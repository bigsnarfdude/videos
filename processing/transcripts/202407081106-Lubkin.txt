Okay, thank you. Shavon, please go ahead. Thank you. Now for something completely different. I am in the wrong window, pardon me. There we go. First of all, I want to acknowledge the great students, postdocs, and colleagues and funding agencies that have contributed to this. And I can talk about them more at length, but apparently everybody runs over at this meeting. So I'm going to try to break that habit. This is about. Habit. This is about not rivers, but the airway that we're breathing with, particularly in mammals, it looks quite different in other organisms such as birds. What we see on the left is a polymer cast of the airspace, the airway, the bronchi, bronchioles, and so on. But there's an awful lot of other parts of the lung. There's the space between. There's the space between those airways. So, what you're seeing is the negative space. It's the airspace, not the tissue itself. The airspace can't form itself. It's passive. So, we have to think about the negative space, which is the tissue. And although the lung morphology in the mature organism that's been breathing and growing and so on on the left is fractal like a river network, when the pattern forms, when the branching pattern forms, Pattern forms when the branching pattern forms. What you see on the right, are you seeing my mouse? Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, what you're um the pattern forms all on the same length scale. So there's some very different things going on. The process, I hope this will play. Is this not there? We go. Okay, it's not exactly playing. There we go. Um, the process is um Is that the tissues are growing? There's more than one tissue. So, what you're seeing in this, the pale space is the lumen. It's filled with liquid. It's filled with amniotic fluid, some of which is secreted by the lung. And we're going to get back to that later. The dark tissue is connective tissue. I'm going to loosely call it mesenchyme. There's a medium gray tissue that's a layer between the lumen and the mesenchyme. We can think of it as 2D. 2D. It's the epithelium. And then around everything else, there's an epithelial layer called the mesenchyme. There's other tissues in there which are going to be important. And this video that I'm showing you is a culture in 2D. So it's a little bit of an artificial situation. It's closer to a river network here in being pseudo-2D, but the lung itself is 3D. And so there's different morphological processes going on in 3D and 2D. And you may be wondering. And 2D. And you may be wondering why I'm talking about a branching system at a looping meeting. And it's because between the branches, we have a looping network. We have multiple looping networks. So this is some microscopy that my student and postdoc did. You can see the lumens here. You can see the epithelium here. You can see everything that's kind of connective tissue between these airway branches. And what is in the connective tissue? There's blood vessels, they form a network. Vessels, they form a network. So it's a multi-scale network here, okay, because there's a network of network. And there's also the network of elasticity. This, the dark stuff here is the collagen and elastin fiber network, which in the mature lung is allowing it to go to open and close repeatedly for a lifetime. So I think they're adjacent problems. I know we want to get to looping networks from branching, but they're going. From branching, but they're going hand in hand because the looping network is between the branching network in the case of these biological branching networks. So once again, we've got these tissue layers, and I'm going to smooth everything out. I'm not going to be one of those people who is modeling individual cells. That's not going to really be contributing to the arguments that I'm going to be making. So I'm going to assume everything is a continuum modeled. Everything is a continuum, modeled as a continuum, just as the you're not modeling every sand grain with the river networks. And in some cases, I'm going to be simplifying even further to not even include, for example, the smooth muscle network, not in the stuff that I'm going to be talking about today. So I want to talk about two problems because they use essentially the same model framework. The first, we learn a lot when we block, when we experimentally block the flow in. Block the flow in and out of the lung. And it is going in and out during the prenatal development. By the way, it's not filled with air prenatally, if you think about it. There isn't air inside the uterus. It's filled with liquid. It's filled with amniotic fluid. My collaborators group discovered that when you ligate, when you close off the trachea, this is a mouse-long in vitro, you get more robust branching. You get, for the same amount of time and the same amount of tissue, Time and the same amount of tissue, you get more branches. So, this was kind of puzzling what the mechanism of this could be, what the biological, what the physical mechanism could be. And his instinct was that when you close off the trachea, the pressure is built up because the lung is secreting. When you close off the trachea, the pressure is building up. And his thought was there's stretch sensing because you blow up a balloon and it's Balloon, and it, and it's there's tension in the balloon. But my thought was: okay, if I blow up a rubber glove, I do not get more fingers in the rubber glove. So it didn't make a lot of sense to me. And we were able to fairly quickly rule that out as a mechanism. But so what then would be the mechanism of an increased rate of branching when you close off the trachea and there's a higher internal pressure? So the model structure, very similar to a model structure. Very similar to a model structure done by people who are at this meeting. We've got the different tissue layers. The outer layer is producing a morphogen, a soluble protein that is going to give a signal to the tissue far away, not terribly far away. That soluble molecule is carried in flow through the tissue and lands at the epithelium where it binds. I should be gesturing here. Where it binds, I should be gesturing here. It's produced here, it is transported to the receiving surface where it binds, and that triggers some growth rate. The real system is more complicated, but this is good enough for our purposes. What is driving the transport? Diffusion, certainly, but there is fluid flow, which we can model with flow through a porous medium, and it's driven by a pressure gradient, a pressure jump across this integer. A pressure jump across this interface because the lung is secreting fluid. Just as if I'm coughing, I am moving the fluid that has been secreted by my lung. So this is an advection diffusion problem, which is transporting a solute from this surface to this surface. And we're going to look at where that signal goes. And we actually have some fairly, I'm going to not belabor our parameter estimates, but we have decent parameter estimates. In 1D, Estimates. In 1D, what this shows you is the flow is dependent on the Peclet number. And as you are closing off the trachea, you are reducing the advection and the diffusion becomes more important relative to the advection. So the higher Peclet number would correspond to an open trachea that's very vigorously producing fluid. And as you're closing it down, you dip the smaller Peclet number. And we could go to zero. Peclet number, and we could go to zero, but it would ruin the nature of the equation. So, if you're so just look for the reduction of the Peclet number, and we can assume that it goes all the way to zero for these purposes. I'm talking really fast because I don't want to run over like we all do. But taking it up from 1D, I mean, because you're not going to get any branching in 1D, the next thing we look at is an axisymmetric geometry, which shows us much more of the detail in the Of the detail in the tissue layer, and as you're closing off the trachea and ramping down the pecle number, you see a greater concentration of this signaling molecule in the tissue, which is what they see in vitro. When they cauterize the trachea, they see more of the solute staying in the tissue. But that's an axisymmetric model that I'm showing you right now, and you're not going to get branching in an axisymmetric model. Get branching in an axisymmetric model. So, we really have to go to a fully 3D model. And so, we had to segment the geometry of some microscopy that was shared with us. And segmentation is harder than you think. And creating a mesh that is going to be computational is actually harder than you think. And so, we were able to run that model in fully 3D. This is just a slice of the fully 3D model. And again, as you're closing off the trachea, you're going to see more of that morphogenesis. You're going to see more of that morphogen in the tissue. But how is that corresponding to anything that's going on with branching? Because it's not that tissue which is changing its growth rate. It's the tissue inside that tissue which is changing its growth rate, the receiving tissue that gets the solute binding to it. And so, how are we going to interpret that signal? It doesn't particularly matter that there is more. Particularly matter that there is more morphogen here than in the previous case where there's freer flow. We have to track what's going on at the surface, and that means we have to be looking at flux. If we're looking at the flux distribution, you can see it very clearly in the axisymmetric model. As we close off the trachea and decrease the Peclet number, the distribution shifts. And the morphogen that was in the open. Morphogen that was in the open trachea arriving at the tip now is, it's not more, it's not more morphogen. We're assuming that these models are using the same rate of production. So the total amount of morphogen is the same. It just gets spatially redistributed. As you're closing down the trachea, more of it is landing at the shoulder of the tip. Okay, so it's redistributing. How is that going to correspond to changing the rate of branching? Changing the rate of branching, we have to look at the 3D case. Now, this is low Reynolds number, so the streamlines are all the same because these things are very, very tiny, and the flow rates are very, very tiny. So the streamlines are the same, but as the Peclet number changes, and this is totally unexpected, this is a delightful result. I just screamed when I saw this. As we're ramping down the Peclet number, where that flux goes changes. Goes changes. The total amount of flux is the same. And in the open trachea, it's distributed broadly. And so, where it lands, that's where you're going to get a higher growth rate. As we close down the trachea, we get more hotspots, same total amount, but distributed to more locations. And that was really the first decent explanation of how we could be getting an increased rate of branching. Getting an increased rate of branching by closing off the trachea. And it was consistent with what they were seeing in the system in the laboratory. And so that was particularly satisfying. We incidentally saw something that was heretical. The dogma in lung anatomy was that it's only bifurcation to two branches from one and never to three. And my collaborator said he never published the trifurcations that he was seeing because it Trifurcations that he was seeing because he didn't want it to get bogged down in the peer review. So, we rejected a stress-sensing mechanism for how you get increased branching when you close off the trachea. We rejected a transport-based model, which showed a higher concentration in the tissue outside the epithelium. And we focused on where is the flux going spatially on the surface, where is the signal? Surface, where is the signal distributing on the surface as you're changing the Peclet number? And that was really the only decent, the only feasible explanation for the increase in branching. Now, something else is going on. You notice I haven't shown anything that's actually growing, just the signaling that is going to precede the growth. We have to also look at what's going on sequentially. So, this is where are the branches. So, this is where the branch is going to be immediately after we have this structure. I want to also talk about the stereotyped shape of the branching modes that are seen in mammalian lungs. There was some very meticulous work that was done a while ago characterizing each of the branching events from very tiny lungs to Very tiny lungs to mostly branched lungs in three categories. Domain branching is essentially side branching coming out of a stalk. And then the other two modes, planar and orthogonal bifurcation, are splitting one into two. But then what happens when you're getting the next two? Are they in the same plane, which we call planar bifurcation, or are they orthogonal to the plane of their parent branching? So that end on, you would. So, that end on you would be seeing a square rather than a line of the four. And they hypothesized that these were three different morphogenetic modes, that there were three different mechanisms going on. I thought that that was probably, I didn't agree with that hypothesis. So, my other hypothesis was that there's probably a common mechanism. It sounded doubtful to me that you would have three different things. You would have three different things going on. So, we can throw a very similar modeling framework to that question of orthogonal versus planar branching. That's what I'm going to focus on. And the setup of this model geometrically is going to be that we're quite interested in a single, what's happening around a single branch, a single tubule near the tip. And I'm going to just isolate a region of interest, which is roughly, if you think of a 3D Veronoi. A 3D Veronoi partitioning of this tree, let's just look at the region of interest around one tip as it is going to elongate or flatten or branch. What's going on there? And so the shape of that region is going to be significant. So this cross-section is not quite circular. It can be elliptical. And that's not just dependent on the epithelium, but on the connective tissue. Epithelium, but on the connective tissue around it. The surface, the curvature of the surface is going to be significant. If the tip is approaching a flat surface, there's very low curvature of that flat surface. If the tip is approaching an edge at the edge of a lobe, there's going to be a strong curvature in this direction and a weak curvature in this direction. And so we're going to look at where would the branching be? How is the morphogen redistributed? Redistribute. And we did look at the Pecley number in the previous project, and we're going to just assume that we only have diffusion at play. We could add advection, but it needlessly complicates the problem. We're mostly going to ask about the geometric factors, the proximity of the one surface to the other surface, the aspect ratio of the region of interest, and so on, and just varying those. And just varying those, how is our signal, pardon me, this should be on top, how is our signal going to be redistributed? And what is that going to correspond to in our branching modes? So first in an axisymmetric system, just as you saw for the previous model, as you are the signal is produced at a constant flux here and it diffuses, no infection, just diffusion, and it lands on. And it lands on the basal surface of the epithelium over here. And as the signaling surfaces get closer together, that redistributes the flux from the tip when they're far away to the shoulders when they're close together. Okay, so we see the same effect of the proximity of the two surfaces that we were seeing with changing the Peclet number. Now, in an axisymmetric model, this does not Symmetric model, this is not going to show us branching, but what it would show us is if the morphogen peaks in the center of the tip, that's the part that's growing fastest, and that's just going to elongate the tubule. If it's peaking at the shoulders, that's where the fastest growth rate is going to be, and that's going to tend to flatten the tubule. So already that's going to be a morphogenetic change in the axisymmetric system from just simply changing how close the signaling surface. Simply changing how close the signaling surfaces are. And that's what they see in vivo: that as the tubule tip approaches the surface that the signal is coming from, the tip tends to flatten. We next wanted to look at branching, of course. So we had to go to 3D, and I'm going to focus on aspects. On aspects of 3D that are super simple, the aspect ratio of the epithelium compared to the aspect ratio of the region, the outside of the region of interest around it, and also the proximity of the tip to the signaling surface. And what I would expect is if there's a single peak of the morphogen at the tip, it's going to keep elongating. And if there's two peaks, And if there's two peaks, we're going to see the tip splitting because the growth rate is going to be highest where this morphogen lands. I heard a squeak from. You only have two more minutes. Sorry, sure. Two minutes. Yeah, the rest is very quick. I've actually, I can do it. I can do it. Okay, we're very close. So let's look for elongation and flattening and tip splitting as a function of proximity and As a function of proximity and aspect ratio. So if everything's round, this is the axisymmetric case, which we saw before, and you'll see elongation and flattening of the tip. But if the epithelium is changing its aspect ratio, we're going to start to see tip splitting, even if the signaling surface is large and flat. Okay, we're going to start seeing tip. Okay, we're going to start seeing tip splitting if the epithelium is not round in cross-section. Well, what if the region of interest is not round in cross-section? We also can get tip splitting, actually, even if the tubule itself is fully round. As long as either one, either the outside or the inside surface have an oval cross-section, we're going to start to see splitting of the peak of the morphogen signaling. Well, what happens in the next generation? Are we going to get planar branching or are we going to get... Get planar branching, or are we going to get orthogonal branching? So we have to consider what's going on after we've already split it and we have two signaling centers. If the surface that they are being signaled by is oval, we're going to see planar branching. And if the surface that these two tips are being signaled by is relatively flat, as on the sides of the lobes, As on the sides of the lobes rather than the edges, we're going to see orthogonal bifurcation. And so it is a single mechanism for the two different branching modes. And that was fairly satisfying. And that's really all I wanted to say. And I'm happy to take some questions. Thank you very much, Eric, for this next talk. Are there any questions? Fascinating. You said that the flow lines don't change, but the accumulation does. And I couldn't square that. Could you elucidate that a little bit? Yes, let me go back to that slide. So the streamlines are not changing and the diffusion. And the diffusion portion is not affected by the stream. I mean, it's semi-independent of the streamlines because it's linear equations. So the streamlines are indicating the advection. And even with no diffusion, the streamlines would be the same at this very low Reynolds number. Okay, so the diffusion is not along the stream as it well, the diffusion isn't. Well, the diffusion is in all directions, but it's coupled to the advection. So the Peclet number is governing the ratio of diffusion to advection. Yes, but it's the diffusion gradient along the streamlines? I guess that's what I assume. The diffusion gradient is in all directions. The advection is couple. I'm not sure what you mean by the diffusion gradient. So there's a concentration gradient. Diffusion gradient. So there's a concentration gradient. Okay, the concentration gradient would be the gradient of the surface I'm curious about. But that's not along the flow lines. The concentration, so we had to find a way to visualize this. It was actually very challenging. It's easier to see the concentration gradient in this method. So you can see where the color contours change. And that shows you the. And that shows you the gradient of the concentration better. We didn't show it in the 3D because it was just too messy. Does that help? I would like to give the word to Vincent, who you showed his experiments, basically. I can't hear. I can't hear. Can you speak up, Vincent? Because there's a scent here. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? No, you don't. It's a little bit better. Is it better now? Yes. We are moving towards the microphones for you, so there's a bit of a rise. All right. I'm Rasan Ferriero, the supervisor of Matthew Public Conference plays a shown completely about the group. Just one thing, in his studies, there are two chapters about the distribution of porphyries around the tubes, which were not published, but which were less. Which were not published, which more or less completely got that, but this is not my question. My question is: in fact, when you speak of branching of a duct, it's not really, in my opinion, it's not really that the tubes grow more sideways. It's more that the tip recedes and undergoes some kind of a contraction. So the tip splitting even. So the tip splitting even, you can think of it as, oh, it's like a dendrite growing in the gradient of a bell, or you can think of it as some kind of a peristatic wave which constricts the tip and generates a tip spitting event. So after a long time, I finally realized that the tip spitting even is more like a contraction of the tip rather than a growth of the shoulders. Of the shoulders, if you understand that. Now, in the images, you have shown both experiments and models that there are muscle cells almost up to the tip. And so there is things that are muscle cells almost up to the tip. And so that the contraction of the tubes is only possible after differentiation of the trace. So away from the tip. And I think that this is not so because That this is not so because the ectoderm itself, the epithelium itself, has a cortical layer, and even though it's not differentiated in muscle cells, it's still contractile, although less than the tubes themselves. And so, when the tubes hit the capsule, for a certain threshold of stress, it undergoes a contraction, and this is what triggers the Triggers the splitting event. And it's not that it follows the gradient sideways of morphogenes. Are you thinking of the epithelium contracting or the surrounding mesenchyme contracting? Because I've also taken that approach in other projects. It's the epithelium. The epithelium has a basal membrane. And just at the basal membrane, the Basil memory: the cells have a cortex of actin, which is thinner than the actin that you see in the muscle cells. So when people stain for actin, I said, you are very happy because you have wonderful differentiated muscle cells and you see a very bright staining for actin and you're happy because you have identified the contractite set. So indeed, the tick of the duct seems not to be contractite. It seems not to be contractile, but actually it is contractile because there is a little actinocortex in the epithelium that suffices to generate the contraction. And once the contraction is triggered, so to speak, the value of the contraction, the mesokine which is inside, differentiates it to muscle sense and voila. You have a branching form. And this is why you ended up with these rings, three branches of the tree. I don't have published that, but it's my feeling. I mean, I'm quite bad. I would love to look at those images. Not right now, obviously, you all want lunch, but I would love to look at those images. If you go back to a place to mature the images of the ducts, and when in studies you see that there is a branching point, if you look at the image, it's not that the branches are going sideways, it's that the tip of the branch is... Is that the tip of the branch is receding? A completely different mechanism of branching. How can you tell that it's receding? Do you have any kind of fixed reference point? If you look at the matrix changes, you have images of that and discussions of that. No, I did the experiment. I always find it interesting that you can add one mechanism that uses the same. Different mechanisms that use the same behavior models so that the diffusion of homology is all this contractual. I mean, they can both play the role in biology. It's very common that you have both phenomena. So I mean, I agree with Sharon. How can you tell? So you have a feeling it's a bit emotional. No, no, no, we need to electric stimulation of the peaks. And if you do electric stimulation of the packs, you trigger that. But precisely, the physics review is that it's one thing or the other. It's like that one right is right because the other is wrong, but sometimes both occur. You can have contraction of the T, but still have a diffusion of morphology that plays a role. In tip speaking morphologies, generally the interface is moving forward. But in this case, you really see that the interface is. See that the interface is going backwards, and from a fluffy, blobby thing, it makes two tubes. From this fluffy thing to make a two tubes, you have to generate a recession of the tip, transform it into tubes. And this is by mechanical contraction of the tissue. I couldn't hear Stéphane terribly well, but I have an alternative proposal, Vincent, that rather than pulling. Rather than pulling the epithelium backwards, you could think of the mesenchyme distal to that tip as increasing in length. You would get the same, you would see the same thing if the epithelium was pulling back versus if the mesenchyme was simply expanding. And that's why I asked, did you have any reference points in the laboratory frame? Because the mesenchyme is also swelling at the same time as the epithelium is growing. The epithelium is growing tangentially. Yes, it's true. It's gone, it's true, but at least in Mutter's experiment, we always considered that it was sinning down. Because the point is that if you have mechanical transduction, if you expect FGFH to be produced by the mesenkind and the mechanical stress, the more you stress the tissue, the more you produce growth factors. And then if you want an arrest point, And then if you want an arrest point, you need the mission kind to sink down because if it thickens, it will going to produce even more HGF8. So more or less in the equations of the charts which are there, in fact you have a thinning down of the besenchi because you have the length scale, which is the length scale of RS of the cube. And the problem is that if you have growth factors, which are produced by mesenchi, and the growth factors are mechanosensitive. factors are mechanosensitive and they produce more mesenchymal more stress then when you approach a tube you stress more so if you stress more it produces more growth factor so if you want the flux to go down you have to thin down because the flux of growth factor is not the rate of production it's the rate of production in a typical size so if you want to have a rate of growth which goes down to zero you need the rate of production You need the rate of production to be high, but the structure to be very thin. And this is what defines the distance of IRS of these tubes. It was very clear. But of course, if the prism kind of produces more, then the size increases and it can generate the recession. But it's not a tense-side recession. It's more like a diffusive recession. I think it's very sad that Sharon is not here because it will be a perfect. Sharon is not here because it will be a perfect description for this part. You see that the brush between 12 and 7, the tip of the branch recedes. It's not that the shoulders or compared left or right. It receives compared to the surface, but the surface is for it. That's a question. But okay, let's talk about it during lunch. Could we talk about this over lunch? I think we should be. Oh, if you were there for lunch, sorry. Lunch, sorry, Sharon. Thank you very much for your contribution. This was really wonderful work. So we will have noted discussion. Okay, general discussion, but short. Because we have to also respect the time for now. I'm sorry. I will remember 20 minutes are discussed. 20 minutes, 5 minutes is. 20 minutes, 5 minutes discussion. At the end of the session, we have 10 minutes of extra discussion. And Stéphane is so no, because I saw a nice link that even some people in Charles' presentation is Hanson's work and which is that the first talk we had was on the scale of these questions. Okay, depending on the Okay, depending on the flux, essentially, the main components are the effects of the bone of the water, okay, either by the sea or by the wind. And here, actually, in the experiment, where you plug there, the scale is even smaller. So we have an adoption that when there is more plugs, actually, the more. We cannot hear them. You have to come closer to the microphone. Can you hear me? No, she's sort of. No, she's sort of come here, Stefano. Here, my discourse. Just a moment. Better like that? Yes. My question was: in the first talk, there was a change of the landscape between the rivers, which is actually the floods going through. Floods going through the river. And then in your talk, there's the same thing which is. In your talk, there's the same thing, which is when it's blocked. There is less blocked, actually, but the land scale is becoming smaller. So, what kind of analogy can we make? I do not hear that. You got it, Sharon. What he asked. I didn't hear it. So it's about so I think you can hear me well. So Olivier talks about the minimal or the m the the minimal lengths of a referral. Length of a river that receives a flux and be still.
