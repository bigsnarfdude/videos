You have no idea how painful it is to be in Melbourne, Australia, and thinking that all of you are, or many of you, are in Banff. So you should be able to see my screen now. Not full screen. Yeah, wonderful. So I think I Yeah, wonderful. So I think I've got about 20 minutes to talk. That's right. No, just 15. 15 minutes. Well, let's go then. Well, very good to be here. So it is 8 a.m. on Thursday morning here, and I'm very excited to be presenting some of this work that's related to social psychology models in the context of COVID-19. Of COVID-19. I'm trying to be a little bit provocative, I guess, and give you a bit of a theoretical overview. And you'll see Deanna Cardanez here, who was a collaborator on this work at the Australian National University when she was a postdoc here. So it's great that she's in the room and I can certainly contribute and discuss the details with anyone who might be interested. Hao Chen Zhu is also a collaborator who's been very involved in this work. Who's been very involved in this work? What I was hoping to do today, and I'm not sure how much content you've had that speaks specifically to group psychology, but I was hoping to take you through a theoretical model of group level drivers of human motivation and behavior to showcase how this layer of human psychological functioning really is not. Really is not, is underrepresented in many of the health models that were utilised in trying to explain health behaviour during COVID-19 and to make a case for why including some of the key aspects of those models can help us better understand a behaviour change, including in the context of COVID, and present some data which Deanna led on an Australian An Australian representative sort of sample around some of these ideas. And then I think there's an interesting discussion about how to build in this line of thinking in the context of understanding behaviour in future crisis. So from where we sit, and I'm a social psychologist and I work a lot with two particular theories, social identity theory and self-categorization theory, which you're going to hear a little bit about. About. Really, one way to look at what happened during COVID-19 is that it was an exercise in behavior change. So, all around the world, quite suddenly, people started to, en masse, engage in behaviours that they hadn't really engaged in before. They had to do new health behaviours, including sort of hand washing. They had to try and keep their distance away from loved ones. They were given new. ones that were given new norms in a way and new legitimate leadership around the way in which they should behave with governments and health bodies. And I guess one of the questions sort of we were focused on during this time is what is the model of the person, the model of the human agent that was underpinning a lot of the health authorities' thinking and government's thinking about how people would behave. People would behave. And if we look at the model, quite often, when you looked at what happened really mainly in sort of Western countries, and we can draw a lot on the UK here and the US, I think, and contrast that perhaps a little bit with Australia and Canada. There were widespread beliefs in government, in health officials, and in the media that people would be either. media that people would be unable they were fragile they'd be unable to cope with the facts about what was happening there was a paternalistic attitude about what people should be told when they should be told it who should tell them that they needed to be cared for and couldn't make sort of responsible decisions on their own that if they had certain information there might be panic and hysteria in the way they might react that they'd act in a self-interested way only and we saw some interested way only and we saw some of that um sort of toilet paper rushes and the like i'm not sure whether you had that where uh where you were from that if people engaged in certain behaviors too early they'd suffer from fatigue and they couldn't keep up these behaviours and that um really given the behaviour of many leaders during this time there's sort of a lack of insight on the role of leadership and elite action uh and and the way in which they um Way in which they sort of can role model the behavior for others. In contrast, when we looked at these kinds of questions through the lens of group psychology and in particular this idea of social identity, which we're going to get to, a completely different view emerges where if people feel a shared group identity with others, they'll have empathy, they will believe and follow the legitimacy of authority. And follow the legitimacy of authority if they think it is legitimate, that people will be able to follow norms and maintain that behavior for very long periods of time if it is normative, and that if people have efficacy, the belief and capacity to act, that they can act for a very long time. So we've, I mean, we're not going to get through all of this today, but we've contrasted this model of the person or the model of a human subject and. And really raise some very serious questions about the public's view about what the human subject is driven by and the way in which they act. I know I'm talking to lots of very experienced colleagues from interdisciplinary sort of settings, and this is a very crude sort of generalization. But if we tried to map the theories of behaviour change that That exists across the social and behavioural sciences. This captures a lot of, I think, what we know, but also what nudge units and behavioural insights units in government draw on to try and inform their models of the human subject. And I want to deal with all of the three quadrants, leaving this sort of social psychology model, which is the one we're going to explore. Model, which is the one we're going to explore in more detail. But the other three, this idea of the economic assumptions, the rational actor, I heard a talk earlier about the cost benefits and the way in which people can weigh options and act. And they'll act according to their sort of individual self-interest largely. I think that's very, that idea is very familiar to many of you and also how it's been critiqued. It's been critiqued by By work in behavioural economics and psychology. And I think we heard some of that earlier as well. And this idea that there is, I don't know, what is it? Route one and route two, and the way in which people can often react to things in a very, in terms of intuition and emotion, as opposed to sort of knowledge and rational decision making. And then there's this social network kind of work that shows us that the people in our network can largely affect our behavior. Network can largely affect our behavior in all sorts of kinds of ways. These three models, the argument here that I'm making, are based on people's psychology as individuals, that they're very focused on individual characteristics, the way people make assessments on their relations with others as individuals. And it neglects this sort of top sort of box here to do with social psychology, which actually argues. Psychology, which actually argues for a different type of psychology, which I'm hoping to make a little bit clearer to you in, you know, in the limited time that we've got. So, and I do apologize, it's very hard for me to know how many people kind of have this information in the room already. But if we look at this photo, we can look at that and we can, we don't know whether the people interacting in this photo are interacting as individuals. Individuals in terms of the individual preference, interests, qualities, characteristics, temperaments, or whether they're interacting as a psychological group. So what is causing their behavior? It's very hard for us to understand that, to try and understand what the group forces might be that could be driving people's attitudes and reactions. And there's a long history in social psychology. Solomon Ash is one example. Solomon Ash is one example where people have tried to better understand these group forces that are at work. And they're very hard to understand and detect because looking at this photo, we don't know what's driving the behavior for people in that image. But yet during COVID, we saw the emergence, I think, of a wider recognition of a distinction between individual psychology interests. Individual psychology interests that could drive behavior and more group-based concerns. And it's the New York governor here, who obviously is a more tainted figure now than at the time, just tries to nicely capture this idea that during COVID, we had to get our head around a new concept, which was the we concept. It's not about you, it's not about me too, it's about we. And this kind of idea of a collective. Of a collective mindset and a collective responsibility. And it's this we concept that we're going to focus on. And if we look at the health models, this we concept really isn't there, that there's a lot of focus on individual factors in the main models that kind of emerge from health areas and also areas like clinical psychology and health behavior. This other concept, this we concept, really comes from a place. We concept really comes from a place that says that humans have evolved to function and live in social groups, that a large sense of who they are derives from those group memberships. And quite importantly for the discussion here, people can shift in their psychology from seeing themselves as individuals to seeing themselves as group members. We can use the word I, but we can also use the word we. And when we do that, there's a different psychology and operation. So we can shift our self-concepts. Shift our self-concept such that we come to include others as in-group members. And when we do that, we treat these in-group members very differently from others. And there's a lot to go into here, but basically this idea has a long history in psychology. It comes out of that work really in the 50s with and earlier with Ash and Levine and Sharif. And it's been sort of developed further with more experimental work through the With more experimental work through the 70s till now. And the idea is that when people shift their psychology to include others as being like self or similar to self, they treat people in their in-groups differently. And this shift in psychology fundamentally affects their attention, their perception, their cognition, their motivation, who influences them and their behavior. And there's a whole line of experimental and other work which would demonstrate these things. Work which would demonstrate these things. They act differently. They start to act in the interests of the group, not in their own individual interests. They think other in-group members are a source of information and are persuaded by them. They seek to resolve disagreements with other in-group members, which is quite creative. And they experience group processes. So they have a sense of purpose, belonging, cohesion, and support. This concept, I don't know whether if people are familiar. Are you familiar with this work from Cialdini, which has obviously got a lot of outreach? But Cialdini has recently included this concept of social identity within the models sort of captured by Unity. If we look at the models that are widely utilized both in academia and outside, we've got the theory of planned behavior, we've got Have we've got technology adoption models, diffusion models? All of them sort of nod a little bit to this idea that others matter and that people look to others, that kind of social norm idea, but none of them really engage with group psychology. So they might talk about social environment, social reference, social norms, social influence, but none of those are driven by group psychology. Are driven by group psychology. They're all located within a sort of study of individual psychology. Here we've got an example. This is theory of planned behavior, probably the major export of psychology to other fields and to practice. It talks about social norms, but it's not talking about group psychology. Technology adoption model. Talks about the importance of others as sort of an external variable, but it's not oriented to group. Variable, but it's not oriented to group psychology. We've been trying to integrate these ideas into a new model. And I know that I must be approaching some time limits here. So this is work that we've done to showcase the importance of these ideas in the context of COVID health behaviours. So in this work, and as I said, it was led by Deanna Cardanes, who's there, we tried to incorporate all of the things that these models Incorporate all of the things that these models would typically include, but also some of these social variables around group psychology, and in particular, national identification and neighborhood identification to kind of capture the degree to which people felt their group psychology was driving their attitudes and behaviours. We also have a range of social cohesion type variables in there to do with trust in political and social institutions and whether they Institutions and whether they felt the relations within their communities were positive or not, and the way in which these might drive the health behaviours we're very familiar with. And there is a rich literature, many here might already be aware of it, that we do know that some of these social relation measures have been used to predict health behaviours like underage drinking, smoking, whether people identify with groups can shape whether they. Can shape whether they will engage in exercise or get vaccinated. And there's work in other pandemics where confidence in government or lack of confidence in government has driven people's willingness to get vaccinated. But often this work is piecemeal. All the variables aren't included in sort of one model or compared. And so that is what we were trying to do in this work. So we have the usual suspects, so to speak, but also these relational. Also, these relational trust in government and social identification measures trying to predict physical distancing and hand washing. So it's a nationally representative sample of Australians. It's longitudinal. We looked at three waves of data collection that corresponded with certain activities around COVID here in Australia. And we were particularly interested in looking at these new measures in the context of existing measures. Measures in the context of existing measures. You don't need to hurry. You were right in your original estimation of time. You don't need to hurry. Oh, okay. So I've got just a few more minutes, I think. Yeah. In five minutes, yeah. Five minutes break, yeah. So these are, I'm going to present sort of four of these. I mean, these are sort of regression models, which I'm sure are very familiar to people. What's interesting here is we've put in the individual factors that would usually In the individual factors that would usually be in these health models, but also then added these social, psychological, social, political factors to look at their role over and above what would be typically included in these models. And what we've looked at neighbourhood level and we've also looked at the national level. So these are the local neighbourhood cohesion or relations and identification. Or relations and identification. And this here is related to whether people are reporting their willingness to physically distance themselves. And we think that some of these social variables are playing significant and meaningful roles. And when we look at that's to do with physical distancing, this is to do with national physical distancing, national level identification, looking at physical distancing. And we see that this. Physical distancing, and we see that this identification with the nation, with Australia, is a significant predictor, capturing those ideas about the we psychology. When we look at hand washing, again, we see the social identification at the neighbourhood level playing a significant role in helping to explain the behaviour. And when we look at hand washing behaviours, looking at national identities, Hand washing behaviours, looking at national identification, again, we see that relationship. So, this work, I guess, is helping us understand that if we extended our health behavior models to include the factors that are already there, plus built in some of these properties that relate to group psychology, we will get better models. We will get better models to explain the behaviors of interest or to explain behavior change. And so, what this work, and I know that was quite rushed, but this work is telling us this we concept matters, that if we want to understand compliance during crises such as this or behavior change more broadly, that we need to look Broadly, that we need to look at both of these individual group psychology and social-political factors. And on the basis of this and other work, we think there's lots of updating that is needed amongst researchers and the wider community and decision makers in health and government to come to have a model of the person, a model of the human subject that. Subject that also incorporates the importance of social identity, social connection, and in-group norms, not just social norms. And there's a matter of, there is urgency around that because these models mattered, the models, the working models that decision makers had and the prevalence of these insights sort of sitting around that decision-making table had very real consequences. And there's some work coming out of the UK. Coming out of the UK, that is speaking to the idea that the decision makers felt that the citizen was fragile and likely to panic and would fatigue, delayed their decision-making by a number of weeks, leading to significant deaths that would not have happened had they not had that model of the human subject. And so, certainly, myself and colleagues. Myself and colleagues are working hard to sort of advocate and cultivate and find further evidence using models that resonate to sort of updating this model of the human act of the human subject. And we're seeing across a whole range of areas with richer data, richer data sets, longitudinal models. Models the importance of the way in which this group psychology matters in a whole range of domains: political psychology, crowds and protests, public policy and compliance, management in organisational settings, education and health. And obviously, I'd be very interested, as would Deanna and sort of Roxanne's very familiar with these models as well, to share them further and talk a little bit more about them. Thank you. Thank you.
