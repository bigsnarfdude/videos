Yeah, I will give three talks. One of the themes of my talk is to explain the relationship between first one is a quantum field theory. And to get to the theme of this workshop, we've hoped. With homological algebra, in particular, to non-commutative geometry and other to index type theory. And I try to explain the connection of this stuff. And in particular, in this And in particular, in these three talks, I will explain the following. Like, first one today, I will explain a simple model, example of topological quantum mechanics, and how it's related to some constructions in non-commutative geometry. And in the second talk, tomorrow, I will go to a holomorphic example. In particular, I will focus on this chiro CFT and discuss a connection to what we call like higher index. And in the third day, I thought that was a very good idea. application I will explain how this can be used to study a example like for example to study like quantum B model and mirror symmetry And in particular, I will explain an example, how to solve a particular example, which is a non-semi-simple example for this quantum neural symmetry. Okay, that's my plan. So today, the first talk, first I want to explain a slogan, which is going to play a very important role in this program. In this program, it's the following: like this very famous theorem in this non-commuted geometry, which is called a Haucho constant Rossenbach theorem. It's a very classical theorem. I will explain in more detail. And I will explain that this classical theorem. That this classical theorem in non-commutative geometry is related to a particular notion in quantum field theory is a renormalization group flow. And it is also a good example to show that some natural Natural object in this, for example, some homological object in this quantum field theory, for example, this UVBRC appear naturally if you do this consideration. So to get this example, I guess a lot of people know Gromo-Wittian theory. So let me first start with some standard ideas in Gromo-Witten theory, and then come back to this. Within theory, and then I'll come back to this example. Like in converted theory, for example, like we have a notion of quantum product. Say, suppose we have a Taylor manifold, heck. And now you can define a quantum product, which is a A quantum product, which is a product structure on the thermal homogeneous way. By, for example, suppose you have you have some elements here, like alpha one, etc. Etcomoj class, then you can make a quantum product. Usually, people write in such a way. So in the beginning, the classical level in geometry, we know we have a naive batch product. This is a classical level. Then you can, from here, this construction tells like we have a quantum. Like we have a quantum product starting from here by sending to like upper one star upper two is a show and the way you construct this quantum product is by like you say counting curves and things like that basically by doing intersection theory like say starting from a fear with a map point and try to map it to And try to map it to x and to count basically the intersection point with respect to some cycles which are dual to these homoch classes, something like that. And you count this kind of thing, and you get a quantum product. And eventually, it's given by some integration on the modulus space of stable maps. With some particular construction. I guess people have seen many things like that in this will be also in this workshop. No, actually, I want to explain a simpler model. I will come back to this model on Thursday. But I want to explain a simpler model. Wichita's model, like going back to quantum mechanics. And similarly, we try to do some quantum intersection theory in this quantum mechanics. Then we know quantum mechanics is one-dimensional stuff, like we have to replay this surface by some curve, some line. But anyway, in quantum mechanics, for example. In quantum mechanics, for example, we have some standard object. Like we can have functions on the phase space. Let me work with polynomial functions. Let's call this ring like A. I can put polynomial functions on the phase space. Of course, they can do more general like simply space, but let me focus on this simplest example. Now, from elementary school or probably middle school, we know like we have a natural algebraic structure for this polynomial algebra. Just by multiplying the object functions. Now, I guess everybody knows this. Now, I want to explain in parallel with like a mutant type theory to define a quantum product for this guy. For this guy, probably let me write here. It's too far. It's okay. It's a mirror, so I guess it's okay. Now, the first call of today I want to explain. We cannot define a S1 quantum product. This is not the quantum product for convergence theory, so let me call this one S1 quantum product. And by saying that suppose I have a bunch of functions F0, F1, et cetera. And I denote it by F1. And I denote it by S1. It's going to be again an element in this algebra, but with quantum corrections by H bar. And the leading order is precisely this product. Higher order terms in H bar. And they are given by something. And they are given by something similar to this intersection theory by pointing. Now it's a circle and something like that to the phase space. In this case, the phase space is R to n and this is a constant basically is the correlation function in quantum mechanics. And so in particular, this will be And so, in particular, this will be realized by integration on the mapping space from the circle to the target loop space. And it's a particular component of the integration. I will explain because this order is important, but I will explain in detail what this means precisely. And you will see from this simple example how this, for example, some standard notions of non-conference. Some standard notions of non-conventional geometry appear, and why you do this intersection theory, you're going to find an index and so on. And in particular, this will explain why this voxial cost and Rossenberg is basically a version of renormalization group flow. And you can, tomorrow, I'm going to do a more complicated example, like CFT. But I hope this is like a multi-wheel example to illustrate what's happening. Illustrate what's happening. It's rather explicit. It's rather explicit. Yeah, it's formula, explicit formula, yes. If insertion is polynomial, then it is polynomial. Yeah. You know, the Seymour diagrams, right? It's just like five terms of the vertex. So yeah. It's going to be radic. Yeah, it's going to be rather explicit. Yeah. Okay. So let me explain the model. I need to model this mapping space. So anyway, let's denote a map by I'm going to use some standard ideas in quantum mechanics. So I'm going to write this Qt I I PT, let me write it as big because it's important, not only because it's important, but you just want to indicate a map from a circle to the phase space R to N. You can do more general like a target, but let me just do the simplest case. Now, I from 1 to N represents like two N components of this map. Components of this map. And we know that from quantum mechanics, there's a very standard way to write down an action functional standard action, like PDQ. The dot means like taking derivation with respect to time. So this is standard PDQ action. And this action is pretty simple. So we can write down, for example, the equation motion at the classical level and quantize it in a natural way. So for example, the equation motion. So, for example, the equation motion, you do variation, you find like it's like the time derivation for pi is zero, and time derivation for qi is zero. This is a one-dimensional analog, this is two-dimensional case. This of this two-dimensional case, in the chiral case, like in 2D case, you can count like a holomorphic map. So, one-dimensional case, you have only one parameter, you turn this equation. So, this is like a constant map. So, basically, the solutions describe constant maps. So, we're going to count constant maps. Like UI. The Qi T is a particular value, Q little Qi, Qi T is a Pi as a counter map. And basically, we can view this as a point on the phase space, or otherwise it's like the impermaturized two variables, parametrized the phase space, a point in the phase space. And then we're gonna and then we're gonna we're gonna do the counting for for constant maps and you might wonder like why you want to count constant map looks looks like very trivial and and in completion theory count holomorphic maps but we know this a mirror theory like the a model is counting like holomorphic map the b model is counting constant map that's why i want to explain why how to count count constant map in the in a in in a particular way but anyway that's the what this model is telling uh classically Model is telling classically now I'm going to erase this lovely quantum product. Now, how to make a product? So, suppose I have a function on the phase space. I can work with a polynomial function, but I can do a little bit more. Function, but I can do a little bit more general than have to introduce some topology and taking care of the theories. But let me work with like polynomial function. Then the idea is like you think about this variable as some kind of constant mode or zero modes in quantum field theory. Then you perturb it. By, for example, we can add into this quantum field. We can add into this quantum fuse perturbed by quantum fuse. And this is rather naive. Then, from this perturbation, we can write down a formula. Let me, I need a place for the formula, probably. I'm gonna keep it here. Probably, I'm gonna keep it here. What is a good way to maybe I just write it here? We define the S1 quantum product by the following. It's a rather explicit formula. I need two lines properly. Probably probably I need a whole page. The formula is the following: like F0, F1, and etc. It's one quantum product. So this is going to be a function of Q and P with values properly in a With values properly in H bar. But anyway, you insert a bunch of functions in QMP. The output is a function in QMP defined by the following. Does integration play the role for the integration on the modular space? P0, P1. P1, Pm, less than one. Like 0, 1, this region parametrizes points on the circle, and this integration, dt1. Let me first write down a formula and explain. You put things in thickly order. So this is my S1. This is like a... This is like a T0, T1, T2, and et cetera. You put on this on the circle in sickly order. And then you compute the correlation function in this model. And more precisely, you can compute this pass integral, but this is rather explicit in this case. case like dq dp this path integral the the action functional is the it's a free one and then the insertion is like uh every time you compute the correlation at the particular point but but in this uh perturbed uh uh observable it's like observable it's like q i q plus um q d zero p plus p zero this is the first perturbed one and f one q plus q t one and uh p plus g t one and etcetera. And etc. The last one, like F M Q plus Q T M T plus T T M So basically you put a things on the on the on the on the on the points on the circle here you put f0 you put f1 you put f2 etc now you Now, you integrate, integrate all this mode, this P's and Qs. Integration is to integrate all the massive models. So this can write down rather explicit Feynman rules for this integration. And here, the grid function, the propagator is given by the following. So let me write it here. So, this path integral is evaluated using these Feynman diagrams. By define my rule, where basically you only have like PQ fields, and the way you write down And the way you write down a propagator between like a p and q, for example, like q q i t i t prime. This is like a green function. And it's a green function on the circle, so it's actually rather simple. You can write down explicitly. So this is like a green function. For inverting like the time derivative. So the actual functional has one particular time derivative for inverting the time derivative on the circle. And this is rather explicit, actually. And this group's function is bounded. It's not continuous, but it's bounded. So there's no divergence issue here. But in general, you will have divergence issue. So tomorrow, Will have divergence issues, so tomorrow I will explain like the holomorphic case. But in the topological case, things become much simpler. And you can use this Feynman rule to write down efficiently what this one means. So each one contributes, each function contributes a vertex, for example, just like propagator. So you connect this quantum fuse, and you end up with like a piece and q. So you can view piece and q like a constant, like zero modes. So that's the background, zero, zero mode. So that's the background, the remote background. And that's the definition. Any questions? Learn explicitly. You can write it down explicitly. So this function actually look like you can solve it. This function looks like t minus t prime minus one half, something like that. It's very simple to write it down. Yes. Yes, it's a it's a sum over diagrams. Yes, so it depends on how what the leading term is like this. Now yes, so it's like depends on the what is the how many how many. So for example, each each function f Each function is a polynomial, so it's represented by some polynomial coefficient, like Q's and P's. So the leading term is like it don't connect any propagator. So that's the naive product. So each bar leading term is given by connecting one propagator. So something like that. And the other one probably is isolated. This one will contribute. This one will contribute one particular H bar. That's the propagator connecting this one. You can write down like an H bar square term and with two propagators and so on. And every time I connect a propagator, I have to use this function. And then eventually integrate on the configuration space in sickly order. So that's the formula. Yes. This is actually a very good question. Like, you see, like this S1 product, if you don't do S1 product, you put things on the line into the same formula, you get a moil product, basically that's deformation. But if I put on a circle, there's some particular thing happening. There's a difference between real line and circle. Realign the circle. And the relationship is precisely given by Hoschel, Kaus, and Rosenberg. I will explain. Yeah, that's the point. Question? Why usually like the real line, you find deformation quantization? You get more product and things like that. You can move a product and things like that. And what's happening if you do things on the circle? So, this is how to introduce the idea of like hosso margin. And just also explain, you see, like by definition, this looks rather complicated if you write it down. You can sum over like some graph, some comatorial formula. But what kind of structure this one has? It turns out that this structure is. Out that this structure is encoded by this construction. So, I don't know whether people know this, but let me quickly review this definition. So, suppose A is an associative algebra. Then you can write. You can write down a chain complex by the following. So it's a chain complex. And so the pth component is given by A tensor P plus ones. And I need to define you this differential. This differential is called a Hochscho differential. It's given by the following. Suppose I have an element here, so it's given by P plus one tensor, and I apply this Haushall differential to this tensor. The formula is the following: like you basically get the pairwise product, for example. It's like the first one is like A0, A1, and third, A2. Answer A2 is a show. Then you multiply the next two, but with some with a minus sign. And it's not sure. It's ordinating sum. The last one you multi you multiply the last two, the minus one to the The minus one to the let me be precise minus one to the power like to the minus p p minus one and a naught and a p minus one a p and finally you have to put this ap to the front multiply the first one. And there's a very direct way to express this by, for example, if you think about a circle, you think about like putting this element of A on the circle in sickly order. So this Hosho product basically does the Like, that's the following. Like, you look at all the nearby points and make a collision, like, multiply this every nearby point. And you can check that because of this alternating sign, this operation, this map, V squared zero. And this one defines a chain complex. One defines a chain complex, it's called a Hoscho chain complex, and the corresponding margin is called Hoschochomarg. And that particular explain in such a way using the same picture, like a circle. So hopefully, you can get some sense that this picture is related to that one, which indeed I will explain soon. Okay, but that's the definition for Hosho product. Okay, any questions so far? No, let me give you. Now, let me give you some idea about what this one looks like, what this homology is computing, and why it's related to this quantum mechanical model. No, I can't keep that page. So, uh, let's do let's just compute this this homology for This homology for the question, like the particular ring in question, like this like functions on the phase space. So let's just consider A to be polynomial function. Now, for simplicity, let's introduce variables x1, x2, essential. Just to simplify my presentation to my phase space. Phase space. And I write the first n variable to be q, the next n to be p. Just to for simplicity. Now, I want to explain to you how to compute this homology in this example. Homology in this example. It turns out that the following map plays a very essential role. This map is called a Hossa costume Rosenberg map, HKR map, by that's called sigma from just a Haushall chain complex to the Differential forms. In this case, it's the algebraic differential forms in these two n variable differential forms with a differential zero differential. This map is going to be a trend map. It's a trend map from the Hochschule chain complex to a complex of forms, but with zero differential. But you can turn on the natural differential here, but I would. Differential here, but let I will discuss it later. The map is the following: the very naive one. So, suppose I have a bunch of functions: f0, f1, and etc. We know by definition, this is like m plus one's tensor, it likes in degree m component. So, I want to send this tensor to a degree m element here. degree m element here, which is a which is the m form. So there's only one canonical choice we can basically write down. To design a differential m form from here is by, for example, after rescating is given by, I use this as one hour n factorial and f0, some index, a partial derivative, f i one. F I one one f I M F M and D X I one batch DX I M. So in symbol, it's actually just a one old M factorial F zero, D F one, D F two, etc. But in But in components, you write down all the possible derivatives and write down a differential form in such a way. So that's a very natural thing you can write down. And remarkably, this map, it's a very simple map, it's actually a quasi-isomorphism which computes the causal homology. Any questions so far? I gotta call this one HPR map. Some machines I1, I2, et cetera. So the index. So basically, write this differential form in components. So every components so every df i just write this df as a partial some index partial i f d x i i is from 1 to n so involves both q's and p's that's uh that's how i write this index so this this index runs from like one to two n each one that's why i want to rewrite in this variable otherwise i'm gonna write the key Otherwise, you're going to write the Q and DP just to make things more complicated. But that's a triple way of doing this. Okay. Now, here's the upshot. This theorem, Pausha Constant-Rosenberg's theorem, says the following. This map is a quarter isomorphism. In particular, it computes the Hoshi homology for this ring. You see, like this ring is the standard, this definition works for any associative algebra. But this example is commutative. So it goes back to the standard geometry. If you compute the standard geometry, what you get is basically a differential form. Basically, differential form. So the social homology of this example is given by differential forms. Because here, the right-hand side, the differential is zero. I don't have any information here. So if you pass to homology, the left-hand side, this function homology is precisely this differential form. That's what you find in this calculation. This calculation. And this is very illustrating because this one says that this algebraic machine, if you specialize to the commutative world, it gets back to the differential forms, this classical geometry. And that's why, in general, this can be This can be non-commutative, some kind of associative algebra, and can be in general. So, this Hossho machine basically can be viewed as describing like differential forms, this kind of geometry, calculus on a non-campus space. That's one way to explain this partial homology. That's the classical HQR theorem. Okay. Any explanation for this? I guess many people haven't seen this, but let me just get a quick review about this formalism. Now I want to connect this story with the page here. I want you to explain. I want to use this one to explain what this one is computing. So, you compute correlation functions on the circle, you insert observables on the circle, and then you let them run. It run over the circle. Because you see, I have to integrate over the positions. So, let them run. You insert mobile observables on the circle in quantum mechanics, and then let them run. And it's actually interesting that. It's actually interesting that if you let them run, it will get into an algebraic structure, which is precisely related to this Hausho homology. So let me try to explain. So to connect to this quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics is a quantum world. So I need to quantize this stuff. I need to quantize this story. And this also will be playing an important role later in other examples. But this quantum mechanics is the simplest example. Now we know that in quantum mechanics, like functions on the phase space can be quongized to like To like a non-creative algebra. Like you can do canonical quantization. For example, this ring on the phase space. You can quantize it. You can get different expressions, but all of them are equivalent. You can get differential operators, or you can get wire algebras, all this kind of thing. All of them are equivalent. So just writing wire algebra. Just writing writing wire algebra in two variables, but definition the underlying space is given by like q's and p's. Now, because I work with polynomials, I'm going to also work with polynomials in h bar. And there's the algebraic structure. This is the star product, or which is also, in this case, it's the moil product, especially. This is a non-commutative, and if you compute this commutator, for example, Qi Pj in this star commutator, a definition is like Qi star pj minus pj star qi to find like ih bar, something like that. Oh, let me put h bar here because you put H bar here because I need to work with like complex values. But I prefer IH bar actually. But anyway, you always get this trouble if you talk with like a mass community or physics community, this I, which one you prefer which one. If you see somebody writing without I, it can charge like he's doing mathematics. He's doing mathematics. He writes like I, he probably is more likely to be a physicist. But anyway. Which one? Just commutator of the two. Just like a QP operator, like canonical connotation. It's not that that's I. So let me just write this as a formal variable. Oh, delta. Oh, yes, it's a Oh, delta. Oh, yes, yes, yes, right, right, right, right, right. Right, right, delta ij. Yes, yes. I prefer to add an extra i here, but let me pretend not. Okay. But anyway. But this formula actually has I here. So anyway. So, anyway, I pretend I haven't seen that. But it's going to be the equivalent. No, let me explain to you what's happening. You see, like at the algebraic level, this algebra, so left-hand side, this polynomial ring. So, you can basically commutative ring. You can multiply polynomials. But in quantitative, you do canonical quantization, you get a non-commutative algebra. Equal quantity addition, you get a non-commuted algebra, and then you can ask, like, what's happening on the algebraic level? You have this Haushall chain complex, and you have the classical HKR map, which intertwines the Hossa-chain complex to this guy. And then you may ask, what's the relationship between this colonization and blah blah blah, something here. Blah, blah, blah, something here. This map must be quantized in such a way to incorporate this data. That's the naive thinking. And there's indeed a precise formula for quantizing this HKR map. Actually, you can just, it's a rather easy guess. You see, like in writing down this formula, what you do is the following: you insert a bunch of points. Following. You insert a bunch of polynomials, then you multiply these polynomials with the differential M form. So this formula is like you multiply these functions. And the multiply is basically the classical multiplication. So that's what we learn in high school. You just multiply polynomials. So it's not. So it's not hard to imagine, like, so you can guess the formula. That's exactly the result. Just replace this naive product by this quantum product. Why not do that? Let's do that. Let's quantize this HKR map by the following. Let's call this one sigma H bar. It's a context map by the following formula. Or j I just simply replace the naive multiplication by this F one content product. This F1 content product. This is my definition. So functions HKR, F0, answer, F1, essential defined to be sun over, it just replaces this yellow box by. Box by quantum products That's one important and I get a differential form as well And uh And as I mentioned, like the classical limit, if you send H bar goes to zero, you get back to the original product. But this one will have H bar correction terms. And this is the element in differential forms valued in H bar. And uh that's my definition of the quantized HKR map. Of the quantized HKR map. And the theorem is the following. So let me write down the theorem. I guess I have to. Great. You have time. It's work with my former student, Zheng Jing Gui, and Tai Shu. And uh a couple of years ago it will. So as a vector space, it's gonna be same and I cannot write down the statement. As a vector space, it's same, but the algebraic structure deform a little bit. So you will see like the at the at the linear level, it's like that, but you can you can ask like what kind of that but you can you can ask like what kind of algebraic structure it intertwines it intertwines the the the moil product so it's really defined on on the on the on the for the for the wire algebra but let me first write it down the context map interference Into France. The Horshall chain complex of the wire algebra are just as you said. And I basically linear expand extends H bar linearly. If a map defines such a thing, as a vector space, this cannot be like that. But we have H bar, so this part is H bar linear, so you can do such a map. And which intercourse. And we should intertwise the Horschall or Hossa differential here. Now, this Hossa differential computed of this chunk complex is the Horschau differential using this Moyer product for this algebra. In the trans this operator, with an operator here, what kind of operator you can have on the right-hand side? Because it's a chunk complex, you're going to decrease the degree by one. Decrease degree by one. There's a natural one. It's quantocorrected, so it's an H bar here. And this operator in physics is called a B V operator. It's a very natural way to see how B V appears. And precisely, this operator is given by Lie derivative with respect to the Poisson biovector. So omega inverse is the Poisson biovector. And you take a linear with respect to Poisson by vector, you're going to decrease the degree form degree by one. And actually, this operator, if you write it down explicitly, this basically plays the role of so-called BV operator in quantum field theory, where you used to, yes. Apple. Oh, sorry. A couple, oh, in this case, yes, yes, I my or yes, in this case, it's polynomial. If you just work with polynomials, everything's a whole polynomial. Yeah, you can you can work with like a formal power series or some other rings, you can you have to work with other rings as well. In this case, it's a it's a polynomial, it is and um so this to me is one of the natural ways to see how B V appears. And we know like a BRC B V form is a fundamental to quantize the. It's a fundamental to quantized gauge theory and particularly the homological method. And moreover, actually, there's something more interesting. There's just additional data. We have a circle and there's a circle rotation. And this circle rotation is also implemented by an operator, which I didn't explain, but there's an operator here, which is called a Kunis operator. Let me write that the corner operator. This operator played a role of like rotating points on the circle, this S1 rotation. And this operator will intertwine a natural operator here. So this goes in an opposite degree. So it sends the P trend to P plus one trend. P trend to p plus one trend. And if you write want to write down a operator here, which says the p m form to m plus one form, just a unique way. Not a unique way, it's a canonical way by the RAM differential. That's indeed true. This data incorporates all the algebraic structures hidden inside this correlation function. That's a statement. That's a statement. Yeah, let me kind of write it down a little bit. I won't explain too much, but I just illustrate, tell you the basic idea. So, just a few comments. First one is related to your question. So Agla, I can it's a yeah, it's a trend map from this this this trend complex to this trend complex. So for example, this means that uh yeah, let me write it down. It's a map of chain complex, it's actually mixed chain complex. It's a B it's a first apply B something. First, apply B something, then it's the right inside this operator. And the second one is like if first apply this Kunis operator, it's the RAM on the right-hand side. So it's a trend map. And actually, there's of course a model, so-called A model, a so-called B-Wave model behind this construction. This relation can be viewed as one way to write this one is to show is to write B minus H bar del applied to this S1 correlation is zero. And this equation is related to the so-called B-We quantum mass equation. And this is the B-b-quantum mass equation for a particular model behind this one. It's actually a so-called AKSZ model for the mapping space from the circle to the phase space. This is the first thing I want to say. Second thing is that now I can erase this part. Probably I can probably I just write here. Probably I just write here a few remarks some remarks first. I want to say if you pass to margin and this is actually a very famous map. If you pass to a margin, you compute a trace map based. You compute a trace map basically on the homology of the wire algebra. This is called a Phagon-Felder Schochief trace map. And actually, uh in the uh in the in the yeah in in the in community of like deformation quantization we know this strength map can be used to prove uh a particular index theorem i will mention uh as well and this correlation actually can be glued on the simplic manifold by the following like this is a local piece of the data so it's a standard phase space now you can glue on a on a simpler manifold but locally it's like that Locally, it's like a piece of this face-based. Then, this construction can be glued on the standard general simply manifold by thinking about the construction as something on the tangent fiber. And you can construct a connection moving around, which is called a Sodasov connection. And this can be good in such a way. And this philosophy of collection actually can be realized in this model by basically the way you glue things, do some transformation can be viewed as inserting, computing some correlation functions with background, some kind of background fields. But naively just like glue all this data using the connection on the manifold. On the manifold. There's a lot of connection. And in this way, you can construct a canonical map intertwining the Horscher chain complex or the deformation quantized style algebra to forms on the manifold. And after this gluing, And after this glue in, you will get, I probably won't explain this, but I just mentioned you can look at my paper in details. But you can get an index type theorem. We're going to do index for a 2D example later, but this one is the standard, the algebraic analog of a testing index, which is called algebraic index theorem, formulated by Barassov and Nestika. So, tomorrow we're going to do a drake index analog of this one in the 2D case. I will explain that. And then I just mentioned like there's a construction of this one on the political object if work with my student example. And actually, there's some other relations like constructions. There's also a stochastic approach to this construction in probability theory. And so, but probably let me stop here. Thank you.
