So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizer for organizing this workshop in this so beautiful place. Okay. So, I think everyone very enjoyed it. So, definitely, I hope the participants online can come for face to face next time. Face to face next time and a very beautiful place. So today I'm going to talk about this controller problem for the income visible MHD equation. And this is also a very old problem. And this is joint my former student, Manuel Resser from Germany, and he is now a postdoctoral. And he is now a postdoctor in the New York University in Shanghai. Okay, today I tell you about what's the problem, the first. And the second is, I discuss this problem for two cases. One is artifice without viscosity. So that is somehow simplified. And the second one is a wood viscosity with viscosity. So for example. So, for example, let's consider for example describe the fulls. So, this income is never source. And there is a condition. Our boundary condition is described by a part of the boundary. And also, there is a force. So, there are two kinds of the control: one is so-called the boundary control, another is so-called the inferior control. Called the internal control. So it's more. So getting an initial state, another final state, can you find some control which can reach the final state? So this is a so-called control. Oh, sorry. Sorry now, they are saying that in the 20s, why is it for the small time global control? Small time, small time means for how many time you can reach the approximate this final gate. So this is a small time. Golden is the difference between the between final state and the individual state. Final state and the individual state that can be large, can be additive. So, therefore, the small time and the clone this is more difficult than the long time and the small control. So, because here the small time means absolute momentum means this difference between the This difference between the final and the user that can be added to it. And the other two notation is person by the control and the resatur control. So that very clear from the notation. So this is that it means you can reach your data. And approach means you can approach the finest data very closely. Another is another The land means the final state of Islamo in the tread resolution. So the local means the final states and the very small, whether it's not even local. He is the famous state in a state of one trajectory. One trajectory. To one-train solution, okay. One question which is proposed by Jack Leon in 1918 now. Time has defined for the negative stress. So getting one algorithm epsilon and algebra momentum, and those are pump states which are one that is in the state of the of level energy. Of the level energy, such that can you find internal control? Can you find the internal control? Such levels you have at least one resolution with this initial data and the non-state by definition. Such levels, the final state is a kind of thing to this one. And this, the technical part of the problem. The typical cognitive problem is why it's not smallest assumption for this difference between the initial and the final state. The second one is the most simple pounding gave you a much hard problem because to study this problem, normally we need second screening and the Screen and the length considering the so-called small special image. When you start with this small special limit with a non-supermanic machine, you will need the strong boundary laws. So therefore, to solve these problems, this is my obstruction. So far, there are some progress. The first one is concerning the Uh, is a concern so this is ideal flow, so without viscosity? So, that course is a very good because results is a flow is mainly driven by the convection. It's like a transporter equation. So, the transport of course is relating the inbound to control using the border control. So, the first one was studied about Has studied about in 1993 first studied this problem for the control and for the two dimensions are simply connected in the map. And the whole problem is similar, for example, UTD, Soluthe, and so on. There is the equation of the hate equation as well. And the foreign member stores, unfortunately, very little progress. As I said before. As I said before, because it's a small base, because the limit problem is much harder and difficult as well. So, first of all, I was also obtained by Corona Nabata and the Seya in 2020. Corona Congata is a Navajo recognition. Well, it's a Naba recognition. And this almost since 10 years ago. Almost says a minute 10 years later, they were not in Taliban, and they got the control with the non-sleeper boundary condition, but in order to control this baron, they constructed law artificial force in order to control this one. So there is a lot of a force. Okay. How complicated is the force exactly? How complicated the force is exactly the open. So therefore, up to now the Chaka Device program is still open. And for the MHD, and there are also some results, but my major concern is informal control, not the boundary control. With internal control, there are several programs here. So now the question is: from who started this program? Start this problem with a boundary control for the magnetic problem. So let's consider for the ID, for the ID flow. For the ID flow, this is I think most of you know this system. So that is the idea and a physical question. Okay, first, that is funny. Funny okay, how to control this one is not so easy to something. Okay, now first we start this problem just okay, in a rectangle, the map, in a rectangle map. Then above and the problem, that's a fixed button. About and the pattern that's a fixed banded with that function, we probably have the condition over there. So there are no silly uh the normal the magnetic anterior over there. And for the uh for the anterior and the sidewalk, this is a uh boundary to this diagnostic removal control from the sidewalk in order to from initial data use. As well, try to make your final state after the final state. So that is fix all up to the time and fix your initial and the final states. You find the control on the both side, such that you reach the final state at some point. At some point. Okay. So generating stuff, this one is not so easy. It's not so easy, it's not so easy. So, and that the point of the place here is you follow this problem with other determined banning machines. And then, if you find a solution for this underdetermined problem, then the destruction of the boundary data is a control. So, that is another economy. So, people doing that way. Okay, for Harry Madam, so you have the transformation. You have a miracle transformation. So that's the LC, which is a combination between the velocity and the magnetic field. And then the problem is transverse into Zapwa. Okay? Transvert into Zapwa. And in that case, the problem has no. So plasma has no coupled on it because they're only coupled with the velocity, so transport velocity. So it's a little coupled. At the same time, you have to pay that this quantity of Q plus and Q minus should be the same. Otherwise, you could not transform back. Okay, so now this is the transformer problem. And the difference of these two balance here Q is the ammonia function. So look what we saw the previous one, then we can solve in the Q from this problem. Now, first of all, that's a referral. Not really compared. And the final stage is in some. Even in some subject space, in some folder space, such as the boundary condition in the determining the boundary already, now you have exactly having one strategy to the audio, which means you put the final control. Such that from the zero state to the final state for add to the time t so go to the original one, you go to the I don't know what the solution for the for the for the MHD equation. Okay. Secondly, now is we have a feature of predatory formula equation. We have two Israel. Pure Israel. And therefore, how can solving this problem? This will probably solve the price. Problems of so-called converting velocity in a very valuable way. Try to somehow initially you have some state, then finally you hope to get another state. So that is you show this convection of the rest of the plan. So each of So you transform this original technical technical on this side of the equation. And the ones we have with two morticity, J plus and J minus over there. And the z is original ball. And then G. The right G plus minus is a cooler part of this first vendors. And the composed of J plus minus plus and G minus this one. And Jim Radis, this guy, this guy compared that all the like zero of this J plus Z to J minus because J plus J minus is a curve of this Z plus minus. So this is like the zeroth order. So we are consoling this system by so-called fixed point argument to fill this problem. So, that is so this is a cultural state for Problems. So, that means a lot of countability. It's a small constant, a small quantity. If your initial vertical is small, you have an acceleration. you have an oscillation which is a very you can reach the final state at uh reach the uh reach the zero at some momentum reach the zero at some momentum so says this to solve this problem that's the because at the beginning you have some state in the domain so is very plus and there is a minus There's a plus and there is a minus over there. And but you want to act a certain time till certain guarantee that the state in the domain should be zero. So that means no transmotor from this data to travel to the out and from some zero data to travel into that into that of the map. So this is so called a retainless. Transport the mass transport the zero mass into the mass and transport this initial attack to be out. So that is only transport of that one. Once this problem is solved, Uh, uh, problem is solved. Then, only the problem can be solved by so-called scoring from the quality argument. Because the equation is a hyperbolic, it doesn't transport. You're going slowly backward as it works. So, from the initial data, you have form one of the options from the famous zero. From the final state, you have to come back all the afternoon zeros, and you have to activate it. Okay, actually, our cleaner saying that it says initial time is the slow is only considering. How can so for the time of the data? Then we will scale. And the form of time momentum, because it's not a mark, the time is a fixed time. Mark matters is problem for extra time. So there was. So that also should have been using the scaling for a short time as well. So that is so-called scaling and coding argument. So that is, so first thing is this is a backward, okay? Once you have the solution, then the backlog is also a solution. So because this is in that bar. You are not in the scaling. There is nothing in the scaling. Oh, sorry. So that is scary. So that you just for the data, initial data, and the final data. Then you want epsilon small, then you can get this guy is small as well. You like? And finally, you throw in that one to get this, to get this two. Oh, sorry. So get this two. And then we only scale for the time. For the time, because you want to for anti- For activity, you should have to find the standard. Okay. I want to go to the border of this total solution. I don't connect to that. We connect to that. Okay, so I am not going to digital time because the time is limited. Okay. Finally, I'll go to the mic that the anti-reaction actually is going and that way to solve the problem. I think you have played with another door over there. So that means if I can solve only the MHD question. I mean it's new question. Okay. And this is the loss, Dr. Lester and myself from a student who continues that study and to a general, singly connected map. So because for the general one thing to construct the trajectory, to transport the mass is more complicated. It's more complicated. So that we so that uh we so to do that to to follow the general to show that the compose the general demand the compose the general demand into a lot of smartphones and the for the one we can we can construct that uh the the throw pack particle and then for the general one we'll control piece of ice piece and then for finally And then to finally to reach the results for the men. And then what is much more difficult is the squadron. Because as I said, in that case, because you have only scary as before, but when you're scary, then you should reach some small. Reach some small parameter, even the viscosity. Then you expand in the solution in the small parameter, then you will reach the Pambelua stuff. Okay, now you're considering this tire. And this is this course. And the button is a non-bandy finish on there. For the for your not silicon band, it is still open. Machine is still open because if you mix the mandofin machine, uh, over there, you have a very strong mandal, so-called very location where you appear over there. But for that case, not control that is uh much technical. So we wanted to not in order to technically typically the rule tester can say this simple. Consider this simple bat, okay. Forget about what's in the first so configurations. The one is this kind of simply connected map. This is a control bundle. This one is a control bundle. Another is a piece of terrace, a piece of terrace. Okay, then this is a Okay, then this is a control boundary. This is a control boundary. Okay, the number two things. We have the following things. For after the initial time and the final state, you want to walk. And after the time, control time and the third position, you have a lot solutive. What's the is a car? Watch the you have the close left data, very closely, can be smaller than telehap, can be smaller than so-called small time approximate control, approximate control ability. Okay, so first, it's changing. First, we're sending this the man to a blood one. You're sending this one to a large one. When you're sending the tempest, the tumblers is for the transport without the sponsor. I think this initial data to be out and move this to variable inside. That's that is. That is contributing for the overvalue, for the overvalue. So now for this memory, with some force, artificial force supported out of the domain. Now we use this as before, this transformation. We use this transformation and then scaling. And then scaling for the time and the relatively so this is epsilon and the epsilon square epsilon square and the scaling for the epsilon t because transform this as antibody denial into a large largest. Okay, because they want to work with them. Of the approximate. Then they scale epsilon to the larger time integral. So using this time integral. And then in that case, the transformer amount satisfies the single integral. And there is some small viscosity in front of the Latachi. Okay? And my teaching is that. So now you're saying this now look at the formula expansion. So this is because you see the initial data, you have the extra influence of the initial data. So that's the amplitude of that extra is what. So it's also the farmer and the father's favourite in the second order, not the ruling order. So therefore, Pandela is a ring. Pandelo is a ring. So therefore, you see, this one is the living profile. Profile y star p star cos i star and z is a number layer for p is a distance function is a distance function and this square epsilon is is the one is the rightness of the bundle. Okay, so what is this profile? Oh very and smooth And smooth. Okay, now we solve each profiles. The first profile is solving the IV flow. And the second one is solving the visualized ID flow. And the Bandalua is solving the vitalized planter. Because it's a rich bandalua. You estimate this guy. You got the estimate. You can find this cassava such that the resolution at this T moment is the epsilon eight minus nine over eight. And then one more problem. This things. And that is our result, what we can obtain. Because the time is. Oh, so I should step her up. So, thank you very much for your attention.
