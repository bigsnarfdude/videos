Extremely kind invitation. It's really unfortunate that we can't be in Canada at the moment. We have to do this over the internet. So, as you can see from the title page, this talk too, like Joseph's talk is dedicated to Raj, who celebrates his birthday today. My work over the last few years has been really strongly influenced by things that I have learned from Mira and Josef in Prague about Rajit. In Prague, about Raj's work. So, as you can see from the title, the talk concerns the analysis and approximation of implicitly constituted fluid flow models. So let me just list a few papers to begin with. So, concerning the physical background, I think the key papers are the two that you see on the top by Raj and Srinivas from 2006. From 2006 and 2008, which concern the physical foundations of implicit constitutive theory. There's been subsequent work on the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations that arise in these models, and these are the papers from which I have learned a lot about the mathematical analysis. There's been subsequent work about the mathematical analysis of these equations. So if you looked at them, So, if you looked at the mechanical literature and the mathematical analysis literature, you would see quite a substantial body of work. Concerning numerical analysis, I think the literature, I think it's fair to say, is really thin. So what is listed here is what I'm aware of in terms of the analysis of numerical methods. And I don't mean computations, I mean the mathematical analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations that arise in these implicitly constitutive. Rise in these implicitly constituted fluid flow models. So there's a range of papers running through, starting from steady flows up until time-dependent problems and heat equation coupling in these equations and so forth. But since this is just a short talk, I decided to concentrate on a simple model, a steady problem, which is the one that you see here. So you have a bounded Lipschitz domain in So you have a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rd, and we are thinking of physical dimensions. So D is two or three. You have conservation of balance of linear momentum equation, which looks like Nabius-Stokes, except for one fact that the stress tensor, the shear stress tensor, will not be linearly related to the symmetric velocity gradient, as would be the case for Navier-Stokes, but there will be a non-linear relationship between them. Linear relationship between them. And as Joseph explained in the previous talk, they will be related through an implicit relationship, which is written here. So going back to the equation, so u is the velocity, as usual, p is the pressure. You have a source term, perhaps on the right-hand side. We are looking at the incompressible case. So divergence u is equal to zero, and then some boundary conditions. So maybe in the simplest possible case, the velocity is equal to zero on the boundary of this domain. So S here, So, S here is going to be assumed for physical reasons to be symmetric and trace free. So, the sim notation here in the subscript corresponds to being symmetric and the zero corresponds to being trace free. So, this is related to the fact that S and D are in a certain relationship, and D has a trace zero because the trace of D of U is precisely divergence, and divergence U is equal to. divergence and divergence u is equal to zero by assumption. So it is assumed here that G is defined on the Cartesian product of R D cross D seems zero crossed with itself and it maps into the same set. So there will be certain assumptions on this graph or this implicit constitutive relation. So what is assumed here that you can identify this implicit constitutive relation with a graph. Relation with a graph. So S and D are in a functional relation if and only if this pair D, this pair of matrices, lies in a graph, and then certain structural assumptions are made on the graph, which are listed here. So for physical reasons, it is assumed, and that's the first assumption, that the point 0 is 0, that is when D is 0 and S is 0, so the point 0 0 is in the graph. So the second assumption is monotonicity of the graph, which is Monotonicity of the graph, which is what you see here. So, if you could somehow visualize in your mind a coordinate system where the horizontal axis is the d-axis and the vertical axis is the x-axis, then this would correspond to monotonicity in that ds coordinate system. So the third assumption, maximal monotonicity, is a technical assumption. It simply expresses the fact that there are no gaps in the graph, which is assumed to be monotone. And the fourth assumption, which in some form also arose in... In some form, also arose in Joseph's talk, is going to be quite important in the analysis. It is a lower bound on the scalar product of these two matrices, S and D, is assumed to be bounded below by a positive constant that multiplies the matrix norm of D raised to a certain power R, and similarly for S raised to the Holder conjugate R prime. So, incidentally, as Mira was saying in the beginning, As Mira was saying in the beginning, I think the arrangement is that you are allowed to interrupt me at any point. Correct, Mira? Yes. Okay. So if you have questions, please stop me. Because otherwise, it feels like talking to a blank screen. So here are some examples of these implicit constitutive relations. So if you have a linear relationship between the shear rate, so this is the symmetric velocity gradient and the shear stress. Symmetric velocity gradient and the shear stress. If you have a linear relationship, you have a Newtonian fluid, you could have a shear thickening fluid, you could have a shear thinning fluid, you could have something like a Bingham fluid, which is this graph here, which is continuous as a graph, but it's discontinuous as a function, but it's a monotone graph. And then you could have this upper curve here, which would correspond to a pseudoplastic fluid with a yield of Herschel-Bartley fluid. So all of these are. Bartley fluid. So, all of these are covered by these monotone graphs that I described in the previous slide. So, concerning numerical approximation, how do you go about this? Well, the first step in the construction of the numerical method is we regularize the graph because this graph could be potentially a graph that exhibits a jump. So, what is done is you consider measurable selection from this graph, and you modify this by convolving with some kind of With some kind of compactly supported function theta n, which is in L1. So you end up with a graph, which is a modified graph. It is this red graph. There are other possibilities for smoothing the graph, such as this Yoshida regularization. But in any case, you have some sort of smoothing of the graph as the first step. So then the next step in the construction is to discretize the problem. And what it means to discretize the problem is to replace the infinite-dimensional problems that appear. The infinite dimensional problems that appear in the weak formulation of the partial differential equation with suitable finite-dimensional subspaces. And in this particular method that we are considering here, we are thinking of finite element methods and finite element methods use piecewise polynomial spaces on triangulations of the domain. So you take your computational domain, whatever it may be, you triangulate it, obviously not by hand, using an automatic mesh generator. Automatic mesh generator. And then you choose finite-dimensional spaces for the velocity. This is V sub H. H simply stands for the granularity of the discretization grid, the mesh size, VH for the velocity, and QH for the pressure. And these guys are contained in suitable infinite-dimensional spaces, whatever the space for the weak solution was, this W1R with perhaps zero Dirichlet boundary condition. And for the pressure, so. And for the pressure, so it's some Lebesgue space, and the zero subscript signifies the fact that it is assumed that the integral average of the pressure is equal to zero. So zero is not zero boundary condition, yes, zero integral v. And so then there are some standard assumptions on these finite dimensional spaces in order to be able to talk about convergence as you pass the limit. And what appears here, just to point out, so when you are working with W1R, for reasons, the technical reasons that come up in The technical reasons that come up in the analysis, the appropriate space for the pressure is LR with a tilde, where R tilde is this funny object here defined by these formulae. So it's not quite the Hilder conjugate of R, it's a sort of slight modification depending on how small R is. So for small values of R, you need to replace the Hilder conjugate with a different number. But in any case, so then, okay, so once you've got your finite dimensional. Okay, so once you've got your finite dimensional spaces, you need to think ahead a little bit in terms of what you want to do next. And so, one of the big hurdles in the construction of finite element methods for incompressible fluids is the fact that you have to in some sense satisfy the divergence u equal to zero constraint. So, if you have reasonably smooth solutions, you can satisfy this in a point-wise sense. But if you are working with finite-dimensional approximation, If you are working with finite dimensional approximations of the velocity field, it's not clear whether you can ensure that divergence u is equal to zero pointwise. And you can see from this slide the trouble that is caused by the fact if div u is not equal to zero pointwise. So let me just run through what would happen if d v u were zero pointwise. So you would look at your weak formulation. You would take formally your test function to be the velocity field itself. You would perform integration by parts. form integration by parts. So this term is what would arise from the convective term. This is what would arise from the pressure term. And if d v is point wise zero, both of these blue terms would cancel. So that's very nice. You would drop the blue terms. So then using the structural assumption number four, which puts a lower bound on s scalar du, you get a lower bound on this integral in terms of norms here. And on the right-hand side, you perform a Cauchy-Schwarz. Right-hand side, you perform a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, a Hölder inequality, or whatever you want to call it. The definition of this negative sub-olef norm to get a bound on the right-hand side, and you simply kick back this d of u into the left-hand side, and you have a nice energy estimate on the solution in terms of the data. So, if you are after an analysis of a numerical method for this problem, you have to mimic this process. And the problem is that d v need not be 0.50. So, the question is: how do you mimic this process? Question is: How do you mimic this process if you don't have a pointwise divergence-free velocity field? So, what you could do for sure, and this is what is done in finite element approximations of incompressible flow, is to at least ensure that this property is true. So divergence of the velocity field UH, now this is the approximate velocity field when tested against QHs, which come from your approximate pressure space. This is what is required. Space, this is what is required to be zero. So this can be done. And there are loads of finite element spaces, I mean the whole zoo of finite element spaces which can happily achieve this property. There are not so many finite element spaces that can ensure that d vuh is pointwise equal to zero. There are some finite element spaces, for example, this Scott-Vorgelius or more recently Guzman-Neeland finite element spaces that ensure a pointwise divergence-free property. So we'll distinguish two cases in the analysis. In one case, option A is that you have this discrete satisfaction of dvuh equal to zero. And option B is you use some special finite element functions where dvh really is pointwise equal to zero. So then in case A, if you are working with these approximately divergence-free functions, the problem is that the first blue term I had on the previous slide is not going to be equal to zero. slide is not going to be equal to zero because setting this term equal to zero does really rely on the fact that uh is pointwise divergence free and this you don't have so there is a fix to this uh in the near-stokes uh literature finite automatic approximation of nevier-Stokes equations which is to replace the original object that you are dealing with here so replace divergence u tensor v dotted with w which is the term that we derives from the convective Who derives from the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equation with this term that you see here? So another trilinear form. So the original trilinear form is replaced by another trilinear form. And this will always have the property that if the three entries are the same, then this B expression is equal to zero, which is precisely what you want. And this will happen irrespective of whether UH is pointwise divergence-free or not pointwise divergence. Free or not 0.5 divergence free. And this trilinear form is also consistent with the original trilinear form in the sense that if d v happens to be equal to zero, then this modified trilinear form collapses back to the original trilinear form. So basically, there are these two situations one has to think about when you have approximately divergence free finite element functions and pointwise divergence free finite element functions. Obviously, in the second case, this modification is not required. Modification is not required. So, here's the convergence theorem that can be proved. So, you have a numerical method where instead of the stress tensor, you have this modification through the graph. You have this modification of the trilinear form arising from the convective term. This is the approximation of the pressure term after integration by parts, and then you have a source term. And then, down here in the second line, you have this discrete imposition of the divergence. Position of the divergence u equal to zero constraint. So, this is the numerical method. And the theorem says the following: in case A, when you are working with these approximately divergence-free functions, as long as R is, so this is the R, the index that arises in the graph, in this axiom four, in the graph, if R is greater than 2d over D plus 1, you have convergence of your numerical approximation to a weak solution. Approximation to a weak solution of the problem. Whereas in case B, when you are really pointwise divergence-free, you can further lower this R to almost a critical case, 2D over D plus 2. So I think when R is equal to 2D over D plus 2, this is a critical situation when the convective term is in L1. And so sort of that's the limit that how far you can go. So in any case, there is n tends to infinity. So this is the modification. To infinity. So, this is the modification in the graph going to infinity. H, the mesh size going to zero. You have convergence of your sequence of numerical approximations to a weak solution. There's no uniqueness of weak solutions at this stage. And this weak solution satisfies the weak formulation, as you would expect. So, Mira, am I right in thinking that I still have five minutes? Yes, definitely. Okay, okay. So, let me just Okay, okay. So let me just in those five minutes, let me just give you a few ideas of how the proof works because I love this proof. Some of it is inherited from this or from these papers by Mira, Pyotr, Josef and Agnieshka, which concerns the proof of existence of weak solutions. So they use a Galurkin method, but the Galurkin method that is used in the construction of or the proof of the existence of weak solutions. Proof of the existence of weak solutions uses smooth Galurkian basis functions. And obviously, here the situation is completely different because you are working with piecewise polynomial functions. There are certain tricks that you can do with small smooth Galurkian approximations doesn't work when you are using piecewise polynomial functions. So in any case, the first step one in the proof is you pass the limit with your modification on a fixed grid. So the finite element spaces are fixed. You let the modification tend to be. You let the modification tend to infinity. And by using basically the estimates, which are similar to the ones that I showed you for the Navier-Stokes equation, you have a bound on the sequence of numerical approximations and usual arguments. You can pass the limit. This DUNH lives in a finite dimensional space. Boundedness of the sequence automatically implies strong convergence of du and h to duh as n, the H as n, the graph approximation goes to the limit. And for the second guy, you have boundedness, but this comes now from an infinite-dimensional space. So all you can say is that it goes to a weak weakly converges to a limit, which is to be identified. And then using the monotonicity of the graph and Minti's method, you can identify this weak limit to be precisely S of du H. So this pair du H S D U H, in a sense, limits As the UH, in a sense, lives on a graph. So, in the second step, you now want to send H to zero. So, how do you do this? Well, you go back to the previous estimate that you have, and then by weak law of semi-continuity, you deduce from this as you send n to infinity that you still have an upper bound on these limiting objects, which is this one here. So now you have a bounded sequence duh in LR, so you can extract. In LR, so you can extract a weakly convergent subsequence which goes to du. And once again, because you have a bound on this S D U H in L R prime, it weakly converges to something. And this something, you don't know what it is. You would like to say that this S bar, this something you have converged to weakly, is S of du, but this is not clear. So what you would like to show is that this pad D of U and S bar lies on the graph. lies on the graph, or if almost everywhere in omega, or in other words, that s bar, what you have converged to is s of du. So we come to step three. So to show that this pair lies on the graph, you consider this object here. This is a signed object because of monotonicity, it is non-negative. And so using these various bounds that you have from the previous step, simply by Hoder's inequality, when you integrate. Inequality when you integrate the absolute value. In fact, the absolute value is not even necessary because this is non-negative. That you get a bound on this by a constant, simply by Holder's inequality. So then you have a bound in L1 on this guy. Now, unfortunately, L1 is not reflexive. Joseph also mentioned this in his talk, but you are still not completely dead with the argument. There is a nice result. There is a nice result, the Shakon biting lemma that Joseph mentioned, which allows you to consider a nested sequence of domains contained in omega, and which exhausts the whole of omega such that the discrepancy between omega and these nested domains shrinks to zero. And you have weak convergence on in L one on the sequence of these nested domains, which is a consequence of this bound via Chapon's biting lambda. Chacon's biting lemma. So, one final thing that is missing here is because you have weak convergence, you have therefore equi-integrability of the sequence, if you could manage to show almost everywhere convergence of this sequence, perhaps to zero, that would provide some helpful information. So, this is really the next step. So, you once again look at this guy that you looked at in the previous step. Looked at in the previous step, and one step that is now really specific to the numerical method. And here one deviates from the argument that is in the PD analysis papers, where a Lipschitz truncation is used, going back to Acherby Fusco. There's a refined version of this result in Deening, Malek, and Steinhauer. This was not available in the finite element literature. So, what we had to do in order to complete Had to do in order to complete this discussion is develop sort of a finite element counterpart of this Lipschitz truncation method, which is contained in this paper with Lars Deening and Christian Kreutze. So I don't want to go through the technicalities of it. The long and short of it is that by using this Lipschitz truncation method, it is possible to prove that this object A sub H that I considered on the previous slide converges to zero almost everywhere in OMA. Almost everywhere in omega. So, on the one hand, you have weak convergence of this AH. On the other hand, you have almost everywhere convergence of AH in omega. So, by appealing to Vitali's theorem, you can deduce therefore that AH strongly converges to zero in L1 on these nested sequence of domains. So, this is good news. Now, this is almost So, this is good news. Now, this is almost the end of the proof because we already have weak convergence of S D U H to S bar from step two, and we also have weak convergence of DUH to D also from step two. And if you combine these two pieces of information with what is written here in line two, you can use this equality here. And once you have this equality, you can appeal to the property of maximal monotony. The property of maximal monotonicity of the graph to deduce from all of the things that you have that du s-bar does indeed lie on the graph almost everywhere on this nested sequence of domains. But then by a diagonal procedure, because these nested domains exhaust the whole domain, you can deduce that du, this pair S-bar really is contained in the graph almost everywhere, you know, because so you have. Everywhere, you know, because so you have therefore identified the limit of the sequence of these stress approximations that du as bar does lie on the graph. And that is basically the end of the proof. So I'm almost out of time. I knew I would be out of time. There are lots of numerical simulations that we did. Let me just show you one. And that's my last slide. And it slightly relates to what Joseph was saying earlier on. So, what is, I think, fantastic about this implicit constitutive theory allows really. Constitutive theory allows really all sorts of weird and wonderful fluid models. So, look at this one here. So, d here is d of u. This is the symmetric velocity gradient. And you have a model where d is possibly 1 over 2 mu s. So you may have a linear relationship between d and the shear stress on some part of the domain. And in this example, this domain where you have d being equal to 1 over 2 mu s is the complement of this circle. So you think of. The complement of this circle. So, you think of a circle in this domain in the complement of that circle. So, basically, near the boundary, you have Nebius-Stokes, and inside the circle, you could have S equal to zero. So, you would be down to an Euler model, incompressible Euler model, as long as the magnitude of D is below a certain threshold. And if D is above a certain threshold, you have a sort of a genuinely non-Newtonian model with implicit relation. Implicit relationship or a non-linear relationship between the and there. So there are lots of examples in this paper that is cited at the bottom of the slide in Science Journal of Numerical Analysis with Patrick Farrell, my colleague here in Oxford, and Alexei Gaskarosko, who is in Erlangen at the moment. And he was our joint student in Oxford. So I think I'm out of time. So thank you very much indeed for your attention. Thank you very much indeed for your attention.
