And thanks to all of the organizers for organizing this conference in this very nice place and for giving me the opportunity to speak. So as you can see from this illustration, we are not in the real line. I'm going to talk about non-self adjoint spectral theory, Schrodinger operators, the complex valued potentials, and I want to show you some. Show you some constructions of Schödinger operators with very wild spectral pictures. And if after the talk you can imagine of any other wild behavior, I'm happy to hear any of your ideas and I will try to prescribe that behavior as well. So the setup is the following. We geometrically are quite simple. I'm looking at Are quite simple. I'm looking at shredding our operators on the whole RT. So this acts as minus the Laplacian plus multiplication by a potential V. And in principle, I do not really care about the regularity of V, such that this operator makes sense. Just think of sufficient regularity. I'm usually thinking of piecewise contiguous functions. Of piecewise continuous functions. I will show you some step functions. So, not necessarily continuous, but piecewise. So, my Schrödinger operator is H subscript V. If V is zero, H naught is just a free Laplacian, and this has spectrum, just essential spectrum, which is the non-negative half-line. Negative half-line. And now we add a potential V, and we assume that this potential decays at infinity, because then this is a relatively compact perturbation and leaves the central spectrum invariant. But in addition, we have some isolated eigenvalues of finite algebraic multiplicities, which is the discrete spectrum. So this is the rest. So, this is the rest of the spectrum. And here, later on, it will be a small technical detail that, in principle, we can have eigenvalues embedded in the essential spectrum, but in this definition, I exclude them from the discrete spectrum. Okay, so there may be finitely many or infinitely many discrete eigenvalues. If there are infinitely many that accumulate somewhere, Many that accumulate somewhere, the accumulation point always has to be in the central spectrum. So, then, in particular, in the self-adjoint case, when V is real-valued and we are in the real line, posit the non-negative half-line is essential spectrum, so the discrete spectrum has to be in the negative half-line. And if the discrete eigenvalues accumulate somewhere, the only possible accumulation point is zero. Zero. And so I'm interested in accommodation rates to the essential spectrum in the self-joint case. This means how does the modulus of the eigenvalue behave in the complex case then so if this is realignant, this is zero. This is zero. This is essential spectrum. If we are here, the distance is just the modulus. But in the complex case, if we are in the right half plane and have a discrete eigenvalue, the distance is the imaginary part. So you will see that the modulus will behave a bit differently than in the self-joint case. Self-joint case. But yeah, I want to somehow know how I can characterize where the eigenvalues lie. And in particular, there were some conjectures floating around in the community, and I wanted to disprove them and come up with a crazy eigenvalue phenomena that I now want to explain to you. But first, I concentrate on what we know. First, I concentrate on what we know in the Solfer Trunk case. One way of characterizing the accumulation rate to zero is done using these Lieb Turing inequalities, where now we assume that in the self-joint case, here. So our V is real-valued and it's assumed to be in an LP space. It decays sufficiently fast to be in an L P space where P. Be in an LP space where p is sufficiently large depending on the dimension. Dimension is d. Then the Lieb-Tinning inequalities after Lieb and Pinning say that if you take the modulus of the discrete eigenvalues, take this power and then sum over them, this is always bounded by the L P norm of the potential to the power p. Of the potential to the power p. So, in particular, the modulus has to go to zero, as we already said. They can accumulate only to zero, and it has to accumulate to zero sufficiently fast that this sum is finite and is even bounded by the L P norm. And this constant C depends only on the dimension and on P. And there has been a lot of research about finding the optimal constant, but I'm more interested in the non-sulfur chain case. So in the non-sulfur chain case, you can have non-real eigenvalues, and in principle, they can accumulate to a non-zero point of the essential spectrum. But if such an example exists, then certainly this proof. Then, then, certainly, this proves that the Lee-Tilling inequalities do not hold for the non-selfat joint case because what we sum up here is then not a zero sequence, because the modulus converges to this real point. So, that's not a zero sequence. So, the left-hand side will be infinite, whereas the right-hand side is still finite if we find an example of an LP potential. Okay, and I want to. And I want to show you some constructions where I have a prescribed accumulation point in the central spectrum and actually even crazier behavior, namely accumulation to all points of the central spectrum. So this theorem that I'm going to present now was a Present now was published in actually two separate papers. In the first paper from 2017, I proved it. It's maybe to you a technical detail, but we have here some assumptions on P. Oops, sorry, in the first line. And in the first paper, I could prove for p greater than the dimension. So in dimension, Dimension. So in dimension one, p greater than one, and in higher dimensions, p greater than d. And then with Jean-Claude Cunet, we then managed to also prove this for smaller p's. And I will show you in a second that this is now sharp. So for these p, if you give me an epsilon, I can give you a potential, a bounded potential that is in A bounded potential that is in Lp, whose supremum norm and LP norm is less than epsilon. And there exist infinitely many discrete eigenvalues in the lower complex half-plane, and they accumulate everywhere in the essential spectrum. You see that, so from the Leibniz inequalities, sorry, for we have. We had the sum of the modulus to the power p minus p over 2. If you now drop the sum, you get an estimate on one individual eigenvalue. You see that the modulus is always bounded by the L P norm, but p norm uh but but now this this picture uh shows you that not even uh you didn't do not even have a bound on individual eigenvalues because they can be arbitrarily far away from from zero and the L P norm can be arbitrarily small and just a slide on why I now think that this assumption is sharp in dimension D. sharp in dimension d equal to one the assumption is p greater than one and it doesn't work for p equal to one not even the bound on the i mean sorry we have a bound on individual eigenvalues and so this this proves that this this picture cannot happen in in in that case when when v is an l1 plus V is an L1 potential. And in higher dimensions, this is related to the conjecture by Lobdev and Sofronov that also gives or would give a bound on individual eigenvalues. They publish this as a conjecture and whoops here. So their values. So their values of p is here is the d over two is where we started for the Lieutenant inequalities and then d was what they conjectured that up to that value we have an individual eigenvalue bound. And in 2017 I thought okay my result is sharp because there is this conjecture and this would prove And this would prove that for these p's, we cannot have this crazy behavior. But then there were some rumors that maybe this conjecture is wrong. The conjecture has been proved for some small interval of peace by Rupert Frank here. And Frank and Simon almost disproved that for all ps just larger than Is just larger than here, so p greater than d plus one over two. They almost disproved it by showing that it doesn't work for embedded eigenvalues. So they found the sequence of potentials. So if we have our essential spectrum here and they constructed potentials, we Constructed potentials Vn such that one, which is in the essential spectrum, is an embedded eigenvalue for this Laplacian, for this Schrolinger operator with potential Vn and the L P norms of Vn go to zero and goes to infinity. So you have here on the left hand side, you have one. On the left-hand side, you have one, and on the right-hand side, you have something that goes to zero. So, this disproves the inequality, but only for embedded eigenvalues. And this was formulated for discrete eigenvalues, so they haven't actually disproved it. But because they also proved that for this range for which they proved it, or at least Rupert proved it, the estimate also holds for embedded eigenvalues. For embedded eigenvalues, the assumption was somehow that also for these larger p's, the behavior of embedded and not unembedded will be the same. So the problem was then to make this embedded eigenvalue not embedded by somehow shooting it up or down out of the essential spectrum by maybe just so if you have minus Laplacian plus Bn and then And then you make here some alpha times q, and alpha is something near zero. You make alpha a complex number near zero, and you somehow hope that the eigenvalue will behave nicely with alpha. But for embedded eigenvalues, I mean for discrete eigenvalues, that would be fine. The eigenvalue would depend holomorphically on alpha. Morphically on alpha. But for embedded eigenvalues, you could either stay an embedded eigenvalue, you could turn into a resonance, or you could indeed shoot out of the essential spectrum. But yeah. Whoops. Yeah. Did I? Nope, still here. So I will show you a construction that I did with Chample Pina. With Jean-Paul Pina, how we could shoot out this eigenvalue into the complex plane and therefore disprove the conjecture. And because the conjecture is, yeah, now we kind of know how everything works, everything is understood, and the dependence on P. The dependence on P is now sharp. So, this is kind of the outline of my talk. After a longer introduction, I want to show you some techniques of constructing shredding operators with prescribed eigenvalues. In the first technique, I want to show you first how to How to prescribe one eigenvalue. If I give myself or you give me a point lambda in the central spectrum, and you give me a precision R, I want to give you an LP potential. LP potential. Oh, you give me actually lots of precisions. You give me a precision on how small the L P norm shall be, the L infinity norm, and how far away the eigenvalue shall be from this prescribed point, but still discrete. So I just chose to be in the lower complex half plane. So I'm going to construct a class of these what they call basic potentials. So I can essentially prescribe one eigenvalue, but then I'm going to. One eigenvalue, but then I want to have this crazy picture, so I want to prescribe lots of eigenvalues. So now let's assume that we have let's say we have constructed three eigenvalues with a potential, so with a Schrodinger operator. With a potential V1. And I would like to have a further eigenvalue somewhere here. And I know with from step one, I could essentially prescribe that eigenvalue with Schrodinger operator with potential v2. And now I somehow want to put these two together to get a Schrodinger. To get a Schrodinger operator, and if I give myself a precision whose already constructed eigenvalues do not change too much up to this given precision, and I also have this additional eigenvalue. And then I want to iterate this to get infinitely many and then get this crazy eigenvalue picture. And then the And then the second technique is, as I explained here, I want to perturb embedded eigenvalues of the essential spectrum, not necessarily for this potential that Frank and Simon constructed. I will show you a more general technique that just works more generally, but then I want to apply it to this example. This example because then I can also use then this example as a class of potentials for step one in the first technique because I can, if I want to prescribe not a near one, but maybe Near one, but maybe near some larger value in the essential spectrum, I just do a rescaling of variables and I can get a class of potentials for step one. So that's the outline. So this is step one: finding a class of potentials that prescribes one eigenvalue. Prescribes one eigenvalue. I show you here the result in one dimension, because in higher dimensions I will use this perturbation of the Frank-Simon example. In one dimension, it's very easy. It's just the potential is a step function. Characteristic function, characteristic function on. He, a characteristic function on the interval minus a to a, multiplied by a complex number c and the proof of this lemma is just by constructing the eigenfunction, which looks maybe a bit ugly, but it's just this is a constant. So inside the interval, we have a cosine function, and so outside we have an exponentially decaying function, and then we have some conditions such that Have some conditions such that the function is continuous and its derivative as well. And then we play around with the parameters and we make all these things here small in order to satisfy the prescribed things. So I can essentially prescribe one eigenvalue. Now I want to show you this method of adding one more eigenvalue. More eigenvalue to a Schrödinger operator that we already have. So we have a Schrodinger operator with potential V1 and we have a point that is in the spectrum with potential V2, but not yet before. And now the idea is: so maybe V1 is the potential. Is the potential that is somehow localized here. And now with v2, I use the step one where I can prescribe one eigenvalue in one dimension. It's a step function. So I add a step function, but now I shift this v2 away from where this is localized. Where this is localized. So here you see that shift, and let's say it doesn't matter, I just chose the highest coordinate direction up, let's say, with this positive parameter t. And then I claim that now there exists a sequence of eigenvalues in the spectrum of this Schrodinger operator that converges to the prescribed point. To the prescribed point set, if I move the support of this function to infinity. Here is the proof, a proof idea. First, I use that the spectrum is invariant of how I choose my coordinate system. So instead of fixing on this. So instead of fixing on this potential, I want to fix on the one that moves away. And then this one actually then moves to the other direction. So now you see that I shift here V1 into the other direction. And I prove that this operator here now converges in strong resolvent sense to the one just with V2 because. Because this disappears. And then I need to prove some spectral or I need to prove some spectral convergence results, which I do not have much time to explain here. It's just this is what I did in my I did my PhD and then finally published in 2018. Just I proved some spectral convergence outside a bad set, which is defined there. And then just called the limiting essential spectrum. And then I prove that this bad set is contained in this spectrum, but we said that set is not in that spectrum. Is not in that spectrum, and therefore, it's not in the bad set, and therefore, the eigenvalue will be approximated. And intuitively, the proof is that if you have now an eigenfunction of this operator with my eigenvalue that I want, the eigenfunction is localized somewhere here. Localized somewhere here. Now, as these two move apart, the eigenfunction will not see the influence anymore of that other potential. And so, maybe intuitively, you understand that this will be approximated. But now I also have to be concerned about these finitely many eigenvalues that I have. Finitely many eigenvalues that I have already constructed. And here I just use a classical result in, for example, the book by Cato. If we take finitely many discrete eigenvalues and the precision r, that works for any operator. There exists a parameter delta such that if what you add in operator norm is less than delta, then your final. Is less than delta, then your finitely many eigenvalues move by less than r. And now my perturbation is a multiplication operator, therefore, the operator norm is the L infinity norm. And if I shift it, the L infinity norm is still the same. So these three eigenvalues will move by less than the precision r. And so now I have. And so now I have four eigenvalues up to a precision r. And I can repeat this and intuitively, inductively, then I do the following. I take a countable subset of the central spectrum by taking all the rational numbers in it. And now near each rational number, Near each rational number, I want to construct an eigenvalue up to a precision. And to do this, I use these steps one and two. So for each eigenvalue that I want to construct, I find a basic potential, and in each step, I shift it so far away. So far away that everything works fine. And then these eigenvalues accumulate at the closure of this, which is then, because it's a countable dense set, is then the whole essential spectrum. In one dimension, yes. Yeah, okay. But yeah, that's just I. But yeah, that's just I showed you an explicit construction, but you can work with any class of basic potentials. Okay, now I'm already in technique two. So I showed you how to get these crazy eigenvalue pictures, and now I want to concentrate on how to perturb an embedded eigenvalue of the essential spectrum. And here I have I have a self-adjoint operator H0, and although I said that this is just a free Laplacian at the beginning, I'm also thinking now of so either the free Laplacian or the Schrodinger operator with some potential V naught because I want to apply it to this example of the Frank-Simon potential. The Frank-Simon potentials. And so, first, I fix an arbitrary characteristic function he on an arbitrary compact subset. And I take a point lambda in the spectrum of H0, and I'm actually thinking of taking it in the essential spectrum because I'm interested in perturbing. Perturbing embedded eigenvalues. So I take Landauer spectrum and a precision epsilon, or yeah, now it's a continuous parameter, arbitrarily small epsilon. And now depending on epsilon, I will construct a V, maybe I should write V epsilon, a potential such that Such that this exact eigenvalue, not just up to a precision. Lambda plus i epsilon will be an eigenvalue of a new operator, H naught plus v. And I cannot give you the exact potential, but I can give you a pointwise bound. For each x, the modulus will be less than a constant times the characteristic function phi. So this means So this means outside of the support of Qi, my potential will be zero, and inside I have an upper bound on the modulus. So this is a bit different to the first technique. In the first technique, I gave you a potential and the eigenvalue only up to a precision. And here I give you an eigenvalue, but I cannot give you the explicit potential. Potential and this constant in front looks very ugly. I will explain you in a second why this is so ugly, but this is the key lemma. And before I prove the key lemma, I give you a corollary. If, okay, before we had just point in the spectrum, now I assume that it's actually an eigenvalue and we have And we have an eigenfunction psi that is normalized and it is localized. And now I take my characteristic function he such that it captures like where the eigenfunction lives, because I assume that one might. Assume that one minus phi, which is the characteristic function outside of the support of phi, multiplied by psi. So the full thing has norm one, and here on the complement, it shall have L2 norm less than one quarter. So he captures more or less where. More or less where at least three-quarters of the eigenfunction lives. And by taking the support of sufficiently large, I will find such a characteristic function. But yeah, this is now fixed after I know that this estimate is satisfied. And now for each positive epsilon, using this key lemma, one can construct. one can construct v or v epsilon such that lambda plus i epsilon is an eigenvalue as before of h naught plus v but now the the pointwise bound is much nicer it's four times epsilon times k and i'm interested in lp norms of the potential so immediately with this point wise bound i get a bound on the l p norm and i do not really care about this l p norm of qi because that's fixed L P norm of Qi because that's fixed. But now, if I take epsilon small, I can make this L P norm arbitrarily small. And this is how, in the end, I will perturb the Frank-Simon example to perturb the embedded eigenvalue of the essential spectrum, and the perturbation can be arbitrarily small in L P norm. So this is. So this is what, oops, sorry. So I explain here. So I take then H naught as a Schrödinger operator, where this V naught is then the Vn of Frank-Simon. Alternatively, so this is all trying to work with Jean-Claude Kuna. We instead of using this proposition, Instead of using this proposition, we applied directly the key lemma to the free Laplacian and then made a clever choice of phi such that this thing in front here also behaves nicely and goes to zero with epsilon. But that's a bit more complicated, so I wanna focus now on Focus now on this perturbing the embedded eigenvalue. I think this is more intuitive. But now I want to prove this key lemma because it's key. So I want to prove this lemma. And I will first give you a wrong proof, but it gives you the right idea. In particular, if you In particular, if you have heard of the Birmann-Schringer principle, I look at some kind of Birmann Schringer operator. So I have here the resolvent of H naught. And from the left and right, I multiply by the characteristic function V. V is a characteristic function on a compact. Compact set, and this is a relatively compact perturbation of H naught in these cases. So, this combination is a compact operator. And I assume that I have an eigenvalue mu that is not zero with eigen function. With eigenfunction phi. And now, if I define psi in this way, you can rearrange this eigenvalue equation to a new eigenvalue equation in terms of psi, this new function. And it's an eigenfunction of H naught minus one over mu times p with eigenvalue z and z that I just yeah. Yeah, took kind of arbitrary lambda plus i epsilon. So this is my prescribed eigenvalue. And you see that this is now a Schrodinger operator and the added potential here minus one over mu times he yeah this is added and and then yeah. And then, yeah. This is kind of nice, but I would like to control the L P norm of this potential and make it small. And for this, I need to control one over mu, the modulus of one over mu. And I want to make this small, which means I want to find mu, this eigenvalue of the compact operator. I want to find. Operator, I want to find this very large. So I would like to know what the spectral radius of this compact operator is. But now, yeah, I like my non-self-adjoint operators, but the spectral radius is difficult to compute. It's not as nice as in the self-adjoint case where if you have a bounded compact operator. A bounded compact operator, then the self-joint, then the norm of the operator is the spectral radius. In the non-self joint case, you could have spectral radius zero, and then that's no fun. So that idea does not quite work. So I want to instead work with a self-ajoint operator for once. So instead of taking the full resolvent as here, Full resolvent as here, I take the imaginary part of the resolvent. H naught is self-adjoint. I should also say this as a real-valued potential. In the Franck-Simon example, and yeah, here I also assume that H0 is self-adjoint. So the adjoint of this resolvent is just the resolvent with the complex. Just the resolvent with the complex parameter, complex conjugated, and then the difference over 2i. Now, sandwiched in between these two characteristic functions. And you can check that this is equal to this, or maybe I should explain, this quotient means epsilon times the resolvent of what is here in the denominator. So here we have self-adjoint operator. A joint operator H naught minus lambda. Yeah, sorry, lambda is real. So this square is non-negative. And then we add something positive, so we are positive. And then the inverse exists and is also positive. And then we multiply from the left and right by this real valued characteristic function that's non-negative. So we have. It's non-negative, so we have a non-negative compact operator. I should also say because he is H naught compact, also this whole combination, which I call K, is compact. And it's non-negative compact operator. And now I can use that the norm is the spectral radius. So I know that this is an eigenvalue and there exists an eigenfunction phi. function phi. Also, Schrodinger operators commute with taking complex conjugation. If you first complex conjugate and then apply the Schrodinger operator, that's the same as first Schrodinger operator and then taking the complex conjugation. And therefore the eigenspaces have real valued basis. Have a real-valued basis. So, without loss of generality, I can assume that phi is a real-valued function. And then my eigenvalue equation, well, just here, this simple eigenvalue equation can be written more ugly, but if I then look at h0 minus z applied to psi, where psi is To psi, where psi is this combination as in the first proof idea, you get that this is almost zero, that's almost a eigenvalue equation. You get some remainder, and now I want to write this remainder as multiplication operator times psi. Psi. So I want to write this as, or actually as minus v times psi. If this right-hand side is equal to this here, you can solve this for v, and you get that v is given by this expression. This is a technique that is used quite often in order to construct. order to construct eigenvalues with potential with sorry to construct potentials with given or given eigenvalues and given eigenfunct then so you have to divide by psi in order to get v um and and usually you run into problems because psi could have zeros or be close to zero Or be close to zero. But here with this construction, we just end up with imaginary part of psi over psi. Because this imaginary part of the resolvent turns into, we then have psi and psi complex conjugate. And so we have the imaginary part of psi. And this quotient, the modulus, is always bounded by one. And therefore we just have. We just have in modulus the point-wise bound of this operating arm of k to the minus one times phi, because this is modulus less or equal to one. So this is how you get this embedded eigenvalue of the essential. Of the essential spectrum. And then, yes, okay. So I have now shown you a lot of crazy eigenvalue pictures. So you may think that in the non-salvary chain case, everything is very wild. But in the last whatever time. Whatever time I have. When did I start? Half past. Okay. I just want to show you very briefly that there exists some one can tame the eigenvalues also in a non-salvage chain case, but now instead of looking at the modulus, the distance to zero, we have to look at the distance to the essential spectrum. Spectrum. So actually, then Rupert Frank proved that you have an individual eigenvalue bound that doesn't just involve the modulus of Z but this distance to the essential spectrum, which may be smaller. And then this now also holds in the non-self-agine case. And he proved it also for this p greater than e plus one over two. And we proved that Yeah, okay. You can think you could change your powers here a bit and give some powers to the other thing, because in the self-adjoint case, everything anyway reduces to the modulus, and then you just add them up and get exactly the same p minus d over 2. And we prove that this distribution of these powers is sharp because it behaves exactly the same. It behaves exactly the same as the LP norm. Anyway, so we have a bound on individual eigenvalues and also maybe look here. Not up there. We also have some kind of Leap Turing inequality, but now you need again the distance to the essential spectrum. So this was proved by Demotansman-Cartriel. I just I just realized that their proof wasn't optimal, and this is the optimal result, which I don't have time to explain, but I proved here that it is sharp. And so one can also find leap-tuning inequalities and therefore accommodation rates to the essential spectrum. Spectrum. So I stop here. There are some references. Thanks for your attention. Yeah, thank you, Daniel, for the thought. Questions? Actually, may I ask a question? I mean, you always approximate. I mean, you always approximate eigenvalues which have been in the spectrum of H0. Is it possible to construct potentials where you get some sort of spectrum pollution or something, some sequence of eigenvalues for small potential which are not in the real line or something, not in the limit operator with the method, or is it totally which method? Well, I know. I mean. I mean, your eigenvalues always converge to somehow you construct some non-data joint potential and then they converge to the spectrum of the limit of radio match. I think in your case it's always data joint, yeah? Actually, there could be additional eigenvalues also this this this picture where I have all these eigenvalues in the lower complex half-plane. I just uh I say I have all these eigenvalues, but there could be additional ones. Could be additional ones. So you put that spectral pollution there. Yes. Well, I mean, they have to accumulate at the central spectrum, and the spectrum is always the central spectrum is always in the spectrum. So I do not really have spectral pollution, but can you give this potential a reconstruction for the x-ray? Let's say you have four values, and then you can really write down the potential. I do not know. Um, I do not know, or I did not know how far to shift these individual potentials. Then there was another paper by Jean-Claude Cunin, where he did some explicit computations and proved you have to move it that far in order to get that close to the eigenvalues. But that's then very I can value it, but that's then very technical. Maybe another way I would say naive question or something. If you have to explain this to a physicist, how would you explain it? I mean, how would he say, go ahead, would it have to be? They are anyway surprised that there are embedded eigenvalues. You're not aware of Wigner-Von Neumann potential and other stuff. I think every scientist, not what is true. I mean, it should be farmhats, but I guess, yeah. Yeah, but yeah, my turum colleagues were surprised. They were surprised by having embedded eigenvalues in the essential spectrum. Yeah, for us it's okay, but for physicists It's okay, but for physicists, it's but then you have to start with some operator like actually like the second case, yeah, with some potential, yeah, on let's say the real line, yeah. Yes, I think the easiest example is the Wigner von Neumann potential that behaves like sine of x over x or so. So it uh it has to oscillate uh a lot and and and decay slowly. Then you have a very argument yourself. Then you have a very argument yourself. Yes. So, maybe two very stupid questions, I think. So, here this example where you say you can say where you want the ID value, but then you can really say how much it is. Yes. And then you say, but there you have to go small for the IPs. No, I just can't make it arbitrarily small because I want my LP norm to be. Because I want my L P norm to be arbitrarily small. But this was for arbitrary for all epsilon greater than zero, right? Here. Any epsilon greater than zero? Yeah, the problem is then just that this here will be very small and then the inverse will be very large. Will be very large. I mean, you had one with like where you put the fixed item value. This is something yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you make a double item and it may be so rich such that this is great for the buttons? No. But no after that, then I mean, yeah, in principle you can with your at least in higher dimensions you have your basic potentials and then I think you can somehow just rotate the potential in order that the eigenfunction becomes. Function becomes linearly independent and probably add this to the previous one and then shift it away again. I would have to think about it. But you certainly cannot do it iteratively because then you would have an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity and this cannot happen outside the central spectrum. Central spectrum. Any more questions to not? If not, then thanks, Babina, Daniel.
