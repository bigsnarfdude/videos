Today, I will talk about weak solution of Euler equation based on differential geometric arguments. So, my geometer, a little bit analysis, and due to my asthma sorry inconvenience. So, but anyway, in this talk, we'll In this talk, we'll discuss Eura flow, which is a model describing the motion of two-dimensional, incompressible, and invisible fluids. And point vortex dynamics, which is a model derived from aura flow. Point vortex dynamics is used as a model described flow with localized vortex structure. But since it is derived formally from the oil flow, From the aura flow, the question arises as to whether point bottle dynamics is an aura flow in the sense of some mathematical. So oral flow is a solution to the two-dimensional Euler equation. When the flow field is a plane, the Euler equation can be reduced to the voltage equation. So, furthermore, So, furthermore, the voltage velocity is given by Birsova law, which gives an explicit presentation of voltage. It turned out that using solution omega of the voltage equation, this pair is order flow. So, this is extended to the weak solution. Solution. We focus on the case where omega is given as a linear combination of delta function called the point vortex distribution. A pair is determined in the same way, but it is not clear whether the vortex equation is satisfied when omega is a point vortex distribution. So Helen Holtz proposed to define it as the To define it as the orbit of a lateralized vector field. This is called point-vortex dynamics. So, since the equation governing vorticity is determined in different ways, the question arises as to whether point-port dynamics is in any sense or a problem. Until this problem is solved, it is still open whether. It is still open whether the insights gained by using point-voltage dynamics is also available for order flows. Therefore, even if we find out something about the time evolution of free phenomena using point-water dynamics, which is mathematically easy to handle, just a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, we cannot distinguish whether. Cannot distinguish whether it is inside or only gained from point vortex dynamics or whether it is an insight that can be guided for order flow as well. Point vortex dynamics in a background field is a generalization of point dynamics in image the effects of background field. Of background field, such as the rotation on the earth, are taken into account. Point-water dynamics in a background field is defined by the versity of classical solution of Euler question and vector field of the point-water dynamics. This field is defined in the same way as in absence of background field. Even the regularity of the background field is. Regularity of the background field is simply of class C R, it remains open whether the pair is a weak solution of the Euler equation, just as the case with no background field is open. As an application of point-wise dialogues in a background phase, it is utilized as It is utilized under some vortex measure. The process by which the kinetic energy distributed in the large and small vortices finally concentrates in the large-scale structure and becomes dominant is called inverse Cascade and is regarded as a fundamental process of two-dimensional turbulence. Therefore, the understanding of the process of the process of the process Therefore, the understanding of vortex major is important to gain insight into two-dimensional taverns. As a simple file model, quantum vortex dynamics in a background of this setting is used. Protein-Hamiltonian contacts, we see that they different depending on threshold view. In the negative case, distance between two Between two points is smaller, which implies that it is expected that both X merges occur. In fact, this has been confirmed to be consistent with fluid experiments. In this experiment, two meter longer rectangular tank is loaded to create shear flow, and this is background field. And tube is used to move the dyed fluid in and out to create a localized vortex. The photo is snapshot of rectangular tank rotated so that mu is negative, and we see how they approach each other. On the other hand, in light of Kelvin-Cyclon's theorem, the number of bodices. The number of vortices never completely decreases from two to one in non-viscous fluid motion. In this experiment, the bore-text-Reynold number is 7500 and in the final stage of the bortex motion, the viscous effect is dominant and the both C match into one. On the other hand, in the On the other hand, in the early case of the vortex motion, the effect of advection is dominant and the vortex vortices are closer together. Sorry. In fact, when that direction pogrom fits reversed, narrowly, when the rectangular tongue is low. When the rectangular tank is rotated in the opposite direction and the same experiment perform, the vortex moves attached with time. This is also consistent with point vortex dynamics in background fits, where mu is positive. As a result, every simple model, such as point-vortex dynamics in background fits, can be provided inside. Can we provide insight to the approach of vortex? However, we do not know if this is also true for Eura flows. Sorry, it can be understood that even when the profit in on cut surfaces, the best. The breast is regenerated from vorticity, and vorticity equation is written as an evolution equation, sorry, in terms of vorticity. By using solution to voltage equation, we can obtain the solution to the oral equation, which is equation, which is the generalization of all equation to the surface. Euler equation to the surfaces. Reaching this point allows us to derive the point vortex dynamics on the surfaces. The point vortex dynamics, essentially something or area, primary evolution evolved not through not through not through both equation, but through. But to the reality of Biosabar law. The only aspect that seems characteristic of the Bortist equation is that while the support of delta function evolves over time, its coefficients do not. Thus, we define the voltage as such and that and the timing. That and determine its evolution equation evolution, time evolution as a regularized vector field of the grave function for the Lafrasian on the surfaces. Thus, the time aberration of the point vertices is governed by two functions. The fastest grain function, which is chosen. To be constant according to the three-boundary condition of the oral analytic regression, leading to its designation as a hydrodynamic green function, any constant can be chosen as long as total circulation is minus one. But we will focus on this class with With a fixed harmonic part. The existence of brain function on a general curved surfaces is not given. The second driving function for point both sides is a Loven function. Defined as a regularized distance, a regularized function by distance of the grain function. It is x. It essentially acts as a self-driving element for point vertices, depending on the domain shape. The dependency on domain shape varies such as in uniformly curved areas without hole or boundaries, it is not expressly present. Present, but otherwise, it can be created advective effects. In this manner, the point-vortex dynamics on surfaces can be straightforward derived from Eura-Andrude equation. However, historically, it was not It was not so simple. In terms of historical developments, initially, point-vortex dynamics on a plane were deformated in this Hamiltonian system. Then, the flow field in bounded domain in the plane was more precisely examined with regularized regularization. Legalized regularization of green function. Finally, when generalizing profit to subsistence, this harrowing homolog was introduced, leading to present format. In more detail, it was loose through fast-driving Hamiltonian formalism. Formalism for 0.46 constituted by green function. Linda considered the Rovan function in this context. The formalization of point-vortex dynamics on substitutes using Hamiltonian system was accomplished by Harry. Since then, interesting vortex motion in battery flow. In Barrier, flow field has been studied, leading to the current understudies. In recent years, there has been reconsideration of formulation of point of dynamics on surfaces. One view is areas and limits of a small body. Of a small body on surfaces becomes point-vortex dynamics. For example, in a model where the motion of fluid and liquid body is governed by Euler equation and Newton equation, respectively, and the liquid body moves according to the pressure exerted by fluids. It is said that the vorticity of point vortex dynamics will be converged in the mass of mass zero limits and area zero limits. All the convergence analysis has been limited to the play. It has been shown that point vortex dynamics can be obtained. Can be obtained as a mass zero limit, even on surfaces. In addition, for surfaces with whole, it is necessary to consider the harmonic part. This is also true from the formulation of point vortex dynamics. However, it is known as that by considering the flow due to the how many Flow due to the Hamiltonic part in this way for the Hamiltonian of the point of vortex dynamics, the Hamiltonian can be redefined. Seeing from another perspective, this can be interpreted as adapting such a form of bacon fields for the point vertex dynamics, thus it can be And it can also be considered a type of point vortex dynamics in a background field on surfaces. Therefore, the aim of this research is the mathematical justification of point-vorte dynamics in a background phase on axis as an Euler-Anald equation. To address this, we formulate the solution space of Euler equation through drama currents. A dram current is a continuous linear function defined on the space of all differential forms with test with compact support. Primary mathematical objects developed in. Geometrical objects developed in geometric analysis. Roughly speaking, a current is an object that locally becomes a differential hole with distribution coefficients. Since the currents are geometrically natural concepts, the same discussion as in this presentation can be applied even when the profiles And the profit is on substance. Thus, for instance, the main result can be applied to the point of voltage dynamics with rotation fields on sphere when we model using geophysical fluids. However, in this presentation, I'm asked to ensure the To ensure the essential part of discussion are comprehensive, even for those not familiar with necessary concepts in differential geometry, we focus on the case where we have flow fields in the plane. As for Karl Savior, how uh curve surfaces can be for to be effective we try to use green function for now so a substance when when green function exists and orientable to take and drive with a polyphone would be desirable Desire as an example of current differential forms and distribution can be cited. In particular, since integral operators with differential forms as their kernels As their currents become currents, differential forms are identified with currents through integral operators. Therefore, the wave formulation using currents is carried out by first representing with differential form and then replacing them with currents. This form is Therefore, it is identified with distribution. Thus, the current corresponding to the delt function is given as a delt current, delta currents, and this is referred as a delt current. Let me now discuss the key process of obtaining point vortex dynamics. Point-to-dynamics from the Eura-Arnold equation using currents. Firstly, we rewrite the Euler-Arnold equation on surfaces in terms of differential form. This operation corresponding to the linear algebraic operation of converting vector to covector. To covector using causality form. In two dimensions, it becomes clear that all terms can be written as differential form, concluding vorticity. This allows for the composition of the advection term into product of vorticity and infinitesimal product. Infinitesimal flux and gradient components. Important aspect to note in point of vortex dynamics is this gradient component. When we apply test form and create weak form, the gradient component disappears for smooth solution. However, for non-smooth solution, For non-semester solution like point vortices, this component becomes essential. To observe this, we take principal value, solutions that satisfying, thus obtaining weak form with principal value, are called current boundaries solution for the ERA available. For the Euler-Avald equation. The greatest advantage of using currents is that through the calculation of currents, we can actually obtain non-stationary term of point-vortex equation and Hamiltonian vector fields. Hamiltonian vector fields driving point both sides. So here is the non-steady time, stationary time is here and derived from Euler and equation in stationary and non-stationary terms. And this is a background phase and And Hamiltonian vector feeds driving Hamiltonian and driving point both sides. As a result, for current valid solution for the order identification, where the politicians is given as a linear combination of delta functions and the voltage date of the Vorticity of the background fields. And so this omega sub x is the vertices of the background field. It can be concluded that the motion of singular point vortices, singular points of delta function satisfying this equation in the sense of current. So we called this equation. We call this equation point vortex dynamics in background fields on surfaces and corresponding to the conventionally called point vortex dynamics. So and this formulation is a generalization of conventional form and here this no Background field terms with normalized coefficients and with no constant background vorticity. This tan is equal to zero. So conventional point vortex equation is derived from this generalized form. So, hence, we conclude the point about dynamics in background field of substance, any surface, any background fields, but classical solution of Eura and equation. Background fields is given as classical solution of Then this current value, then the point vortex dynamics is current variant solution for the Euler anode equation. Moreover, this secondary point, as a secondary point, we can obtain the pressure of C. The pressure of single the point vortex dynamics and the pressure is a background field pressure and cross term is background field and point vortex vector field point vortex fluid velocity and kinetic energy of fluid velocity for point vortex is. For point vote S. And this coefficient is governed by this cross-turn with singular singular pressure with this cross-down and kinetic energy. So, and this coefficient corresponds to the evolution equation in this form. So, in this So in this coefficient is dynamically coherent, but this coefficient is a kinetic coefficient for in the sense of pressure. But anyway, this is shown the main result. That is, if the vorticity of the relative verticity of Epicity of the previous formulation of pressure is governed by single-portity. This is stated in previous slides. The linear combination of delta function and with background field policy. Then Then the evolution of a single point of delta function is governed by this equation. Conversely, sorry, and this is a title just corrected with this equation of This equation. But anyway, the converse statement is hold true. Namely, if singular support is governed by point vortex dynamics in background fields on subsets, and then the given by fluid birth. Like fluid burst in the form and pressure, then the current bar solution of Eura anodification. So from this point about X diamonds, it's just right as a current valid solution in the sense of drawing currents as a solution of. As a solution of Euler-Anold equation, as an exact solution of Euler-Adold equation instance of drama currents. Based on main results, we revisit the application of point-vortex dynamics in battery-lane field and vortex measure. What is already known is that point-vortex equation in Point vortex equation in background fields provides a criterion that gives the occurrence of vortex major, which is consistent with Freud experiments. On the other hand, what is that news is that the point vortex equation is updated with questions, and these questions And these questions actually derived from the pressure. This pressure is the solution of the Eura annual flow. In this case, Eura flow in the frame. From this point of view, the criterion is also updated in this way. In this way. And since emphasizing the determining factor, the conclusion obtaining from the update criterion and those obtained from the original criterion are the cell. Furthermore, since the Hamiltonian counterines as a cell, thus, using updated criterion, occurrence both Occurrence vortex measure is predicted not only the direction of the background field, but also the time of the coefficient of the pressure. It is expected to consistent with the original flow experiment, but since there is no reference to the comparison of the pressure. The comparison of the pressure and energy density in the previous study, it is not clear whether it is consistent with the previous experiment, even if pressure takes into account. In any case, justification of point vortex dynamics as a weak oil flow in the sense of Duran currents make it clear the insights are buried in the framework of oil flows. Of Eura flows. Finally, we consider the Bernoulli law in the pressure of point bottles. Erotation field is a steady solution to the Euler equation, and its pressure formula is called Bernoulli law, as you know. The single voltage of point voltage can be regarded as an irrotational phase in Phase in the domain except for the single support in terms of linear combination of delta functions. However, to say that pressure orbits benevolor, it is necessary to say that it is pressure of oil flow, which is guaranteed by the main Theronum 2. On the other hand, let us use Thernum 1. Let us use the third one to investigate the Bernoulli law in more detail. In this setting, if the background field is a rotation field, then the point vortex equation in background fields is given by the beta times the usual conventional point vortex equation, and the pressure becomes this. This is the parameter replaced by the Replaced by the density of the currents, and actually the time from the velocity velocity remains changing in the parameter beta. This is that if beta is one, equation becomes a conventional point equation, and the pressure is a usual point vortex dynamics is given by this formula. Formula this formula if beta is such sufficiently small, the point vortex point vortices move quite slowly along the trajectory, usually point vortex dynamics. So beta scaled to y and scale to time. At scale to time. So, in this sense, beta describes the flexibility of the motion of point vortices as the flexibility fades away. The pressure converges to the Bernoulli law in the topology in L1 space of the pressure and fluid velocity. So, thank you for kind. Kind attention and finish my talk.
