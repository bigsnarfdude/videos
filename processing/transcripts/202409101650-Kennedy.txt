To have Chris Kennedy who will be speaking about a classroom formula on PathSpace for the region post. Hi there, and I just wanted to thank the organizers for inviting me. It's nice to be back in Manff. And I've made sure to reference at least three people that are here today in the presentation. So based on stuff that was done previous to what I've done, and then some stuff that extended it later on. So without further ado, let's go here. So I just wanted to start with the overview. So, I just wanted to start with the overview of the results that I'm going to present. So, using stochastics, I generalized a classical Bockner formula for the heat equation, automol manifolds, to an infinite-dimensional Bockner formula, quadruparabolic path space. So that's this curly M, which is equal to M cross 0 T. One of the benefits is also characterizing solutions of the Ricci flow in terms of the Bochner inequality, and one can obtain additional. Can obtain additional things such as gradient and Hessian estimates for Martin Yale's on path space as well as condensed proofs of previous characterizations of region formulas. So this is just the table of contents here. So the plan here, it's similar to the structure of my paper, is to just go through the characterize, discuss the preliminaries briefly, and then go to the main theorem and time permitting, I might discuss some of the applications. So we'll see where we go from there. Where we go from there. Okay, so one of the great things about probability on stochastic is that we can use it to better understand how shapes deform and evolve in time. And one application of such is solutions to geometric flows. And two ways that we can characterize solutions to geometric flows is through gradient estimates and Baukner formulas. So here's just a Baukner inequality that one can view. That one can view. HT would just be the heat flow. That would be your normal gradient on a manifold in the time-independent setting. And so, for example, and this is a classical result, you can find super solutions to Einstein's equations and show that they satisfy an equivalent notion. So that's positive reach curvature here, a gradient, a Bochner inequality here in the middle, and a gradient estimate on the right. So we can classify super solutions to Einstein's equations. Super solutions to Einstein's equations in these two ways. Classical result. And so, what I've done here is what we're going to try and do is we're going to try and develop a Bochner inequality for solutions to the Ricci flow. So, the Ricci flow equation is written here from Hamilton's program in 1993. And what we're going to introduce is going to introduce a time-dependent metric theory. And so there's so. And so there's solutions and supersolutions of flows, and we can characterize both supersolutions and solutions to both the Einstein's equations as well as the Ricci flow. So the example I just showed was the one in here, Ricci greater than or equal to zero, and we can characterize that class. We can also characterize super solutions to the Ricci flow as well. So if I go here, we can do an equivalence of super solutions to the Ricci flow. To the Ricci flow with a classical Bachner inequality and gradient estimates. So, what you can see here is you can see a nice gradient estimate and a nice Bauchner inequality here. HST is basically the heat flow from time S to T. So it's the standard starting at base point S, but and evolving to T. And here F is just a test function. MgT is our time dependent Riemannian manifold. Riemannian manifold. So, this is again classical, but we can characterize super solutions to both Einstein's equations and the region flow. So, one thing that we could do to extend this, and this was done by Nabor in 2013, was to develop first an equivalence of solutions to Einstein's equations to an infinite-dimensional gradient estimate. And an infinite-dimensional Bopter inequality was done later. So, for instance, Naber proved this particular identity here. Particular identity here, where we integrate over the path space. And that's dealing with curves that evolve backwards with unit speed. Here is just a discussion of some other works and variants of the estimate that have been attained by people such as Cheng and Talmeier and so forth. So let's continue, and what we've And what we've got here is a main result that was developed by Hasselhoffer and Neighbors. So, Hasselhoffer is one of the three people I'm referencing in the audience. He was my co-PhD advisor. And so they developed something else because the previous example was an infinite-dimensional gradient estimate, but they were also able to characterize solutions to Einstein's equations via a Bochner default. So that you can see right here. And one of the utilities of this inequality is you can do a simplified proof of the infinite dimensional estimate by neighbor. And that's also discussed in that paper from 2018. So this is just some glossary of some of the terms here. F is just a test function from the pathways on the manifold R. You have an induced martingale here conditioned on a sigma algebra of the information that you know up to time t. dx is the standard v. dx is a standard Wiener measure starting at x, and then there's a notion of a parallel gradient, and I'll define some of that semi-formally in a later slide. So one of the things that should be discussed here is solutions to the Ricci flow. The main difference with solutions versus the classical situation of super solutions is what we have here is we have this notion of a parabolic path space. This notion of a parabolic path space. So it consists of continuous space-time curves. And notice the first component here is evolving with freedom speed backwards. And we can naturally endow with a parabolic Wiener measure as well as a parabolic stochastic parallel gradient. And what you can do is you can prove this particular estimate here. So if it evolves and it's a solution to the Ricci flow, you can also get this nice great volume. And here, M is. And here, M is, curly M is just M cross 0. T is with space-time equipped with the Levi-Chavita connection. P sub t of M is the parabolic path space related up here. And then we've got a standard parabolic Leviner measure starting at X, T and evolving maximum time. Okay, so just a mention of other work that's related to. Of other work that's related to that gradient estimate for solutions to the Ricci flow. There's characterizations also by Chen and Talmeyer. Links between elliptic and parabolic settings have also been established by Cabeza, Serivas, and Passelwater. But then there's also a question, and this leads to my result that I published in 2023, Calculus of Variations in PE, was can we establish a Bacher formula on the Perivald path space? So the Perivald pass space again is defined. So, the parabolic path space again is defined here, just to gram in the idea a little bit too hard, perhaps. And then we've got this definition of our heat flow. And let's go to the next slide. But before I get there, I wanted just to iterate why this might be important. And I've provided this example here. Provided this example here of f of gamma is equal to f. So pi 1 is just the projection onto the second coordinate. I guess 0 is the first coordinate of this curve. So we take the spatial component where f mats be manifold r. We define an induced martingale as well, given by this property. And the utility basically, and that gets to the last point on the slide, is that we can use these martingales, just as in this example with a one-cylinder function, to generalize equal. Generalized formula. And so it motivates our main result that we could perhaps develop a generalized Bachmann formula on parabolic acids. So there's some notations involved with the geometric preliminaries here. I'm not going to probably wax too much philosophic on this, but there's the time-independent geometry where we have a complete Riemannian independent geometry. We have a complete Riemannian manifold. We have a set of frames from Rn to Txm. From Rn to TxM, where our fibers, where we call these the fibers with the orthodontal map, and we deal with a frame bundle, we deal with a lift to the frame, so f tilde equals f composed of pi, and we develop the notion of a unique horizontal lift such that the push forward of x star is equal to x. And the difference with time-dependent geometry is now we have a metric that is dependent on time, we have the space-time with the connection. Space-time with the connection. And here, again, the frames look fairly similar, but they start at base point XT, and they're the orthonormal maps starting on the tangent plane TSM with metric GT. And then there's a few other definitions here, just as a reference in case someone asks me any questions, but I'm not going to go over that. It's just if it shows up in a theorem or whatnot. So this links to the So, this leads to the geometric preliminaries. So, that's what I'll discuss first, followed by the probabilistic preliminaries that lead to the main theorem. So, hopefully, I can at least get to the main theorem. Let's see how much time we have. So, 15 minutes left, so I think we're good. So, horizontal lift here. We have a given vector in the tangent space for curly M here, and we've got a frame U. There exists a unique horizontal lift to the Horizontal lift to the frame here, satisfying with the push forward here of alpha x star plus beta dt is equal to alpha x plus beta dt of x star. So in particular, dt is the horizontal, this capital dt is the horizontal lift of partial over partial t. There's also a notion here of local coordinates. So what we do is we deal with this kind of map here and Deal with this kind of map here, and given local coordinates on perilly m we can get local coordinates on the generalized linear bundle up here, g sub xt, and we have this notion of u EA is equal to this term here. And the lift of this UE sub A will actually be this symbol here, HN. And that will be the horizontal lift. And we've got this notion. And we've got this notion of horizontal lift here, we've got a vertical lift here, and we've got the lift of partial over partial t. And there's some calculations done by Hamilton based on his program in 1993 in which we write these terms in local coordinates. Are there any questions so far? Okay. Okay, let's continue then. So there's a notion, okay, that we have that hand, so there's some theorems, some results that were used to develop this Bochner inequality, such as this what here, where you take the derivatives of the tensor fields. And this basically allows us to get to a proposition where we deal with orthodoxy invariant functions. So we want them to be orthodox invariant, so we're focusing on a particular fiber. And then Particular fiber, and then we can actually get a commutator relation between these horizontal lifts on the frame bundle for this, and we get this particular equation. So these tildes just basically say, okay, we're going to correspond to, there's going to be an actual map between this, say, metric, or this, like this region curvature, between the frame bundle and the projection down on the mouth. So, for instance, the region curvature sub AB there. Sub AB there is given by this formula. Okay, and there's also probabilistic preliminaries. So just as when we're doing with unit speed evolution of curves here, where you're solving an initial value problem such as this, we can look at the anti-development in the time-dependent setting for evolving manifolds. So we've got a base value of u. A base value of u. We've got du sub tau is equal to this. And this here, this circle just denotes the Stretchonovich integral. It turns out the calculus works much better, but we do a horizontal lift with the Stratonovich integral. It's the same thing like you trade, like integration by parts works for Stratanovich and Edo, it's the chain rule. You're making a trade-off, so it makes the calculation a little more difficult when you project down, and it makes it much easier to do the analysis on the flip. So, a key probabilistic tool was developed by Hasloffer and Neighbor, and it was basically to establish that this differential equation here has a unique, subject to some kind of regularity conditions, has a unique solution satisfying this particular model. And I've briefly sketched the proof just in words here. So, what you do is you embed the frame basically into Rn. So, N is a much bigger. R n, so n is a much bigger than the actual dimension using a Nash equilibrium argument or similar. And what we can do is we can extend, do a partition of unity argument, and we can find solutions up to some kind of explosion problem. So there's the reference to the second person in the audience, Elton Sue there. And what we do at the end is we do some Edocalculus, we project down, it turns out the explosion time for this particular SE is infinite. E is infinite, and then we can get our result. Okay, so about 10 minutes perfect. Okay, so there's the definition of the Brownie motion on space-time. So we've got this particular map here. We've got space-time with the connection, and we've got a base point pi view of x, t. We've got a notion of a stochastic parallel transport, which is a family of isometries. Which is a family of isometries from this tangent space with this metric to this space. And we can also define the based path spaces, P sub U of F on the frame and this path space on the manifold. So this, I just reiterated, I think I've hammered this home a few too many times, but now I think everyone knows what the airbald path space is. And anyways, these are just preliminaries. Anyways, these are just preliminaries that will be useful in terms of proving the theory. Okay, so there's a couple more probabilistic preliminaries, one of which is the notion of a cylinder function. Some of you may be familiar with that definition. So if it's a k-point cylinder function, you've got a projection of gamma sigma 1 through sigma k. If it's a one-point evaluation map, then it's just going to have this first component. U will go from m to r. And I'll actually do an example where we. R, and I'll actually do an example where we do a calculation of that shortly. And then there's the notion of a stochastic parallel gradient defined by the Freier derivative of d sigma, and it shows up in here. It's this little term here, and then this is the standard inner product of this space. So that's some more notation. I don't think we need to go through it too much. I'll probably skip. It's too much. I'll probably skip this slide, but if there's any questions, then this might be handy as a tool to refer to. So, one of the key examples about how Martingale's generalized heat flow is this particular example here, where we look at a function of a one-cylinder function here, f gamma, is equal to f of pi one of gamma tau one here, and we look at the induced martinal. And for instance, Hasloff, our neighbor, came up with this. Our neighbor came up with this formula in here, where we concatenate from gamma from 0 to tau star gamma prime, which has some kind of randomness element, from tau to tau 1, and we can perform a calculation and actually compute what this induced martingale looks like. So, this is just a useful tool. For instance, this one here is easy to calculate because if tau is, for instance, greater than tau one, there is no randomness element. No randomness element, so you're integrating, you're just doing f pi1 gamma tau1, and you're integrating with respect to probability, and that's just independent of this measure. So you're just integrating against the probability measure, and just getting this f here. Pi1 of gamma tau1 is just x tau 1. Whereas if you integrate for tau is less than tau 1, you integrate over the path space, and you're going to integrate, and you're basically going to evolve under some kind of heat flow, and you can show that f tau is equal to this particular. Okay. So I want to get to at least the main result and discuss it briefly and maybe go through one or two of the applications, but we only have seven minutes, so let's see how we do. So the main result here is we let f tau be a map from the parabolic path space to R be a Martindale, and if sigma greater than or equal to 0 is 6, then we can actually Greater than equal to 06, then we can actually get this particular Baukner inequality. So we've got the differential of the square of the gradient, we've got this particular term here, but then you've also got some kind of volatility terms here with the d tau component. One important thing is this main result basically gives us what we want in terms of if we have Ricci, we have full Bachness. So if we have this particular, if we have Richie. So if we have this particular, if we have Ricci, this term particularly will vanish, d V T of G plus 2 Ricci. And what you'll do is you'll see, okay, indeed, these other terms just show up. So if there's equality and this thing vanishes, then you're going to get this inequality. So this corollary is fairly trivial. So anyways, I'll outline the steps to the proof. And the steps to the proof begin with proving a Martingale To the proof, begin with proving a Martindale representation theorem. So if there's this map f tau from the parabolic path space to R and it is a Martindale, then it solves this particular stochastic differential equation. So as you can see, there's only the DWT component here. There's only the drift, I guess. And you've got this parallel gradient in here, and you've got the started point F naught. So the trick is to actually. So, the trick is to actually, based on the earlier calculation, prove properties for k-point cylinder functions. Then, the idea is to lift to the frame bundle F tau tilde. So this PF is just the path space on the frame to R. And we can actually show that DF tau tilde is just equal to the inner product here of where we're looking at the L plus 1th component of the horizontal lift. And then what happens is And then what happens is one proceeds to project back down. After which, we can find the evolution of the parallel gradient. So we found some kind of, so that's this particular term in here. We can find, okay, we can look at that quantity and find its evolution. And then we can perform a little bit of eco-heedle calculus, remembering that we were working with Svertonovitz earlier, and we can get our result, the Bachmann formula, in general. The Bochner formula, the generalized Bochner formula on parable opacities. So, I guess I should do briefly, because there's about, there's four minutes, okay, so enough time to go through some application. So, there's also some new characterizations of the Ricci flow. So, there's an equivalence between Ricci and Bochner. So, we found new characterizations of the Ricci flow via the Bochner inequality. So, there's a bunch of them, there's gradient estimates. Of them. There's gradient estimates, there's quadratic variation estimates, others which I haven't even stated on the slides, like Log Sobolev and Poincaré. But I'll just give a brief overview of that. But the idea is basically what we've got here. This is the main theorem. We can go from that full Bochner to Ricci. If the Martin Vale F tau satisfies the full Bochner inequality, then the family manifolds will evolve under the Ricci theorem. So I just thought. So I just thought I'd mention: okay, this is a new proof of a previous characterization of the Ricci flow based on previous work by Haslaw for a neighbor. And then I also noticed that somebody, that Ava Kopfer and Streets generalized it to include, to a generalized region flow, and it includes a torchion term. So we found a more general bottom flow. Okay, so just to mention some of these. Just to mention some of these new characterizations. Okay, so we can characterize full Bochner as implying weak Bauchner. We've got a bunch of like A implies B, implies C type equivalencies. And some of these are fairly trivial, but are useful in terms of proving different directions. So we've got the full Baukner here. We can drop this non-negative term, and we've got some kind of notion of a weak Baukner down here. We also have equivalencies. Also, we have equivalencies with a linear Bochner formula. So, we go just as we did before, you could develop a formula for the evolution of the gradient squared, but you could also do an evolution of the norm of the gradient. You can get this inequality, and that's equivalent, as well as the sub-Martin Gale problem. One can also do some gradient estimates. Do some gradient estimates. And these gradient estimates, you can go from a sub-Martingale, which is the fifth property I mentioned for Ricci flow, the fifth equivalency, and get gradient estimates. And that will actually prove useful in terms of new characterizations of the Ricci flow, which time permitting I may get to in a couple minutes. There's also some Hessian estimates. I don't want to ramble on on about these estimates for too long here, but they're also valid results. Valid results. So, this leads to the final couple of slides where one can look at condensed proofs of prior characterizations. So, we can use the previous gradient estimates to prove equivalent notions of the Ricci flow. And these are some of the ones I was mentioning. So, you've got this other gradient estimate in here. So, this result here, the gradient inequality estimate number one, allows us to get this result here, and we've also can get. And we also can get quadratic variations. And some of these provide equivalent notions of the region flow. So what we can do is we can characterize in various ways, and we can also use, develop log sablo, and Plain Corre equivalencies. I'm not going to mention them in too much more detail because we only have forty two seconds, but they're definitely available in the paper. They're definitely available in the paper. Also, of note is we went in one direction throughout this entire presentation. So, converse implications where we go the other way aren't too difficult. They just basically involve substituting one-point, two-point cylinder test functions of compact support. And we can get the equivalence that full Bochner implies Ricci, yes, which is what we showed up here. But we can also go the other way and do Ricci implies full Bochner. Does that make sense? So the notions are. Makes sense. So the notions are equivalent. And that's just the slide with the summary of the results. It's the same as the first one there. And I just want to thank you for your attention.
