With Voitek Palopeki. Voitek is an assistant professor at the University in Posna. And Voitec is interested in plant and ecosystem modeling, self-organizing systems. And actually, he wants to present something related to climate response modeling, and you didn't change your mind, actually. No, I don't think. Okay. Yeah, so he went back and. Yeah, yeah, so I went back and forth, but I included a few slides on the other topic. So the idea was that there were a few discussions on pre-combustion as well because that seemed like relevant to what part of the audience was interested in. It included like a biomechanics model and physical simulation of combustion. But in the end, I stuck still into the original topic, which is essentially how to integrate or how to model, how to simulate the interconnection between vegetation, atmosphere, soil. All right, and this is essentially a little bit like an This is essentially a little bit like an observational slide for us. It's a work that has been published like two months ago at a conference. Can you move virtual speaker? So how was that better? I will try to focus on this all here while speaking. The motivation essentially was to create a model that can describe the Can describe the interconnection between vegetation, atmosphere, and soil. So, this is a topic that has seen like increasing interest throughout science. And it's something that we wanted to address through simulated work that was inherently geometric. So, this work was actually based on two previous projects, which we accomplished during the last years. One was a vegetation model, which already had some kind of global. Had some kind of global notion of the climate, which in this work we try to extend towards a local notion of the climate, microclimate, so to speak. And the second project, where we are focusing on modeling the atmosphere, and specifically the simulation of different cloud species. So, here, an overview kind of like how the application is composed. So, I'm a computational modeler. So, this would be more, let's say, an overview. So, this would be more, let's say, an overview of what kind of computational tools there are, especially in computer graphics to facilitate simulated work on natural patterning. And in this overview, essentially, what we start out with is some kind of user input where a user can specify different types of plant species, a digital elevation model and some climate data. Then we have a vegetation model component, which allows us to produce some geometry that describes our ecosystem. Describes our ecosystem. And this then is transformed into a vapor map to simulate the transpiration of the vapor from our ecosystem model. And then we have a Weber model where essentially we track water in different space transitions. This is modeled here within the differential equations. And then, sort of, like what happens essentially in the weather model, and then to transform into a precipitation map that is used as simple. Map that is used as input into a soil model, where again we have a few coupled partial differential equations that close off sort of like the water cycle that we attempt to model here. So for the first bit, the vegetation model, we're using a multi-scale representation for vegetation. So we start out with a definition of modules which specify the topology of individual branch clusters, and these modules can be arranged. These modules can be arranged then by a process of self-organization to describe the structure of whole plants. So, here we're mostly focusing on trees, and with this topological description, we then pass it on to the GPU, where we are then able sort of like to efficiently create renderings by expressing the geometry out of this topological description. So, here a diagram that this That describes a little bit this multi-scale vegetation model in a bit more detail. So, on the left-hand side, there is a picture, an image showing off a few prototypes that describe different branch modules. So, this is something that is supplied by the user. It's going to be arbitrarily defined. And then these modules are sent to the GPU. So, we can then, using defined transformations, transform these sort of like These sort of like template structures by scaling them up, by shearing them, by somehow modifying the structure. And this is something which then expresses deterministic development in our model at the scale of the individual branch modules or branch clusters. And then we use these branch modules to organize them in space and connect them in such a way that they describe a whole plant. And then several such instances could be placed in one simulation space that they... Placed in one simulation space where they then can interact with each other, thereby sort of like affecting each other's goal. All right, so the self-organization part needs like a few more words towards that. So the idea is that we express the notion of competition of branches in space and for light as well. So here we compute, approximate the light conditions around the tree. And then by computing the light flux, we propagate this light information through. This light information throughout this tree graph to the root node, where we then redistribute this light flux again as bigger values, as growth potential, back to the nodes, which then express this notion or can determine potentially the next growth iteration in our vegetation model. But in this case, we can modulate this vigor flux that is getting sent out by some kind of climatic adaptation parameter, which Parameter O, which expresses that like how adapted a plant at a given region in space is. Another thing that we're doing at the scale of these modules, of these branch clusters, we have the gradient-based optimization method where we try to minimize the intersection between modules. When it comes to the atmosphere model, it's based on describing the phase conditions of water in the atmosphere from vapor to condensed water, which is then integrated. To condensed water, which is then interpreted as clouds by our rendering machine to rain. Here we extended this scheme, which is known as the Kessler scheme in climatology by including plant evapotranspiration and some macroclimatic vapor, essentially vapor that can come outside of the simulation space into our model. And with this atmosphere model, we're essentially able to describe geometrically the transition from different colours with different. Different clouds with different cloud species, such as stratus, stratusumarus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus clouds. The third part of our model was the soil model. And here essentially, once the weather model computes some kind of downpour, some kind of rain over a terrain, we store these values in a precipitation map, which then is used to determine the surface water layout over the terrain. And then we also simulate the infiltration of water. Simulate the infiltration of water from the surface into the soil. And the soil waters can then be used by the vegetation model, taken up to facilitate further growth in our vegetation model. We hear a bit more detail on the soil model, essentially described by two coupled differential equations. The first one describes the rate of change of soil water over time, and the second one the dynamics of surface water. So here we similarly So here we simulate several phenomena. First one is, of course, precipitation here, like in this turquoise color, is essentially the amount of surface water that is aggregated from the atmosphere model. Then we simulate the water infiltration, just essentially the water which is removed from the surface and infiltrates the soil. Then some water is removed by plant water uptake, can diffuse around. There is some evaporation and drainage happening. We also account for the attraction of the slope of the. Also, account for the attraction of the slope of the terrain. So, the way that we integrate our vegetation model to the soil model is in the following way: this variable B that you see here, this water infiltration term, is essentially computed by summing up all of the plant modules in a given location in space. And this is a measure of the total biomass over a specific location. The higher P is, well, the more water will be infiltrated. Will be infiltrated into the soil, and the more water is infiltrated into the soil, of course, is then available for growth for the plants. And then we have positive feedback, essentially, where more plants can infiltrate more water, thereby supplying themselves with more water in future simulation steps and thereby sort of like a way to express plant cooperation. So this is better. This red term here, this water infiltration term you see at the beginning here, this alpha coefficient. Alpha coefficient, potentially like one parameter won't filter straight in the model. It allows us to simulate different types of soils. For example, a low alpha parameter value would indicate the soil maybe with a thick crust where relatively little water is infiltrating into the soil. And thereby, we have a significant amount of overland water flow. In this case, since In this case, since where the plants are, the infiltration is better, plants essentially act as sinks for the overland water flow. With a high parameter value of alpha, then we have maybe a much faster water infiltration. Plants take up water, they're by removing it, but by this diffusion process in the soil, further water is able to direct it towards the locations for the plants. Let's look maybe at a quick ablation study. Ablation study. So, here on the top row, the rightmost image, it's maybe not so visible on this screen. I don't know how it is with this, like on the screen for the people. It's better. So, like at home, have your laptop. But essentially, here we have yellow-leafed species, which is more precipitation adapted, sort of like localized, aggregates more into the crevices of this terrain. And essentially, you can see sort of like here dynamics of this happening. So, this is a self-organizing process where we start with some kind of. Organizing process where we start with some kind of diffuse localization of these two different plant species. The yellow one is basically the precipitation adapted, the green one, the less precipitation adapted. And after a while, essentially, due to the action of the less precipitation-adapted species, soil water is increased here in these crevices. And that then allows sort of like the yellow species, the more precipitation-adapted species to preferentially localize in these regions. In these regions, and this patterning essentially these dynamics are sent in the naive model without the soil. All right, so our model allows us to simulate microclimates, so there is water gradients in the soil, as well as temperature gradients. And in this case, we simulate the patch of forest with some kind of apex species, like a tall apex plant that's localized here in the center. Then we remove Center, then we remove a patch in our forest, like create the gap essentially throughout the forest, and continue our simulation. And now, instead of sort of like the apic species growing into this patch due to sort of like these climatic gradients, what we observe here is actually that these species which are more adapted towards the edges of the forest can grow into it. So, this is something which is called forest edge effects by foresters, and it's something that you can inherently simulate. You can inherently simulate to account for the microplanet. So, here are a few images that demonstrate that dependent on the density of plants, on the type of plants, how much transpiration is happening, then in the scene we can model different types of clouds. So, this is also illustrated here by this video where we have a jungle scene, maybe something which is similar to what we've seen yesterday, where we take out Haka. To take out to go to an old hacker, where we move rudely a patch of jungle in our simulation, which is the effect that there's no cloud formation above the terrain where no vegetation is happening. But then we can continue sort of like our growth simulation, we grow our forests and restore our climate in this way. So with our model, we are able to simulate a variety of different spatial vegetation patterns. So in the found in the We found in the ecology literature several classes of vegetation patterns, which are, for example, here classified as galv stripe or spot-like patterns, and our model, which expresses essentially these water-mediated interactions with plants, as well as sort of like these above ground spatial and light-mediated interactions, we can reconstruct all of these patterns just by changing one. Changing one parameter in our model. So, here another image that illustrates the capabilities to simulate different vegetation patterns. Here we took photographs of different geographic regions, once Bushmond Niger or peatlands in Siberia, and we tried simply by manually tweaking the parameter values to come up with the vegetation pattern, which looks as similar as possible as the one which we found on the photograph. So, having access, of course, to such a dynamic model of the clouds, you're To such a dynamic model of the clouds, just if you want to have questions, so here we have a draw simulation. And what we see here is we decrease the drought and more and more plants essentially die off until we get arrived at this other place. Here, the same idea, but just a faster drought simulation. So it's like 10 times faster this drawdown here. Here, the plant also died back, but in this case, it's much faster, and we have these vegetation. Much faster, and we have these vegetational patterns that you've seen before. So, here we exchange plant species for slower-growing pine tree species. And in this case, even here, we see these spatial vegetation patterns occurring. Even in the case of slow droughts, if we have fast droughts, then we see sort of like spatial vegetation patterns emerging again as well, similar as we've seen in the previous simulation. And if we had like two different plant species, well, we can have these effects of cooperation, potentially where. Effects of cooperation potentially where we can improve, improve the water infiltration. So, here are fast-growing species and a slower-growing species, in this case, like a more labyrinth-like strike-like pattern emerging. So, dependent on the species composition and like how quickly the drought is emerging, we can actually control here the vegetation pattern which occur in our simulation. So, here an example of a complex scene where we have over 300,000 different plants, like seven different species. All of them are adapted to different climatic conditions, and we just like again perform. Conditions, and we just like again perform this draw scenario where we reduce the annual average precipitation. This case can be seen that sort of like from an originally mixed forest, we sort of like see here these vegetational spatial patterning occurring, as well as sort of like the tipping point occurring at some point, like the whole vegetation simply divisible. So, yeah, one question came to my mind essentially to provide here for provoking idea is sort of like can because sometimes very often we have sometimes or very often we have models which describe the same phenomena they're expressed in different formal languages maybe at different scales the question is can these models somehow be made commensurable can we find some maybe like an optimization strategy or so or machine learning would allow us to essentially to somehow map between different types of models would that be useful to do so one thing is for example here i noticed like with uh like bruised talk yesterday that he for example Windows talked yesterday that he, for example, describes tree architecture in terms of sort of like trophisms or a set of processes, which cannot really self-organization, do we have a modern use of organization? Which means we can be somehow taking these two models and can we make them common durable? Would that be useful? Could we learn something by such a comparative analysis? All right, so I don't have time anymore. So I had a few more slides that I wanted to show basically, which also like was a pre-combustion. But okay, thank you very much. Okay, we didn't have time for a couple of questions. Quick question. Thanks for your beautiful talk. Are there ways to validate the simulations with you show some qualitative comparisons with pictures? Yeah, so indeed there are. And we validated in this paper also like quantitatively. So one thing we validated like this. So, one thing we evaluated like these edge effects. So, there are studies which look essentially at the distribution of species at the edges of the forest. So, that's something that we quantitatively evaluated. And then sort of like these drought experiments, where we see sort of like the slow and the fast draw, that's something that had been also observed, but actually relatively recently by ecologists. And this is something that we evaluated again, like against that as well. So, it is possible, but like a full, let's say, for a evaluation, this is something that probably could be like a number of one for at least a quarter. One for at least a quarter of a couple of papers, okay. So I think this was this question. It just says to follow on from that a bit quickly. So, I guess, I mean, this is very attractive by the way to synthesize a lot of information over a different scale. What could be useful about it is to find areas where the model is sort of in tension with the reality, right? Because you then understand something that was not previously known. Do you think this is sufficient? known do you think this is sufficiently fine-grained in the causal kind of relationship procedures to be able to do that is there an example where you know tension between the model and reality leads to discovery of new biology is that example i mean like new biology like this is like a having difficult question that you're asking but in general yeah i mean like this model can be extended to account for like our processes which To account for other processes, which I know would have to be included to make it more plausible. One thing that comes to mind would be radiance, for example. So, like, it's something which we do not account in this model and something that we theoretically could, for example, like how clouds shade the terrain or basically the trajectory of the sun. Essentially, then we have like a difference between the north and south slope of the mountain, for example. So, these are like obvious examples which would have to be included. And if without this inclusion, we would simulate it where you would. This inclusion, we would simulate it, but you would see this discrepancy. What we are doing is, yeah, that's that. So, let's say you should have longer route. Longer route perhaps could be better for drawing water. Is that something that could be explored there to evaluate, you know, genetics of a route? Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, here we're not remote modeling like roots in a spatial way, but that's something that could be included. And indeed, these kind of experiments could be very much. The app is okay, great. Thank you very much. I wonder how you combine the time scale of your climate model, which is probably short, and the time scale of your growth model is long. Yeah, so I wish the second question is: there seems to be new trees or new species, new plants. How do you transport the seeds and germinate some news? Okay, so short answer is basically like we had like a short time scale simulation. Have like a short time scale simulation for like the atmosphere model, like 10 seconds. So, here we simulate this cloud pattern on this temporal scale, and then we aggregate essentially like we simulate like 15 days or something like this. So, in average days throughout the month, basically, each one is like a different climatic parameter, the average parameter, like the mean and the standard deviation over that. We simulate 15 days essentially, then we compute the average and the precipitation bed, and that's what we use for a monthly iteration on our growth model. So, that's an answer, like you answered to your first question, and then uh. Question and then the seeds and the seeds essentially like we use like ocean kernels with a plant species parameter you can set. So right now we don't account, let's say, like for like water transported seeds. So we only sort of like have like some kind of like universe normal which should be spread essentially around the plant. Okay, thank you very much Pointe.
