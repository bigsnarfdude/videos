From me out very early, so that you have all the background and TCR that you needed for this talk. So just in interest of full disclosure, that the experimental side, they were actually fundamental work because this study involves an experimental vaccine. But I'm not going to talk about anything on these. So just a background on T cells. So Kelly gave a really nice talk on introduction on T cells, but here's the T cell receptor. You actually get co-receptor to go with the T cells. With the T cells, and T cells recognize the anti-context of MHC. So, and it's important to characterize T cells and the T cell receptor because it affects what the T cell will recognize. So, and specifically in the context of disease or vaccine, we want to identify the T cells that are responding to the antigen. We want to call antigen-specific T cells. And this will be important to understanding how we can improve the efficacy of. Understanding how we can improve the efficacy of vaccines. Other current methods for identifying these antigen-specific T cells, they're limited in scope, throughput, specificity, and sensitivity. So the GO standard for identifying antigen-specific T cells is something called a peptide monomer. So it is shown here on the right. You have multiple molecules, and each one has a MHD molecule. Each one has a MHC molecule together with the peptide. And each peptide MHC will then interact with a specific T cell receptor. This is the GO standard, but it is very limited in throughput and scroll because you can't always do this in all context. The second method is also the method our collaborators chose to use, is to simulate the cells in vitro with the antigen and then compare the cells that have shown the activation marker versus cells that do not. Versus self-setting on. And it really matters which activation markers that you use to notify the antigen-specific T cells. And the last method is actually just stimulate with the antigen again, but you compare the T cells before and after to see what changed. This will obviously also be more limited in specific system. So, the goal of this vaccine study is to characterize a T cell response to an experimental vaccine. Vaccine and so the subjects were actually given either two or three doses of vaccine. I'm going to focus on the study where the part or the arm of the child that has multiple, that has three doses of vaccine administered, have one, zero, two, and six. And blood was collected all throughout. So the initial workflow for standard for this study is that they collected the peripheral blood plus among Plus, among nuclear cells, we stimulated these T cells, well, stimulated the entire population of cells with antigen. So it's either the IE4 or PP65, and they collected the fast-forwarded for the live T cells, and then they did the paired single-cell RNA-seq and TSR sequencing. And we were interested in analyzing the transcriptomic of these T cells after these antigen simulation. These energy simulations. So, obviously, hopefully, we will draw some testing plot or UMAP plot and discover something interesting. But that wasn't how it worked out. So, in their experimental design, as I mentioned, they selected by FACS live CD3 positive T cells, and they extracted two fractions from their samples: interferometry and interferon gamma positive fraction. Or a positive fraction. So the positive fraction would be deactivated T cells, which are likely enriched for antigen-specific T cells. And we wanted to compare this interferon gamma negative fraction versus interferon positive fraction and see what is the difference is in the transcriptome and as well as what are the different T-cell subtypes in these two samples. So after you integrate the data together, I'm here coloring. Together, I'm here coloring the T cells, the cells, by interferometric negative versus positive. You can see in the positive fraction, there's a number of clusters of cells that appears to be specific to the interferonal gamma positive fraction. But however, upon closer examination, they all turn out to be artifacts. So one of them seems to be B cells, another population seems to be like Seems to be like a complex of a T Sam and Monoma complex, and another, this last two groups just appears to be monocytes. So they were all just artifacts of the experiment. So then we try a different method and we make use of the TCR sequences this time. So we compared the negative fraction and the positive fraction and look for T cell. Here and look for T cell colon types. So, T cell colon type is just a population of T cells that share the same TCR receptor sequence. And we really focus only on the CE3, alpha, and beta training part of the T cell receptor. So, you can see here that there are the top phonal types that were detected by the assay, which wasn't sequenced very deeply. And most of the TCR recounts were actually assigned. Counts were actually assigned to the first chromotype, the first chromotype. And you can see that frequency of this chromotype actually increased a little bit in a positive fraction, which would indicate this perhaps this chromotype would be antigen-specific to the TCR receptor. And you can, because this is paired data, you can link back the TCR chromaty back to the single-cell RD-C data and look at what is the transcriptomal. What is the transcriptome of these T cells? So, if you map the clonal type 1 back to the single cell RNAC data, you can see a cluster right here in this upper right corner. And the chromaty 2 appears to be in a similar location. And this cluster of cells appears to express activation markers, especially cytokine CCL5, as well as As well as grenzy B and peripheral 1. So those are our classical markers of effective T cells. So perhaps we're on the right track here, and perhaps it's time to write the paper. But our collaborator looked at this and felt something didn't add up because they simulated T cells with the antigen and they were expected a higher fraction of cells to be activated. So then they decided to actually. So then they decided actually to do a time course of just bulk TCR sequencing. And the result of this revealed that actually the kernel type 1 and 2 that we identified were not actually antigen-specific. And the reason is because when we do the time course of TCR sequencing, we can track what is the relative clonal fraction of clonal type 1 and 2 throughout the course of the vaccine. So if you recall, the vaccine was administered at So if you recall, the vaccine was administered at month zero, month two, and month six. But during that time, this colonal type was actually decreasing in relative colonial fraction, which is opposite what I expected. So if the T cell is responding to the vaccine, those T cells, they should increase in relative fraction as opposed to decrease. So then we'll have to go back to the drawing board. This is where we had a uncomfortable conversation. Uncomfortable conversation with the collaborator that, well, we messed up, let's try something else. And now, something else is analyzing this time towards CCR data, a little bit more closely, in order to identify what are the different clones in the CCR receptor, time towards CCR receptor sequencing data, and which of those clones are actually the ones that are responding to the vaccine based on how the temporal trajectory of how those T cells expand. Of how those T cells expand or contract over time. So, we actually didn't need a complicated method. What was complicated here was trying to find a normalization of the data to make it look as normal as possible so that a fast algorithm like k-means would run in a reasonable time. Because you have ten thousand tens of thousands of uh these trajectories that you want to cluster together. Uh so uh I w I just thought about k means because we we optimized our conflicts. We will optimize our computational speed. But you can see here that I clustered these clonal types trajectories into 100 clusters. It's definitely over partitioning the data. But you can see these are the non-responsive clonal types where the trajectory does not correlate with the time at which the vaccine was administered. And we were able to identify five clusters of Clusters of T cell clonal types where it was increasing in clonal fraction over time after each of the vaccine, and they can be further split into a durable response and a transient response where the T cell would expand and then contract shortly after the vaccine was administered. So then we can look at more closely what these two different groups of durable response T cells and then transient response T cells and learn about Transient response T cells and learn a bit more about what the biology is. So, if you aggregate all the clone durable T cells together, you can see their increase in frequency and stay at a relatively high clone of fraction, whereas the transient cells, they go up and they come back in. You can analyze the TCR sequences by clustering the sequence together and come up with a motif for those TCR sequences. And many of those motifs are actually known. That are known to respond to the specific antigens that we use to stimulate the T cells, which further validated the fact that we actually identified the right antigen-specific T cells. It also turns out that most of the cells that are antigen-specific were C V A positive T cells for this particular vaccine. And among the durable And among the durable clones, they were predominantly seen for positive, whereas the transient clones were predominantly seen for negative. And we can also map this data back to the single-cell RNA-seq data and look for transferronic differences between these different populations. And we can see a lot of activation markers that are most highly expressed in the durable clones as opposed to. in the durable clones as opposed to uh the transient clones. So you might be wondering, okay, we just did k-means on the two-drag clustering. Is there something more sophisticated that it can do? So there is. And can we recall that k-means that doesn't actually take advantage of the fact that the data is temporary has time dependency. So here is a well-known formulation for k-means. Formulation for k-means from a Bayesian perspective. So you can derive k-means from a nature of normal model, and you would just do iterative conditional optimization in order to re-derive the k-means algorithm. So you have n samples, you want to cluster into k-clusters. But if you want to introduce a time component, first you can add, you can use a Gaussian process model for that. You would introduce You would introduce a dimension. The time dimension, we have J time points as well as a time variable because the time might not occur at regular intervals. You will replace the mean with a function and you can place a Gaussian process prior on that function. And using this kernel, using this covariance function shown here, the double exponential convolution function, you're encoding an assumption that these curves should be smooth. Be smooth. And using this approach, you can actually improve the clustering of the trajectory data just a little bit. So we're still, this is still ongoing work, but the preliminary simulation data definitely looks very encouraging. So you can simulate just curves with different ground truths where the black is the ground truth. And you can see that k-means can after mix different trajectories together and affect which. Trajectories together, and which would affect its model estimate of what that trajectory will look like for a particular cluster. Whereas, if you use a K Gaussian process model that we developed, you can see that it can much more accurately estimate the underlying trajectories. But there's obviously still ongoing work that needs to be worked on with regarding this only because we derived the EML for this. We derived the EM algorithm for this, but there would be times where we descend to the local minima, but we want to do additional work to make sure we get as close to the global minima as possible. So in summary, cell compositions in single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell THCR might not be always quantitative due to experimental reasons that are beyond your control. And you probably can't correct for that. You probably can correct for that using a computational system method. And we can identify NGS-specific T cells by modeling the temporal trajectories in longitudinal block GCR data. K-munus will actually do quite well, but this will require a lot of manual work, a lot of tuning. So we're working on methods for improving this trajectory clustering using KLC processes, as well as an automated selection method for identifying the clusters that are responsible. Identifying the clusters that are responsive to the vaccine. And after you identify the engine-specific T cells using box equipment data, you can link it back to the single-cell RNA seq data using the CDR3 sequence as the barcode in order to understand the single-cell transcriptome of these cells. That's it. I'd like to thank our collaborators and just shout out that we're looking for people to join a lab, especially post-doc. We'll have funding to do that. Funding to do that, but we don't have any candidates. Thank you. So in addition to looking at the um TCL uh sequencing data workloads. Sequencing data, what the single-cell transcriptomic data, other than T cell, do you see changes in other cell types as well? Other cell types in like B cells and in terms of composition. Right, right. In this data, they were actually interested in specific T cells, so they pre-selected for T cells. So we don't want to get access to the other, to the B cells rather than use. Do the to the B cells rather than the cell pipes? So, in a so the single cell pharmace is just the T cells? It's just for the T cells. Yeah, because the B cells were analyzed separately in a different study. So with single cell TCR you won't be able to capture any of the rare T cells. It's you just don't capture enough cells. But if you do bulb TCR sequencing, you can actually sequence this the the your product very, very deeply. Product very, very deeply, and we were able to detect hundreds of thousands of TCR, unique TCR columns from our data. So, if you if you want if you're really interested in the T SAR diversity, I don't think single cell is the way to go. If you would be doing bulk T SAR sequencing, but then you can always do single-cell TCR and then link the data together. Questions for now, so let's go ahead and have three more. So we still have healthy time for discussion. If there's any questions for any of today's speakers, any burning questions I didn't get to ask through Slack, go ahead and chat them out. Otherwise, I want to propose a topic of discussion that I think has kind of been percolating a little bit today. Of impercolating a little bit today, which is what are the things that we think are commonly done that shouldn't be done? Single status analysis, sort of challenging the status quo. So we've heard, I guess, one thing that comes to mind, these could be things that we have potential alternatives for. They could also be things that we know that they're not ideal. That we know that they're not ideal, but we don't have a good solution for, so that could be a possible topic to work on. But one example is what Melissa has talked about, which is not over-interpreting gene set enrichment analyses, and that actually she has a proposed solution for that. But what are some of the other ideas that people have been thinking about with their pet peeves? At the beginning of a lot of single-cell analyses, people still just set hard thresholds on the number of UMIs and say anything below this is debris, anything above that's a doublet. I'm only taking things in this good range. There has to be a better way to do that, right? Eric, with protein, you can do manual gating because you know I some cell only expresses through protein markets. There are also some double-edged scientific internet one. Right. So I learned that so recently there have has been papers. So recently there has been papers that try to study the mitochondria RNA. Mitochondria gene expression in single cell disease. But I think in the old days these genes were not exact. Yes, I think that means important. Analyzing those information may give you interesting biology. And I think that will require knowledge about mental health, but many people don't have that. Right, right, right, right, right. So you're saying most commonly just throw that information away. Just throw that information away. Right. And maybe you should. So I want to echo on that. Actually, some of my collaborators are thinking about dedicating a certain proportion of their weeds just for mitochondria. Because before they think they're garbage, but actually now we do like the other, in the other talk, right? So we can actually, they do provide some information, for example, the cell lineage, right? So it does tell me where the cell comes from or what cells are similar to each other. Just based on the pounder. To each other just based on the 100 meetings. So that's actually like, I think also, like, in terms of experimental design and protocol development, I do think that's like, you know, you don't have to spend too much, actually. Or you reach the microcontroller chains. Yeah, and another thing I think I want to mention, maybe as a preview of my talk tomorrow, is the double definition. I think it's everywhere in single-subdata analysis. Variance in terms of data analysis. People have to infer latent variables from the data, but then infer the associations between latent variables and genes as a second step using the same data. It's double different. I don't think it's avoidable because people have to analyze data in this way since we don't observe as many variables as we want to. But how can we make sure that the double didn't give us too many false positives? That's what my talk. Relatives, that's what my talk will be about tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. I look forward to that. I guess maybe going off Kelly's comment about thresholding, I have this battle with my students and my collaborators where in addition to that kind of thresholding, this idea that a gene is expressed if it's not zero, I don't know if other people have that sort of issue, I'm so. Have that sort of issue, and so they basically take these thresholds based on the number of expressed genes. But a lot of my collaborators get upset because just because it's not a zero read count doesn't necessarily mean it's expressed, right? And there's a whole spectrum which we understood really clearly with bulk sampling that, you know, there's a whole spectrum of expression. It's a distribution. But now it's almost like there's a digital perspective where it's like it's not zero there, but it's expressed. Not zero, therefore it's expressed. And I think that's not really using the data efficiently and thresholding really maybe aggressively or too conceptually, but one of those extremes. Yeah, another thing.
