The name is a visual. Where are you finding recording? Yeah. I did press I press record here. I was saying Ah, that's my image. Oh, and there's, I learned a couple interesting things about the way the system works. Apparently, the boards have sensors underneath it. So if you ever are looking up there and you're like, hey, that camera is not doing, you can either write or just touch the board and it won't blind you. So if you go up and try, give it a try now. So, I don't know, tap off, supposedly. Try tap. Interesting. I will not be able to watch the screen. So if something you can tell me when you say nice. It generally does a pretty good job, especially if you're writing. If you write and then you do a lot of walking back and forth, it'll sometimes get confused. Don't worry about it. It'll help you hard. Okay. All right. Our next talk is back to R. Jacobson on Lip. Next talk is by Mura Jacobson on the ellipses of motivic common photography. Okay. So it's great to be in Pan. I thank the organizers for not me. And okay, this is an introductory talk to motivate commodity theory for people who do not and have never worked in motivic committer theory. Have you ever worked in this area? Feel free to leave the room. I will not be able to surprise you today. I mean, it's really an introduction. I mean, it's really an introductory talk because we thought that since we have two different people with these two different kinds of backgrounds here, it's good to say something generic about these words. And later this week, there will be many talks which use some ideas from machinery cometh theory. So, okay, so there will be an introduction. And also, the notes, my notes start with sorry for, and then I can phrase what I wrote there. So sorry for something I'm not sure. Thing I'm not sure. Oh, just sorry for not naming theorems. Yes, because it's a so this subject is a product of work of many people. It began with the work of Merle Wyvotsky, Ceciline Friedlander, Evine Hopkins and many others contributed a lot. And every time I say something, it's probably a theorem of some people, and I don't want people to say every time it's a theorem too. These are the main people who contributed to foundations and then work with them. Okay, so let's start. And feel free to interrupt and ask questions and discuss. It's an hour to ask all your questions about material content. Okay, so in general, it's the material theory is an environment to study invariance of schemes, primarily smooth schemes, but also nowadays people use this to approach more general schemes. Approach more general schemes. And so, mainly by other invariants, such as, so, my main example of an invariant would be algebraic K-theory, but we could also, yeah, so interesting and rich invariance such as so and okay. Um so So since I chose key theory, it will be my motivation, and I'll say what I mean by this. And so we'll start with unstable motivated countries theory. Okay, so what do we have here? So I said I want to have algebraic K theory as a main example of my invariants. And so algebraic K theory is an invariant of schemes, let's say, built out of vector portals. out of vector bundles. And so let's say you fix a base scheme S. You can think of a few, but you don't have to. And so K-theory for me is a space. And K-theory, algebraic K-theory groups are the homotopy groups of this space. And I like to define it in the short Define it in the shortest way as a sheaf. So it's a sheaf of spaces that want to find things. So it's a sheaf. Such that quantify things, it gives something that resembles k theore. So it's you take the group. You take the group where the vector bundles on X and you apply group completion to it as a model in spaces where it's vector derivative. So in K0 it's group completion on vector models of task or and in general this kind of a space. Okay, so people love it, love K-theory in general because it appears in different parts of mathematics, in arithmetics and non-differential topology and where not. And so let's say. And so let's say we wanted to have an environment where this thing leads nicely. And so, what we observe, okay, oh, maybe the last, this equation here, just to make sure I just k of x is vector x. So this is a space that you've written here? Yeah. So, okay, so normally let's think k0. Yes. So k0 is you take vector balance of trasomorphism and you apply group completion. And I'm kind of Completion. And I'm kind of using in practice what Peter was talking about in theory, and well, roughly speaking, that you can also do the whole idea of algebra is that you can do algebraic operations to homotopy types or to spaces. So I take the group for it, vector bundles, and isomorphism between them. I think of it as a space, and it is a monoid in spaces, mutophonoid in spaces with respect to direct sum. respected or its sum. And abstract theory tells me, that I can, it makes sense to speak about group completion in spaces. And what it does is on phi zero, it does what you would expect. So phi zero of this thing, phi zero permutes with group completion. And on higher common to the groups, it does something interesting. And okay, so maybe the advertisement for geometrically minded people is a function. Geometrically-minded people is one thing why people care from a geometric perspective is that rationalism of K0 gives you child groups. Just so that I understand, sorry to interrupt. I always lived in a world where K1 and higher multiple groups. K of x. Very simple impossible to understand. Yeah, k1 is possible, k higher is impossible. No, sure. But so this is the actual definition of the space k of x. This seems very something that I can wrap my mind on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why, I mean, okay, so yes, one thing is to define something and the other is to compute, right? So when I define it this way, it is clear what it is on pi 0, it is computable what it is on pi 1, but this definition. And uh but this definition does not give you an instruction how to compute high quantity. So computing is as hard as it was, and defining I think this way is much easier than what I saw for the first four years. You often see that as vector X is just the distro A where X is vector A and then you take the coverage. Just what you said. So, just to even more basic, just to parse it, so X is a scheme, you know, kind of missing that somewhere. And then I should probably, yes, but you can see who X is, but anyway. Well, it's an element of X. It's a function process. And I should probably flip the two lines here. So then you define KOX to space by that line, and then you put Kiox to be my. Well, I want to. Okay, it's more. Okay, look, I wrote a correct sentence, but it's a sheaf. But it's a sheaf that only five schemes. Yes, and k groups are responsible groups. The fact that k0 of x is what we just said, the usual definition for arbitrary schemes, which don't happen to be fine, does not extend to. Sorry, I should. Yes, I sorry, so sorry. I was sorry. K0 is. Find zero input completion computes. So, for a fine schemes, it is the usual thing. For non-affined schemes, it's the more interesting thing, where you want to impose additivity in short exact sequences. So, for non-defined schemes, in K0, you would have relations like if you have a short exact sequence of two bundles, then you'd want the middle thing to be equal to the sum of the two things. So it's more relations than on the bind schemes. Times okay, so let's say if there's not any way to find K theory, I'm happy to let you know. If you have any other more comfortable ways, that's good. I think whatever ways you have, you think of it as some. You have, if you saw it before, there were some groups, and I'm telling you, there are like homotopy groups of space. And then, And then we may wonder: okay, so if you want to have a playground where K-theory can be studied, then we'd wonder: okay, which properties does K-theory have, which we can then impose in that. So, and okay, K-theory has many interesting properties, but maybe one notable thing is that I said it's a sheep, meaning the risky sheet, but actually, K-theory has more descent with respect to more. So, descent with respect to more curves. So, it's a okay, so it's a Zariski sheaf by my definition slash by Ethereum, if any other definition. But it's also a sheaf in a big, in topology called Proverbs called Misnevich topology, which links between Zariski and the Tal, but so Kesira is not in the Tal she. So this is this Danish topology, which so I suggest that you think of it as a topology in between, which we will be working in, let's say, for the purpose of this motivation. So I don't know. One way to think about it is that here so what here local rings are for, here you have enzyme local rings. Okay, and covers are certain kinds of telecommunications. Okay, and so another feature of key theory is that, so when x is smooth, and so I said you can take any base, let's say base is regular, then k theoret has homotopy invariance, meaning that meaning that the value on x times a1 is the same as the value of x. So these are two of many wonderful properties of k-theory. But so we choose this to establish rules in our playground. What is the meaning of x? Theory where does the fixed sorry x multiplied by x. Sorry, X smooth S scheme. So the A1 hematic invariance property of key theory breaks when you have some similarities, for example mean potents. It's once as long as your regular. I forgot who was asking. Okay, so using this, we can then define a metubic space. To be something of which we want k theory to be an example of. So it's a functor from smooth schemes to spaces. So it's a sheet which is which has this properties. So which is a one homoto coverant. So So there's only one invariant in the sex. So it can mean that you have such an isomorphism for any small x. Any one invariant is new. And okay, so we have on one hand we have We have let's say we so this is something inside all functors we have so this subcategory of such functors so so pre-shifts with these two properties Okay, notation for three sheets on smooth schemes with these two properties and this is denoted H of S. So this is the unstable Now, okay, you can think of it living inside, but the okay. So, first of all, before I get here, let me just say that the natural gadgets to consider would be, let's say, you can just take a smooth scheme and go here by gamma embedding, or you could just take spaces and consider constant sheaves. So they all live. So they all live, so they're functors from here to there. And okay, but the interesting stuff happens here. And so what's interesting is that, okay, this is an subcategory, but actually we want to go there. And this functor, so this is called motivic localization. And this is very hard to compute. So the issue is that if we only considered this condition, so only the sheap condition, then it would just be shifification. And shiftification, we know shiftification is the cheapest. If we only had this condition, okay, it's like if we only wanted k12 invariance, this would be k1 maximization functor. It's not the same thing as geification, but there is an explicit formula how to make something artificially one apparent. There is a formula and it should be good. But when we want to do both things together, But when we want to do both things together, the nice thing is to think about it as like you should apply this placing many times or you can think of it as abstract, but there is no nice formula in general. So this is an article, some hat jobs. Yeah, so localization, yeah, just attract. That's attracted. So, and the fact that this is. So, and the fact that this is hard to compute makes. So, on one hand, here we have objects like invariants we are interested in, but it makes it rather hard to compute things here because we'd want to go from here. That's the intention. So, then the trick becomes to compute. Let's say you compute this thing. Okay, so let's see. How is there some philosophical reason why we're interested in the smooth? Yes, so actually a priori, so many things are much easier to do for smooth schemes, but nowadays there there are people working on extending these ideas to singular schemes and Elden in his talk will tell us something about this. Tell us something about this. I don't want you to think that automatic methods only work for some schemes, but I will only be talking about them. Philosophical, I mean I know practical reasons, like just easier to say but uh Mark do it's like it's like declining all the topic theorists start in the finite sense. Theory started in the finite sense. It's like the minimal thing you need. Start extending in different directions, you're starting to make choices about what you want. So that color, I think, basically is invisible. Sorry. Maybe use the other Maybe use the other no no no I'll just use it I will not use that colour because I was surprised that erasing makes mix Okay so an application is for example so now we have created like a common place for schemes and multiple types to work together and so the nice thing is that we can now represent some stuff in this category. So page So, for example, let's say we care about vector bundles. We better assume for the purpose of this topic we do care about vector bundles because they all look here. But, okay, so we'd like maybe to ask: okay, so in topology, vector bundles are represented. Presented in the homotopy category by Crossmanians, and we may ask: okay, is this true here? So, this is supposed to replace for us the unstable homotopy category in topology. So, we can ask the same question. And in general, if you take all smooth schemes, so the answer is no because the A1 invariance property will not hold in general. But if you restrict yourself to F1, So that's the first reasonable restriction to ask, and luckily this works. So I should have not used the same notation. So let me say that R denotes frank R vector bundles modula. So this thing becomes isomorphic, so in bijection with taking homotopy classes in this category of maps between from X to the infinite continuum. Okay, so this is true when S is So this is true when S is regular with some extra condition like so an example would be a field or integers so nice basis okay so this Um okay, so uh this is something that we would have so we have a what is H of S? So uh it's the thing we defined unstable material. So uh class yeah maps there Phi zero of the mapping space in this Okay, so this is something we would want if we wanted to study vector bundles using metamic methods. We'd want something like that. And likely we have something like that. And so our K-theory friend, so far we know that K-theory having these properties is, so K-theory as an invariant is an object here. But as it was proved in the original paper by Merle and Robotsky, it is also represented in a more explicit way in this category. So we can think of we could just take we could take maps from X to K theory. This would be a tautology. X to k theory, this would be a tautology. And the statement is that actually we can replace it with something much more explicit, maybe with the infinite Brusmanium times integers. So in this world, so this means that once you impose these conditions, so once you apply this functor, then K-theory becomes indistinguishable from something much more complete, like. Which makes us. Which makes us, it doesn't resolve all the problems about K-theory, but it makes us well you should think of it as stable vector bundles. Last one you still for F? No, X loops with S. And S so S regular only continues. Regular old projects. How is the internet crossmane? Well, you take, you have maps from crossmanian, let's say, of R planes in some AM, and you have a map to R plus one planes in AM plus one, and you take colon plan. Correct, so it's an individual colon, and in particular, not a scheme, right? Yes, it's an int scheme. Yes, it's an int scheme, right? But in schemes live there as columns. So we're sorry, but the Z is the rank or the degree of the vector part? Rank. Okay. Um okay, so this is where you're not. So that makes the C cross grad1 and infinity the k-series spectrum We can then later build a spectrum out of taking space KKK ring we can later so it's a space it's not the same thing as a spectrum sure but if you stabilize it somehow or I don't know Yes, you can then later have a Mativic spectrum, which has its spaces being K-theory spaces. Okay. And they will be this Z cross. Yeah. Well, so let me just write one more word. So I don't want you to... Okay, a mistake I would make if I were looking at this, I could maybe think, okay, so now K theory is the same thing as Mania? Like, no. So basically, okay, in other words, I want to say. In other words, I want to say that A series is this thing in, so this is an equivalence in this category where we have made artificially many things to be equivalences, right? When we applied this localization function, we said that we force these equivalences to be equivalences for A1, so max from X plus A1 to X to be equivalences. So we have first forced many things to be equivalences, and then we Forced many things to be currencies, and then we're like, oh, cool, now this hard thing is the same as this. So I don't want you to be more tricked into believing that K-theory became simple, but it gives certain more tools to study it when you cure it. So another way to say the same thing is the K-theory is already mobile. It's already has these properties and the right-hand side doesn't. And the right-hand side doesn't. You have to apply this ununderstandable functor of both to the right-hand side to make this equation. Yes, you're right. Thank you. Thank you for clarifying this. Yes. Thank you. Okay, my friends. Now when all this has been defined, the problem is that in this wonderful category, it's actually pretty hard to compute something. And it will still be hard once I improve it. But at least. But at least we need more tools to be able to do something. And so the tool that we want to impose is: let me erase this. So an analog slash generalization of point-query duality classically is a so-called ideal duality. And that's what we want to have. Okay, so we want to go to stable motivation here. And let's say our motivation is that, okay, it's pretty embarrassing, but I always say that our motivation is to make computations. I personally don't know how to make computations. There are people in this room, however, and at this conference that made amazing computations using these tools. So I'm just a marketer. Market interest. So we want to have a computational tool called the T-duality and think of it as some big generalization of concrete duality and topology for common terms. Okay? And so what it means in practice is that In practice, is that when f is, so let's say x is a smooth proper scheme, like a projective scheme, so then you want to say that it has a dual. So we want it to have a dual. And the dual, well, we know what it should be if it makes sense. So by So, by looking at topology and making more thinking, we and by we I mean people who oh I forgot to put IU because people created here. Okay. Okay, we meaning Jeff Aguin others know that it's supposed to be, if such a thing exists, so it's supposed to be a time space, and I'll say in a sec what it is, of negative Negative of the tangent bundle, like relative tangent bundle, being the relative potential. Okay, so this minus, we will get back to this in a second, but so the Tom space is a geometric analog of the one-point compactification in topology. So you define it for any vector bundle complex to be the shape quotient of your vector bundle. The shape quotient of your vector bundle by the complement of the zero section. So V and A. Quotient, what category are we living in? So sheaf quotient. Sheep quotient. So it's just a space. So this guy lives in, let's see, so I believe lives in each of us. So it makes sense to go backwards. So whenever you have a vector bundle, in topology it makes sense to speak about one-point computifications. Their analog in the geometrical world is to take the quotient by the complement of the zero section. And if there was such a thing as taking some spaces of negative boundaries, taking term spaces of negative bundles, then that thing would be it would make sense to say that it's a double x. But we need to be able to say to take minus so then we need to like improve our category so that there are terms bases of negative modules. And luckily it turns out that you don't Turns out that you don't need to do too much, you don't need to add in some formal way all of these guys, but it's enough to just take the trivial break one bundle. So enough to make to invert the tone space of the trivial bundle. So this is then just the quotient of A1 by A1 minus A1 by the complement and sorry, I don't want X. X is just S. Okay, so this gadget is called T, abbreviated as T. So it's just a quotient of a. So that's a quotient of a1 by a1 minus 0 over s, but you can get s. And this has a nicer interpretation in our category. So we can think of it as so we can show that it's in so in up to a one promotion is the same thing as uh prime o point to let's say pointed to infinity. Because what is happening here is that we have A1 minus 0. So, what does the quotient do? Quotient is this push-out of the embedding of A1 minus 0 into A1 and sending it to a point. But in our world, the point is equivalent to A1, option equivalents, right? And you'd get this equivalent to a push-out. That is equivalent to a push-out gluing to A1, so long A1 along 0, you get that thing with A1 equivalent. So in this world, A1 equivalent to A1. You're confused. Tell me what you're confused about. What do we mean by this quotient and this category? We're going to destroy them in the populace and stuff. One more time. Hard to imagine that, but if you also use a Myoria Taurus sequence, the objective completion of the would be module all the height of the plane at infinity that's there, and then it's maybe easier to say modulo, what do we Sorry, when we say modulo, what do we have for the set, a topological subset? This is a quotient as topological subset spaces. Or is it a group? Is it a group GM? You mean quotient is a pre-sheaf? You're talking about maps into those objects. So the map into this quotient, it's maps into A1 module, the maps explained in A1 module. For any X. That's what it is, it's a pre-sheet. It's a pre-sheet motion, and then you ask for your localization. No, no, no, please do. I think you explained the... I love that you have a differentiative. So you want to know what's the value of this pre-sheet on some u. Well, it's maps of u into a1, which is functions on u. Module over maps, which lay into a 1 minus 0, which are the nowhere vanishing function. Whichever has nowhere vanishing function. Okay, that's a set. You're happy with that set, right? It's maybe not the nicest set you can imagine, but it's a well-defined set. Well-defined pre-sheave of sets. That's what that thing is. Then take the image of that pre-sheave of sets under this local causation vector mediation. Can you make people understand that this is the prejective line? Understand that it's a projective line? Yeah, so another way to say it's a projective line, you have like excision. So A1 modulo A1 minus 0 is the same as P1 modulo P1 minus 0. P1 minus 0 is just another A1 neighborhood of infinity. So infinity, P1 minus infinity, is the same as P1 modulo the A1 neighborhood of infinity because A1 is fragmented. So it's P1 modulo. So it's p1 module infinity. I'm going to take a set module, an element of the set, you're just pointing the set by that element. P1 pointed by infinity, which is the same as... I think what's slow, that really helps. I think what's just to apologize for myself a little bit, is what's slow is passing from thinking about spaces to the son topology, I mean, it takes a vector bundle module. You take a vector bundle module of a vector bundle minus the zero section, that's all topology. Because you're thinking of it as topological spaces, but that's not really the complete problem. Thank you. Okay, this is a much better explanation. And Mark, we need to hire you for one more step. But in topology, we are honestly taking vector bundle minus vector bundle minus the zero section. No. No. No. This bundle module of the sphere bundle. Or you take the vector bundle, module, the complement of an openness. But you take the vector bundle and then you have the disk bundle, you have the open disk bundle, take its complement. That's the time space. It's the one-point compact condition. It's the same thing. So you don't like to oil the minus the zero section and model. Zero station model by open subspace of the space, it's not usable. But you could also take the projected completion of the vector and call plus a trivial bundle, modulo the hyper point at infinity, and you're just expanding out the hyper point at infinity by excision as it's so important to view in algebraic geometry, so you're taking that. I think I didn't understand one of the errors that you just raised. The one from smooth skin operators from the smooth scheme is to give you the space, sweet space, appreciative sets. Pre-sheaf of sets. I can consider homes into X. So this is a pre-sheaf of sets, and in particular, pre-sheaf of spaces. Read spaces. This is what you were saying now, that you take quotients of sheaves. You have given one of these vector bundles, this is V, you take the sheet of sets. And you take quotients of sheaves of sets, and you get this V mag V mass of sets. But the other thing is, you could also. But the other thing is you could also, this localization left data joint, so it commutes. If you wanted to, you could take the LMO to both sides and then take the quotient. That's harder to understand. It's going to be hard to understand that from something going one way or the other. As long as it compiles. I wanted to say, so there was one more step. So there is one more step which in this chain of equivalences. So one way, thank you to Mark for explaining is that this quotient can be thought of in this category as a projective line. But also, this may be more abstract, but I need to say it for future purposes. Is that if you also contract the other A1, then Then you have a pushout of P1 minus 0 along point. So then Okay, so then this becomes the same thing as suspension of A1 on A0, so suspension of and so we need this intuition because So we like to think of this as like a topological circle, a simplicial circle. And so this has an algebraic circle, meaning that there was this realization functor that Vicky mentioned, and realization will take this topology to an actual circle, but for us, they're different things. Yeah, sometimes it's a little funny to think that the gm is the a1 minus 0. That's the gm. And the point is, if you take the homotopy push-out of some space, mapping to a point and then mapping to a point, that's the suspension. I'll do this. In there, because we have two A1s, or that's the same as two points. Okay, so same, same thing. Same thing, same thing. Okay, so if you have never seen this kind of stuff before, it looks like weird magic. But mainly, okay, so this, why this is all, we need different incarnations, because basically for us, this gadget, different incarnations, plays the same role, like this tensoring with this thing. Is tensoring with this thing is the same thing as tensoring with S1 and topology, aka suspension. So topology, knowledge for geometry. And so you can think of P1 as this quotient as an analog of a circle, but actually it itself decomposes into two different. Itself decomposes into two different kinds of circles. And but I mean, if okay, if this part is harder to imagine, you can ignore it. It's good enough if you understand at least some presentation of it, because what we do know is, so we consider this stable material is taking our unstable category. Is taking our unstable category and making this thing to be tensor-invertible. So this is make it invertible with respect to the so there is a symmetric minor structure given by smashed product spaces. And so classically, you would take the unstable homotopy category and make suspension invertible. Make suspension invertible, so making smashing with a sphere invertible, and here we make tensoring smashing with this thing, whatever form you choose, so is it reasonable to call the elements of this thing spectra? Mativic spectra, yes, yes, thank you. So objects here are called mutivic objects. Not the same thing as spectrum topology. But so who will be? So these guys are representing generalized homology theories of smooth schemes. So they represent generalized homology theories of school. Also schemes which have the properties that we have in close. So this narrative descent, a one-invariance, and this property that I tried to motivate, a tier duality, meaning that they treat when x is proper, they treat When x is more proper, they treat this thing as the tool of x. Okay. And so more explicitly, well, so why we need to, I mean, given an object here, how to define a cohomology theory, well, there is a mixed, like a formula, just like a topology, given a spectrum, how we define a cohomology theory. So there is a formula, and it will. Homology theory. So there is a formula and it will be bibrated in the sense that you can distinguish these two spheres to get two different kinds of things. And if you have, so E, if E is a metabolic spectrum, then you can consider five-grade homology theory out of it, defined as, well, you want to take homes in this category. Between so the image of X, so X is any small scheme. So the image of X here will be a suspension spectrum. Or, I mean, just think of X. So this is just the image of X here. So what happens with X when you stabilize, when you invert P1, you The image of X will be this P1 suspension spectrum. And here, well, so you want to play, so to get by grading, you want to play with these kind of spheres. So you want to take a bunch of these S1s, like simplicial spheres, these guys, and a number of GMs and And tensor stands for special form. And here is speech form. So the formula itself is not so important, in my opinion. What you need to understand is that an object here gives a generalized homology theory on smooth schemes and you can play with, so you could just take a homology theory, but you can play with great. We can play with grading, two gradings on this two. What's the valid taboo? Uh maybe just I was just thinking it tells you that what's the difference. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Yes, so I could, if I smash x with P1 and increase this guy by two and this guy by one, I'll get the same dual, do you have some dual property here? Brings the text dual. That terms already do of the cohomology of the homology. Is the rank cohomology a theory that can be handled in this? Outside characteristic P. Very good. So not when it is the one homotopy invariant. So not yeah, in characteristic zero. Yeah, incorporates zero points. Okay, and is then this by grading in a way related to how to compensation? No, it's it's saying that the wrong homology is wrong. So it's not the same thing, Shashi. So now that the PQ decomposition has a multi-beak formula so much better. One more abstract thing I wanted to say is that just like a small comment is that so this thing is related to what we started with. Similarly, like in topology, you'd have infinite suspension and infinite food space. So here it's the same thing, just instead of the circle, we have a projective line called this object, and then we do have similar kind of pointers and correlations. Kind of pointers and relations, but the main difference, and actually, so given this construction, you can get back the same things in topology. If you replace like smooth schemes with smooth manifolds and this manage descent with Meyer-Gutori's property, A1 to multi-invariance with the multiple invariance, and P1 with S1, you just get the spectrum topology. So it is analogous in some sense. But so, what I want But so, what I wanted to argue in the last five minutes is that you get much harder to make computations here, but also you get richer invariants and more things. And so an example, which will be used numerously in this conference, can already be seen at the level I'll tell you in a sec. So while this makes sense for any maturity spectra, so generalized homology theories like K-theory and so on, let's say, let's for the last five minutes forget about different spectra and just look at the motivic sphere spectrum. So just taking function of the point. Point. So let's say we only care about that mapping space from the unit of the category to itself. So suspension spectrum of point to itself. So classically it would be looking at mapping space between sphere spectrum and itself. And And um sorry. Okay. And um okay. So if so let's if s was so the closest thing to topology is to take spectrum of complex numbers, then so you get the same thing as classically. So then this start. So start. So stark becomes the same thing as just looking classically at the mapping space from sphere to itself. So for complex numbers, we have all the stable homotopy groups of spheres encoded in material homotopy world. But so the end And more generally, SH embeds into SH of complex numbers. But so, more generally, so when S is a K where K is any field, we get something more interesting. Namely, okay, I can try to advance so in general. So just like for classical stable homotopy groups of series, we don't kind of answer for material stable homotopic groups of series. However, we know that, so pi zero is missing. Yes. And so on the right, I want to write something that, so classically it would be just integers, right? Stable by zero. Pi zero, classically, by zero of the maps from sphere to itself, it's stable by zero, it's just integers. But here, and that's what will be used numerously in the talks this week, we get not just integers in general, but the That's the Groton-Dequitt group of work. So the Groton-Dequitt group of polygic forms. So you take non-degenerate polytic forms on your field, trisometry, consider them as a monoidal respective rexum, and make it a group artificially rather than its construction. So put out a format. This is literally any field type. Yes. It's still characteristic zero. No, no. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Characteristic two, you have to use symmetric linear. Yes. Symmetrical in your sorry. Let me erase symmetric. I want it to be true if you ever. Okay, so in particular, already for real numbers, you will get here something more interesting than integers, and integers. And so the idea that will be okay, I don't want to so this idea will be has been recently used a lot by Mark and by Kirstie Wicker and Jessipas and Pantas and many more people to nowadays to bring classical computations in enumerative geometry, which were computations over different fields, to bring them, so to give as an answer a quadratic form. Answer a quadratic form rather than a different number or different fields. So they will tell you how to actually apply it and use it and show you beautiful stuff. I wanted in the last minute to tell you, okay, this is a highly non-trivial result, so it's not obvious at all. If you have a question why on Earth podcast forms, that's a very valid question. I have not told you, and so it's Ethereum. It's not a formal conclusion of anything we see, but I would like to just But I would like to just sing the last minute to give you at least a map. So a map in that direction. So how given a quadratic form to get something secret? So a quadratic form, a generator in the quick group would be a form given by Ax squared. And I want to associate to some map from the suspension spectrum of a point. What was it? Not sure what is it? Sorry. Anyway, so I want to give something, something here is like, okay, it's a mapping space, but like connecting components of a mapping space. So I'd like to have a MM from here to one, right? So, and given a colour, okay. So, okay, these are some theory spectra, but they're built out of taking. Built out of taking many times suspension with respect to P1. So it's enough if I just gave you a map from P1 to itself, this would induce a map between spectra. And so the map that I suggest you to take is if you have coordinates x and y, homogeneous coordinates, send them to coordinates x, k, y. And so the form Axis, the form here. The form given by A, I pressured A, it's K. Yes, so this corresponds to Axel. Okay, so this generator A here, where A is an element V is sent to just the very concrete map of projective lines itself, which scales one of the. Which scales one of the homogeneous coordinates, and this induces a map from the P1 spectrum to the speed one spectrum on the point to itself, and this gives n element. And it's not clear why it's an isomorphism, and it will not become clear in the remaining minuscule minutes and software, which is a deep result and used in interesting ways in some of the topics. Is there any questions? Well, maybe just to parse what you just said, try and parse what you just said in Morton's sort of simple terms, are we saying then that in this language, the homotopy class of that map only depends on this the class in this rotation. Exactly. I have hopefully completed this. You should. You should and is everything in GW as a sum of such things? Come on, come on.
