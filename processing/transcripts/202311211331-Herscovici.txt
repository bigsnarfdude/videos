For a minute and we'll focus on proof just stability and inequality this in this theorem. So first of all, Gaussian inequality if I have E gamma of A B is Greater or equal then square root of products of two measures AK and BK. And here we need, first of all, this happens for all positive A and B. And we talk about comic symmetric set K subset in. Subset in Rm And as usual, this is a standard Gaussian measure. So we are taking it in our end. So mean our density is Mean our density is 1 over square root of 2 pi to power n e to negative x squared over 2. This result was obtained by Cordero Taraski Fragilizi And the Maria almost 20 years ago. So actually the result, if we consider what happens here, this inequality actually states that this measure, if we consider measure of set e to power t k, this is K, this is a low concave measure with respect to T. So our work we considered on what happened with this inequality, what about stability of this inequality, and is equality achievable if and if it's achievable then where? So So let me start from one of our main results. Show fun. Let's say first of all that A is less than B. They are positive, but we assume that B is greater than A. Here again, we take in a symmetric convex set. Cool, we accept. And let we can write that Gaussian measure of square root of ABK is less than square root of products of measures. times some factor one plus epsilon and it happens this inequality happens for some positive epsilon which is small enough then show the happiness one of two either R of k is greater of n or equal 1 over b square root of log of c log b over a squared over n squared epsilon or R of k is less. Is less than or equal some constant C times square root of n over E epsilon to 1 over n plus 1 log of P over A to negative 2 over n plus 1. Then we speak about R of K. This is the inner ideals of Of body key, meaning if this is our body key, then in radius R of key, this is a radius of maximum Euclidean ball inscribed in our set K. In our set K. So, for future reference, let me call this boundary as F and this boundary as U. Okay, so question that we ask is All those bones sharp and our answer is yes, but just for the boundary help. The boundary L. What happens with boundary U currently for our boundaries, for what we saw, it's not likely that it's sharp. Okay, so now let's consider, let's go and prove that our boundary L is indeed sharp. Is indeed sharp boundary. So we will consider a convex body K, a convex set K, then K is a symmetric strip. Okay, so denoted by S R and this is symmetric straight of bit 2R, meaning here we have all points S So when you say are these bounds sharp, do we fix epsilon and then? Yes, so if you consider for a certain epsilon, we can it's possible to find those constants that make in it otherwise because it gets For epsilon one of 100 epsilon is fixed. Yes, we will consider as a case of equality, then we will talk about changing of epsilon. If epsilon is fixed, first you need the absolute value of the log, because you have n squared in the denominator. And second, the upper estimate, epsilon to the 1 over n is basically a constant. The 1 over m is basically a constant which cannot be absorbed in a constant C. No, it goes. No, X is 0. Okay, so maybe I did not say it clear. So X1 might be any number. Any positive number we said all we want this, I did not write it, our epsilon. Or epsilon. Because the term goes to infinity, the term will be from here. So these constants C do not depend on X. Yes. Okay. I said, but I did not write. Small enough in terms of n. When we say small enough, it's always compared to something, right? No, but it could be small enough. It's not even n squared, because in the second estimate, it's epsilon to the 1 over n plus 1, which makes sense either of them. Either of them. So, then there exists some constant C. Yes. So there is some constant. C does not depend on epsilon f or n no some universal constants. Okay, so back to the stripe. So we have here a symmetric stripe in first coordinate. So, what do we have here? If this is our first coordinate, we have here this is negative RR and our inner ideals this is just It's yours. So for our step B assume Assume that this equality holds. So here we have our scale strength with scale factor square root of AB. Here we have again square root of ASR BSR and the equality holds actually on existence of this cartish. Of physical teaching compositive exports. Okay, so let's see what happens with SR. So we can write the measure. It's Gaussian measure of our strength. So it will be just 1 over square root of 2 pi integral from negative r to r and our density. And we can write it as 1 minus 2 over 2 square root of 2 pi. This time it will be integral from r to infinity. So once we have this notation for our measure, Notation for our measure, we use the following relaxation. We can bound this integral, integral from r to infinity. And to bound this integral, we use relaxation of a result of Charek and Werner from 99, so we can bound it. bounded by 1 over r e to negative r squared over 2 and on the left it will be bounded by 1 over r plus 1 r plus 1 and the same exponent function so now we will work this is a boundary for Boundary for related to Gaussian measure of original strip. Now let's consider what happens when we scale our strips. So we need to evaluate AB and square root of AB. So let's define f of t to be 2 over square root of 2 pi. Pi integral from TR to infinity where T is some positive factor. Now, this integral is related to measure a gaps and measure of integrals, so we can. intervals so we can see that since a is less than b then f of a will be greater than f of square root of a b which is greater than f of b Now we can consider what happens with our epsilon. So our epsilon, our compensation, our deficit can be now written as measure of S strip of width square root of ABR over Over square root of measure of 3AR measure of 3AR minus 1 and we shown that this is less than or equal to F of 1 to f of a over 1 minus f of a. So let's consider what happens there. So this term, if we are going to have a notation of f of t, will be written as f of square root of a b over, sorry, one Over, sorry, 1 minus f here 1 minus f of a here 1 minus f of b square minus 1. But if we consider two terms in our denominator, a left one is smaller than the right one because of A, because B is an equality that we wrote. A because this inequality that we wrote here. Which means we can write this as 1 minus f of square root of a b over 1 minus f of a minus 1. Okay, common denominator and we will have f of a minus f of minus f of square root of a b over 1 minus f of a and we obtain our result that we saw f of a over 1 minus f of a colour In other words, we can arrive with epsilon over one plus epsilon. Is less or than or equal to FA which is, as we saw here, is the integral AR to infinity e to negative the square root of the equation. E to negative s squared over 2 ps. And again, we apply the bound that we saw earlier with respect to AR now. We get here that this is less or equal 2 over square root of 2i A R E. E to negative a square r squared over two so now taking algorithm and considering inequality with respect to R we obtain We obtain that R is less than some constant C1 times square logarithm 1 plus 1 over epsilon. So we will see soon again the boundary that we got in our theorem. Theorem, but meanwhile, let me at the end you will see that this proves that actually the bound that we evaluated is sharp for boundary L. But regarding boundary u we got that if We will consider K to be a small and medium ball. Then we get that this time alpha will be bounded just Be bounded just by some constant C2 times only square of epsilon. If you remember, epsilon was to power 1 over n plus 1. So it shows again that this bound is sharp and it contains the gap between two results. The gap between two results. So currently the result is not sharp. We don't have proof. Maybe there is some other proof, some other estimation making it sharp, but currently we don't see. Don't have it. Okay. Now let's see the equality. What happens with equality? Then is it achieved? Equality, then is it achieved? So, if we consider equality between two measures, so here our square root be considered results for Consider the result for some epsilon. Now, if the original inequality holds as equality, it means that this term should be eliminated. So we are going and take epsilon. The Russian Tusil. So then R of key will be just greater than limit. Then A, epsilon approaches zero, one over B logarithm of C log B over A is. B over A squared and squared epsilon and this limit just equals to infinity meaning that K just coincide with the whole subspace. With the whole sub space Rn. And in our situation, that we had that R of k was less than t times square root of 10 over a epsilon to 1 over n plus 1 log b over a to negative 2 over n plus 1, then our epsilon approach. Then our epsilon approaches zero, this limit equals zero, and we have that k just has an empty interior. Uh how much I have minute? Okay, so just uh last word. So these of course our results and we can see here again about sharpness here and unsharp result for the upper boundary. And I don't have more time, so thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. No questions, please. What about other measures? What about what? Other measures like Dario, LeRon, Degeneralize. There are some extreme extremely serious obstacles. Obstacles with this approach that we are absolutely not seeing how to overcome. Our initial goal was other measures because there is a conjecture that will be solved that way, actually, actually. But we came to the conclusion that it's actually very hard. But we have result, then the scaling is not done homogeneously in all their dimensions, so we use different scaling for different dimensions, and this result is on archive. So just don't have time. So, just don't have time. This case, more general case, have one more case here, meaning the situation richer. One question in this one estimate you have one for epsilon x squared epsilon. This one, yes, this one for this boundary. Yeah, the upper one. The upper one, this yeah, there you don't have the end. Yeah, there you don't have the n, you have n squared. Yeah, so um n squared here so we consider some some some space Rn because our space is I guess so the result is sharp in the sense that the asymptotic is chart of epsilon you think of as n to Epsilon, you think of is n to the hundred n to the hundred, then you don't care too much about this n squared, it's almost like it's also. So the point is that it's not sharp, but it's morally. I think you fix the dimension itself epsilon to zero. Then as a function of epsilon to the shaft. Yeah, yeah. So of epsilon del sha. Yes, epsilon del sha. Of course, it's epsilon delta. Thank you very much again.
