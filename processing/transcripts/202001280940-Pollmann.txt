And now I want to deviate a little bit from this. I want to ask questions how the kind of frictonic dynamics affects properties which we only see far out of equilibrium. And this is work that actually has been mostly driven by two students in Munich, T. Borvakowski and Pablo Sala. It was also done in collaboration with Ruben Veresen, who was at TUM. Ruben Verizen, who was at Tum and just moved to Harvard and is now in Ashbelsgroup, and Michael Knap, my colleague in Munich. So, since it's the first talk focusing on these non-equilibrium properties, I want to set the stage and say a few words about what we mean by quantum thermalization. And in particular, the setup that we have in mind is that we are considering a pure, like a closed quantum system, and we start from a pure state that we prepare out. From a pure state that we prepare out of equilibrium. That could be, for a spin system, for example, a state where we just choose a product state where we have spins chosen randomly on the Bloch sphere. Now we take this state and time evolve it, and then we want to ask the question, does this state in some way approach a thermodynamic equilibrium? So as we are used from a classical experiment that we can do. But clearly, that cannot be true for the entire state globally, because we start from a state that has zero. Because we start from a state that has zero entropy and under pure state or under a kind of a closed quantum system, that is also a zero entropy state after arbitrary long times. But we can have a different type of notion of thermalization. Then we can look at a subsystem. So we can just say we just take a block of consecutive spins and we look at the reduced density matrix describing these spins. Clearly in this initial state. Clearly, in this initial state that I've chosen, the reduced density matrix is not thermal, so it's still the density matrix of a pure state with zero entropy. However, if we evolve the system under some generic Hamiltonian, then we will find that entanglement is built up between those degrees of freedom within the block and the outside. And this generates entanglement of the generates entropy in this reduced Entropy in this reduced density matrix. So, in this way, the system serves as its own bath. And the question is: does the block density or does the reduced density matrix actually correspond to a thermal density matrix after sufficiently long times? And this is a question that we want to ask, basically, like does it happen? And the question, like, how does it happen? Like, what are the time scales needed, for example, to reach this thermal equilibrium? To make it a little bit more concrete, Make it a bit more concrete, what we will look at is we will look at a few body observables. This could be, for example, the local spin observables or local energy that we measure somewhere in our spin chain. And then we just look at how this quantity approaches some equilibrium state if it does. And here's some example where we just show the particle density at a certain momentum as a function of time. And we see it at short times it has some oscillations, but at Short times, it has some oscillations, but eventually it actually converges to the state that we would also get for a thermal ensemble. And that thermal ensemble is then only described by a few quantities, which example the energy or total particle number and the like. So the question is, what are the conditions that this is going to happen? What are the conditions under which we expect the system to thermalize? And this is answer was basically discussed in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Because that it happened is actually not at all clear. Because if we take our initial state, like this was the state we've chosen, where, for example, we just choose a simple product state of block spins, this we can expand in terms of the eigenstates of our Hamiltonian. And then after long times, well, after long times we expect that off-diegel elements will disappear if we have a system where the energy levels are not commensurate. Are not commensurate, but we will see that the information about the initial state remains in here at all times. So there have to be certain conditions on the system such that this actually would correspond to a measurement with respect to a thermal density matrix. And the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis gives now a condition for this. It basically says that, well, the expectation value of our observable has to be a smooth function of the energy in the thermodynamic limit. The thermodynamic limit. And the off-diego elements have to be exponentially small in the system size. And now we can distinguish between different types of this eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. And this is what I'm also going to use later on in my talk. So the one hand we have like a strong version of Eth, and that means that this condition has to be true for all eigenstates. So we just basically look at, as shown in this example, as we just go to larger system sizes, and here we plot the expectation value. The expectation value of the spin operator as a function of the energy, we see this becomes now a smooth function and there are no crazy things happening in between. And then there's another weaker version, which is like weak ETH, and we do have certain exceptions. There can be certain states in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian that obey it, but we just assume that these from a vanishing set or the set measure zero. So it's only if we It's only if we have this strong version of ETH that the system would equilibrate from any state. If we have the weak version of ETH, then we can always find certain states that would not equilibrate to the thermal equilibrium as defined before. So and having said if in any initial state do we still want to be product or can be any state? Well it can be any state that would not be an eigenstate. Be any state that would not be an eigenstate. But the eigenstate. Not necessarily a product state, right? Right, and now we can basically classify the dynamics of Hamiltonians. We can just basically ask, we just write down a certain Hamiltonian. We can ask, would this Hamiltonian actually thermalized or is it fully ergodic? And then, as I said before, we have then the long time. Time dynamics is described by a few conserved quantities, all eigenstates will look thermal, and observable would relax to some thermal values. And then there's another class of Hamiltonians that has been discussed a lot over the last couple of years, and these are many body-localized systems, or fibrillantly integrable systems. In these systems, we actually have an extensive number of local integrals of motion. The eigenstates are not thermal, and if we just do this kind of quenched experiment, And if we just do this kind of quenched experiment, the system would actually keep the memory of these initial states locally, and they would never equalate to some thermal state. And more recently, it has been discussed that there are now a number of systems which show a behavior which is sort of in between, which are not fully ergodic, but also they don't show this many by localized. They don't have an extensive number of local integrals of motion. Extensive number of local integrals of motion. And not a complete set of integrals of motion. And one of the examples are kind of localization observed in gauge theories. And another one are these kind of quantum many-body scars where there exist certain states in the spectrum which are completely different than outliers that don't have volume law entanglement and they lead to the fact that we can just prepare certain initial states that do not revax. Certain initial states that do not relax to a thermal equilibrium, at least not in these experiments, not after kind of after long times. And we can actually construct systems where they would never equilibrate even after infinitely long times. And there have been some experiments on Ruthberg atoms and a theory for these kinds of so-called TXP models and also for AKLT type models in the group of Andre. So let me now come to what I want to talk about. Because having now the setup, kind of having now seen that systems can have very different properties out of equilibrium, I want to look how these tectonic dynamics affects this story. And I want to discuss two parts. First, I want to look at a system where we have kind of simultaneous charge and dipole conservation, and I want to show that this can That this can lead to an extensive fragmentation of the Hilbert space, so that the Hilbert space decays into many disconnected blocks. And this in turn can lead to non-thermal behavior. And in the second part, I want to discuss that in these systems, due to the fractonic nature of the systems, to this constraint dynamics, that we get some interesting type of integrals of motions, which we call statistically localized integrals of motion. So, let me now come to the kind of concrete model that I want to look at. In particular, we want to look at a system that simultaneously conserves the total charge and the total dipole. And for concreteness, we want to look at a spin-1 model. And here it actually been proposed by Michael Pratko that these kinds of has been discussed. Kind of has been discussed how basically these the combination of these symmetries enforces certain constraints onto the dynamics of the excitations and thus the frictonic behavior. And that this system we can see very easily if we just take now our spin one chain and prepare a product state of spin zeros where we just have a single spin plus. We have a system where we have q equals to one. So we have a Q equals to 1, so we have 1 charge. And if we just put this into the center of the chain, and with this definition of the dipole operator, we find that this configuration has a zero dipole moment. But we see that in this scenario, the charge cannot hop at all, because if it hops to the left or to the right, we would see that the dipole changes. So the charge is just like a single charge, would just be completely locked. So the only way that it can move is if So the only way that it can move is if this, if we just emit here an extra dipole, and then we can just move this dipole away. So the dipole can move freely while the charge sits here. And having now these kind of constraint dynamics, a very natural question to ask is how this actually affects now these thermalization properties. So now we have dynamics that has these constraints and charges by itself cannot move. Does it actually Cannot move, does it actually change the thermalization properties? And then it was shown by Pi and others, including Michael Pretko and Narul Brantkeshaw, that for a system of local unitaries that preserve the charge and dipole, that this can actually lead to a breaking of thermalization. But the question is: how robust is this phenomenon? And this is exactly what we want to address. And instead of kind of Of random unitaries, we wanted to look at a concrete Hamiltonian. So we just wrote down a simple Hamiltonian that actually has dipole conservation of this type. So we just see that these kind of two spins, two plus, can hop to the middle. So that gives us a state which is then zero plus zero. And we just simulate the dynamics of this in particular. We look at the autocorrelation function of Sz and we want to see. Of Sz, and we want to see if it approaches the thermal value for an infinite temperature state. And indeed, we find it does not. So, here we just look at the autocorrelation function as a function of time, and we find it saturated at a finite value, so it doesn't go to zero at all. So, here we actually see that due to this kind of very constrained dynamics of our Hamiltonian, we find that the system does not reach the thermal equilibrium. If, however, we add other terms, We add other terms to the Hamiltonian, which we call H4, which is again a dipole-conserving Hamiltonian, but now it doesn't act just on three consecutive sites, but acts on four sites. We actually see a different scenario. In particular, we see that after a sufficiently long time, the system actually slowly reaches the equilibrium um state. So now the question is now uh um first of all what are the differences between H three and uh H three um plus H four? H3 plus H4, and also can we just understand basically why this system falls out of equilibrium? And here I was showing just the kind of time evolution of these systems, but instead we can now also look at the properties of eigenstates. So, one property that we are looking at now is the half-chain entanglement calculated for eigenstates, and we see the following. And we see the following picture. So we see that if we look at the eigenstates of H3 alone, we find that, first of all, that all eigenstates are scattered, like the entanglement entropy of those eigenstates is scattered around this kind of red block here. And secondly, we see that none of them reaches the kind of infinite temperature value that we would expect. So the dashed line here shows what we would expect for a random state. What we would expect for a random state chosen for this particular Hilbert space. And if we take H3 plus H4, we get a very different picture. So the entanglement entropies are not as scattered. So it looks much more smooth. And in fact, many states approach the infinite temperature limit of the entanglement entropy that basically is then the entanglement entropy of a random state. Although there are still a number of outliers here. There are still a number of outliers here, but there are much fewer. So we see that there is this kind of big difference in the properties of the many-body eigenstates of the system. So let us now try to understand it. And we first want to look a bit closer at H3 alone. So one thing that we can immediately see is that there are exponentially many. Is that there are exponentially many eigens frozen eigenstates. There are states which are simple product states and they are solutions and they are eigenstates of this Hamiltonian. So in particular, we can come up with a very simple rule that tells us that the states are frozen. So whenever we have a particular spin configuration on three consecutive spins, we know that there cannot be any dynamics. And for this, we can then use a simple Pauling estimate to estimate the number of these flows. Estimate the number of these frozen states and then compare this to our numerics. And this is shown in this plot. So, in what we see that the red line here, this is the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. So, this is going as 3 to the power of n. And then we see that both the Pauling estimate and also the exact number of frozen states is actually growing quite. States is actually growing quite quickly compared to the total number of states. So a certain fraction of these states is actually completely frozen. But this is not the only conserved quantities. These are not the only special states we find. We can find also that there are other conserved quantities. So for example, we find that the sign of the right and leftmost charges in any regional space is conserved. So we can just now construct specific Specific initial states, like this one here, and then we find that the charge can move now within this region, but it can never leave this region. And this means that the system just decouples into certain blocks where we have dynamics, but then there are now frozen regions in it that really separate the system spatially. So we have now this kind of structure that just due to this constraint, we find that even if we just fix our global quantum numbers, which are Our global quantum numbers, which are q and p, we find that the system just fragments into many different parts. And now, one of the things that we want to look at is what is basically the size of the largest block in the system, right? Because that largest block in this Hilbert space will, in the thermodynamic limit, tell us about the kind of properties in the thermodynamic limit. And in the large Dermodynamic limit. And in the largest block, we actually can map our spin one system to a spin one-half system. In particular, in the largest block, we find that the charges are always alternating. So we have a minus, and then we have an arbitrary number of spin zeros, and then say we have a plus, and then an arbitrary number of zeros, and then we have a minus, and so on and so forth. So it's similar to the string order found in AKLT states, we have this pattern of chart. We have this pattern of charges in the largest sector. But that we can now map to a simple spin one-half system in the following way. So we just, at the leftmost part, we choose maybe the spin half pointing to like downwards on one of the bonds, and then we just keep spin down until we hit uh a charge, and at this charge we now change the direction. So basically the charges of our spin one model then correspond to domain volts in this um spin one half. Volts in this spin one-half model. So then, depending on the starting state, we find that the number of states in this sector is in 2 to the n minus 1 times 4. The 4 comes from how we terminate the boundaries. And the Hamiltonian in this language becomes then simply the xy Hamiltonian in this given sector. And this means that the largest sector in our That the largest sector in our Hilbert space grows in this way, and this is approximately growing then as 2 to the n. So, in particular, and this is now the main message for H3, we find that the largest connected sector for this Hamiltonian grows as 2 to the n. So basically, compared to the total number of states in our Hilbert space, this is like a vanishing fraction. 2 to the n divided by 3 to the n is going to 0. And this is what we now call. zero, and this is what we now call a strong fragmentation. So, just to reiterate briefly, so we do have a very kind of constrained way how the Hamiltonian can connect states. And that gives also kind of strong kind of constraints on what kind of states we can actually connect in the Hilbert space for the certain number of completely frozen states and like various block structures. And the important thing is that in this case, this fragmentation is so strong. In this case, this fragmentation is so strong that even the largest block is growing much slower than the total Hilbert space size. So, that gives us also a way to distinguish now H3 and H3 plus H4. Because if we now take these two together, then we see that there are still exponentially frozen states that we can construct, particularly the way that we can construct it. Again, as if we can construct certain islands here and construct them in such a way that we can. Constructed in such a way that they cannot be connected. So, then again, we have frozen states. So, again, we have an exponential number of frozen states in the system. However, in these systems, they are different in such that now the largest connected block, right, if you now just again define the largest block that is connected, it actually also scales with 3 to the n, which means that the largest connected sector contains. Connected sector contains almost all the states of the Hilbert space. And this is what we then call weak fragmentation because now again we do find exponentially many sectors in the state, but almost all states are in the largest, containing the largest sector. And this now explains basically this kind of qualitatively different behavior in these two sectors. So we find that H3 does not thermalize, to be just. Not thermalized to be just kind of goes to a system, to a state that is not described by thermal equilibrium, while H3 plus H4 does go to this because almost all states are in this kind of largest sector. And in fact, the expectation value after infinite times, we can actually describe by a simple kind of half measure over all connected states. And the same idea that I now detailed for the spin-1 system, generizes. The spin one system generalizes also to a bunch of other systems. So we can take, for example, a spin one-half system, where we have now the smallest dipole and charge-conserving Hamiltonian would be H4. So this would act on four spins, where spins just hop to the middle. That one does not equilibrate, but if you take then the large the next larger term to it, like the term involving five spins, then it equilibrates. This is a spin one that we looked at, and for spin two, Spin one that we looked at, and for spin two, even the smallest one seems to approach the thermal equilibrium. Good. So this is basically the story on how these kind of different dipole conserving Hamiltonian are different, but in order to actually have the system fall out of equilibrium, this is only true if the kind of support of the terms in the Hamiltonian are of a certain size, they're small enough. So the question that Enough. So, the question that I want to address in the second part is now: how can we understand these structures? So, what are these kind of new integrals of motion that we have that would describe or that do describe these different sectors? And they have an interesting nature, I think. And these we call kind of statistically localized integrals of motions. Before I apply these to the Dipole Hamiltonians, I want to just give a different. I want to just give a definition of what we mean by statistically localized integrals of motion. We basically just have an operator q which is not local. So the operator q is now a sum over some local operators that can be everywhere on our system. And this operator q fulfills now the following conditions. The first, this operator is conserved by the Hamiltonian, so it commutes with h. And now what we demand Now, what we demand, and this is now what you call them statistically localized, is that for almost all states, the expectation value of this operator is localized to a sub-extensive region in space. So, in particular, if we just calculate the variance of I over L for these operators, we expect this to go to zero. In this case, we can actually show that an operator which would be just the total charge operator. Would be just the total charge operator, where Qi would be, for example, just the charge on side I, would not qualify, because in that case, the variance of I divided by L would go to a constant and not to zero. Yes? How about an operator? So any projector under any eigenstates satisfies first condition right now? No, but it doesn't satisfy the second operator. That's right. I mean if because then the projector on the given eigenstate would not The projector on a given eigenstate would not be local at all. And you're not making any implication about the null load. The projector in a state would have a huge null space, right? On any other state, it would be zero. So that's you're not making any. Well, I mean, we just make it, well, we make a we want it to be written in this specific form, like this is a sum of local operators. Yeah, but that's not probably, that's not unique. No, but you can write down these operators and then some of them do have a meaningful interpretation. I mean, not saying that all of them necessarily do have a meaningful interpretation. And now I want to demonstrate this idea by looking at a simple kind of toy model. And this is a TJZ model. So it's a TJZ model. So it's like a TJ model where we just take only the Z part out of the exchange part. And this is directly related to the problem that we had before, that we have now a chain of minus spins and zeros and plus. And now the charges can hop, but we cannot exchange two charges. So the pattern of pluses and minuses. Of pluses and minuses will always be conserved. And now we can write down an operator, and this operator Q is now the spin of the case particle counting from the left. And this is a quantity which is conserved. So in particular, if we have a system, we just determine the spin of the first charge, that is like a minus spin. The minus spin, it can sit on the first side, but it can also sit somewhere. But it can also sit somewhere deeper in the bulk. But now we kind of see also why we just call it statistically localized. Because if we take now a system with a finite filling, let's say that we go to half filling for concreteness, then we see that there is, of course, one configuration where the first spin sits in the middle of the chain. So then that position, of course, is not local. But the probability. But the probability of finding this configuration is going exponentially to zero. So, almost in almost all configurations, this bin will sit somewhere right at the boundary. And then this is why we call it now kind of statistically localized. And this is not only true for the first spin, but this is also true for spins which are deeper in the bike, where k is now like some, or k over l goes to a finite number. Over L goes to a finite number. Verticular, we can then determine basically the probability of finding the k spin at position i. And this is peaked around a position k, and where mu is now the filling factor. And in particular, the leftmost spins, they decay, or the positions or the probability of finding them somewhere decays exponentially at the boundaries. And in the bulk, the standard And uh in the bulk the standard deviation uh goes as um square root of L, so not as L as it would be for a for um for a for an extended operator. And this has now a number of uh constraints. So here I plot now the the expectation value of a density operator for finding uh the k spin on a side i. And we see that this is for k equals to one, this is Or k equals to 1, this is strongly peaked at the left boundary. And if we just now go to larger k, this is now peaked somewhere in the bulk. And then we can also see that this is now in the bulk described by Gaussian, which has a width of, like, a variance of square root of L. And if we have now these conserved locally, these statistically localized operators, then we find that Operators, then we find that split at the boundary, they will never equilibrate, so they will, like then the autocorrelator will go to a constant, while in the bulk it will go to zero, but it will only go to zero as one over square root of L, and not as one over L. And the existence of these kind of statistically localized integrals of motions leads actually to some topological properties of excited. Topological properties of excited eigenstates, particularly if we look at eigenstates of the spectrum and we assume that we have, in addition to the conservation of Z here, we have another symmetry, for example, like Rx, which would be a symmetry for spin rotations about X, or time-reversal symmetry. Then we actually find what we call strong zero modes. It basically means that each eigenstate would come in pairs of In pairs of four. Thank you. So then we have an example where we have now strong zero modes through all the systems. So this would be a property where, like an AKLT state, for example, we know that the ground state has a 4-4 degeneracy, but this is only true for the ground state, not for the highly excited states. But in the presence of these kind of stochastically localized integrals of motion that are just introduced, you would actually find that the entire spectrum would have this fourfold degeneracy. Degeneracy. And this was also discussed by Paul Fenley a couple of years ago to be the case for, for example, for the Ising or the Majrona chain. Any other question? Yes, so if I look at the ETLT graph today, I have a string operator, right? But that's not a part of this set of operators, right? This is local. Right. Somewhat local. But it will not be part of this construction stuff. Construction and stuff. But this is a different way, like for the AKLT chain. If we would kind of look at the autocorrelated for the ground state, we would also find that the spin one half would be localized at the boundary, but not at finite energy density states. But it seems like a lot of these states have string order in their things though. So I wouldn't expect that a string operator would kind of define the the subspace. define uh the subspace rather than a sum of uh local operators? Well there are two things to it, right? I mean this operator by itself does not yield these zero modes. Right, so so this operator by itself just tells us that we do have certain blocks in this filbert space. We just basically have blocks that we can now so we can we have now our kind of k numbers. So now we can just Numbers, so now we can just put k numbers on each, we can use them to label each item state. That gives us now the pattern of pluses and minuses. But that by itself doesn't mean that these blocks are degenerate. For example, if we take the AKL team model and we apply a Z-directed field, then it breaks time-reversal symmetry and it breaks the Rx symmetry, and then we have no longer. RX symmetry, and then we have no longer degeneracies. So we really need both. And if we have both, then we can also define a string order for all those exciting states. Good. Yes, I'm sorry coming to an end, but let me just briefly kind of touch upon the question, like, how can we realize these kinds of models in experiments that was already briefly mentioned by Michael, particularly if we have a very simple setup where we take now our chain. Our chain, where we can probably think that on this one-dimensional chain we have charges, and we just apply a stronger magnetic field, and then in perturbation theory, we would actually get exactly these type of terms, this type of dynamics that I was discussing before, where we have now, depending on which order of perturbation theory we include, we get then longer range terms. So H4 would be lowest order. So, H4 would be the lowest order, and then we get H5 as the next highest order, and so on. So, then we can exactly look at these models and see how the charges collibrate. And moreover, what we could do is we could just set up certain experiments where we initiate the system in certain sectors. Because now we just understand the kind of structure of the silver space, and then we can explore how the dynamics looks in these different sectors described by these stochastically localized integrals of motion. So, that brings So that brings me to the end of my talk. And what I discussed is systems where we have kind of simultaneous charge and dipole conservations. And what I showed is that that always leads to an extensive fragmentation of the Hilbert space. But there are different ways of how the Hilbert space can be fragmented, depending on how fast the largest sector grows. And that has an implications on the thermalization. And then I discussed or introduced these kind of stochastically localized individuals. Of stochastically localized integrals of motions that allow us to label all these sectors with quantum numbers. And let me then end by thanking again Tibor and Pablo for this great work, and also Ruben and Michael. And I want to thank you for your attention. Okay, we're time for questions. So here you have explicit explicitly So here you have explicitly dipole conservation symmetry. But in like fractal models, do they have an immersion backward conservation symmetry? I think that's maybe a statement that holds only low energies dilute excitations. Well, I mean, imagine if you just take mods like this, this would also be emergent. Is this what you mean? I mean, basically that you have to symmetry to a whole spectrum approximately but infrared. Approximately but infractional models, I think it doesn't make sense to say that it's images or when you have any excitation floating around. So in that sense, can you ask such dynamics for I think infrared models? But then that would be a question that we I mean if I understand the question correctly would say that well if it's emergent only in the ground state then that question would only make sense if you look at the dynamics which are like of low energy excitations. So so if that goes out of the window for high energy states then that wouldn't High energy states then that wouldn't be visible here. Maybe kind of similar. If you had, remember your like H3 hematomian or something like this, and you had a small dipole symmetry violating term, can you characterize like how fast thermalization happened or something? Good question. I mean, I expect that the moment that you break this, so say that you add. Break this, so say that you add a perturbation of this kind of, like let's say the attility is A3, and then you just add a simple xy term to it of order j. I think then the time scale at which this will break is just j. I mean, I think there wouldn't be a big surprise. Part of this I asked before, but let's say it again. So, uh in the first part, this strong uh shattering or whatever, it's very classical in the fact that I can have a stochastic model. That I can have a stochastic model with those same rules and the feasibility of state space applies, right? That's right, yeah. And the second thing is that it doesn't depend on system size. Because you have this shattering at any system size, the conservation or the which where the non-triviality of non-ergodicity is really limit of large size. So I think that what you're implying is that H3, all non-ergodicity of All known algonicity of H3 is just a consequence of this simple fact. That's correct, yes. Okay. And then I have a question on the second part on the strong serial modes. The models, at least I know, where you can prove exactly existence of strong serial modes are integrable. But one way to think about them is that you have quasi-particles bouncing against the edges in some way or another. So is there an interpretation like this here as well? Well, I mean, here we do have I mean the I mean We do have, I mean, the spots are why I like this because this is, I think, at least to my first model where we do have strong zero modes also in an interacting model. And the interpretation here is just from this brute stochastic way that basically almost all states have this spin one-half localized at the edge. And that will give rise to these degeneracies. Yeah, so this looks a little bit less simple than either the. Than either the non-interactive chain, you know, the Mayorana chain or the XY set that has been solved. Okay. I don't understand why you call the strong zero modes of Fendi at all integrable. No, but at the moment, if you just take Paul Fende's model, if you take for example the Majrana model, where you have strong zero modes or like magnetic bound states, and you just add a small integrability burning i integrability breaking perturbation to it, then these modes disappear. Then these modes disappear. Like basically, they would long-lived, but they would decay. Right, but they are very long-lived stuff. Yeah, but yeah, but they're stable, but hugely stable. Yeah, in the other case, the time scales diverge with systems. So this will be between strong and almost strong zero modes. Here they are actually strong. I do have a question. So your host or manages of the which Me something which I see in top article order, which is you take your Hilbert space and then they split according to any of them. So this gives you a super selected sector. And then you discover now you have a merge symmetry of these sectors, which split into a group, you know, across another group, across another group. And then that becomes a representation of this product group. Of this product group. And then it's a standard theory that the space got decomposed into a tensor product with each of the sublimes. And that's more like your fragmentization of the Hilbert space process. In the first step, you split into super-selected sectors. And the second, if my guess is your summation of OI, each OI generates a small algebra, which is a symmetry of its sector. Of its sector that your space could compose. But I don't know if this is the same story, but it something happens in how to face matter. I do have a question. There is no symmetry. It's not local. It's not operator of the the operators are not local, but they're statistically local. I mean, Your submission then is an OI, right? Yes, yes. In general, there's no symmetry that gives you this space, that's right, algo symmetry. We gotta be clear about this, right? Is there but I mean these are conserved, these are integrals of motion, I mean they have expectation values that are local, but operator is this going back to the This is, I mean, like going back to the definition. So, the operator itself is not local. And OI is a local. OI itself is not. That's what I'm saying. OI is a local argument. I would like to discuss it more. I mean to see this connection. So you have a question. Yes. So if I break that book observation. Yes. Is there anything left that you recognize the model? Well, we looked at it emerging, but then we didn't find any surprises. So basically, as I said to the previous question, so if you As I said to the previous question, so if you add now a simple kind of xy term with an amplitude of j, then the time scales over which all this kind of goes away is is like inverse j. So that way it's highly fine-tuned in a way that the moment that we just lose dipole conservation, then there's nothing slow or interesting in it. Any more questions? If no questions, that's back to the speaker again. We take out 30 minutes, about 30 minutes break.
