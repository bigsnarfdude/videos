What active miles and networks. I'm going to start, however, by telling you a little bit about what motivates my math modeling work and how it touches on different aspects that I don't have time to tell you about today in case you want to chat about it later. This is not going to work, right? This is not my data doing this thing. Yeah. Okay. All right. So typically, I'm motivated by trying to understand intracellular transport and organization. So basically, the key molecular players that have to Molecular layers that have to do with transport and organization of site cells interact with each other. Cargo that I typically think about, messenger RNAs or vesicles, interacting with molecular motor proteins, and finally moving things along the cytoskeleton. And so most of my projects are in collaboration with experimentalists. And so what I try to do is I try to understand precise time and spatial scales on which this in vivo cell data that they obtain is. Cell data that they obtain is observed. So, how can we explain that? And also, if we're trying to understand large-signed behavior, given all the stochastic fluctuations that arise from all these binding, unbinding interactions, how could we try to understand that robustness that occurs? All right, so Allie did a really nice reminder this morning of cytoskeleton we might want to keep in mind, did three different classes. Different classes, and so my work has touched on all three of them. So, when it comes to microtubules, I have thought of them initially more in the context of transport of messenger RNAs in the development of frog-old cells. So, with a collaborator at Brown, I was interested in understanding how different geometries of microtubules, different orientations can lead to this robust transport from the nucleus to the periphery of the cell. And the way that we approach that is by using. That we approach that is by using dynamical systems, so partial differential equations, typically convection, reaction, and diffusion, because we try to think about switching between diffusion states that the mRNA can be in, bi-directional active transport states, and potentially pausing as well. So you have the switching dynamics, but what you're interested in is perhaps effectively, all these particles, what are they doing? What's their effective velocity? What's their effective diffusivity? Velocity, what's their effective diffusivity, and how does that depend on parameters of each individual state, like diffusion motivations, transport rates, and switching rates? So that's the kind of thing that I approach with dynamical systems, more analytical methods. But in the more applied sense, I was also interested in parameter estimation based on fluorescent microscopy data like FRAP and photoactivation, and then validating other in-divo imaging kind of experiments. More, okay. And so, the kind of things that we could give back to the experimental collaborators were the type of localization that can be compared with what they get at various times in the development of a site. And more recently, I'm thinking about microtubules a little bit more on their own rather than as a road for transport and more about their organization. So, in collaboration with Melissa Rawls at Penn State University, she Penn State University. She thinks about many things, but one of the things is microtubu polarity and organization in dendrites of neurons. And so there we try to understand how microtubule turnover leads to this very polarized organization of microtubules in dendrites and axons. That in turn will have, of course, effects on transport. But for now, we're sort of interested in how that polarity can be established, what happens when they sever the axon, so they basically cut it. So they basically cut it, and one of the dendrites essentially becomes the new axon. But what that requires is that all the microtubules switch their polarity. And so that's kind of very interesting from a feedback dynamical system point of view, and that's what we're thinking about these days. So at the intermediate filament scale, I haven't thought about it really in the way that I heard today and yesterday, but more in terms of these neurofilaments and axons. And axons. So I collaborated with Tony Brown at Ohio State, and he studies neurofilm and transport in axons of neurons. So there we think of them more of cargo that's being transported along microtubules. You can see in the video there what that might look like with fluorescence. And so here again, we were thinking about these switching state-type dynamical systems with the neurothoman switching between different kinds of dynamics. And what we were particularly interested in. And what we were particularly interested in is the fact that the axon is really not that smooth. It has these constrictions that are called known as Brownier. And it's very clear why that's important from a signaling and electric potential point of view, propagation. But from the point of view of transport, they could be bottlenecks or traffic jams. And how does that not happen, for example, for these neurofilaments? So we propose some mechanisms that could explain why, how that could happen in healthy systems. And so, finally, what I'll tell you about today is on actin filaments. I have two parts. If I only get to the first one, all good. No one freaked out. It's fine. So, the first part that I'll focus on has more to do with understanding patterns that could form in actin-myosin interactions. These are a little less connected, sort of, quantitatively, with experiments, but can maybe explain some of the structures that can be observed in actin in vivo. And if I get to the second one, that's more. And if I get to the second one, that's more with an in-fitro collaborator where we're going more towards a quantitative understanding. So we've seen also this picture maybe once or twice already, but it's this idea that there are different action architectures in different regions of, say, a moving cell. So you could have things like contractile fibers, viral bundles, homogeneous meshes, or ring channels. They're in different parts of the cell, and they also. Parts of the cell, and they also lead to different mechanical properties or profiles of the cell. And so, more specifically, our motivation came from the lab of Adriana Dawes at Ohio State. She's actually one of the organizers, but can't be here. And so she's in math and molecular genetics, studies the roundworm C. elegans. And we were motivated by the fact that in C. elegans, but other systems and in the early embryo, changes in actin organization can occur. An act and organization can occur on the order of minutes. So they can go from things like patches with few filaments to more of these homogeneous distributions and finally to more bundled or ring channel type arrangements. So how can we understand that? What can lead to that kind of behavior? And so what you'll see today is our approach to it has been to try to understand how mice and motor properties can lead to those different kinds of structures. And many of you in this audience, And many of you in this audience could tell me that there's many other things that can happen. There could be changes in regulatory proteins, there could be changes in turnover. We kind of gloss over that and we focus on how myosynchroproduce alone can lead to a diversity of acting structures. So that's what we're focusing on here. Okay, one more thing. It's difficult to observe these directly in the system that Adriana works with. I believe there are some labs that can do it. She's trying to get it. Do it, she's trying to get it. But the point is, we can't really observe this dynamics in Hebo, at least right now. And so, hopefully, I can give you that as a justification for modeling and simulation being a useful tool. Another specific motivation that I'm going to come back to, also from Andreana's lab, had to do with the fact that in the reproductive system of the worm, which you're seeing sort of cut off through right here, there's this region here, rectangle. You might not see it very well, but it's blown up here. Well, but it's blown up here that has these membranous structures, and in between these membranous structures, there's these germ cells that form. And what they're going to do is they're going to grow, they're going to go around this bend, and they're going to become mature oocytes. That's the goal. In order to do that, they essentially have to be able to have communication with this rest of the worm body, this sort of open area that you're seeing here. And the way that that happens is through these ring channels, these actomrives and rings that have an opening. And rings that have an opening or a hole in the middle. So, we have been trying to understand a little bit that, motivated by here, by this biological observation kind of loose. One thing that they did, however, see in experiments was the fact that there's really probably more than two, but at least two myosin motors at play in ensuring this kind of organization. So, they did RNA interference experiments with two types of myosin. Experiments with two types of myosin 2, NMY1 and NMY2. So when they knock down one of them, NMY1, okay, so this is a healthy situation. This is what you see, like those membranous structure and this opening here. When they knock down NMY1, what you see is this complete and premature cellularization. And when you knock down the other, you see complete black cellularization. So somehow these two motors, they're part of the same family of myosin motors. They're thought to be usually redundant. Be usually redundant in various functions that they have clearly seem to not be so. They might have some sort of antagonistic kind of contribution with respect to the cellularization and ring channel formation. All right, so she had some hypotheses of perhaps the way that they are acting on the ring channel. So, in terms of the ancient-based model that I want to tell you about today, this was a collaboration with Gary Pafoyan's lab at University of. With Gary Papoyen's lab at the University of Maryland in computational chemistry. So, his group already had this agent-based model and framework called Median. And Median is nice for us because it's already pretty much made for actin-myosin interaction, specifically mitosin II. And Median essentially accounts for dynamics and molecular transport of different chemical species. It's in 3D. It allows you to essentially have these cubicle compartments. Have these cubicle compartments, and then diffusion and active transport are modeled as stochastic jumps between those compartments. He has a polymer model of the actin filaments. You kind of can see the actin filaments here in the sort of beige color. And they are, so they're not, you know, they're not straight as they look here, of course. They're made up of subunits. The subunits are not quite monomers, so it's really a coarse-grained model. So each subunit is kind of like a silicone. So each subunit is kind of like a cylindrical segment. Again, not quite monomer size, but there's many of them along each actin filament. And that allows him to essentially have a polymer model for actin, allows it to be semi-flexible and to have a given persistence length. And so, and then it's based on energy minimization. So, what happens at the next time points of the previous one is based on minimizing energy. And it's a stochastic reaction diffusion. And it's a stochastic reaction diffusion scheme in 3D that it's based on. To give you an example of what this might look like, here I have the actin filaments in red, myosin motors in blue, and a cross-blinker, this particular one, is alpha-actinin. That can be changed by modifying the model or the parameters. But this might be an example of that system. You're going to see a lot of these simulations where I have basically an X and Y and a very small Z kind of Small Z kind of very small height of the simulation domain. So it's still in 3D, which one has to do for Median, but it's sort of a very small height because we were kind of thinking of it as a small patch of the cortex where maybe the contribution of biosin is more important. So focusing on those properties and how they affect action organization makes more sense. All right, so we're Alright, so we were. Here's a first example of how we probe the role of motors in dynamic filament organization. So, what you're seeing here is the simulation is the same. The only thing that's different is the step size of the myosin motor. And these are all in nanometers. They're certainly in the physiological range of the myosin motor family. And what you're seeing is very clear differences. As you increase the step size, you're going from a more homogeneous mesh to two clusters to one. To two clusters to one cluster asteroid thing, and then one that becomes a little bit more that moves faster. And so, this is the way that we started by taking one grammar at a time. And so, for example, here you see step size changing the salmon organization, but also other features that are observed in VTRAN and VIBO, such as the fact that the myosin aggregate at the core of the actin structures, and also you form these aster-like structures that have polarity sorting of the actin. Structures that have polarity sorting of the actin itself, because actin is polar. So, all of these are similar to experiments, but also to other simulation frameworks of actin dynamics. All right, so I kept debating whether I should include this video or not, whether it will wake people up or make them fall asleep more. We shall see. But I included it in the end. So, you can do all sorts of things because it's a model, right? So, one thing we're doing here is we're increasing the number of motors as you go up, and we're increasing the speed. As you go up, and we're increasing the step size as you go to the right. So you can start seeing more of these differences. Again, you see structures that you would expect, like homogeneous meshes, bundles forming, ring channels, more asterid looking things, and clusters. And again, the same types of things like self-metabolarity sorting, motors at the centers of the asters, and so on. And so, what we were interested in here. Interested in here was we didn't really have any data of our own to really compare these with quantitatively. But what we did want to do is we wanted to understand whether there are data analysis measures that could distinguish in a rigorous way these different parameter settings. And so we came up with some measures that had to do more with the actin filament distribution and some that had more to do with the motor localization. And so an example on the left. So, an example on the left has to do with a measure of contractility of the network that emerges through time. And so, this is like the network radius of gyration that many of you maybe have seen before, where you're essentially keeping track of the location of each of those actin cylinders or the middle of each of those actin cylinders or segments. You're finding the geometric center of all of those, and then you're calculating this radius of gyration and normalizing it. And when it goes down, that leads to a more contract housing. Leads to a more contractile system when it goes up, a looser system. And you can see here, of course, we have to do multiple simulations because it's a stochastic agent-based model. You want to see whether that behavior really stands with stochastic fluctuations. So you're seeing mean and standard deviation in this cloud. And you can see that some of these parameter settings are pretty clearly distinguished, especially at the beginning of the simulation. And here, what we're doing is how could we understand a little bit what the motors are doing? What the motors are doing. Obviously, they're going to be influenced by the actin, they influence the actin, so it's a feedback. But here, what we did is essentially we put a convex hole around the motor, so like the smallest polygon that covers them, found the area. And you can see how that either goes up or goes down, going down meaning you form really more of an axon, but those dark asteroids tight, right? So, like a tichondrupile structure. So, this is one way of many others. Of many others that we have used to quantify that. So, going back to our motivation coming from Adriana's lab that there's two types of these non-muscle myosins that might be at play, at least in the gallery system, we started looking a little bit into the idea of having two motor populations, right? So, what if we try to have in this agent-based model two motors with different properties? So, you can kind of Properties. So you can kind of see them here. It might be a little hard, but there's a blue dashed line and green dashed lines. Those are those two miles of motors that could have different properties. So one might ask what changes in the active organization if you have differences in these motors. And also, a kind of interesting question more from the motor point of view is that Adriana saw some motor segregation in the ring channels in the C elegans, meaning that if you have a ring channel and essentially you're putting Ring channel, and essentially you're putting zero at the center of that ring channel, and then you're going out towards the diameter of it to the right on this x-axis. You're seeing how NMY1 and NY2 localize around that ring channel. And they certainly have overlap of where they are in space in terms of the ring channel, but there's certainly some segregation as well. And that was a little puzzling to them. So we were also trying to see whether, from a simulation point of view, can one ever see this kind of thing. This kind of thing. So, our first attempt at this had two motor populations. What you're seeing in black is two motors, but they have the same properties. So, it's really like a one-bit motor population. And what you're seeing in blue is two motors with, say, two different step sizes here, and then two different binding rates to act in here. And in here, what you're seeing is basically the intersection area of the polygons around the two motor populations to sort of get a sense of how. Populations to sort of get a sense of how they might get separated or not in space in the simulation domain. Here you're seeing the distance between the centaurates, so the centers of those two polygons that cover the two motors. And then we also look at some spatial statistics kind of measures. So for example, here what we're trying to say is you're seeing a decrease in the intersection area of the two motor populations, how they're covering space in the simulation, and you're seeing an increase in the distance between the center. Increase in the distance between the centroids. So there's segregation of the two motors. Interestingly, to us, we sort of saw actin organizations from the two motors that either showed competition of the two motors, so one of them sort of winning and leading to the actin organization that it would lead to if it was the only motor in the system, or we saw cooperation, so sort of tuning the behavior to something in between. And we sometimes saw some segregation of the motors. Segregation of the voters. All right, so I included this, but I don't want to spend all that much time on it. I do think it's interesting, so if people have questions, I'm very happy to talk about it. But I've gotten sort of in this direction of using a tool called topological data analysis to try to understand these complex networks. So, this is a tool that draws on topology and it tries to understand the shape of data. In other words, it's trying Data. In other words, it's trying to think about the fact that you might have data that's an image or you might have a point cloud. And you're trying to understand at a certain spatial scale in that point cloud, you know, how many connected components we have, which are zero-dimensional topological features, how many holes or loops are there in the data, which are one-dimensional topological features, or how many trapped volumes are there in the data at that spatial scale. And then you kind of repeat this at different spatial scales. This is at different spatial scales through your data to see whether some of these features are persistent throughout scale. So you get a sense of what kind of structure your data has from a topological point of view, which makes sense, for example, if you're interested in ring channels, which are essentially groups or one-dimensional holes. So this is what we did here with these kinds of simulations, where essentially this path here, I'm not going to sort of explain what the topological summary is, but it really uses topological data analysis. Topological data analysis and optimization to track the formation of this significant hole, which means that this path is going further and further away from this diagonal. So that's a way to quantify that. And we were interested in seeing whether this measure, I mean, really, it better showed differences between simulations that look very different in time, right? So one that leads to this very clear alignment and bundling at the corners of the simulation. The corners of the simulation domain, and one that has more of a contractile structure. And certainly, the measure should show a formation of a clear loop that maintains itself through time. And the other one should show something a little more noisy where you really don't have any significant loops in it. So this is kind of a proof of concept, but the idea is that it can do this for things that are less visually apparent than this, in a pretty rigorous way. And the second thing we did, this was, you know, on agent-based model kind of data. Agent-based model kind of data, but we also were interested in experimental data. So here's Dan Keith Hart again, actually. So this was data again from drosophila and embryo formation, and this is called dorsal closure, with these amniocerosa cells essentially performing apoptosis and closing in. But we can think of them as essentially holes or loops closing in and try to quantify how exactly are they doing that through time. And so these topological data analysis methods allow you to essentially track. Methods allow you to essentially track these paths where each colorful path here could correspond to one of these loops and how it's closing. We're going closer to zero through time. And I'm not showing you that here, but Dan has a genetic screen for this thing. So he's knocking down genes and looking at deficiencies. And we can use these kind of methods to try to understand in an aggregate kind of fashion whether we can quantify those perturbations, where the cells might become less regular. Where the cells might become less regular, or maybe they close faster. And the method can really show those kinds of differences. I think I'm alright. Okay. So for the second part that I wanted to tell you a little bit about that goes a little bit more towards a quantitative agreement, this is again a collaboration of Adriana and I, but with David Altman at Willamette University. And so David studies Myers and Motors. David, you know, studies myosin motors, myosin 2, but also now interested in the unconventional myosin 6 motor and how that leads to different kinds of actin organization. And he's specifically interested in how these motors might be force sensitive, right? Which of course that force can come from the actin cytoskeleton itself. And so there are various hypotheses and evidence that a myosin 6 regulates cytoskeleton organization and development. So we're trying And development. So, we're trying to understand that. And so, the idea of it, this is all very preliminary, but the idea of it is that David performs single bead optical trap experiments so he can get this kind of data sets where he can quantify essentially these binding events of the myosin motor with an actin filament. And so, from these binding events that you see here in red, we can extract essentially what's called the dwell time or the lifetime, you know. Time or the lifetime, you know, the time that that motor is spending on the active fill on it. And really, you can get distributions of these things. And so, using these kind of optical traps where he can also change the forcing that he applies on the optimal trap, we're hoping to try to understand how different switching rates and really how the mechanochemical cycle of biosump 6 might depend on force, might be force-sensitive. And so, the idea is that behind the scene, we will have a stochastic process model of Have a stochastic process model of that cycle. So, a simple one could be that you have a state where the motor is strongly bound to actin, right, and to ADP. Then you have a state one here that releases ADP, and then you have a state two where it binds to ATP, and it unbinds from the filament. And so, what we're sort of interested in understanding is what's the time from the state zero to state two, because that's equivalent. To state two, because that's equivalent to the dwell time in experiments. So, the way we can do that mathematically is we can think about this as a stochastic process with the transition matrix for all the switching rates between these states, and thinking about this last state, too, as an absorbing state where we really want to think about stopping the system and understanding what the expected time from here to here might be. So, that can be done with something that's called hitting time analysis. Hitting time analysis. So, I'm not going to go too much into that other than to tell you that it boils down to solving a linear system of equations. So, nothing too crazy. But it gives you something like the mean dwell time and how it depends on those different essentially switching rates, as well as on the concentrations of ATP and ATP. But the goal would be to really understand how that in turn depends on forcing, right? So, how is it? Right, so how is it force-sensitive? Which ones of these rates might be really most impacted by force? So that's the goal, essentially, to get histograms of dwell times from the experiments and to match them with these expressions from the analysis of the stochastic process. I show you here the mean dwell time, but I have done work in the past where this can be expanded to a first moment, second moment, and so on of the dwell time. Of the dwell time to really get at the distribution aspect, not just the mean dwell time aspect. So that's the goal here. And to return a little bit to actin myosin, we have started a little bit in that direction, but with some very, very simple modeling in Median, where on the left you're seeing myosin II interacting with actin, and on the right, myosin 6. This is a catch bond, this is a slip bond behavior. Also, myosin 6 moves in the opposite direction, might have a different step size. Might have a different step size. So we have some basic things in there, not quite as complicated as we would like, and we hope to inform, you know, from these optical trap experiments. But already we see different organization on the same time scales. So that's what we hope to get. And with that, that's it. Thank you very much for your attention. Yeah. In your two-motor system, what were the different Motor system, what were the different properties that we varied? Yeah, so we did a bunch of different things. We informed which ones to vary a little bit on what Adriana knew in terms of, I think she did a motor domain analysis between NMY1 and NMY2. So definitely we wanted to look at binding rate, we wanted to look at step size, but we looked at other things too, because we could, which is essentially parameters of the interaction potential. Parameters of the interaction potential between actin and myosin, you know, the distance at which you can start having binding events, you know, from myosin to actin, parameters that have to be with stiffness. So we have a number of them in the paper that we looked at. I think I probably showed you the ones that had the biggest kind of differences, but we really looked at the cooperation and tunable kind of behavior too. So you were showing the differences in active organizations of time during the development from sort of those square lattice-like things to the other one. So do you think that the different organizations are caused by relative expression levels of different motors with time? Or is there something else simple that could explain? Yeah, that's a great question. So what I showed you was: is there nothing? Basically, nothing was changing with time, right? In a sense. So, I showed you: let's do the dynamics with time, but with a set motor property, and let's do it with another set motor property. But we did do a little bit in the paper, and I didn't include it here, a change in one of those motor properties at some point during the simulation to see how and whether really the actin cytoskeleton, the network can change. Like, if it relapsed too much. Know, change like if it relaxed too much, is it able to go back to contraction or does it take a much longer time? So, we looked a little bit at that as well. We didn't look at changing the number of motors, which is maybe where you're getting at of like availability expression. And I think that's interesting too. Yeah. Veronica, I was wondering what this step size parameter actually means in your simulations. Because an undersimilizer doesn't really have a step size, it has a power stroke. Yes. How big of a mini fill of it, right? In real life. So that can have different polarization degrees and it's not so clear what it means. But when you look at your simulations, you can probably get an idea of what happens when you change that parameter. Yes. So what Gary Fequoyen does is he uses a model called the parallel cluster model for the minute, because it's really a minute filament, right, with multiple heads. And he has Multiple heads. And he has, and that model comes with parameters like how many heads you have, like the minimum versus the maximum that could be found. So they're not explicitly in there as number of heads. They're more of an implicit parameter that goes in. So it's like a run length or so, if you're kind of like a run length. Yeah, yeah. So it's not explicit, that's for sure. So the 36 nanometer guys, they just stay on longer and they pull. Longer and they pull they pull more during one event. Yes, exactly, during one event. Yeah. Yes? Oh, sorry. Following up with that question, it looked like maybe minus of six blocks in the kind of qualitatively different way. Like I know minus in five, that's kind of a hand over hand motion, sort of almost more like kinesic. So like more processive? Yeah, so it's maybe intrinsically processive that's So is it intrinsically processive that it's put aside? I don't think so. Don't quote me on this, but I don't know that it's considered processive. Let me check on that, though. Yeah, but thank you for the question. I was going to ask about the catch and see bar. About the catch bar and speed bar. Yes. You see that you the parameter that you is being That you consider is the art of rate. The arm of rate, right? Yes. And then besides that, what about the step size? I do think we use different step sizes for these two, but I don't think it had to do I mean does that have to do with this motor split? I don't think so. I think it's just an intrinsic property of the motor with step size. Property of the motor, what step size it takes. But it is different. It's different. I didn't. Yes. For example, the catch bond means that the more urine, the more precise it. Yeah, so the catch bond, let me see, because I always like to get this wrong between the two of them. But when it has a catch bond, when you have external force, you spend a bigger time, right, on the La time right on the filament. So when you have a slip bond, a shorter time. Right? Yeah, I always like it. In the non-business lyes instead, you type A, B, and so on, they're different ones. But there's this ADP release step that I think is force-dependent. There's a force one, and then ADP doesn't come off, and then the motor cycle stops. So we would like to understand how it is force-dependent. How is it force-dependent, for example, right? Like in what way? And if he does different forcings in the optical trap, hopefully we can get at that. Oh, the minus and six, maybe. Yeah, with minus and six. If the two would be mini-filaments, that's kind of hard. Right. Yeah, yeah. Right, well, that's nice. I guess there's after our activities in the lounge. Well the argument was a passing part of the usually. Yeah, I hear her face and everything. I think that's what it is. Uh the switch uh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an alternative passes in the folders. Yeah, I think this is much more uh mesoscopic. It it doesn't really matter what the microscopic mechanism is, it's what the heads are, the tails and the heck compress and whatever. Of the tails of the mechanic, whatever that is. Of course, if you read what's up to all the sports.
