Okay, thank you, Peter. Hi, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Okay, it's my pleasure to give a talk in this workshop. I'd like to thank the organizers for this invitation. And this work is a joint work with Masaiko Simocho from Tokyo Metropolitan University. From Tokyo Metropolitan University. So we are interested in this region diffusion system with the long-level dispersal. So here, the diffusion is defined by this convolution index. So with kernel GI. And we put the linearity, the relation term as the u sub i times f of i, f sub i of u. u is the vector for u1 to uf. So we have a system of m equations. Okay, and the fi here is a seban function. It's a seven function. Actually, this includes a lot of examples of many different models. Okay, and here the curl function Ji satisfies the following conditions. So it's a long active symmetric with. negative symmetric with respect to the origin and and we assume it is smooth actually is continuous but it's enough and it is a probability density so the the integral is equal to one and moreover it decays exponentially in this way so if we multiply by e to lambda y then this integral is finite for any This integral is finite for any lambda between zero to zero i hat for some i hat which is positive and maybe infinity and when lambda tends to this right end lambda i hat and this integral tends to infinity. So this is assumptions on the kernel functions. On the kernel functions, and we are concerned with the training wave solution connecting to different constant equilibria. So we put it E minus plus. And this is well known. So the each component UI is equal to some web profile phi i of G and Of g and g is the so-called moving coordinate, so it's equal to x minus ct for a given constant c. This c stands for the web speed. And the mean of connecting two different constant equivalent is this the condition. So at the left end tail, the profile is equal to. To E minus, and the right hand tail is equal to E plus. So this is a very standard notion of the train wave. And for the light logo dispersal system, the existence of all existence of train wave has been studied quite extensively in the past year. Extensive in the past years. Especially one Tong Li. I check the literature, Wantong Li's group, they have a lot of works. And for scale equation, Jeremiah Kovi has at least two publications. And joined with Arnold and two Chinese. We also study a better pressure system with download dispersal, including the exist of tremendous and also the spreading dynamics. So just briefly this reference. There are many, many references you can check, for example, the Messinet, many, many references. The get many references, okay. And in this work, we are interested in the stability and especially we are interested in the regression definition system of blank cooperative state cooperative type. So the very useful comparison principle is not available. And a typical example is A typical example is for land cooperative system is the like a pressure prayer system. And as in the title indicated, the main goal of this work is to derive the stability of train wave solution for system for this system, standard dispersal. So in this talk, we So in this talk, we should always assume the system has a positive train wave solution for any C bigger than equal to some positive constant C star. And here phi is positive, phi is a vector because we are considering system. So positive means that the the usual sense. The usual sense its component is positive. Okay. Unfortunately, because the SU stability for the general system is quite hard, quite difficult to obtain. So in this work, we assume so-called ecodification. Uh, so-called equal diffusivities. So, this means the ti is equal to one, and the current function gi is equal to j for some j. So, the so the land over time becomes n so this is uh defined by j common root with the j ui minus ui. UI minus UI. Okay, so this is the very, very serious limitation of our field. Okay, and here the second point is to study the stability of train wave, we use the so-called moving coordinate Z. Z is X minus C T. So, in terms of this moving coordinate, the solution, UI as a function of G of T becomes this system of equations. So here, as I mentioned earlier, we assume eco-divisibilities. And this C is the web speech. The wave speed, where we are concerned about the stability of the train wave. Okay, and actually, the train wave solution is a station solution of this system. So that means it satisfies this system of equations. Okay. And next. Next, we want to introduce the so-called relative entropy function. So, for a given set of positive constants, sigma i, and for any positive function, per c, vector function, per c, we define the relative entropy function by this quantity. So we quantity so with the this uh uh uh coefficient sigma i and uh ki ki is this is very standard classical uh functions very useful function uh for for the polar function so this is a very uh well-known function so we recall this is uh We call this relative entropy function, and actually, this is the distance function. So, you can see, you can check easily. This K of P C is the negative and it is zero if only if per C is equal to the given profile phi. So, in some sense, this is a major This is a measure of a function per C, measure of distance, the distance of function per C to a given web profile phi. Then we can define a solution of the Lucy definition system which is a function of t. So for each t, we can function of t so for h t we can we define the relative edge power function so uh we call it the capital w of z of t is this function okay and moreover we for given positive constant r we define the quantity uh by the infreema of this g of lambda for any lambda positive Or any lambda positive less than lambda head. Okay, so because here we list the comma kernel for each equation and appears here. And this quality is well defined as a positive because you can easily check g of zero is when lambda than zero it is infinite. Lambda tends to zero it is infinity. And also, lambda tends to lambda head, it's also infinity. And also, g is positive. So it's positive. So it's easy to see this quantity, CR, it's way to find positive for a given for any given positive constant R. Okay, so next let me describe the main theorem of this work. So let's assume C sub R is bigger than or equal to C star. C star is the minimum of the existence of the train wave for some positive constant R. And U is the solution of the system we are interested in. In terms of the G. In terms of a g coordinate, so this is system three, and for a given continuum, positive continuous initial data u0. And then we are given a positive train wave solution for some C bigger than equal to CR. The wave speed is bigger than equal to CR. So the C phi is our train wave. C5 is the Australian wave. We want to see whether this is stable in some sense. So, moreover, we suppose that there exists a set of positive constants sigma i, such that the relative entropy function satisfies this differential inequality. Linear equation appears here. Okay, and moreover, that c less than lambda head be the smallest pass root of the g dot of equals c. And if we assume, so the conclusion is if we assume initial data is such that with this weight of the entropy entropy relative entropy function, with this, this is the weight below. Weight belongs to below one and infinity. So here, this gives us some perturbation of initial data in some sense. Okay, so it's LO1 perturbation and infinity. So under this assumption, then the corresponding solution you will tend to wave profile. To the wave profile as t tends to infinity and it's locally uniform for z in the whole real line. Okay, so this is the main theorem in this work. Okay, and the proof actually proof is very simple. So first we uh first uh we uh we consider the the the linear problem with our raising relation term uh so the scalar equation okay and uh by the theorem of egan and rossi in 2007 uh under the assumption for the curl function j1 to j3 if the initial data is in If the initial data is in LO1 and LO infinity, then the solution of this linear equation, the initial initial problem, this equation, satisfy this decay estimate. So this is, so as you see, as t tends to infinity, this tends to zero. So this is the decay estimate. And the constant C depends on. constant c depends only on the one norm and infinite norm of the initial data with zero okay by using this uh uh property this decay property then we can easily check easily prove uh the main theorem so first uh uh it's easy to check the this function w with this uh a power A power lambda c damned c is defined by uh this uh uh quantity so corresponding to to a given given speed c and uh then we we multiply the the the target function w by this weight then we can check we say this inequality and then and then we go back Then we go back to the X variable. Then, so this becomes capital U. So you satisfy this inequality. So, but here you see the kernel, the kernel is not a probability density. So, because of this, we normalize, we normalize the we don't want to don't want to d this kernel so so this can be done by by by uh time uh introducing the new time variable tau then then we have uh uh this kernel uh to be a probability density and so the the decay estimate by ignite and the lossy can be used Philosophy can be used to conclude u of x tau tends to z to r star tends to infinity uniformly for x in r. And then we return to the original variable g and t, then our stability theorem can be proved. So it's very short proof, very easy proof. Of course, as you can see, there are lots of assumptions here. There are a lot of assumptions here. So, for example, one of the key is to choose a set of positive constants sigma i such that the relative entropy function says inequality, it's a linear inequality. So, this sort of and so the last minute next I will. Next, I will give you some applications. Okay, so to apply the stability theorem to some specific system, we first assume the system is an invariant set to be bounded or unbounded. And secondly, we assume this quantity I I define my sigma i u i minus y i f i u this is long positive okay for a chosen set of positive so this is actually a the okay it depends on the the the theorem uh we we want to check the stability for trail wave Wave okay, then we can derive the this inequality with this term here. But you see sigma i w i is w. So if we if f i of phi uh is bounded uh by r Uh, by R for any component for all components, then we can conclude from this inequality the desired linear inequality of the theorem. Okay, so the stability theorem can be applied. So, so as you can see, the two key points: one is to choose sigma i so that this quantity. To choose sigma i so that this quantity is link costing and then the this uh s estimate give some restriction. You see the the in the theorem okay here C R depends on R the logic of R the C the logic of C R. So this means the So, this means if we want to have a stability for all web speed C star, we need to choose a smaller R to close to so that the CR is close to C star. Okay, let me to be more precise for some examples. Okay, so first, let me show you. I will show you. I show you three examples. One is this single prey-predator system. So you one is prey, you two is predator. So linearity is usually a linearity. So this A is the predacy rate and B is the mass trans mass combustion rate. Okay, and if we assume B is big. And if we assume B is bigger than 1, AB next one, then C star defined by this quantity. This is by the relation of U2 equations at the present free state. So in this work, we prove this on Showing Wave connecting E plus to some positive state. And then in 2000. Wu in 2021 proved derived the exact limit, T limit of this E mass. And this is the wave exists for any C bigger than C stars for so-called super critical speed. And for critical speed, we need to assume J is completely supported. Okay, and next, so in order to apply C1, we First, the invariant set 01 and 0B exists very easy to check by the compression principle for scale equation. And then we choose sigma 1 to be 1 over R1 and sigma 2 is A over R2B. Then you can check very easy easy calculation, simple calculation, you can check the quantity I is positive. I is positive. And also, R is the maximum of R1, R2 times V minus 1. So the R1 can be applied. So moreover, if R1 is, if we assume R1 is less than or equal to R2 times mean minus 1, then this the CR corresponds to the C star. correspond to the C star. So this CR is equal to C star. So we have stability for any wave, for any wave speed, C bigger than equal to C star. Okay, and next example is the two predator, one prey. So B is also, we have the same conversion rate for predation and predation rate. And predatory rate are the same for each predator. And we assume the two predators are weak competition, weak competitors. So there's a weak competition between two predators. Then the existence of 12 wave connecting the present free state zero zero one and the unique positive record is a state. Was obtained joint work with Nakamura, Ogiora and Wu. For the classical division, and later these groups, this Landzhou group, they obtain the existence of travel wave for Lango dispersal. And here I make a remark here. The all existence theorem not restricts to the case of eco-divisivity divisivities, but the solidity we need to assume. Solidity: We need to assume equal divisibility. So, again, here by comparison for scalar equation, we have a very set for this predator to predict system. And we can choose sigma, sigma 2, sigma 3 so that the eye is length positive. And this actually is the same as the genome work for the classical diffusion case. And using And using the bands for web profile, we can see they can be computed by the maximum of these three quantities. So we have and also we have a C star, the minima wave speed is determined by this point. So again, theorem. So again, theorem one can be applied to obtain the stability for C bigger than CR. And if we assume R3 less than maximum R1, R2 times V minus 1, then CR becomes C star. So we have stability for all training wave with any speed. Okay, the last example is this. The last example is this epidemic model. You're already out of time. Oh, okay. Sorry. One more minute. One more minute. Okay, so actually, yeah, purple asking this. So this is the same thing we can. Okay. Yeah. And let me go to the conclusion, the discussion. So let's be a very brief conclusion. Very brief conclusion. So, stability for a co-relative system, the stability for larger disposal case can be derived by the same wish method because we have a compressible. So, there's a work by UENP in 2018. And for standard diffusion case, we have worked with Simojo last year. Last year. But unfortunately, our theorem can only apply to ecodifficity case. And long ecodiffs are widely open. And finally, here I give example which we can, even for ecodificivity, we cannot obtain the stability because we are unable to find the sigma mask. To find the second mask to get this is a case for every model, but with the so-called standard instance function. Okay, so thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions?
