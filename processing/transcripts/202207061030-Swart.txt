So, just after today, I'm doing quite a bit of topology. When you have to do these continuum objects, you have to really say how you converge in which sense and so on. And yeah, sometimes it gets you saying, Hey, I'm a problemist, I'm not supposed to do this. I've been teaching this big time, I've I've been teaching this scriptwork for Browning Consider. It's quite like we're browning a continuum called random tree, and in that subject, it's even stronger. You have all the written by all this, they don't put any property, they just use topology. So, here this will not be that extreme. So, I'm starting with that metric space and I define a rotation for the set of all compact subsets. To say all compact subsets. So it's all subset of E, and a particular plus of E are still with the non-empty ones. And on this space, there is a metric of topology, so here we go, that is created by the Hausdorff metric. The Hausdorff metric is defined by this, the distance between two compact sets and its remote. First set distance of points to the other set and the distance of point to a set I think that I don't have to explain is the minimum overall distance of two points in the other set. And I think the maximum is the supreme overall x2 in a two of the distance of x2 to So maybe quick pictures or words. Imagine that this is my first set in R2 and say that this is my other set, maybe K2, this K1. Then I'm looking for the point in point in k2 that lies furthest from the other set and i look at that distance and i look for the point in the first set that lies at the greatest distance of the other set and i take a maximum of these two distances and that naturally gives me a metric you can show it's a metric and suddenly the zero of the sets must be equal so that's a natural distance okay that's a half of metrics and that metric we find And that metric defines the topology on this base. And so we want to know when you converge. There is a criterion for that sequence of sets Kn converges, so the distance goes to zero, if and only if two conditions must be satisfied. First of all, there exists a compact set C. C first set Kn lies in C for all n, so a compact containment. And the second thing that must hold is that a limited set must be equal to the set of all points for which there exists a sequence of points taken from each of the approximating sets, such that these points converge to Points converge to that chosen point in X. That's not the only condition. That set must also be equal to the set of all X for which there exists again such a sequence Kn so that X is a cluster point of the sequence n. Of the sequence 6N. In other words, if I can from each of the approximately sets I just take a point, then I find a sub-sequential limit. I look at all these sub-sequential limits that must necessarily be the same as all the things that you can get by just stating limits. And if these two are equal, then these kn have a limit, and that is exactly this set. First, you always need this compact controls. You don't want, I mean, otherwise you would have sets up. In other devices, we have sets up look like this. Here you have a ball, and then you have a top point, and that point is out to infinity, it will converge, and that doesn't converge to the ball into the metric, and that's why you need it. But this would hold, so that's why you need the compact containment as well. What you can see from this, actually, is that if I would choose a different metric on this space that generates the same topology, then this metric, the house of metric would change. Then this metric, the Hausa metric would change, but the topology I would obtain from it on the set of non-anti-compact sets would again be the same. So the topology generated by the Hausa metric does not depend on the choice of the metric on the underlying space. So yeah, then the question is how you call that topology. I usually call it a Pausdroff topology. You have to be a bit careful because it's also something called Hausdorff topology. House of topologies. There's any topology that has the house of properties. There's a bit of household. Okay. So this now we have the topology on this set and it has nice properties. So if the underlying space is separable, then this space is also set. is also separable and if the underlying space is complete then this is also complete and in fact also this is compact that is compact i will say something a little bit more general uh when you have a topology you often know what the compact etc will not have a Complex sets, so when I have a general subset of the set of compact, non-empty compact subsets of B. This is a set of sets, and that is pre-compact. That means it's not closer, it's compact, if and only if that exists a C compact such that That K lies in C over all K in my big set of sets. So it's again compact containers. If and only if only the sets are contained in one big compact set, then it is a collection of compact sets. It's compact and there's some economy. So in particular, if E is compact, that's of course actually satisfied for it. That is also the answer. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, and then you can also check that you'll need to often is that you have random variables taking variables in this space. Now we know this is a nice space, right? If you start with some separable complete space, you get the separable complete space, Boli space. And if you have a sequence of random variables, random complex sets, then their laws are applied even only if. If and only if for every epsilon that access the C compact, such that the probability that this Kn is contained in C is at least you know, these properties have one proof, but as usual in the policy program. As a usual interpolation program, very long ago. Okay, so that's the first construction that we need. You take a metric space and you construct a new space, which is a set of non-empty complex subsets. Now we have a second construction that we need, and I'll call that a squeezed space. So I start again with an electric space. So I start again with an actual space and I construct a new space. And as a space, it is this thing. You take the Cartesian product of E with the real and you add two points. The first point you call minus infinity and the other equals infinity. And side is not an element of E, so you add some extra. So you add some extra. So let me draw a picture of R when you're when this is so this is the closed real line. It's the closed interval from minus infinity to infinity again points included. So how would that look like? I can draw it like this. I draw balls. So here I have C E, here I have my extended V O My extended real face. So, uh, yeah, it draws like this. So, here this one would more generally be space E, and here is the legal line. Here is my. Here is my one point star infinity, here is the point star minus infinity, and that's it basically. This is how I measure it. And I've drawn it in a specific way because this is the sort of topology I want to put on. This is why it's sort of called squeezed. I mean, I don't take at infinity, I want only one point. And I want it sort of as I approach. But as I approach, an element of this is something of the form x t, where t will often have the interpretation of time. And I sort of want to have a form of a topology that if t is very large, then I don't care where I am. I also limit on this side. So that's the idea. And you can do that. You can do that for any metric space. So that's a little construction. So let's choose some metric that generates a topology. metric that generates a topology on this space. Let's choose a function phi phi from this closed thing to non-negative. So that phi is zero at the end points and strictly positive. And let's then define. Uh, let's then define a metric row on this piece like this. Take a point XS and a point Y. What is L bar? R bar? R bar is the compactification of the wheels which you get like this. Yeah, it's a two-point concept of time. So now I put the metric on this space with the help of the metric on this closed real line and with the help of this function that is to deposit here and I do it like this and take here minimum five. Minimum by three, and here I take the distance from it y minimum is one, then I add Is times R T and I add finally this distance here. And the claim is that this is indeed a metric, so it's a bit. So it's a bit small calculation to check the triangle inequality actually for this. And it does what we want because now you can again write down a convergence criterion, a sequence in this space. So I mean, if these are these special points, then you should interpret this in the right way, right? Then the time is plus or minus infinite. So as soon as one of the times is plus or minus. So as soon as 100 times is plus or minus infinity, this minimum becomes zero. So you sort equal to ignore this, even though it may not be fine when it is a star, right? And then you have only these things left, which are defined for all times. And the idea here is that if one of the times is big, then this is small. So indeed, you're not going to care very much about this. Here, for technical reasons, I take a minimum with one. A minimum with one. If you have any metric and you take its minimum with one, it's again a metric. Which, by the way, shows you that saying that something is bounded in a metric space is not a polar sensible definition. You don't always change the metric. And so you feel based every distance is a small. And this generates the same probabilities. Okay, so now we have a convergence criterion. So the sequence converges. Converges in this metric, so this distance goes to zero if and only if, then you have to have two things. First of all, it's always necessary little times converge. And here I mean, of course, in this extended square line. And secondly, if the limit time t is real, Is real, then xn must control x. But if this time is plus or minus infinity, then this whole condition drops. You only need to check this. And this is easy to check. I mean, yeah, admitting that if this time is infinite, then you get here always zero, because you won't care about this, and you just need that this goes to zero. And you just need that this goes to zero, for which it's sufficient that the times converge. On the other hand, if this time is something finite, then first of all, these terms always make sure that your time must now converge. That means that the time here must also be finite from some n on. So then you really do clarify. And again, from this criterion, you say, I mean, I have constructed this in one particular way. One particular way, but precise construction is in fact not so important. Mostly, we will be only interested in the topology generated by this. And you can see to know the topology, you only need to know the topology on E. And again, you don't really care what this precise metric is. You only care really about the topology. But this proves that there exists actually a metric that makes such a topology. And that actually took me a while to write it down correctly. If you write this down correctly, you can check the triangle inequality. Okay. And I can tell you a bit why we need this. We will, in the entry box, have a functions of time that look like this, and we want to have something like locally uniform convergence of functions. And because here we don't really care where we are, we get exactly what you want. The function converges, not uniform. Function converges not uniformly everywhere, but only locally. That's the aim. I mean, this queas space has for the in the particular case that this is the central real line as we introduced in the first papers about the Brownian web by Latis Jankar and Jung for proponent as an isop okay so. Okay, so then again, basic properties. If the underlying space is separable, then the squeezed space is true. If the thing is complete, then the squeezed space is complete. And we need again a compactness criteria. So set A. A in this crease space is compact, even only if again it is locally compact, that I mean that for each compact time there exists a compact set of lying space such that if you intersect this If you intersect this A with this subset of all pairs where the time is between minus T, then that is contained in C times. And so if you restrict yourself, restrict yourself, you look only at the set of points in this. At the set of points in this thing that have time coordinates in here, and these spatial coordinates are compactly controlled, so it's sort of locally compactly control. Okay, so now we can get to what we really want: path space. So, definition path in E E It's gonna be a compact set in the squeezed space with the proper these two properties first of all for each real time that exists. There exists at most one x d such that x t is a set. And secondly, if I define this, I put it all times where you can actually find something. Time up here to as well. This should be an intro. Not any control. Non-empty control. So let me draw it a path. This could be a path, for example, here. I've drawn it a path. So if I look at any fixed time, there is at most one point. So here there is no point. Here is exactly one point in my set. The set is compact. And if I look at all of the And if I look at all times where there is one point, that forms an interval. So the path could go all the way up to infinity, we saw earlier, could go from minus infinity to affinity. And then because, so then undefined, so this is nice, this I call sort of the domain of the thing. Or maybe actually it's better to look only at real ones. Real master this is then domain domain and if you now have a uh now you can define a function pi, as I also call pi, from this domain to the set E that's simply defined by like this at E T. That PT point lies in the set, PSF set, right? So I can, if I have such a complex set, I can always view it as a function. For each, here I have my for each time in here, there's a unique point, and I denote that point by. So you can view you can view such a set you can view this thing as a compact set, but you can also view it as a function that is defined on a real interval. On a real interval. And because the set is compact, this interval actually always has to be close. Close to real interval, maybe infinite. And I claim actually that this function is always continuous. And conversely, each continuous function defines such a compact set. So, yeah. Excuse me, could you please tell me what the condition of alpha bar? I don't think you. Of i bar i contributed yeah at the right so what yeah so on the on the right there exists an x in the set e maybe including this point a star such that the pair here is in the set e as a skewed as a convex set yes i want to know what's the condition oh here right oh so that should be uh non-empty Non-empty, yeah, this is unreadable. I agree with that. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, and how do you see that these functions are continuous? So if I have a sequence of times tn and t. T n and T that lie in this E, T n goes to T, then I know because my set is compact and that these points lie in this compact set, right? So they are the set of all these points is the set. The set of all these points is in fact pre-compact, and so I can choose a sub-sequence that converges. And that sub-sequence converges to something that lies on E. But I know that for the given T, there's at most one, which I have called I T. So this converges. And it is true for each sub-sequence. So if you have a sequence of points that is pre-complex, then each then Three contacts in each, and if there's only one cluster point, then it actually converges. So these things must converge to this. And conversely, if I have a continuous function, then I map, yeah, then I can view it as a map from so here I have a compact interval and I have a continuous function that maps the a compact interval into this space. You know that the continuous image of a compact set is compact, so each continuous function gives me a compact set. Function gives me a compact change with this property. So it's a really wonderful one. Okay. So, what we now have to do is we keep that face straight up big eye. Big I O E L R S And because of the way I sort of I mean a path, we usually think of a path as a function defined on some closed field and continuous function on closed fields. But I said the different way of looking at it is that it's An equivalent way of looking at it is that it's actually a compact subset of this squeezed space. And this has now an advantage because now this is actually a subset of the set of all, as I said, it's a non-empty, possibly subset of all non-empty compact subsets of the real squeezed space of the size of the size of the but this is a nice space because we prove that this is separable, this is this and so on. Except for one of this, and so on. And this has a topology, a natural topology, namely the Hausdorff topology, as I just said, the one generated by the Hausdorff metric. So I can just put the induced topology here, which means that if I have two paths and I want to know how far they are from each other, I'm going to look at this outdoor distance. So I'm going to look at this, which point is further. Which point is furthest from that one and which one is furthest from that dynamic maximum. So that's going to be my topology on this balance stage. And I can tell you that the effect of this is sort of indeed that is, if I would say, you can prove precisely that if you have a sequence of functions pn and you have some other function pi, and they all have the same interval that they're defined, then They're defined. Then convergence in this thing is just locally uniform convergence. But now we have extended this to things that do not need to be defined on the same interval. And that is what you need in the dramatic paper. And in the older papers, you will see that they artificially, what they do is they artificially extend the function to the whole real line in a constant way. And then they say the extended one should locally uniformly converge plus the time galaxy. The time where it starts and the time where it ends with conclusions. We can prove that's equivalent. But this is actually because we activated this house of topology, so we're using it all over the place. This is very quickly. And also to find out the properties of this space, it's very handy to look at it this way. Okay. So I'm sorry. So you said they are defined in the same interval or the All the yeah, so all the pi n let's assume that pi pi n is uh x i pi for x n and that pi n goes to pi in topology here. If and only if yeah, if this is uh how would you say it if if the supreme of all t j of t Of t i n t i goes to zero for all compact subsets of I and then you said what happens if they are defined on different intervals? Yeah, then you have to go to my local definition, or you can look at them and then let's not do that. We stick to review because you said that the convergence of the tax. Really? Because you said that the convergence of the times in the context, definitely, but what has to be true is that the solution has notation or notation. So I also write down, so the extended domain, I can write as sigma pi out pi. So I call this the starting pi, and this is the final. And definitely, if you have a sequence of paths converges, then the starting. Sequence of paths converges, then the starting times and the final times converges. And otherwise, you cannot, you can again think of it as some sort of local uniform convergence, and because of this squeezing, but yeah, I want to show to you that if Show to you that if this is a Boeing space, then the L space is also a Boeing space. Because you know that Polyspaces are very handy for random variables, organized things that you want, actual regular conditional expectations and such other things that you don't have for upper spaces. I recall that only space means that it's separable and there exists a complete metric that generates the topology.  Okay, this is a point that is very important to make. A lot of people, you see a lot of papers where people claim that toric space is basically a complete separable metric space. And that is not quite true if you really do topology and say, no, no, no, no. Already as a student, I had a professor in Kroning and Eric Thomas. In cloning, and you're like Thomas who told me: No, no, no, Jana, you must do it right. And it's important because this says that there exists a complete metric that generates a topology. But unless the space is actually compact, if you have a non-compact polar space, then there always also exists metrics that generate the same topology, which are, however, not complete. And very often, people tend to think, oh, I must construct this complete metric. That is so important. This complete metric that is so important. Actually, it's not that important in many applications. You only need to know that there exists a metric that is complete and generates the same topology, but then you often choose to work with different metrics that generate the same topology, which are not complete. And this is for the Scola hot space, for example, it's actually very nasty to write down a metric that is complete, but then you hardly ever need. And there exist, in fact, techniques to And there exist, in fact, techniques to prove that space is poetry which don't even require you to explicitly write down this config. So this is a good point. And I want to show this one. I want to show that my bound space is always at the original space. Always, I'm going to do that now. And then you'll actually see that I'm using this thing. I'm not explicitly going to. What I need for that is something that for anybody needs it. You have moduli of continuity of R that is of all. Of all distances from the value seat at two times. Is it big enough still? Look at the distance between the values of the path of the time s and t. That I of course want s and t to lie in the domain. I also want them to be between my them to be the t minus big t over and importantly t minus s should be less or equal than delta so if delta is small your thing is it should be small you don't want to see big jumps in a very short time that that's what this thing allows That's what this thing allows us. Actually, if I view it as a contract set, I can define it more generally for any contract set. That looks like it would be the supremum of all distances, between volumes x and y, such that xs and y t by this compact set. By this compact set, and the rest is just a be fine for compact set, which has a small advantage. You'll see that in a moment. Yeah, this can be drawn, right? Because it will be okay. Because it must lie in your thing and these conditions. Next thing, it will also be handy to if I determine set, I can also just define i of j to be the set of all times x eighty differences that It also generalizes the definition we had before, just that each time where you find something, if you have a general compact set here, you can just look at all times where you see at least one point. Okay, so let me now define the prime to be. To be a set of compact subsets. So this big thing, that's creased space. There are compact subsets of it. Okay, this is one of it for which this thing is defined is an interval. And that is actually that lies. And that is actually that lies well as a subset of this and this is a it's a closed subset very easy to see and we have already shown that if this is a toy space and this is a correct space because we said and so if it's separable and complete and it's also complete and then here we also show that you can have a complete and uh metric. So this if this is floys, this is colloids, this is coins. Is columns, and I have a closed subset, so this thing is that we know for sure. But this is, of course, much more still than our path space because now we still need this condition that at each time you find at most one point in this, and this is how this comes in. And now you can check that my path. My part space, these are exactly those prime, such that the limit as delta tends to zero continuity of the things. So I define it as zero for all. But basically, I mean, what's definitely sure is that if you can find at the same time t, same time t, I can find two points, and definitely I can find, I can choose s and t equal here and have a positive distance. But then definitely this is going to be here. To PCF. And you can check actually this is true. Now I can write down A T epsilon delta. These are going to be all things that are sort of close to being a part of the certain sense. So they are all set. Prime of its modulus of continuity is sufficiently small. No, contrary, these are not at all. The complement of this is going to be something that is close to the balance. I have a question about this IFE. Why did you take the button? I think if you'll come in a moment, I think if we'll both are correct, I think. Yeah, I think both are correct. But you'll need to limit the syntax to try to remember that. I wanted to write down one more formula. I wanted to say that my path space is exactly. Now it's the intersection of all n union of all k complements of n over n and i think here's how this limit is written so it says that for each I should repeat that and Value and yeah, I guess that says that for each epsilon, that is a delta. So, for each D, definitely, for each T, but that's the first one, for each N, and for each epsilon, what's the second one, I guess? Yes, second one, and for each epsilon, that's the second one, so for each for each, that exists a delta, so that I'm in the complement of this. Complement of the set, which means that my things are less than two. So think about that it corresponds to this. The main point to make is that this can so this must have a public space, right? This is again a closed subsector. Easily check in the quality gives you a sorry is preserved and the taken. So it's preserved and the taken limits. For each fixed T epsilon delta, this is a closed subset of this only space. So its complement is open. And the union of open sets is also open. And what I have here is a counter intersection of open sets. And that, you may know, is a G delta set. That's called a G delta. Any set that can be. That's called a G delta. Any set that can be written as a countable intersection of open sets is a G delta set. And then there is a nice abstract theorem that I can apply that says that if I have a Polish space and I have a subset of that Polish space, where I put the induced topology, then in the induced topology, I will be Polish if and only if I know G delta set. What is a G delta set? Accountable in the section of the section. So, here I have proved that I'm the delta subset of this Baudi space. So, I have proved that I'm Baudish. And I've done so without ever constructing a complete net. And as you see, the proof is quite short. How to prove that you are Polish because you are a duty that you are using a matrix, you are constructing a matrix. Results if you think I should it's a good team for example I must honestly admit I'm never checking I should do this which dome exactly I suppose Okay, this was a nice sort of tip, but these people use these things more often. So I have a I have a sense. I have a set of parts, or a subset of the set of parts, and I call this such an equique continuous if and only if it's true that the limit as delta zero supremum. supremum over all bounds in my set of bounds of m c delta of zero for each right and uh I also say that I said it's complex and contained If for every T there exists a compact set such that T lies in this compact set for all parts. All parts collection of parts and for all times in their domain that lie if I can. So it can be locally compactly contained. Yes. So that's true if for every finite time you can find this compact set so that the functions on this interval On this interval, if it lies in the domain, take values only in this context. So it's sort of locally the functions which cannot go outside of the corporate set. And then we have a version of the Scotty theorem, and that says that A is a subset of my part space. Path space being compact closure is compact if and only if it's equally continuous and compactly contained. So, this is a slight generalization of the classical classical. The classical refers to collections of functions that are all defined on the same interval. Here we have very important difference, but the statement remains the same. And let me prove it. Let me prove sketchy truth. So this set three contexts. Now, first of all, you want its closure and the subset. So you any kind of this is contained in a larger space, this larger space. Larger space. So you can take it closer in this larger space. We have limits of parts, even if these limits may itself not be parts. They may just be compact subsets of your space. So you take its closure and that has to be compact, which, as we know, by the properties of the squeezed phase, is equivalent to A being. To A being compactly contained. And now we are using our characterization of compact subsets of this, and we are using our characterization of compact subsets of this to see that this is true. Skip the details. So that's one thing you need. And the other thing you need is that actually this closure should be contained in this set. Be contained in this set. Because if you now have a sequence of paths, I said, here I allow the limit to be not a path, but you don't want that. If you want it to be pre-compact, that's a set of this. You don't call a sequence of paths that has a limit, which is not a part. You don't call that convergent. So now the second condition that you need is that actually, if you take limits of paths, they are always parts. So, and that is exactly equivalent to A being A continuous. Why is that true? Well, let me go one way. If I take a sequence of paths and I assume I'm equipped continuous, so then let's assume that they converge to some limit, which maybe is a compact subset of the expression. I don't know. Of the squeezed space, and I don't know if the effect is so far. But if these things are equally continuous, then I can pull through the limit and show that the limit of delta to zero of mt delta of k is zero. And as I said, that implies that k is a pass. That's sort of how you do one, but if you continue, you show that. Continuous, you show that the limit that you these modules are continuity pools go to the limit and see that the limit satisfies those things and Delta checks the problem. This was enough for our solid for quality we need to touch it up. I did my first chapter in the first hour and second chapter in the second hour, but quite similar than my final chapter in my point I hadn't written my notes and I didn't know what I wanted to talk about. So let's do the planning well. So, as I said, we are now going to look at our aim is to look at the scaling limit of branching and coalescing random walks. In particular, I showed branching and coalescing random walks in continuous time and they're dual biased photon model. So now I'm going to first of all we're going to simplify things and we're going to look for the moment we're going to look just at coalescing random balls, no branch. I think, well, that's trivial, but in fact, if you study that very well, that will be a lot, tell you a lot about the branching cases. And the second thing I'm going to do, I'm going to stick to the convention and use actually discrete time a lot. It's somehow in pictures, it's easy. It's somehow in pictures, it's easier to graph, but believe me, in continuous time, you can basically do everything in the same way. So let's define the even subvectors on set rule. These are all points looks like. What I'm going to do now for each of these points, I'm going to draw an arrow that points up and goes either one step to the right or one to the left. And I'm doing this in an I and E fashion. Each arrow is chosen according to independent norms. Going to independent, not this one, already getting on top of that. So, maybe if I'm not around so I could look like this, for example, on the ground set. And these are eight values in minus one plus one. Okay, so what we will now be interested in is the phase of paths going up. So we will look at for each point at each point, can I see the result? Can I see that it's a unique way contributing? Yeah, probably it's uniform. It distributes. Okay, I need this space, which has come to me by my notation for the part stage. So these are all parts in this part of the extended line for which the final time. The final time is a fit initial time at the end. And we have to also be nice. So Z of pi is going to be pi at its initial time and the initial time. So it's a space-time point where the path starts. Okay. And now I say that. And now I say that path I in this set is a path in the arrow configuration. On the ground, if the following things are true, first of all, it should be true by T. I T by set to even for each set by the configuration for understanding the path. So they should pass through these points. Secondly, it will be true that if I then go one step further, Then go one step further. Then I add this omega. So these are these independent errors. So it's phi plus omega of phi t. So I am presently in this point. Now I look at the omega, which is plus or minus one with equal probabilities. I add it to my present position. I get the position. Present position, I get the position one time later. That's exactly here. And now, for what is this time t l in the sigma pi, and sigma pi was a starting time. I have to add it, otherwise, this is not defined, right? And the third thing I want is that I linearly interpolate that dot s is one minus s. is s t plus s plus one for all again so t is now integer it must be big or equal than sigma pi and s is going to lie in the unit interpolation this means simply that i interpret it in a linear way which are really easy for us okay and finally i define u I think I define U is the set I'm going to be interested in. So it's a set of paths and I'm going to say that this thing in a proper way, in our Escaled converges. And that's why we needed all that topology to formulate it and the first thing that you can check is that this thing is actually pre-compact. Well, pre-compact should be obvious, right? Because we know that these things are all lip sheets. So definitely the modulus of continuity is going to be finite in no other. Continuity is going to be finite. So it's big number. So this is going to be closer, it's going to be compact. And what you cannot easily check is that actually, if you add the closure, you don't get very much. These are the typical parts that I don't have to write down anything. So these are parts of this form. So you can have path that is constantly minus infinity and starts at any integer time. Any integer time can even have a path that starts at time minus infinity, and but it has to be constantly either plus infinity or minus infinity. All these paths you get by taking the closure, but you don't get anything more. All the other paths, except for these sort of triple paths that are always minus infinity or always plus infinity, you only have your single. So it's almost already now we define spins. We define stating so just if you were doing this in continuous time with the primary motions, how would the uniform modules of continuity work? We prove that. That is little proof. We'll do that probably tomorrow. We can make it in the last minute. But that is proof. Okay. Okay, so we're going to scale. All times, all positions we multiply with epsilon, all times by epsilon squared. And we continuously extend this function to this whole space. You can easily see that it's unique, continuous extension. And I'm going to use this notation for scaling in many ways. So if I now have a So, if I now have a set of points, then this is the image of that set under the scaling map. So, this I just defined to be a set of all theta and small sets. This set is the set A. So, in particular, A lies in this squeezed thing, this thing, right? Right, and in particular AB paths, right, and I can go one even one step further. If I have a set of paths, then I define again that epsilon, the image of this map. So it's this is the map of points, this is the map of sets, this is sets of sets of techniques. This is sets of sets can be a particular path and so on. And we also actually use this notation: the theta five two paths, so pi one and five two is just going to, I mean, I just define this as scale the first one and scale the second one. This sort of notation I will also use. I don't want to write like thetas and all over the piece, but theta just means that. But that one just means scale and it's different, and then the same that we really want to prove, well, not fully going to prove it very far to prove that is the error of Sloppy Newman Janka if you rescale this box thing. Look at its law converges weakly steps from zero to the law of some compact random set of parts which they then call the round number and of course you see here that what you have here that is a coalescing Here they are coalescing. Then on Mox if you scroop diffusion scale, they become coalescing emotions. So this is sort of, and these things start from every point. So if you make it dense, then you will basically get sort of coalescing around motions starting at every point in base end time. We have to be a bit more careful how to define that, but the thing exists and this convergence falls. And they were the first to introduce this sort of squeezed space and to. Squeezed space and to introduce the card space with the right topology and to show. I mean, the Brownian letter itself had been studied before. In fact, already around 1980, Aratsia was studying this, but he didn't quite finish his manuscript where it really was in. Then it was dormant, and then Dalian Tot and Ben Berner started to study self-repellent random walks in one dimension, and they needed this object, and they came up with it again. This object and they came up with it again. But they didn't use this topology called stuff that I use here. So they, I mean, they basically view this as a collection of paths. So for each starting point, you have a path. So you can view it as a function from the starting point to a path. And then there's a question, how do you, for example, choose a right continuous version, which is basically what they did. But these people realize that it's sort of better to do it in this way, particularly if you want to prove conversion. Particularly, if you want to prove convergence, you have a nice framework to prove convergence, then this is really a very pleasant way of working with data images have some kind of status. Need that the object.
