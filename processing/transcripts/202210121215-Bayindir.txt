And so he'll tell us about adjoining roots to ring spectra, algebraic K-theory, and chromatic redshift. Thanks, Osgur. Go ahead. Okay, thank you very much. This is a joint work with Christiana Soni and Tassos Molinos. Okay, so the main goal of this work is to study the algebraic K-theory of ring spectrum. And I will start by motivating. And I will start by motivating this through its connections with H-cobordisms of manifolds. And in this work, what we do is that we start with a new construction for adjoining roots to ring spectra and look at the effect of this on THH, the resulting THH and algebraic K-theory. So, actually, this is kind of similar to the theme. Of similar to the theme, a part of Samek Bashu's talk. In that work, they come up with a formalism to take quotients of ring spectra, and then they look at the resulting effect at the level of THH. So, actually, it's philosophically similar to that. So, this construction of adjoining roots, we show that it results in interesting graded ring spectrum structures. Ring spectrum structures, and in particular, it equips our spectra of interest, which are the Morava E-theories, with structures of graded ring spectra, which ends up with splittings, providing splittings at the level of algebraic K-theory. Along the way, we make a new definition of logarithmic THH or an alternate definition of log THH, and we show that this procedure is logarithmic THH at all. At all. And at the end, I will give applications of these results. One of them is to two categorical real vector bundles, and the other application will be to stable H cobortisms of eight odd dimensional spheres. Okay, so for a topological space, the A theory of the topological space, or sometimes also called the algebraic K theory of the topological space. Break K-theory of the topological space is given by the suspension spectrum of loops on that space U. And the interesting, one very interesting thing about this A-theory is that if you start with a closed differentiable manifold, then Walthausen's theorem says that the A-theory of M contains what's called the smooth whitehead spectrum. What's called the smooth whitehead spectrum of M as a sum end. And what's interesting here is that the smooth whitehead spectrum, it is built out of pseudoisotopy space of M through some sort of a stabilization procedure, a meaningful stabilization procedure. And it contains information regarding pseudoisotope space, H-cobordenism space, and the fermorphism space of M. So this is kind of a So, this is kind of an important point where this theorem basically tells us through this theorem Walthausen tells us that, okay, there is a new way to study these topological properties of these manifolds, and that is through this completely new direction, through algebraic K theory of topological spaces. But the problem with this is that algebraic K theory, so I mean, although this A theory or algebraic K theory of topological space. Theory or algebraic K-theory of a topological space contains important information. Algebraic K-theory is often very difficult to understand and compute. And even the most basic case, the A-theory of a point, turns out to be almost impossible to completely understand. Or this corresponds to the algebraic A-theory of the sphere. But this is quite important because A-theory of a manifold always contains Manifold always contains a theory of a point as a retract, and on top of that, a theory of a manifold would always be a module over a theory of a point or the algebraic k-theory of the sphere spectrum. So, basically, at this point, Waldhausen, basically, after Walthausen's work, this becomes a goal on its own to understand the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum. And for this, And for this, Walthausen makes a conjecture, which is later carried forward by Alson and Ragnis. The conjecture says that we should basically attempt to understand K-theory of the sphere spectrum by understanding its chromatic localizations. So, this is basically stealing from the chromatic theory approach to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres. You just play K. You just play K in front of the theorem or the conjectures at the time available. And so he's saying, so, okay, this should be an equivalence, therefore we should just study the localization. And Alsonian and Rugnis look at this localization from the Kn local sphere to En as some sort of a Galois extension. And through some conjectural Galois, the same property. Conjectural Galois, the same property, say that they expect that the k-theory of the k-n local sphere, which should give us these guys for each n basically, should be possible to understand through these fixed points of k-theory of Morava E-theories. So, and basically, this program kind of like now has a direction, and the first step is. Direction and the first step is to compute the algebraic k-theory of Morava E-theories. And this is a question that Assoni and Ragnus attack for n equals one. So we get a computation of the algebraic K-theory of E1, which is basically a p-completed complex k-theory spectrum. And so And so the little Ku is going to denote the connective cover, of course, and the homotopy groups of this ring spectrum is given in this way, where U2 is the bot generator. It's a generator in degree 2. So it has this nice structure. And K has what's called the atom sum and which splits as a spectrum. It splits complex K-theory in this way. And this other. Theory in this way. And this Adamstum and its homotopy groups are given in this way. So it is also a polynomial algebra, but with a generator in degree 2p minus 2. This generator corresponds to the periodic elements in the quotient of the sphere spectrum, V1. And the point is that this V1 in Lp, so Lp maps into Kup. You can kind of like see this through the splitting. Know, like, see this through the splitting, but there's a infinity map too. And through this map, v1 corresponds to the u2 to the power p minus one, basically. And you can see at the level of rings, the relationship between Lp and KuP to be that of a rooted junction after taking homotopy groups. So basically, if you take the homotopy ring of Lp, adjoin a P minus one. Lp, I join a p minus one root force by taking a polynomial algebra over the homotopy ring of Lp and then doing the appropriate quotient. That precisely gives you the homotopy ring of Ku P. And the computation of the K-theory of E1 or complex K-theory follows by first Asoni-Rogner's computation of algebraic K-theory of the atom sum end, and then after this computation. Some end. And then, after this computation, Asoni computes the T2, the V1 homotopy of algebraic K-theory of KUP. And what kind of like initiated the interest in this project, the interest for ideas in this project, was actually what's going on at the level of T2 homology. So what's going on is that T2 homology of the algebraic K-theory of KUP. K-theory of Kup is precisely given by the T2 homology of LP adjoin a p minus one root to V2. So this is very interesting and kind of I'm guessing there wasn't much of a reason to expect this initially, but what comes out of these very complicated computations is that what appears to be adjoining a root of order p minus one to v1 one to v1 results in adjoining a root to of order p minus one to v2 at the level of algebraic k theory so adjoining a root results in adjoining a root in at the level of k theory and you observe that and one other interesting thing is that you adjoin a root to v1 that in turn adjoins the root to v2 so this is very interesting so there is some sort of redshift going on in i mean this is part of redshift In, I mean, this is part of redshift, I guess. Um, that you adjourn a root to v1, and that turns into a root adjunction to v2. So I'm going to turn my lights on in the meantime because it just got dark outside and it's getting darker here. Okay, maybe if I do this, okay, There's a question in the chat. Oh, yeah. I should have included that there. Yes. There's a negative sign in here. And yeah, I should have included that there. So there is actually, it's a root of negative v2. Yes, thank you for the correction. Okay, so what we do is. Okay, so what we do is that, okay, what can we see in general about rooted junction and what's going on at the level of algebraic K-theory? And so what we do is we start with this method to adjoin roots to ring spectra. And so for whenever I talk about a root adjunction to ring spectra, I make these assumptions that I start with an m larger than zero that will be the Than m larger than zero, that will be the degree of the rooted junction. And k has to be even. And I start with an E2 ring spectrum, even and positive. I start with an E2 ring spectrum with even homotopy and pick a class at the level of homotopy of degree mk. And we're going to adjoin a m root to this class. So, one thing I want to note is that we are actually able to adjoin roots to ring spectra in a more general scenario, which would include, for instance, adjoining roots to more of E-theories, which are not E2. But I'm not going to omit that generality and just stick to this generality for the sake of simplicity. Okay, so this is the setting. Is the setting so one object we use is the free E1 algebra over k-sphere? It is going to be denoted in this with this notation. And one fact we have, I think, from Lurie, but it might be some you may believe it should be attributed to someone else. I'm not very sure, but something we know from Lurie is that these three E1 algebras turn out to be E2 algebra. Algebras turn out to be E2 algebras, so they are not just E1. And there is also this result of Hanel Wilson, partially could be attributed to Lurie II actually, is that these somewhat behave like 3E2 algebras, although they're not 3E2 algebras. If you have any two-ring spectrum of this sort with even homotopy and you pick a class of degree. And you pick a class of degree mk, there is always an E2 map from the free E1 algebra to X that carries the generator to the object X you started with, to the homotopy class you started with. So there is always an E1 map of this form. Simply, these are free, but there is also E2 maps of this form too. And this can be observed, this follows by the fact that these things have some sort of what's called a E. The E2 algebra even cell decomposition, basically. So you can attach even cells and obtain these things. And because this has trivial odd homotopy groups, the obstructions to lifting such a map vanish. So you have such a map, E2 map. And then you can start with the free E1 algebra with the generator in degree K, in a lower degree, and then map. And then map the again have an E2 algebra map from the free E1 algebra with a generator in degree mk to the other one that carries sigma mk to the sigma to sigma k to the power in homotopy. So what we do is that we kind of like reprove these results using shearing functors and so that we have both of these maps simultaneously. simultaneously. And that allows us to make the definition of what we call X adjoiner m root to X and that is we define in this way it's basically just a relative smash product over sigma mk and if you and because we start with E2 maps this turns out to be an E1 algebra. It's actually an E1x algebra as you would want it to be. As you would want it to be. And if you check the QNA spectral sequence, you observe that the homotopy groups of this ring spectrum is given exactly as we want it to be. The homotopy groups of X adjoint root is homotopy groups of X and then adjoint root as a ring. In the way I mentioned earlier, take the free polynomial algebraic quotient out. formula algebraic quotient out okay so we have this construction and do the examples we are interested in uh can can can they be obtained in this way right and we were interested in more available e-theories for this program to compute algebraic k-theory of the sphere spectrum and it turns out you can actually obtain these ring spectra in this way moreover e-theory can be obtained from k-n localized johnson wist From Kn localized Johnson-Wilson spectrum. By first smashing with the spherical width vectors, that's just to make the Zp coefficients into width vector coefficients. And then I join a root p to the n minus one root to vn. So you kind of like force it to be too periodic, basically. That's what you do. For n equals one, this recovers the case we mentioned, I mentioned. The case I mentioned at the very beginning. So, KUP can be obtained from LP by through this router junction procedure I mentioned. And okay, why are we interested in obtaining these ring spectra through this procedure anyway? One reason is because this gives us graded ring spectrum structure that allows us to have better control over what's going on. Better control over what's going on at the level of THH. So, let me remind you what a graded ring spectrum is. It's basically you take the classical definition of a discrete graded ring and you replace all occurrences of tensor products with smash products and co-products with coproducts. So, you can define a graded ring spectrum in this way. It's just a spectrum that splits as a co-co-product, and the multiplication should carry. multiplication should carry the weight i part times weight j part to weight i plus j part and the unit should lie in weight zero so i'm gonna call these um sum and weight pieces i'm gonna i'm not gonna use the word degree i'm gonna call them weight to just i want to notify that of course in the infinity categorical setting you don't make these definitions through such axioms you rather want to have a concrete construction Rather want to have a concrete construction of a category, and you want these to be algebras in these categories. The correct way to do this is to say that this is you start with the functor category from integers to spectra, equipped with deconvolution, monoidal structure. So note that as an infinity category, this is just a product category, right? So that means objects are precisely, you know, can be thought in this way. Be thought in this way, and then EN ring spectra there are precisely EN algebras in this category. I mean, if you look at the definition of day convolution and what it does, you would see immediately that an associative algebra is given in this way, basically. Okay, so there's something going on here. We don't get greater spectra out of root a junction, actually. That was not true. That was not true because of the following reason. So you start with a ring spectrum, right? And you want the root A junction to give you a graded ring spectrum. What you do is you place this ring spectrum in the weight zero, and it becomes a graded ring spectrum in a trivial way, just like you can do with a ring in the classical case. You put it in the degree zero, and now you want to put the root to. To put the root to degree one, what happens is that the mth power of the root goes to weight m, right? And that's not what you want. You want the mth power of the root to go back to where you started with, which is in weight zero. So this doesn't work actually. What you need is that you want m to be equal to zero, basically. And therefore, what you look at here is z mod. Is the modem graded ring spectra. So you want to look at these modem gradings. And what you do is that you take the previous definition, replace all integers, occurrences of the integers with Z mod M. And this time the weight multiplication works with weight modulo M. Therefore, the M to pair. Therefore, the empty power of your root would be what you want it to be, basically. It would lie in weight zero. Okay, so why does root adjunction result in m graded ring spectra? So these are my every time I join a root to ring spectrum, I'm going to put these assumptions there. So let's look at this object again. So let's look at this object again. So, as an E1 algebra, you can immediately see that this is a graded E1 algebra, right? Because it splits and the product works exactly in the way you want it to work. But what Lurie shows is that this is actually a grade D2 algebra. And you can turn this into a Z modem grade D2 algebra through con extension, left con extension. extension, left CAN extension. What this does is that the weight I part in Z mod M graded is given by a coproduct of all weight pieces that are in weight equal to I modulo M. So you just take everything and take their co-product and put them in weight I. So this is basically the canonical thing to do. This basically is given by a left kind extension. And then the other two objects involved in Objects involved in rooted junction, you put them in weight zero, you can force them in weight zero. Um, and and they become Z modam graded E2 algebras, and then you take this mash product at the level of Z modem graded spectra. And everything goes through, but the E1 algebra you obtain at the very end is a graded E1 algebra in the situation. And the grading is non-trivial, it's not that everything is. Is non-trivial, it's not that everything is in weight zero, so this formula precisely says that. No, I mean, the root actually is in weight one, and then the powers will be in appropriate weights. Okay, so we gathering these two facts that EN is obtained via root adjunction and root adjunction results in Z mod M graded ring spectra, we obtain that more. spectra you obtain that Morava E-theories are Z mod p to the n minus one graded E1 algebra and the pieces are given in this way so these are non-trivial gradings and the n equals one case tells us that complex k-theory spectrum is also a Z mod P minus one graded L algebra and and the pieces And the pieces are given in this way. And this basically, and this can be thought of as some sort of improvement on Adam's classical result that gives us this splitting. So we say that it splits, but this result furthermore says that this splitting is compatible with the E1 ring structure. With the E1 ring structure. So we have these graded ring structures. But our goal was ultimately to understand THH and algebraic K-theory. Basically, ultimate goal is to understand algebraic K-theory. For that, we need to understand THH. And so here, I want to give a very quick reminder on trace methods. Trace methods to show how we go from topological Huxley homology to algebraic K-theory. So, this was in Samek Pasha's talk too. Topological Huxley homology is defined as the realization of the cyclic bar construction, which is a simplicial spectrum where these phase maps are given using the multiplication on your ring spectrum. So basically, Your ring spectrum. So basically, the first phase map here would be multiplying the first two elements, the second phase map would be multiplying the second and the third elements, and then the third phase map would apply cyclic permutation and then multiply the first two elements. So for a ring spectrum, you can define this cyclic bar construction. And the realization of this simplicial object, simplicial spectrum, gives you THH, the homotopy groups of that gives you the Groups of that gives you the THH groups. Furthermore, there is a CN action in degree and plus one. So basically, in degree zero, there is no action. In degree one, there is a C2 action given by switching these two factors. And then here there's a C3 action. And then here there's a C3 action given by cyclic permutation. So, and all these actions provide an S1 action on THH of X. So, I will quickly give the definition of topological cyclic homology and show the connection of topological cyclic homology with algebraic K-theory, although I'm not going to use it directly. I'm not going to use them on the rest of my talk. Use them on the rest of my talk, but I wanted to make the connection. So, as I said, there is a circle action on THHX that comes from these cyclic permutations. And furthermore, that comes together with the Frobinus map from THHX to the Tate construction on THHX, which is an S1 equivariant map. And due to the recent work of Nick. The recent work of Nicolas and Shause, one can define topological cyclic homology as the fiber of a map from homotopy fixed points of THH of X to tape construction later applied homotopy fixed points. And this map is given by, so this is phi P, the Frogenous map here. The map is given by substructure subtraction. Subtraction of these two maps, where the first is the Frobenis map later applied fixed points, and the second one is what's called the canonical map that comes from the canonical map from fixed points to tate construction. And what connects TC with algebraic K-theory is done this good William-McCarthy theorem, where I give a special case of this theorem in here. Here. So here, this theorem says that if you, in this situation, there is a pullback score where the bottom row is given by the algebraic k theory of this discrete ring, which is pi zero of x, and t c of this discrete ring, which is pi zero of x again. And let's say you're in a situation, hopefully, that you're. In a situation, hopefully, that you already know the algebraic K-theory and TC of these discrete rings, which are supposed to be easier. Hopefully, you know them. And then, through this pullback square, in order to obtain algebraic K theory of X, what you really need to do is to obtain the T C of X. So, once you have T C of X going to algebraic K theory of X becomes much simpler. So, that's how we get from THH to C, T C. And so, what was the goal? The goal was to understand K-theory, therefore, we need to understand THH. And what we had through this root adjunction procedure is a graded ring spectrum, a mod M-graded ring spectrum. And what we know about such rings-graded ring spectra is that THH of such ring spectra results in Results in an S1 equivariant graded spectrum. In other words, THH of graded ring spectra split S1 equivariantly. And such splittings are very useful. So these are used in calculations of computations of algebraic K-theory of discrete rings in the past, for example, for algebraic K-theory of truncated polynomial algebras. For ring spectra, For ring spectra, actually, in other work, we use such splittings to compute algebraic K-theory of THHFP, which also happens to be a graded ring spectrum. And these splittings become very essential for these computations. So, computationally, this is a very useful thing. And since I gave you the definition of THH, I want to show you exactly where this splitting comes from. It actually comes from From the place where you obtain such gradings on classical computations. Basically, if you take the Hackschel tomology, the classical one, of a discrete graded ring, then that's a graded object in some sort of an obvious way. And that translates into the spectral situation too. The spectral situation, too. So, PHH is defined as the geometric realization of the simplicial complex. And in degree S, the simplicial complex is given by an S plus one smash power. And because smash products commute with core products, this can be written in this way, right? So each piece can be written as this huge coproduct of pieces. Of pieces. And what you notice is that if you take the cofactors, so the weight I piece here comes from the cofactors for which the sum of the indices is equal to I. If you take these cofactors, you immediately notice that this is invariant under face maps, degeneracy maps, and the permutation. Therefore, you obtain a sub-simplific spectrum. And this also, because this also respects the cyclic permutation that creates the S1 action, then what you obtain at the end is an S1 equivariant splitting. So that's where the splitting originates. Originates so summarizing now for X adjoin root because it's a graded ring spectrum now THH has an S1 equivariant splitting. So the first thing we do at this point is that we study the THH of X adjoint root and in particular what's going on at the level of this splitting. And the very first result in this work states that if XSP log That if x is p local, so I put that hypothesis there, and I think it's going to be there for the rest of my talk. If x is p local, and if p doesn't divide them, then the canonical map from th of x to the weight zero part of x adjoint root, because x is weight zero, it goes to weight zero part of th x adjoint root. This canonical map is an equivalence, right? And for this, For this, one needs the hypothesis that p doesn't divide m and p locality. If you remove these hypotheses, this is no longer true. There are counterexamples, so you really need those hypotheses there. And this identifies the weight zero piece of THHX hydrogen root. And in particular, it says that. And in particular, it says that the canonical map is the inclusion of a wedge summit. And for to identify the other pieces, we consider logarithmic TH. Again, these are my standard assumptions whenever I join a root. And we define logarithmic THH in this way. So looking at this carefully, maybe I can give a feeling of where this, how we thought about this definition. Definition. So, this piece here should be thought of as the logarithmic th of the free algebra of this guy. What you do is that you invert your generator, which lies in, again, we think about these as graded ring spectra. So, this generator lies in a positive weight. When you invert it, the inverse goes to a negative weight, right? Goes to a negative weight, right? So, pH of this object has negative weight components, and then what we do is that we take connective cover in weight direction. And in order to convince yourself that this is the correct definition of this is a correct definition of log th of this free algebra, of this free algebra, basically. Of this free algebra, basically. You can take its HC homology that and you can compute that, and you would pretty quickly see that that gives you the log Huxlet homology, the classical Hackschik homology of the free polynomial algebra, as it should. So smashing with HC should do a base change to the classical case. Phase change to the classical case. And it does. If you look at it a little carefully, then you would immediately notice that it does what it should do. And then in the discrete setting, for example, for discrete rings, you can define log THH. And this way, you can start with the definition of the free object and then make this mash base change to log THH of your discrete ring. And so this is where that this relative. Where this relative smash product comes from. So, in a forthcoming work of Sanat Developer Pulkar and Tassos Molinos, they show that this definition actually is equivalent to the earlier definition of John Radmus. So that's another way of knowing that this definition should be meaningful. Meaningful. Okay, so using this definition, we show that root adjunction, again, under the same assumptions of p locality and p doesn't divide the order of root adjunction, that log th of x-adjoint root is given by a base change through log th of x. In particular, this means that logo is x. Particular, this means that log th of x adjoin root is just shifted copies of log th of x. This is also called logarithmic th at home. This also works for certain E1 algebras, not only for E2 algebras. It, for example, works for more of a K-theory too. So you can adjoin a root to more of a K-theory, look at what's going on in log THH using this definition. Using this definition, and again, you can see log THH at once. Okay, so combining these two results, actually, what we obtain is a complete description of these coproduct splitting of THH X-adjoint root in terms of THH of X. This is the weight zero part, and this is the other weight pieces. The other weight pieces and log THH of X. So once you know THH of X and log THH of X, you obtain THH of X at your root. If you know THH of X, you can obtain log THH of X through this fiber sequence, which in many cases should be feasible. So that's how to go from THH of X to THH of X at your own reach. And in a forthcoming work with Christiana Soni, we're planning to obtain, we're obtaining a simplified computation of T2 homology of K-theory of KUP using logarithmic, this new definition of logarithmic THH and our construction of graded ring structures on KUP and Sanata and Tasos work on logarithmic KHA. Logarithmic THH. Okay, so I was one thing that came out of this theorem is that THH of X splits THH of X adjoint root, right? And this carries all the way to algebraic K theory. And we obtain this theorem that algebraic K theory of X adjoint root contains algebraic K theory of X where I Theory of X, where I'm just putting M as just some spectrum at this point. But so this theorem is basically saying that the canonical inclusion is the inclusion of a wedge summary. Again, you need X to be P local and P shouldn't divide M and applying this to the earlier result that you can obtain That you cannot obtain Morava E-theories from Bram-Peterson spectra or Johnson-Wilson spectra through a rooted junction. You obtain, together with this theorem, you obtain that algebraic K-theory of En gets to be split by the algebraic K-theory of Brown-Peterson spectrum with vector coefficients, Tn plus one locally. Of course, this Tn plus one. Locally. Of course, this Tm plus one localization comes from the purity results in algebraic K-theory because at certain points you need to do some Tm plus one equivalence. This is what you get. But so there is a splitting. So this is some sort of what we have for higher height case of at the moment, what we have for higher height case of passage from K theory of L to K theory of K u, right? That was Asoni's result. Ku, right? That was Asoni's result, the passage from there to there. And in the higher height case, this should be considered, maybe this should be considered as the first thing to compute in order to go to K-theory of EN. And then one would consider computing algebraic K-theory of EN. And we obtain an information about the passage from the easier one to the more difficult one. One to the more difficult one, basically. Okay, so one of the initial goals in this project actually was to compute the prove redshift for Moravo E-theories. And we were pretty confident that we were going to get there, but Ellen Yuan did it before us. And even they went further. It's Schlank, Brooklund, and Yuan recently showed that redshift. Show that redshift they verified redshift for all E-infinity ring spectra. But we wanted to keep our proof of redshift for Moravi E-theories in this work, because along the way, we prove redshift for certain E1 ring spectra, E1 ring spectra that is not covered by the theorem of. That is not covered by the theorem of Brooklyn Schlank and Yuan. So we start by proving the redshift conjecture for Morava K-theory. And I must say that by redshift, I mean that the Tm plus one localization of algebraic K-theory is non-trivial. So this is the redshift in the sense of Brooklyn, Sri Lanka, and Yuan. Sri Lanka and Yuan, not in the sense Hannah and Wilson are talking about it. So we're not using the FD type and definition. Anyway, so we prove redshift for, in this sense, for more of a K-theory spectrum and for every ring spectrum mapping into Km. So this turns out to be quite useful to derive redshift conjecture for other ring spectra, especially ring spectra obtained via Spectra obtained via quotienting out elements or inverting elements in complex cobordism spectrum in Mu because Kn is a spectrum because it's a field. It's uniquely determined by the fact that it's field and its height. And its E1 ring structure, due to angelweight results, its E1 ring structure is also unique. So, for example, if you start with any form of PPN, it maps into. Of BPN, it maps into KN, it maps into KA. So we obtain redshift for all forms of BPN. Again, Hannah and Wilson proved redshift for BPN, but they only proved it for the forms of BPN that are E3MU algebras, but this proves this covers all E1 ring spectrum from E1 MU algebra form of BPN, all forms of BPN, let's say. And then And then other ring spectra, I mean, there are other ring spectra you can show easily show to be mapping into Kn. For example, if you start with Brown-Peterson spectrum, non-truncated invert Vn, that's a height n spectrum. And that also satisfies the redshift conjecture because it maps into K. And then the thing is that we combine this with our root. Uh, with our router junction result, uh, because proving redshift due to purity results, uh, recent purity results, proving redshift boiled down to proving some sort of non-triviality. The non-triviality, Tm plus one, and due to this equivalence, Tm plus one local non-triviality of Kx implies the Tm plus. The Tm plus one local non-triviality of k-theory of X adjoint root. We deduce that if X satisfies the redshift conjecture, then X adjoint root also satisfies the redshift conjecture. There should be a connectivity assumption here. I think I didn't carry it from the previous slide. X should be connected, but it doesn't matter ultimately. Tm plus one locally. Tm plus one locally. But yeah, so this allows you to obtain new examples of redshift. For example, we can construct this two-periodic Morava KTR spectrum by adjoining p to the n minus one root to vn. So that also satisfies redshift. There is this what might be called essentially two periodic form of PPN that's obtained from That's obtained from BPN via router junction. We know BPN satisfies redshift, so this will also satisfy redshift. And through this, so the initial goal was to prove redshift for Morava-E theories, and one can also obtain redshift for Moravi-E theories through this procedure. Basically, start with BPN, adjoin a root, and obtain something TN locally equivalent to EN, and therefore obtain. And therefore, obtain redshift for more of a E theory C n. Okay, so that's redshift. And so I want to talk about other applications of our results. So KU, as I mentioned earlier, classifies virtual complex vector bundles. And aside from the motivation I mentioned in the The motivation I mentioned in the beginning for computing K-theory of the sphere spectrum, algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum, another important motivation for Asoni's computation of V1 homotopy of algebraic K-theory of KuP was due to the result of Bus, Dundas, Richter, and Ragnes, which says that algebraic K-theory of KU classify virtual complex two-vector bundles. complex two vector bundles so so so what they what algebraic k theory of ku classifies is is the bundles where the fibers um have to be um the category of complex vector spaces rather than just a complex vector space and um and so this was one of the motivations and then there is the real counterpart of ku which is k Counterpart of KU, which is KO, that classifies real vector bundles. And algebraic K theory of KO again classifies virtual real two vector bundles. So there is also a motivation to compute algebraic K theory of KO. And what we do is that we compute this, we obtain this through our rooted junction formalism. And through the previous computations of Christiana Sony. So basically, Ku P can be obtained from KOP for P larger than 3 by adjoining a square root to the class called alpha. And therefore, algebraic K theory of Ku P as a spectrum contains algebraic K theory of KO as a sum. Through this, we obtain a complete Obtain a complete description of V1 homotopy theory, V1 homotopy groups of algebraic K-theory of KOP, which I'll not write here because it's quite complicated. But I'm going to write the final result in T2 homology because it's interesting, but I'm going to again write it wrong because there should be a negative sign here, as John Ragnas just warned me. So there is a negative sign there. There should be. sign there there should be so the t2 homology of k theory of ko uh can be obtained from t2 homology of k theory of l by adjoining a p minus one over two root to negative root two so so so in this case actual ko can also be obtained from l by adjoining a p minus one over two root instead of p minus one root and as you would expect at the end you get At the end, you get another route take junction at the level of T2 algebraic KT. Okay, so finally, so since it fits to the theme of the conference, I wanted to talk about these applications of these results and methods that we were observing with Yejit Jang separately from the main project, but it kind of follows from there. As I mentioned at the very beginning, As I mentioned at the very beginning, Walthausen's theorem says that for closed smooth manifolds, A-theory provides the smooth whited spectrum. And if you take the infinite loop space and then loop it again, this gives you this stable H-cobordism space of the manifold. And stable H-cobordism space is again a space obtained from the H-cobordism space through. From the H-cobordism space through some sort of a stabilization procedure. Okay, let's look at what's going on if we put replace m with an odd-dimensional sphere of dimension larger than one. Yes, so dimension larger than one. So, in this case, you to compute a theory of this sphere, you would be computing the k-theory of this. This gadget, and due to senate splitting, this is precisely the free E1 algebra. So, this is what's inside K-theory. It's precisely the free E1 algebra on degree 2n. So, this is exactly the object I was talking about earlier. And it's kind of a tautology, that you can think about this free E1 algebra as the ring spectrum obtained from the Spectrum obtained from this free E1 algebra with the generator in degree two and in a larger degree generator through a root A junction. This is kind of like if you look at the definition, this is the tautology. And actually, the theory goes through in this case two, and the k-theory splitting also goes through in this case. So the k-theory of this free E1 algebra gets to be split by the k-theory of the other. Be split by the k-theory of the other E1 algebra, which carries a generator in a larger degree. And you can one can show that this results in a splitting of the stable H-cobordism spectrum. So this H-cobordism space is an infinite loop space. So here I think about it as a spectrum. One can show that the spectrum splits as a Gets to be split by the H-cobordism spectrum of the sphere of larger dimension. And it's kind of fun to think about this. You can actually keep carry on the splitting and you can further split this spectrum too. And you would have, again, up to p completion. If you pick these integers larger than one for which p doesn't divide. For which you know, p doesn't divide, then you can show that actually the stable edge cobortism space of the sphere gets to be split by all these stable edge cobordisms of these larger and larger dimensional spheres. And also what follows is that these suspension spectra appearing here also gets to split the H-cobordism spectrum, and you also. And you also have these suspensions of the sphere spectrum appearing in here. So, yeah, so that's one application of the splitting of algebraic K-theory to the H-cobords, the stable H-coboards in space. Okay, so I will stop here. Thanks. Thank you, Osgur. Are there any questions for Osgur here in Oaxaca? I have a question, but it might be a little. I think this is probably silly, but in the root junction procedure, why is taking the SMASH product the right thing rather than, say, taking a push-out in E2? Push out an E2 ring spectra or an E1 ring spectra. Yeah, yeah. Definitely something we thought about. All three give three different answers, right? All three give you different answers. And you have all these nice theorems for the one who chose, but what's wrong with the others? Yeah, yeah, there's nothing wrong with the others. The point is that through this example, we were able to obtain the The ring spectra we were interested in and were able to obtain actually, like the idea was that the idea was basically looking at what's going on between L and KU and how it generalizes. So it's guided by that specific example. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Okay, good. Yeah, and of course, the other ones are more difficult to control, I think. Like, if you want to do computation, as far as I see, as far as I see. Yeah, maybe the worst is the push out in E1 rings. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Andy commented in the chat. Thanks for a great talk. Oh, there is another question here. So there is this involution in the edge coordinism space that basically you sort of flip, you sort of turn an edge coordinate upside down. I'm wondering if this last splitting you have there, if you can tell how this involution acts there. With respect to that splitting, I mean. With respect to that splitting, I mean. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know what would be the resulting thing. Yeah, sorry. Are there any questions from the Zoom audience? If so, just mute yourself and ask. If there are no further questions, let's just too shy to organize ourselves. Okay, good. I mean, Stefan raised his hand, so maybe he should. Sorry, I wasn't, I didn't see the notification. Do you also have a question, Birgit? Well, I have three, but maybe. Well, I have three, but maybe Stefan should go first. Okay, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, yeah, my audio was a bit low. Sorry. So, what I wanted to ask is: you mentioned that if you have a ZMOD-M graded ring spectrum and take the THH, then the ZMODM grading survives. Can you say anything about how the Flubinius interacts with the grading? And that's the content of the next slide. So, for business, what it does is that it takes you from weight i to weight pi. Right. So, so and the and the point is that if p is a non-zero divisor, then it kind of like doesn't mess around with the weight zero part. So, so yeah, there is there is a control over that. It's not just an S1 equivalent splitting, yeah. 2 covariant splitting, yeah. This is what, uh, in the work of Akhil Matthew and to um Nicolas and I think Matthew Merrill, what they call an LP-twisted cyclotonic structure. So basically, what it says is that this one weight i to weight pi, that's what thanks. Sure, yeah. So, you were very careful to avoid odd elements in the homotopy groups. How serious is this? Is this a technical assumption or is this unavoidable? Well, the free algebra is not going to be E2, right? Yeah, sure, but I mean, not that you want to adjoin in root of the odd things, but they might just float around and cause trouble. And cause trouble. So is this really trouble, or is this just noise? Some of the things may follow, but I don't know how you would adjoin a root. I don't think again, something we didn't really try to force and make work, you know, to adjoin a root and not decree. To adjoin a root to an odd degree class, because that was not part of any examples we were interested in. But if you force that, yeah, the first problem is when you try to adjoin a root, I don't know how to do that. That might be possible. If it does, it might result in splitting in algebraic key theory. So I can't really tell, but we didn't really take a look. I'm mainly asking because of the example of KO going to KU. I mean, there are two is the most interesting prime. And of course, if you don't want odd elements, you just rule it out. And is there any hope for that example of the prime 2? Or is this just hopeless? Again, something not considered in detail. There might be things that one could say. Yeah. No, again, yeah, there is hope, I think, that something interesting could be said about it. But V1 doesn't exist either, so P could two cases very different. You can stay three cases very difficult. And the last question, and then I'll shut up. This is about descent. I mean, if you kind of join a root of unity and you know that your two spectra, the one you started on and the one you extend to, are, I mean, they are extension of, so you have a faithful extension or faithful dualizable or whatever. Can you descend under some prime being nice assumption, or is this too good? Is this too good to hope for? Yeah, if you're working with a degree zero class, right? This should be quite. That's a question? What happens if you're adjoining? You can adjoin a route if you have some extended thing. Can you pass down to the non-extended one? Is this possible on a Standard one is this possible under some prime doesn't divide something assumption, or yeah, yeah, well, one thing is that yeah, you shouldn't be adjoining a primitive root, like you should be adjoining a root in the sense I describe here, which will well, like you, yeah. So, so in the sense I describe here, it should be like more like the straightforward route junction, and then and then again, the prime. And then again, the prime shouldn't divide the power. I think what you get is a splitting in T C, which may or may not carry over to algebraic K. So there is to get interesting things, I believe. So I think that's the reserve case. Again, yeah, something to look at. No, thanks. Thank you. Okay. Are there any other questions? Yeah, well, if there are no other questions, let's thank Osgur again.
