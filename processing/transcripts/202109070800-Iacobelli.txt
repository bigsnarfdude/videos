To the organizers for the very nice invitation. So, I'm very happy to be able to talk today at this very nice workshop. So, I would like to talk about the Vlaso-Poisson equation and with a particular focus on some singular limits and the use of BASE-style distances to prove stability estimate. Okay, so the overview of the talk is the following. So the overview of the talk is the following. So I will first introduce the Blasso-Poisson equation, that is an equation appearing in plasma physics. Then I will talk about the quasi-neutral limit, that is a singular limit for the Blazo-Poisson equation that link this equation to a sort of kinetic Euler equation. And the core of this stability result is Is an estimate in Baselstein. So I will focus on that kind of stability results and I will show how to improve stability results in Vasestein using some Basestein type distances specifically designed for kinetic problems. So first of all, I would like to talk about an equation that describes plasma. Describes plasma. So, a plasma is a dilute ionized gas composed of charged particles. So, by ionized, I mean that this neutral, this originally neutral gas under the effect of magnetic fields or under very at very, very high temperature, the electrons detach from the ions, so we end up with a cloud of electrons and a cloud of ions. And the cloud of ions. And electrons are much, much lighter than ions. So, in general, since they move on to different time scales, one can decide to adopt the point of view either of the ions or the electrons. And the classical point of view is to look at the evolution of the electrons. So, unlike classical gases, plasmas are highly conductive because the particles interact with each other, creating With each other, creating electromagnetic fields with long-range interaction. So it means that each particle feels the action of all other particles present in the plasma. And this is, let's say, very different from what happened, for example, for the Boltzmann equation, where we consider short-range interaction. So the particles interact only when they collide. So this is just to give an introduction to the An introduction to the model. So, the most classical model for plasmas in kinetic theory is the so-called Vlaso-Poisson system that consists in a transport equation whose unknown is the repartition function of the electrons. So, it means that we will follow the dynamic of the electrons, and the repartition function f tell us how many electrons are at empty with position x and velocity b. X and velocity B. And okay, there is this transport structure, and this cloud of electrons move under the action of an electric field. So E will be our, we will guide our acceleration, let's say. And E is minus grad of U, that is the electric potential. And the first interesting feature of this equation is that the coupling, so the non- The coupling, so the non-linearity doesn't happen at the level of the unknown itself, but happens through the density, the density function. So the coupling is the Poisson equation minus Laplacian of u equal rho minus one, where rho is the electrons density. So it's the integral of f in dB. And you see that here the assumption is that the Michaela, sorry, sorry. So I don't think that the slides are moving up forward. So I just see the just the title. We just see just the title. I don't know. This is strange. I'm sorry. I apologize. Let me see what is happening because I see everything moving on the screen. So let me do a stop share and a share screen again. So I apologize. So, I apologize because can you see now this was the slide of the plasma? I'm sorry, I'm not seeing it, but there is nothing super important. And this is the system. Can you see it correctly? Yeah, yeah, sorry for stopping. Okay, no, no, I'm sorry, I don't know, some technical problem. So, what I was saying is that this Rasopoisson equation is a system of a couple equations. There is this transport equation for the repartition function. Of the equation for the repartition function f, and there is the coupling that happens through this Poisson equation, and the acceleration is given by the electric field. And what I was saying is that the density of the ions is assumed to be constantly one. So the ions in this model act only as a fixed background. Of course, one could decide to follow the evolution of the ions. This would give rise to another model. This would give rise to another model, that is the plasophoson system for ions. But today I will not talk about that, although there are the results that I will speak about at a counterpart in the IONIC setting. So let me now mention something about characteristic scales of the physical system and of plasma. So if we want to model a plasma or anyhow a physical system, Or, anyhow, a physical system, we usually decide to normalize constants to one and to only take into account the physical parameters that we wish to consider. So, for plasmas in general, a very important characteristic length is the so-called bilength. So, if we look at the plasma as a whole, so on the all torus, we see something that is globally neutral, because if the gas, the plasma Because if the gas, the plasma, now we have the plasma is totally unized, so we only have ions and electrons. So the total amount of the ions balances the total amount of the electrons. So in general, this gas is neutral. But if we zoom enough at the level of the bilength, then we see a local and char local imbalances of charge. So locally, this plasma is not neutral anymore. We have to keep in mind. We have to keep in mind that the plasmas are really highly conductive. So each charge that forms is really neutralized by the rest of the plasma. And this, the by length, is very, very small compared to the observation length. So I will call epsilon the ratio between the by length and the observation length. And if we decide that we want to keep track of the We want to keep track of this parameter, we see it appearing as an minus as an epsilon square in front of the Poisson coupling. And in general, so the Poisson ultra limit consists in the procedure of sending this epsilon to zero. Now, in general, if we talk about kinetic systems, or there are several natural questions that we can ask ourselves, some of which are, let's say, linked to each other. Let's say linked to each other, starting from the well-poseness to the relation of these mesoscopic models with the underlying particle systems, and the relation between this mesoscopic model or kinetic system with some coarser, let's say, description of the system that are fluid equations. So, this quasi-neutral limit, in a sense, will be in the spirit of this last point. So, we'll Point so will lead us to a model that is a kind of hydrodynamic model for plasmas. So let me show you how the system change if we keep track of this epsilon. So the Blasso-Poisson system at this epsilon square in front of the Laplacian. And just as a formal Just as a formal computation, if we decide to put epsilon to zero, we see that now the term quasi-neutral is explained because we have this constraint that is the global neutrality, that is that rho is identically one. So the density of electrons is identically one. And now the force field, so E, is given by the gradient of U and U act as a Lagrange multiplier. act as a Lagrange multiplier. So it's a Lagrange multiplier that enforces this condition rho equal to one to hold true for all times. So like in Euler, the pressure field enforces the incompressibility constraint. Here we are enforcing the global neutrality constraint. So the electrons are moving under the action of this gradient of view. And okay, this of course is a very formal But okay, this of course is a very formal computation. And the goal of this talk is to explain how to make it rigorous and why this limit is very delicate. So, okay, the first one making this, the connection between this equation and incompressible oil has been Brenier that made this observation at the end of the 80s and then up to the End of the 80s and then up to the mid 90s, he proved rigorously this fact that if we consider a specific, it's very easy to see, at least formally, if you if you take monokinetic solution. So it means solution that are equal to rho of x times a delta centered in the velocity. Then f is a solution of this kinetic incompressible Euler if and only if u is identically one and u solves the incompressible Euler equation. So So this is very easy to see formally and give an intuition of the link between these two equations. So of course making this proof rigorous is difficult and there have been many important contributions in the years. In particular, the most relevant to us are in general the proofs by Brenier, who proved the validity The validity of limit for well-paired monokinetic data that are data like the one that we have just seen, so supported with velocities on a delta. Then the most important result to us, so that will appear in the following, is the series of results by Grenier who proved convergence for analytic initial data. So the validity of the quasi-neutral limit in case. In case of analytic data. But then, of course, since plasmas are objects that are not stable in general, and you can already guess why this limit could be tricky. And it is because, in a sense, we are trying to solve the Vlaso-Poisson equation without using the Poisson equation. So, it's clear that this cannot be without a price. So, due to the So, due to the presence of some instability mechanisms, there have been results by Antoine Hor√©, Antoine Nguyer, and then Antoine Androset that treated the question of stability or instability issues. So there are also negative results in this setting. So, let me start with the first important result to us, that is the analytic convergence. The analytic convergence a la Grenier. So, Grenier proved the validity of the quasi-neutral limit on some finite time interval when the initial data are bounded in a certain analytic norm, so bounded in an analytic norm in space. So, he assume, let's say, the initial data to be bounded in these analytic norms, and then he assume that the density at time zero is uniformly close to one. Is uniformly close to one, still in these analytic norms, and it uses this norm to express in terms of Fourier coefficients. Then the Coisinautural limit all true, provided one filters out some plasma oscillation, but this is a purely technical thing. So this is our starting point. And once one has a global, I mean, a result that That proves validity under stringent assumptions, that is, let's say, being analytic at time zero. A classical question could be, can we go beyond analyticity and how we can do that? And an idea is to perturb this initial datum, so to go beyond the analyticity setting, and it's crucial. Setting, and it's crucial to select how to measure the size of this perturbation. And this is where vases stain distances enter. So I put the definition just for completeness, although I'm sure most of you know what these vases stain distances are. So these distances are distances on probability measures that matrix the topology of weak star convergence on compact set. And they're defined. And it is defined as follows. So, if we take two probability measures, then the p-vas descent distance between mu and nu is the infimum on all coupling between mu and nu of this integral of x minus y to the p with respect to this coupling, everything elevated to 1 over p. And by coupling, I mean a probability measure that is in the product space and that has a first marginal mu and second marginal mu. First marginal mu and second marginal mu. Now, why these buses and distances can be useful for us? These distances are employed in many different settings, but in kinetic theory, they've been used since the 70s to prove stability estimates and, in general, convergence to equilibrium. The first proofs have been the ones by Tanaka in the context of Boltzmann equation and the one by Dubrushin for what concern Vlasov. For what concern Vlassov equations. And there are several reasons why they are handy, but let's consider for now that we have at our disposal several stability estimates that are classical in Bastes time. Just to understand why they could be flexible in kinetic theory, there is this simple example. So in kinetic theory, it's very common to Theory, it's very common to consider measures that are supported on points because we are talking about particles. So, in general, in particular, to prove mean-field limits. So, the derivation of Lassov-type equation from the n-particle system, one may want to consider particles. So, if you take, for example, two deltas, the delta n0 and the delta in x, then the total variation distance between these two delta is always two, regardless. Is always two, regardless how close x is to zero. While if we consider the vast distance between rho and that, between delta in zero and the delta in x, then the distance is always the distance between, the vast time distance is the distance between the supports. So if these deltas are very close, I gain a lot by considering this kind of distances. So this is just an idea. Distances. So, this is just an idea to see why they can be useful. And the first result that I would like to talk about is a result obtained in collaboration with Daniel Advanced from a Cold Polytechnique. So, what we did is considering a sequence of initial datum that are the sum of a part, G0 et silon, that satisfies all Grani assumptions, so the analytic part, plus a perturbation. And we consider this perturbation. And we consider this perturbation to be very small in Bas's time. So, exponentially small in Bas's time. And then we can prove that the limit, the quasi-nautral limit, holds true. So, there exists T such that any weak solution of the rescaled Vlasopoisson system starting from F0 epsilon then converge to a solution of the kinetic incompressible Euler system that starts from G0, that is the limit of this G0 epsilon that are then. G0 epsilon that are the part of the initial datum that satisfies Granier assumption. So yes, we have a proof, but an important point is that the hypothesis at time zero is quite stringent because we are requiring an exponential smallness at time zero. And we can wonder whether this is good or not. Is good or not? And the answer comes, in a sense, through the fact that we have some negative results. So, in reality, the analytic assumptions of Renier on G0 and the exponential smallness of the perturbation H0 are necessary. In fact, due to the presence of instability mechanism in plasma, first Grenier explained this fact, but then Antoine and Or√© proved it rigorously. Ray proved it rigorously that there exists smooth homogeneous equilibria for the kinetic incompressible Euler system, such that even if I have a polynomial control in as many derivatives as I want, the quasi-neutral limit is false. So in general, I can say that having requiring for an exponential smallness at M0 is okay for us. I'm not saying that it's optimal. I'm not saying that it's optimal, but we cannot go to polynomial. So I would say that that is fine. But the theorem that I was showing you before, it was only 1D. So this is a big caveat because the Vlasso-Poisson equation is highly dimension dependent. So when the dimension grows, the estimates get much worse. So then the theorem in 2D that is still in collaboration with Daniela 1 is very similar. Daniel Lanc one is very similar. So the strategy is similar, but the tools are different. And the point is that in 2 and 3D, we had to require a double exponential smallness at time zero. And on top of that, since in higher dimension, we don't have at our disposal a so-called strong, strong stability estimate, that means weak, strong stability estimates. That means that I have only to That means that I have only to ask for integrability in one of the two solutions, but here I need to have integrability on the density of both solutions. We need to ask some extra assumption that is boundedness and finite energy, essentially, that will allow us to and the compact supporting velocity. This can be weakened, but in a way we need a control on the supporting on the growth on the A control on the supporting on the growth on the supporting velocity because we have to ensure that the densities of the two functions that we are considering, the two solutions that we are considering, remain in L infinity for all times. So in general, there are some modifications to do, and the hypotheses at time zero are much more stringent because we have this double exponential, and we have seen that what would be a nice control is a Is just one exponential. So the strategy of the proof is the following. So the idea is to show a quantitative strong, strong stability estimate a la Leper, because Leper proved these very nice estimates in 2006 to prove uniqueness of solutions for Blas of Poisson. Then let's say having the stability estimate is not complicated. And once we have this stability, we use the stability estimate. This stability: if you use the stability estimate, we have this control that is a control in Basel Stain 2 of the kind e to the log of something to the e of something. And here you can see where this double exponential comes from in the end. Then we apply leper estimate with the F1 equals G epsilon, F2 equals F epsilon, and we use all these new hypotheses on the support. Hypothesis on the support to do an argument to show that we have a control of the growth of the supporting velocity, and then we conclude applying the Grignet theorem. But still, there is this point of the double exponential that bothers us. So the idea was trying to get rid of that double exponential. But the strategy of the proof is quite clean. I mean, there is not so much space for improvement apart the stability estimating. Apart from the stability estimate itself. So I will now explain briefly how to improve these stability estimates. So the idea is to use, let's say, at our advantage the fact that in kinetic equation, there is a natural anisotropy between the position and the velocity. So if you differentiate the position, you get the velocity, but if you differentiate the velocity, you get the electric field. So it's much less. The electric field, so it's much less regular than the position. So, while Leper estimate was, for example, holding also for Euler, so was giving us a result a la Judovich for 2D Euler, we are now trying to have an approach that is specifically designed to tackle kinetic problems. And this approach is based on finding a quantity that looks like Bas's time, but But where I add eternalization in front of the position. And this was partially done, in a sense, when lambda was just a parameter. And for example, in the context of Lazopoisson, it was done by Lazarovich and Lazarovich Pickel for mean-field limits and by Megan Griffin-Pickering and myself. But that was it, was just adding a parameter and then optimizing on a parameter. While here, the goal is to add a function, and this function will be And this function will be a function of q itself. So it will be a non-linear implicit way of doing that. So for our purposes, a right choice is to select lambda of t equal log of q of t. So it means that we have q of t on the left hand side and the right hand side. So then the step of the proof are like proving that this q of t in the regime we are looking, so when q of zero is very small, then this q of t is well defined and is differentiable. Defined and is differentiable because we need to do all sorts of manipulations on this Q of T. Then proving a Grand Wall argument on this Q of T. And then, since Q of T looks like a vastest and distance, proving bounds from above and below, so I compare the estimate that we get in Q with estimates in W2. So then I obtain an improved estimate, although it doesn't look clear. Although it doesn't look clear, the improvement from the estimates itself, that is quite complicated. But just to show the kind of improvement, if we assume that at M0, the distance between F1 and F2 is theta, so it's very, very small, then if we then apply Leper estimate, the control remains good, let's say, for a time log log theta. While with this new estimate, While with this new estimate, the control remains good for a time square root of log theta, so much on a much longer time scale. And I'm not expecting to have something better because if we have the density in L infinity, then the electric field is only log Lipschitz. So we cannot expect then to have a clean ground wall for this situation. So this is essentially the best, more or less, one can have. or less one can have. And thanks to this choice, if we then select lambda of t to be epsilon minus two log of qt, thanks to the improvement of this Leper estimate, I could prove the quasi-eutra limit in the spirit of what was done with Tanier and Juan, but only requiring one exponential, let's say, the exponential smallness of the perturbation at time zero. And to conclude, I mean, this method is quite flexible, this method using this natural anisotropy between X and V and can be generalized to other stability estimates. So, for example, to improve debris in type estimates and also in the context of hypocercivity. And so, now the natural new steps are to improve the existent results on quasi-neutral limit for the Yonik Vlasov-Posson equation that has. Ionic Vlasov-Poisson equation that has an extra non-linearity. And this is something I'm doing with Madam Griffin Petering, but also get improved convergence rate for the mean-field limit, essentially. And lastly, I think that this method could be applied also to quantum system to a kind of two-vasest time distance introduced by Gauls and Theripol recently. Terry Paul recently. Last remark: I don't really really use the fact that I have a second-order structure. So I'm using the fact that these two variables have different, let's say, one variable is more regular than the other. So it can be also applied to other situations of non-kinetic equation, but where the equation involves different variables that have an asymmetry in the revolution. So, for example, one variable. So, for example, one variable in space x1 is more regular than an x2, let's say. So, and this concludes what I wanted to say. Thanks a lot.
