All right, so today I'll talk about isomorphic 4D superconformal field theories, and we're going to understand them by using technical geometrization as our workshop starts with the geometry. This will be based on two papers, one with Jacques Dessler and Craig here, and the next one with additional Grant Elliott. So today, what I'm going to really discuss to understand is a physics question. Physics question through the mathematical toolkits. So, what is the question? This is basically the grand goal we want to understand. Of course, we won't be able to understand for the full context. We'll try to bring it down to which context we can analyze and understand them. So, the grand question is: when do two QFTs describe the same physics? Physics. So there's many possible kinds of descriptions of different quantum field theories. And sometimes they might actually be addressing the same physics, and then they should be isomorphic theories. And thus, the isomorphic theories part. We live in 4D, so today we're going to focus on strictly 4D setting, no 3D. And I'll explain what SCFT means as you go on. So, then first address this question. The answer will be very difficult. If these two quantum field theories have the same local operator spectrum entirely and all its endpoint correlation functions, then of course they will describe the same QFTs. Now, that is not quite tangible. If we knew how to do that, we would not be, I think, sitting in the room trying to understand quantum field theories today. So, let's then try to make Let's then try to make a question into something more describable. And one of the tricks that physicians usually tend to use, or I think so is for mathematicians, is adding symmetries. So let's add conformal symmetry. And I believe Craig gave a nice perspective yesterday of conformal symmetry of the symmetry group, and that describes the C. And that describes this C. And this was a field theory that's coming from here. So now we got to CFT thus far. Then Kenny addressed when do two CFTs describe the same physics? Now, CFT is a reasonable thing to really think about it because we can have all the CFTs to be going down with the RG flow and QFTs live. And QFTs live around here. So it's basically living at the fixed point of the QFT. So you're just reducing the question to understand where all these fixed points are. So can we actually do this? Unfortunately not. But when would they actually be describing the same physics? Well, if they had the same conformal data, which will be all the two-point correlations and all the three-point correlators, if they are all The three-point correlators, if they're all identical, that would be very reasonable to then imagine: ah, then the CFTs will be all then characterized by this, so thus they're the same physics. Unfortunately, this is not generically computable for in all orders. If we knew that, of course, we would not be hearing so many CFT talks as we heard from all the physicists thus far. Now, what if we can find some other sets that can characterize a CFT? Characterize a CFT, some form of conventional invariants. So, today's goal, as I think Craig already pre-announced it yesterday, is try to come up with some set of invariants that can characterize some versions of the theories. And that will be given as invariants. That should be very than thinking of it like all possible things you can do from geometry. And this is how you're going to access to answer such a question. um and how we're going to really use the invariant as max and craig talked about it uh we're going to use higher dimensional perspective called class s as stephen nicely used the term already in the dinner setting um so let's try to do that but before we jump into the class s let's uh try to think of some particular example we know exactly how to do um let's start with an example i think everyone likes n equals four I think everyone likes n equals for super young mills. Let's start with that. n equals for super young mills, a very concise theory. We know exactly how to solve them, right? So what is the Lagrangian? This is even a nice Lagrangian theory. I'll write it in particularly in this form. Tau is the complex coupling. And there's one more term of the reels part. And there's some other fermion terms. And the step of the complexified coupling. Complexified coupling, and that should be given as like this. Now, with this particular Lagrangian, I can pose this next question. Are theories given with SU2, but tau? That's a theory one. Let's consider a theory two, and that will be SO3, and minus one over tau. And minus one over tau. Are these theories identical? Well, if you first look at just like a particle physicist from 60s or 70s, we'll look at it and then, oh, they have clearly different boson spectrum here. So thus they're different theories. But that's not quite, that was too quick. That's not quite right because you need to actually answer by overall everything because you can really shuffle around. Well, one theory is clearly at One theory is clearly at a strong coupling, and the other one is the weak coupling. That's why it's tau and one over tau. And spectrums of these two massive W bosons and BPS monopole spectrum are actually the same. And all the interparticle interactions are actually the same. So one would then naively guess that maybe they're actually the same theory from physics perspective. But that's not proving anything. So we're going to prove using that geometric invariance perspective. Invariance perspective by using higher dimensional origin. So then, this n cools force of for young mills can come from higher dimensional theory. So, in general, how it works is we have a higher dimensional theory. Let's call it in generically D setting. And that's going to go down to lower dimensional theory. And that will be in small d, let's say, so that this is strictly bigger than the This is strictly bigger than the small d, then it's crossed with the leftover manifold, and that would be d minus d. Then how we generally do is this is the quote unquote in physics compactifying space. What it really means is that we are going to have geometric and topological data to be all booked up here. And then we push it down forward to the base that we're taking as this lower dimensional theory setting. And then we read that off as an invariant. Read that off as an invariant. So let's do that exercise here. So, what we have is going to be little d is four, right? So four-dimensional. And I'm going to take as the same thing as like you heard yesterday, 62,000 CFT that you heard many times from throughout the Craigslist. So that will be 6. And then that'll be 6. 6 minus 4 is 2. In fact, I'm going to take a particular type of this 2 manifold. That'll be T2. Manifold that'll be T2. And you might already guess where it's going. I wrote conveniently already with respect to tau and T2. So what's really happening is that the coupling constant, this tau, is exactly the complex structure of this torus. And this one has the SO2Z self-duality group. For physicists, that's called Montanola duality. And for here, it was exactly the Just exactly the things that we have for the complex structure of the moduli of the torus, as SO2Z. So, this is what we call as geometric engineering or thus geometrization that we're taking. And then everything will be given as this, and then that's going to be pushed down. And that's how we view this tau as a coupling. So then we prove that these two theories are identical by having from the same origin to be given S. Yes? Yes, yes. Um, all right, but of course, if I was talking about an equals for superior wheels with this, this is very exact and beautiful, but that would be not new today. So let's now literally generalize a little bit into what you heard yesterday setting a little bit. So from here, you're not going to do t2. We're going to choose this manifold to be given. Manifold to be given as something of a slightly different kind of what you heard yesterday, as Riemann surface with genus G and punctured N. And that's going to be so-called, as you heard already, giving rise to class S configuration to give rise to a 4D n equals 2 theory. We have supersymmetry, so superconformed field theory. Well, this is what you already heard thus far. Heard thus far. And this is just manifestly now changing just a manifold. However, this is not going to be just all the geometries we're going to use today. I'm going to actually connect to having another geometric origin in this format. So this one, the higher dimensional theory was 62,000 SCFG. And this was the class S by Moore, Greg Moore, Guyoto Moore, Nightsky. Kyoto Mornitsky and Kyoto. And we can also get this theory from having one less amount of supersymmetry. And sometimes these two origin can give rise to the same thing, despite that this has gone towards compactification, and this is exactly the punctured Riemann surface. And let's then look at this particular section of the theory. So let's try to look at the Benn diagram. Try to look at the Benn diagram. This part, let's say, is corresponding with this, and this origin can give rise to something of this theory. And then we're in the space of n equals 2 for the SCFTs. You're looking at this particular region of the interest today. You're not addressing the full everything. You're just going to use this particular geometrization to look at it. Now then you should ask, why are we looking at this different geometrization? What would that toolkit actually give us? Toolkit actually gives us. And that's because this particular toolkit on the right side will give us elliptic vibration data to give rise to this understanding, which we'll get to. But let's try to connect to why we're looking at this particularly 4DN equals 2 theory for today. As you probably already noticed, photos really like 4DN equals 2. 4DN equals 2 is particularly nice in many physical reasons, but also I think it should be particularly interesting. Also, I think it should be particularly interesting to the crowd here because the workshop has the Higgs bundle and thus it's a lot of Hitchin systems. So 4TN equals 2 SCFTs are very special because it's a particularly one of the main epitome of examples that we could understand and describe the physics by Hitchin systems. And today's focus is explicit as 4DN equals 2 theories, where Where then what is that Hitchin system really gives us is that the Coulomb branch geometry of this theory. I want to write this. And Coulomb branches of the geometry is encoded in the very much of the Hitchin system, and that's due to cyber-Witten geometry. In fact, more precise terms for these class S or type of 4D and equals 2 S C of T's, we could equals two S C of T's we can write the precise statement that the Deline Mumford modular space let's write as M G N is then which is associated to the U B curve for physicist is usually identified with the space of Of marginal parameters of the 4D SCFTs. In fact, if you remember earlier, let me connect a dot from here. The reason why I didn't erase is because of this. The marginal parameter that was playing the role was just really tau, that played the role as a complex coupling. Then you can imagine you can have the Then you can imagine you can have the marginal parameters tau ijs. It'll play the same role to give rise to coming from this modulated space understanding. And this is how we describe the Coulomb branch from mathematical perspective to give rise to this. Now, unlike 3D, in 4D, the Coulomb branch and Higgs branches are not 3D mirror duals. They're completely different. Well, the 4D Higgs branch is the same as the 3D Higgs branch, but 4D Coulomb branch through the For the coolant branch through this procedure is not hypercaler, it's complex. So, you can then imagine that this type of analysis will be very useful, but not quite enough to apply if you want to understand the Higgs branch spectrum. And through this other protocol, we are going to try to access the necessary additional data needed to understand the Higgs branch of the 4D n equals 2 supercontrol field theories. But from From then here, let's utilize this context of the class S configuration and the 61 comma zero configuration behavior. And do everyone remember class S or do I need to review a little bit? A little review. Okay. Sounds good. So let's say the 60 took Mazura. Let's say the 62 Kumazero SCFT. I think the notation Craig used was SG. Is that right, Craig? Perfect. Let's remove this one. Yes. I cannot write MathFact G on the board. My apologies. And that G is literally the group, the Lie group, and here it will be taken as ADE. And as I was telling you, this is the Riemann surface. That's a genus G, non-math frac. Genus G, non-math fac. And n is a number of punctures that we have on the surface. And the punctures can be described as then n different punctures that we can have, which can be both regular and irregular. Today, for the purpose, I'm going to mostly talk about regular today. It'll be easier than yesterday. And for those things that we get in the end is that because you compactify them here. Compactified on here. This is math rack regular G then can be described by depending on different punctures, then we'll have different type of theories in the end, right? So we will then associate with all the punctures we have, and that's going to give rise to our class S theory. And this will be all we needed to characterize the data here specifically. And manifestly, we're using this configuration and pushing it down, and that's the information we are. And pushing it down, and that's the information we are using. Now, then, what was the other way they can achieve such thing was using this 61,000 CFT that I didn't even explain to you what that is. But let's put that as some particular toolbox we can have that can give rise to the same theory. So, how we're going to cook this up is using this thing called F-theory. I think half. F-theory. I think half of the room here have heard my F-theory pure elliptic vibration talks here before. This is exactly how I engineer it. Just for the recap, how we did it is this is called geometric engineering as well, because we're going to now utilize the same concept here from here to down. This is then using elliptically fibered collabio threefold. So this was coming from two dimensional to Coming from two dimensional to the six-dimensional complex dimension three, it's real dimension six, so that works out. And it has to be absolutely elliptically fibered, not the other way around. And as you can gather coming from already here already, then we can have all the divisors encoding the information in the Cartan data that can specify all the groups that we can associate to have and all the gauge algebras. And that's going to give rise to what we're going to have here. What we're going to have here as a 6T1, 0 CFT. In fact, we're going to call this, I think we've used this term many times, the conformal matter. So I'm going to stick to use the same notation here today. What I really mean by that is this information is literally the one that's encoded from this Calabio 3 fold. So, for example, how So, for example, how it really works is: you know, we can have now Jacobian vibration that gives rise to a well-defined Calabia threshold. Then you can have like many curves that can associate minus one curves or minus two curves and minus three curves like this all together. And then we're going to only take the non-compact version of it. So think of it as a non-compact version. And all these curves that we intersect has to be. Curves that we intersect has to be a negative definite because, unless we do that, it's not going to give rise to a self-consistent theory. And we need one more ingredient that all the singular fiber that can live above and any two curves really meet and is actually supposed to be minimal. And that's where the minimal really lies. That's the minimal model program in the sense of Moray. And from here, then we can describe. And from here, then we can describe this as particularly, I'm going to write with a notation, the theory that carries this gauge algebra G, this is math frac G, and that's going to carry, I'm going one and two, two nil-potent orbits. If you're Higgsing by this nil-potent orbit, O1 and O2, for example, then the resulting theory that we're going to get is since this is just. Is since this is just a torus vibration we are taking, we're going to have a theory onto this O1 and O2 on the T2. And this is a smooth T2. You're bringing it down. You're not charging anything on here. So notice the difference here. Here, you're using the puncture data to associate with the surface here. So everything was just coming from this two perspective. The difference. Perspective. The difference here we were using is that now these punctured data is coming from the disk format, and then we're just doing the smooth t to after. So this is swapped in this format. That's because the information with all the G is encoded on there, and then you're Higgs over here in 60 perspective and then bringing it down. Are we good? Okay. All right, one thing I should tell you before I move on is that let's say I have minus one curve, minus two curve, an easy example. So minus three, minus three curve, and minus one curve. Curve and minus one curve, then I'm going to be very lazy and write like one, three, one. Physicists are absolutely lazy. I'm going to charge this with, for example, SU2, then I'm going to write SU2 on top, meaning that's the one that as a curve that carries a divisor of the carton SU2. Are we good? Oh, perfect. Yes? Correct. Correct. I was going to use that. Well, it doesn't exist, but thank you. All right. So now we have two geometric ways to lead to the same theory. And then we exactly now explicitly have this class S theory that we had. And I'm going to use a particularly genus zero today, as simplest as it gets. And three punctures. I'm going to take them as one and O2. As one and O2, and one, I'm going to take it as simple functor. And as I was telling you, I'm going to use its origin from the 61,000, which will be a theory of the same type G, this is a math frac G, charging with same two punctures of O1 and O2 pair onto a T2. Now, I'm not going to prove this today. That will be taking too long. Taking too long. But as I was promising, we are doing this because you want to understand it's Higgs branch data. And with my collaborators, Florent Baume and Craig, we have proven that this equalities manifest through the Higgs branch data. What I really mean by that is you're taking the same setting, but now you have made the nilpotent puncture a nilpotent. Potent closure here, partial nil potent closure. So we change this pull, and then the rest is remaining intact. And here, then you will get the same, oh, not S, same thing here. And of course, O1 tilde strictly included the O1. And this will be still always equal. And this will be an iterative operation you can do till every Iterative operation you can do till everything is all simple. Yes? Ah, thank you. Forgot. Perfect. All right, so this will be the premise. Another nice way to say this is that two perspectives give rise to isomorphic Higgs branch entirely. And don't forget this. And don't forget this is just simply a genus zero. So I'm going to use as a three-punctured sphere in this pair of pants decomposition. So we can just iterate all possible these data that we can find. And thankfully, we have 10 or 12 year long data that's being cataloged for this by dear collaborator Jacques Dessler. So we can always grab the data that we need about all possible things. And you should probably ask: what are the data that I'm really speaking of? The data that I'm really speaking of, and now that's what I meant by then invariance of the theory that characterizes the theory, hopefully. Then, what will be such a thing? Let's try to get then 4D equal to conventional invariance. I'm going to put this conventional quotation because that's created word by us in all means. So, from the Craig's talk, Yoli learned about two things. Yoli learned about two things, central charges. So central charges A and C, also known as conformal anomalies or vial anomaly coefficients. So these two that you learned yesterday is characterizing the conformal symmetry. And we are kind of giving it, this is a more precise notation that we can give it F, since you already heard the gist yesterday. This is vial tensor squared, and this Euler density. So that these two are literally the one, two character invariants that controls the theory explicitly. And or equivalently, you can think of it as just contents of vectors and hypermultiplex. It's just a linear combination of the two. You learned one more thing yesterday, just the flavor symmetry. Choose the flavor symmetry. And flavor symmetry came with two things: group and the flavor central charge. So, how did we then precisely define the flavor central charge and how do I get them? Well, we can also use the flavor just current since everything is. Since everything is preserved, is how you're gonna get them. This Ki is the Ki you heard yesterday. It's a flavor central charge. Definitely checked the sign today, so it should be correct. All right, so. So, these two you've learned, and I'm going to add two more to this. These two are unfortunately not enough to characterize the data. In fact, I can come up with a million examples that have the same centric charge and flavor symmetry and flavor central charge, and it's completely different. So the third one is a very reasonable expectation that one can have. That's the Coulomb branch operator spectrum. That makes sense. We are getting Coulomb branch operator spectrum by just having the hitching system, as I was telling you earlier. We are just grabbing that information still. And I was telling you, I'm going to have fourth one. Now, fourth one, I'm not going to explain it too much in detail. It's going to be called, I'm going to give you a specific term. It's called sure index and the how little. And the whole little wood index. What it does is we're just grabbing the more overall operator spectrum of the theory that we can get in a particular simplest setting. Sure sector is like the simplest closed sector you can find. That's SL2Z invariant in 4d equals floor context. And Hall Littlewood is just similar to the Higgs. Just similar to the Higgs branch spectrum, and it's a particularly an invariant you can find of the theory. And of course, then you can ask: are these all? Would these, if you have just these invariants, would that characterize uniquely of the theory? So you can always find two QFTs just if they're identical. Are they the same? Unfortunately, I'm going to tell you the answer is not necessarily true. Especially if you go to higher ranks, you can find million examples that would not be the case. But for the But for the low rank enough, these will be sufficing, is the idea, or even the subset will suffice. Let's give a little bit of an example. Well, one, yes. Yes, but it's a very high order, so we cannot really compute it. Okay, but in principle, the supercomputer index is would you say that this is a perfect normal? Would you say that isn't it perfect, Ronnie? If we can compute entirely, yes, but we can't. Yes, yes. But that would be hard. So here I meant by like up to a computable limit. Yeah. In fact, for those computable limits and still being different, it is already studied somewhat for a certain limited format by Jacques Dissler and Grant Elliott. That subset of the most recent paper. That's upset of the most recent paper. Let's give like an easiest example where this will be very enough. In fact, let's come with an example that you don't even need the fourth one. And the rest will be just enough and everything. And the simplest example is a rank one n equals to a supercontrolled field theory. So the Coulomb branch generator is just simply this. Easy. Easy. And the set of two central charges. And it'll look like a weird number. But I'll explain why I'm writing this. Now, for physicists, you should look at this and say, oh, I know this theory. You cannot claim to me that you do not. Mathematicians should have absolutely no idea what the hell is that number. This is actually unique. There's only one theory that can exist of this, and this is proof. Exist of this, and this is proven by Argerius Lotitos Lewin Martone. I think I got everyone. Oh, great. And this is called the E8. 12 is the flavor central charge. Minihan-Namashansky theory. Oh, I can never spell Namashansky correct. A E C G A Thank you. Well, this is recorded, right? I will ask you. Sorry. Yeah, so this is the simplest theory one can think of. Like in 4D, if you ask anyone other than like this trivial theory, can you think of anything just simplest? That's the one. And it has weirdest numbers, I know. So let's just use the Let's just use the number one and number three. That was all we needed, right? So, one and two on its own to uniquely specify is also possible, and one and three is also possible as well. So, there are substets that we can use that just uniquely characterize all the theories. So then, what type of theories that we can do to address by maybe looking at one, two, and three only? That would be super nice because we don't have to do numerical power computation of number four, which by the way takes many, many, many hours on the cluster. Many, many, many hours on the cluster, which I'm not very good at. But one, two, three, we can analytically get them. And it'll be great if you can get them to find a way to prove it. And you're going to prove it by using a 60 origin lecture that way that we've already discussed here. All right. So then, how do we actually show that they are all isomorphic? So this is how we're going to really use the 60 power to have. So what are the theories that we can really then look at? We can really then look at. So, we're going to consider the pairs of class F theories. I'm going to write it: consider the pair of class F theories. But I'm going to make a few things simple. The genus of the Riemann surface is the same. That's not math back G, it's a regular G. Another one that I'm going to make get together, the 62,000 origin is the same. zero origin is the same. What I'm going to write is just S. This is math frac G is the same. And I'm going to enforce one more. All but two of the full end punctures are the same. So I'm only going to vary two punctures as a pair. Very true functors as a pair. And you can kind of guess why, because those are the only ones we can address from the 61,000 perspective. So for any class S theory that we've been doing, the complex structure moduli of this then punctured Viemann surface then parametrized the exactly marginal deformations of the superconformal field theory so we can take a degeneration limit. So, then what we really can have is having a theory with like many punctures. Say there's n numbers. This is like, let's say it's n minus two numbers of punctures. We have two punctures of O1 and O2. And this is clearly an identical picture, even though it doesn't look like it. picture even though it doesn't look like it. I'm going to put this O1 prime and O2 prime. So the first one that we wrote it in this format is then exactly the Sg of C Gn O1 and O2 and the rest till 1. And this one is this is identical up till here except that it's O1 prime. Except that it's O and prime, O2 prime, and the rest are the same. Okay, so from here, we can take a degeneration limit from here. Color. Wonderful. So now take the degeneration limit. So from here, you can write it then. This is the full puncture that Craig already talked about. And this is O1. And this is O1, O2, and the rest n minus 2 punctures are there. And this can also take the degeneration limit in the same fashion. So this part is the same. And this is zero, by the way, full puncture. And have O1 prime and O2 prime. Now, these are the clever tails, like all the flags that Marina was saying during the open problem session. I think that's the correct name of the session. And these can then just be cigar shapes and then just go to the generation limit. So thus, this then reduces further down to so this one will just give us some O, regular O, that will be always regular. One. O1, O2, and this one will reduce down to the same O because this data is identical, the same Cooper tails that we have taken. And this will be O1 prime, O2 prime. Are we good? All right, so what we are then comparing is this and this theory we have. Just a three-puncture sphere, but regular punctures, identical one. Identical one regular functor that prescribes the covertails and two different pairs. And I'm not going to actually look at all different pairs because they would be, of course, generically an octave versus the same theory. So, but when are the theories that's going to be actually the same? Now I'm going to look at, of course, we haven't utilized the number two yet. We're going to impose number two. So what does number two impose happen? So what does number two impose happen is then having now so in here O1 to O1 prime and O2 prime goes back to FK. So then the flavor symmetry of O1 plus O2 is identical to the new O1 prime plus O2 prime because you want to not have You want to not have a different flavor symmetry because they'll be, of course, then different now. Imposing this, then you can actually ask then, oh, with this particular setup now reduced, can we now answer these two theories explicitly? When are they really the same? And can we characterize them since we have one, two, and three now being identical? Are we good? All right. All right, so this will, as I was telling you, only work in low rank. Let me demonstrate that first. If I pre-draw this diagram, can everyone see this? Wonderful. So, this is not low rank. This is a very high rank. I'm going to put n large. This is the theory that we're going to have. These are two punctures that. Going to have. These are two punctures that just spell a card or symbol. Don't worry about it. It's a particular, simple enough to consider. This is the 61 comma zero picture. I know it looks very complicated. All I want to really specify is that we can cook up a generic model for any n and can compare them. And we can have two Higgs down. I'm going to Higgs this part down to here. And this side is Higgs, this part down. And this side is hexing this part down to here. That's the only thing I did. And you can see from just the curves, they're different. I don't think it's a genius to figure that out. We just look at it and say, oh, they just look different. That's correct, because as I was telling you, in high rank, they're definitely not necessarily the same. Now let's put it into a specifically simple rank, small enough rank. I'm going to put n equals Equals two. No, four, four, actually. Four. True doesn't quite give the theory. This n is the number of punctures for n. Oh, I changed into, why did I change into capital N? There you go. And also, the capital N is large, yes. All right, so let's put now small n to four. So we just have four things. Then I'm going to draw it. It becomes very simple. In fact, adding one. Let's see. And no, I see two. And no SU2. That should be good. That's the theory we get. Very simple. Right? That's the same here. So let's put it to now two to n minus two. All right. So then this particular one, then we're going to be getting two, one should be seven. E7 and that's the theory we get. That's the same thing here. So good. So if you see this and this, you can tell they're the same, right? That's exactly the same divisors, that's associated to exactly the same things. Associated to exactly the same things. We call that curved configuration, as that makes sense. And then from looking at this, since 61,000 is uniquely configured completely by geometry of curved configuration, when they're the same, they're actually identical. So from here, what we can tell is these two theories are isomorphic. And comes from this theory, which can have one VAV here that was coming from. Here, that was coming from this to this nil potent orbit. And this is coming from this to decinal potential orbit. And if you look at here, I draw this particular example that's easy to look at it. It has diagramic Z2 automorphism. And this Z2 automorphism is explicitly swapping these. Is explicit swapping these two maps that we could do as a two different partial innipotent orbit closures. And that's the source of the reason why we can have these two theories actually being explicitly isomorphic, which is the information we learned from the 61 Kamazir perspective. You can see there was a beyond just a diagram. You can actually source that directly from the anomaly polynomial, but I'm not going to do it today. So then, what you should really then question is, can you do Really, then the question is: Can you do this beyond just the simple things? And what are the ones that's being explicitly checked? Yes? Oh, no? Okay. For the type of E7, if you notice, I cleverly picked the E7 type. We exhaustively went through everything. The reason we chose E7 is because E7 was the one that was giving counterexamples of when even these are the same, that it looks different as a theory. And going through all of them, we could detect. And going through all of them, we could detect them to be always all isomorphic through this way. So, all the examples that we through here, remember, so the two things that we really ask as a question is having the same covertail. So, some O that you have to determine when that's possible is O1, O2 prime, and O1. And O1 and O2, this pair, are they really isomorphic? And we could detect all possible cover tails that given rise to them because we exhaustively went through all possible type E7 configuration and show that what I just described to you really works. Now, we demonstrated it works for some selective cases of ADE type because all this thing only relies on ADE type only. But we didn't exhaustively do that at all. Exhaustively did that at all yet. We only just did that for all the E7s, and E types will be most certainly all following through in this fashion. But of course, for certain cases, this is not actually going to work. In fact, I'm going to give you a particular example when this will be very difficult, where we do not have the 61,000 origin. So everything was relying on the fact that we could actually compute this just purely curved. Could actually compute this just purely curved configuration and just look at the Jacobian vibrations, and that uniquely specifies everything so that it is identical. So that's all simple? The full puncture, yeah, yeah. Because I used that full puncture in the preferences. Oh, yeah, yeah. This is exactly the same conversation we did with Craig yesterday. So, what will So, what was the general methodology here? The general methodology was that we have one, zero S C of T, which has a Z2 automorphism, which exchanges the two, which give rise to two sixty-one comma zero S C of T. And these are just uniquely specified by purely curved configuration for melliptic fibricolobial threefold. And then we're just pushing onto smooth T2 here, right? So this is currently isomorphic to here. And we put it down to smooth T2. So it doesn't change anything. So the resulting for the N equals 2S C of T that we're looking at is still isomorphic as they're. Is still isomorphic as their Higgs branch data is isomorphic as proven in that diagram over here. So, just using this logic, this will be always manifest as in through as long as we're looking at all Higgs blows and all of them, not just going beyond as a mixed branch. And these two are actually class S theories, so that this one had a 62 Kuma 0 S C of T origin. Origin. That's how we specified here. And we looked at it today for the genus zero and n functions. And this n has to be sufficiently low for this to work, is what we demonstrated today. And overall rank has to be somewhat enough low, but for E7, everything will work. Right, so as it relies heavily on the 61,000 SDFT, as I was giving a very DFT, as I was giving a band diagram earlier, which I unfortunately erased, is a subset where it could have actually both origins. That's not necessarily always true. So then how do we answer for the theories that does not have this origin as they're given? So purely, if you lose all this format, what can we get? Kenyan come up with certain particular examples of it. So now let's put in the number four, because one, two, three is not good enough. We need to detect because. 2-3 is not good enough. We need to detect because here we could do that with the luxury of having this toolkit and prove it entirely. So let's give an example where we can think of it. So as number four, you can only compute it by series expansion. So you can only do it with the computing power allows of your computer or cluster. So this is why you can never determine that this will be precisely always identical other than you think it would be. But other than that, Would be. But other than that, it would hint that maybe it is the same. But these will be a particular two examples you can think of. So we have some O as a quiver tail that specifies in one of the four different things. I'm going to stick to Balacarda notation. It's not because it's so insightful, but since it's just for example. Which I was trying to demonstrate with Which I was trying to demonstrate with this is that it looks at the Vallacarta labels, it's very high up. It's happening only in a low enough Hasse diagram below. So that when theories for low rank enough, like low enough of things, it would have gone bad. But for high enough of a puncture, that does not go bad yet because we still have the low enough of a Hasse diagram alive. And that's when these things happen. So we expect this to be actually isomorphic, but we couldn't prove because we don't. Isomorphic, we couldn't prove because we don't have the 601 comma zero origin. So we can choose this all from four punctures that's related to the Rg flow that specify this quiver tail. D5, D6 of A1, D5 plus A1 E7 A2. And you can tell it's very high up also. And I can tell you that the sugar index of these two of the computing order, which is of the order of tau to the 11th, looks exactly identical for all these cases that's related. That's for choosing of. And it looks like it's because we still have the Z2 automorphism intact, as you can also kind of see from the quiver tail as well. See from the quiver tail as well, but it can actually see it directly from like this level. So, then what we can gather is what this is telling us is because these two also need to come from a different understanding like this, that as long as we have a Z2 automorphism intact as an original theory that gave rise to this as an IR theory, that we will probably still manifestly get the isomorphic to pairs of the class S theories. Now we can Class as theories. Now, we can never say for certain it would be the case, but nevertheless kind of gives a hint that maybe that's the way to think about these theories and try to understand them better, even if you lost this elliptic vibration toolkit. And I think my time is up. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Yeah, thanks for that great talk. Any questions for Monica? For the great talk. Any questions for Monica? Let me just try to understand the diagram that you have at the left there. So, the only thing you start with 6D, one comma zero theory, then you're Higgs in two different ways by turning on VEVs of two different fields. Right. So, if you look. Sorry, I have to cover that diagram. Please bring it back to you. So, this is a 61,000. 61, 0, and because on T2, your 4D and 6D configurations identical from that. Wait, hold on, hold on. The Higgsing happened in six dimensions, right? The Higgsing happens in six. No, no, the Higgs thing is happening in six dimensions. And then, yeah, smooth T2 doesn't do anything. Okay, okay. So this Higgsing is, if you look at it, the curve configuration. What I Higgs is from the right, I'll bring it down. But I want to try to understand it just in field theory language. The field theory language in 4D. So this is. even 4d or so this is exactly identical theories you start with this you start with a six-dimensional field theory right but it's still field theory so yes oh you want and then what do you do in in that field theory you you're higging it in in two different ways yes and those two differ by a z2 automorphism yes which is a global symmetry of the six-dimensional theory correct but then okay can i see your diagram again So, if that's the picture, then what I don't understand is how can it ever happen that the two 40 theories you get at the end are not isomorphic? It sounds like they should just be always isomorphic. That was the whole goal. But you said it only works sometimes. No, no, this always works. I'm saying it only works sometimes when 61,000 exist. So, this example is when 61,000 does not exist. Okay, got it. Your bots not exist, okay? Got it. Technically, um, yeah, I have one question about this. So, first, you say it does not exist. Can you, is there a reason why it doesn't exist, or can you prove it doesn't exist, or it's just that we don't know a construction in 60 from pure curved configuration, you will not be able to get these by exhaustion. You just can maybe use orbifles or not to the smooth T2, but. Or not to the smooth T2, but that kind of loses the whole risk picture. And then I'm not understanding. So in the diagram of nilpotent orbits you put below, so I recognize the E7A4, which is on one, but then the others I don't see. So what's the reason? D5, D6 of A1, D5 plus C6. Yeah, but they are not on any of your spheres. This is a choose. So all they're chosen among these four. Oh, so it's just a coincidence that you have these that are related. So can you imagine if this were. So, can you imagine if this works and that works, all these works, and you can actually check individually? Yeah, sorry. Okay, yeah, thank you.
