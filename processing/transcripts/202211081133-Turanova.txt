We choose that the epsilon. Okay, why that regularization of the velocity. So there's the original equation. So solutions to this are Wasserstein, two Wasserstein gradient flows of the energy. E of rho is one half into rho on omega rho over rho bar to rho. So I feel wonderful that several other speakers have already given a bunch of backgrounds. Speakers have already given a bunch of background on lots of time gradient flows, so I won't. And we define the regularized energy. So e epsilon of rho being rho convolved with zeta epsilon squared over rho bar dx. And you can sort of do your formal computation to see that Wasserstein. To see that Wasserstein gradient flows of E epsilon should be solutions of the following continuity equation. So dt rho minus divergence of rho grad d E epsilon d rho. And lo and behold, to this d epsilon, the grad of d epsilon d rho is exactly our approximating list. So that's how we got it. And in fact, we proved that. We prove that so this di E is a standard type of energy, whereas this is pointing new. So in our study of the properties and well positiveness of gradient flows of this guy, we do show that gradient flows of Epsilon are solutions to this equation. So everything I said before is indeed literally true. So here's our, really our, I've stated a bunch of results, but this is I've stated a bunch of results, but this is our actual main result. The other ones follow pretty directly from this one. We say, so if rho epsilon is the Wasserstein gradient flow of E epsilon with some initial data rho zero, that means rho epsilon narrowly converge to rho, where rho is the gradient flow of E with initial data rho zero. And indeed, the previously stated results follow from this. Follow from this. So let's see. So I am going remarkably fast, but that's okay. So for the question. Sorry, what is narrow convergence? So that's So the integral of rho minus rho epsilon f goes to zero for all, I think, continuous and bounded f. Any other questions before I continue? We'll try to think of more to fill up your time. Oh, oh dear. Now you're now I better call it really slow so I uh uh No, it's yeah, okay. Great, so let me talk about elements of the proof. Okay, so like I mentioned before, we show that the gradient flows of this new energy E epsilon are both defined. So that involves studying like the convexity properties of this E epsilon. We show that E epsilon gamma converges to epsilon. converges to epsilon. Then we obtain an estimate on an H1-like norm for the gradient flows of this E epsilon. And a key gradient is an energy epsilon for that, an energy estimate for that epsilon key. And so I'm going to talk about this bullet point in another slide. And then we established the gamma convergence of the metric slopes of E epsilon. Of the metric slopes of E epsilon to those of E. And then we conclude via a general result of Surfer T in 2011 on convergence of radiant flows. And yesterday, Matthias did such a great presentation of that result, whereby if you essentially have gamma convergence of the energies, gamma convergence of their metric slopes, and Of their metric slopes, and another part which is perfectly easy for us, so I didn't mention it here, you get convergence of the gradient flows themselves. Okay, so I'm going to spend some time on these two bullet points. Okay, so what is this H1 like them? So, suppose rho is a solution to our approximate equation, then we have that the That the integral from 0t and then the spatial of the spatial integral of grad rho convolved with zeta epsilon squared dx ct is less than c. Where of course the key point to c doesn't depend on epsilon. So this is interesting because again because this doesn't depend on epsilon and this provides a key source of compactness for us to get our convergence results. are who we're used to. So this estimate, so this level follows from the following energy estimates, which I'll state. So the d dt of rho log rho dx plus the quantity we're interested in, the integral of grand rho convalescent theta epsilon squared, equals to this stuff. But notice first, so I'm going to present a sketch of this energy. I'm going to present a sketch of this energy estimate in, or not a sketch, I'm going to give you a formal argument for it when rho bar equals one, in which case this right-hand side is zero. But notice even when rho bar is not one, these are kind of lower order terms and they are not problematic. And I, okay, great. And the reason I want to present the formal argument for this energy estimate, so let me go here. The reason I want to present it is, first, I think it's really cool. And as I mentioned, it arises in several other contexts that have to do with approximations of the forest meeting equations. Okay, so there's our equation, dt rho minus divergence of rho, grad rho, convolved with those two modifiers. So let's note the following. Note the following. So this equation, just like its epsilon 0 partner, is mass preserving. So the derivative in time of the integral rho dx is 0. So d dt of rho log rho dx, that's the same as d dt of rho log rho dx minus the integral of rho dx. Okay, so on this slide and the next slide, you're going to watch me do calculus really slowly. So let's do it. Okay. Okay, so the d dt of rho li rho dx. Well, that's d dt of this stuff, of this. Okay, so first the derivative will fall on this row, so I get rho t log rho, then the derivative will fall on log rho, so I get rho, rho t over rho, and then the derivative falls on this row. So next I notice, of course, these two rows cancel, and then I get rho t minus rho t, which is zero. And then And then I, instead of rho t, I, again, I'm saying this is formal, I plug in this divergence of blah, blah, blah. Okay, great. So now you might guess I'm going to do an integration by parts and put the divergence on the log. So then I get rho, grad rho convolved with that stuff, and then gradient of rho, gradient of log of rho, I mean. And so then I still get rho, gradient of row, and all of this stuff. And now I get gradient of rho over row. And I'm so pleased because now these two rows cancel. So then, and I get a minus sign, of course. So I get that this is a grad row convolved with these two zetas, grad row dx. And now you probably realize why I keep it as two zetas instead of just putting it as one modifier. Instead of just putting it as one modifier, because now I can move this mollifier to the other term. So I get minus rad rho convolved with zeta epsilon squared dx. Because indeed, if zeta is even, then the integral of f convolved with zeta times g equals to f of times zeta convolved with g, just by doing a change of variable. Okay? So. Okay, so this is really cool that we can looking at this entropy quantity of rho and taking its time derivative, we get this nice derivative quantity. Okay? Great. And like I mentioned, this is relevant to other porous medium type plot equations. Okay. And so now we want to show you. And so now we want to show you another formal computation about a second key part of what we do, namely how to show this gamma convergence of metric slopes. And it again involves this sort of modifier exchange. And I'm also going to show you how we use the previous estimate. Okay. So what does that mean, gamma convergence metric flows? So our goal is the following. So our goal is the following. Suppose rho epsilon narrowly converges to rho. Then for any smooth function, we have the following. And again, I'm sticking with rho bar equals 1. Integral of f rho epsilon, then grad of my favorite stuff, zeta epsilon, zeta epsilon, rho epsilon, equals 1/2 f grad rho squared. So again, as yesterday Matthia so kindly explained, So, gamma convergence, yes. Excuse me, it's limited, right? Um, yes, of course. That isn't the limit, I'm sorry. Um, right, so as Matthias explained, so the metrics, the gamma convergence of metric slopes would be lim int of this guy without the f and this squared, and then an inequality, and then the appropriate quantity on the right. But due to, oh my goodness. To show that it is enough to show exactly what I have written. Okay, so then I'm going to show you how, or exactly what I have written, except with a limit as epsilon goes to 0. So let me show you the sketch. So first, the previous bound, the H1 pipe bound, allows us to update the narrow convergence of rho, epsilon to rho, into L2 convergence. So we're going to actually use that previous. We're going to actually use that previous bound the second time. Okay, so using the mollifier moving around fact that I stated, we can write the quantity on the left as, so f rho epsilon grad z epsilon, z epsilon convolved with rho epsilon, as these guys, f rho epsilon, convolves with one of the modifiers times the other guy. Grad Z epsilon convolves with rho epsilon. Gradz A dot plan development growth tool and the next oh oh no, what happened? Oh dear, I think I pressed and held the button. So I'm not supposed to do that. Okay, so now we can move this f completely out of the convolution, but at the cost of an O of epsilon term. Of epsilon term. And to what contributes to this cost, well, this size of this die is going to contribute, but by the previous bound, this die is controlled. The previous bound said that the L2 norm of this essentially is controlled. So then I notice that I can write rho epsilon convoluted zeta epsilon times the gradient of times the gradient of rho epsilon common volume zeta epsilon as the one-half times the gradient of rho epsilon volume zeta epsilon squared. Okay? And so now by an integration by parts, I can move that gradient onto the F and then I can, because I have that the rho epsilon convolves, zeta epsilon converges in L2, I get that this converges to about 1 half. converges to 1 half gradient f rho squared, which by another integration by parts gives me exactly what I wanted. Now, probably many of you can see that almost every quality in here is very formal. But this is essentially the essence of how we get the gamma convergence of metric slopes. And moreover, I should comment again. I should comment again, the innovation in our work is having rho bar not equal to 1. And there, you know, you just get extra error terms and you have to control them properly. But the reason that you can control them is that you chose, is that we chose to do this regularization in the proper way. Oh, that's funny. Oh, okay, never mind. Okay, so I'm going to have this. The next couple slides will be about a cool application. A cool application to robotics forming. Before I go into that, so let me remind you again of RPE. So dc rho minus divergence of rho grand rho over rho bar d0 in our region omega. So note that the steady state solution of this guy is just rho bar. And formally you could see this just by setting it equal to zero and then playing with it. playing with it. And indeed, our main results imply that indeed our approximate rho n epsilon, that was our particle solution, narrowly converges to this rho bar of x as t and n go to infinity and epsilon goes. And this fact is really the key thing we need for the application I'll show you. Okay, but before Okay, but before that I'm going to show you videos of our bind numerical methods. So let me do that. Okay, so let me do first this. Okay, cool. So here, what is going to be in these videos? So there's our row bar, the green line. Then these orange guys, right now they're, so those represent the locations of the particles. So right now they're at their initial locations, they're not moving. Actual locations, they're not moving. And this row, this blue line, so this should have a twiddle on it, because in the notation I used in this talk, row epsilon twiddle denotes the positions, the sum of the direct masses convolved with the blocks. Okay, so let's see what happens when I press play. My favorite part when I press play is to watch the orange dot. When I press plays to watch the orange dots move around. Okay, so as we see the orange dots move around and our approximate, the guy we show is an approximate solution does indeed converge to this robot. And notice it doesn't quite get there. Not quite there. So, let's. Sorry, okay. I was so busy staring at the picture that I just didn't even hear what you just said. Was the blue one after you took the convolution? Yes, yes. So, this is the blobs. Exactly. Okay, yeah. But, so let's look at the one with... And if you might notice, I call the particles robots for reasons you'll, I'll explain in a minute. Okay, so here we have more particles and And there we get closer to our row bar. And so the next movies I'll show, we're going to have row bar that do not satisfy our hypothesis, but the algorithm still works. So this guy. So notice this is 50 particles. This is 50 particles, which is the same as in the first movie I showed you, but we don't get up close. And now the 50 ones are made, I like watching them more because I like watching dots move around. But so here's the one with a piecewise constant, target row bar, and that's Cool. So that's sort of the picture. How many articles was the last one? 200. Yeah. Okay, cool. So now let me talk about the application. So, and this is very, I'm being a bit fanciful in this application. So let's say we seek to pollinate a field of flow. But also this is, the application is how we first started working on. Is how we first started working on this stuff. So we seek to pollinate a field of flowers using robotic bees. So each bee, it can sense whether it is over a flower, it can sense whether there are other bees nearby, and it can change its velocity based on this information. Bees cannot communicate with each other or with a central public. Each other or with a central hub. So then the modeling is the following. So our omega now is in R2, represents the field. Our rho bar represents the distribution of flowers in our field. And I remark that this rho bar is not known to the bees or nor to the farmer who's releasing the bees. And the goal is to get the bees to come. is to get the bees to come to the flowers. In other words, to have the density of the swarm be approximately this rho bar. So then, of course, we can do the following. Let x, 0, i be the initial locations. Then we let the b's move sort of along as solutions to our OBE system. And we imagine And we imagine row twiddle, namely the blobs over the positions, represent somehow the pollination radius of the beads. So then for small epsilon, large n, and large t, we do indeed get that our swarm is approximately a rho of xt. That's approximately rho bar. And that's great. So one thing to remind. So, one thing to remark here is that indeed, if you look at the ODE system, somehow it really does only depend on sort of what the bees can see as well as sort of within their radius. So, this application is, like I said, it's fanciful, but something, this is a great source of inspiration for us. This is a great source of inspiration for projects for undergraduates where we do things like try to get this closer to an actual, like applicable swarming algorithm where you really have inputs of what the robots get and you really could see how they move. But yeah, so that's pretty fun for me. Okay, and I did finish a bit early, but thank you. Bit early, but thank you very much for your attention. Okay, are there any questions for Olga? I actually had a couple. Oh, yeah. First, the easier one. As you kept writing the equation under the assumptions of rho of R, I kept thinking, why is it in the denominator? But then when you got to It in the denominator, but then when you got to the slide about the application, then you with it in the denominator, I guess you clearly see that that's the same state. Yes, that's right. Okay, and then the original equation, I was trying to follow the details. It was on a domain, right? So that. And then at some point, I saw no domain in the image. So you get to something that I probably, since I had extra time, I could have covered this in the talk. I could have covered this in the talk, but I chose to completely omit it. So, something that we have to do is we have to, in addition to considering that E and E epsilon, the energy corresponding to the diffusion and approximate diffusion, we have to add an additional term that has like a confining potential. Okay, so you don't get it just from the boundary. Yeah, so we have to do something to enforce the boundary, and then we have. Force the boundary. And then we have a parameter that tells us how much we can find our particles. And then we take a limit both in epsilon and in this parameter. But so the reason that I didn't cover that is that some is that doing that is pretty standard. And also the right. If you look at the, say, even the V D, it is not at all surprising that you should get conversions as solutions. As solutions, as the confining potential gets deeper. Okay? But indeed, we take two limits. So we take this epsilon to zero and that confining potential limits. Okay? Yes? Is there any hope to get a quantitative estimate on epsilon on theta is of the convergence? That would be great. I don't know how I would do it. I guess I would for maybe one thing to that there is hope for is maybe to see the look at the energies E, epsilon, and E and try to see the distance between them. They're minimizers at least. That would be a first step, but yeah. And indeed, we like, oh, I won't say anything else. Yes, thank you. I actually had another question. I actually have another question. This nice property, so when I first saw this, I was really impressed with that choice of regularization to make particles good of particles. So in the original paper that you mentioned, for, was it just regular porous medium equation, the Leon's Maas Kettle? Yep, yep. Was that a feature of the original, like introducing this? Original, like introducing this regularization, was that a main goal of it? Was to keep particles particles or something? Exactly, yes. Okay. So it wasn't just a happy accident or something. No, that was their goal. Are there any other questions? All right, let's take one day again. Yeah, we'll be back here at 2 o'clock. So what you are saying is that now in our wait, when you have those you can write down my stream by separating it. I was really looking forward to it after that meeting. Sorry, there's things going on in the same way. Yeah, they catch about the boundary. I'm like, wait, I thought you'd be stupid. You just did integration right now. It's like, what's that kind of one thing here in space? One thing you're in study today is like yes or she has to do it. So it's just kind of just make a bit of salvation. I believe for everyone. In our teacher we did comparable experiments where we sort of measured we measure the distance between the two. And so um it's the map space. I started working on this social media. So that's how I started. But it can it can't be that soy secret. Maybe a more meaty example. So you can say that the robots learners on, that's another way for robots and abstract planets and the particle and like a neural network. It has a very neural. It has a very direct market as much as possible and maximum total. Yeah, 506. Yeah, the most cool thing they're gonna have was memory six. Yeah, so yeah, I agree actually. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's a very physical question. Are you in a rush? I mean, what I'm saying is very much. Oh, that's right. I remember. Okay, I'm assuming that's the thing. So we're going to have like a X. Yeah, yeah. Um but I think I totally spaced out very easy contact. I was like, Yeah, you know I was thinking of me, I was thinking if people are then yesterday. And so and then she said, I'm not saying she said yes. And then I thought did that spend more? No, did that spend version? And then I went on to the image. Yes, I was so new. So each one's. You're always making contact with us, right? Every few seconds I might turn and you can't get it. And when Emma's back to you, I really like the practice control. Lizzie Mosh. Yeah. Sorry, I'm fighting like I have to go to the bathroom, be hungry, and be careful. I'm having like 15 logs on the end, we have to do something funny where we can do it. But not only Okay, let's present that. And then we have another presentation just before you're in the middle. And then use the new video. Ethelon energy. The epsilon size converges to the mind, but then the size of the direction to the robots on the side, which you put in by foot originally. But that's just ability for the ability. So she would also be able to. So that's a great point that you noticed. Are you uh postdoc with Benjamin Yes, and you can look totally? Oh, that's great radiant flows of voice medium equation. Wow, that's so cool! Thank you. Thank you. I really hope. Thank you so much. So is the next step, putting steamers on the robots? Oh god. Yeah. That's what my dad said to me. I got even
