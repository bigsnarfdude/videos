Okay. All right. So thanks, everyone. So I'm going to jump talk early. So it's not far. It's a bit loud or too low. So I have to talk way one step back. Too low. Okay, I have to. You muted now. Right here. I'm unmuted on that one. Right. One. Right. Okay. So actually, the talk I'm going to give is not too different to antibody generation because I'm working on peptides, which are small proteins, and basically is applying machine learning, deep learning algorithm to either predict functions or to generate structure. So, but the word I'm going to talk today is basically something that we usually ignore. And that is to do because most machine learning approaches that have been done over the last decade. Learning approaches that have been done over the last decade basically are based on sequences, and because of that, it's not like an image. An image, a human, can actually recognize a human face, but a sequence, you can't recognize a structure. So it's a particularity because you can't just generate new sequences and expect that the structure will be the same as the one you trained for. All right. So, if you're not familiar with what are peptides, so they're usually small proteins. Are peptides, so they're usually small proteins, they're usually less than 100 residue, and they actually included and they are part of drug discovery pipelines. They're not as popular as small molecules. I used to work in small molecules. What happened? Right. That's right. I can talk about things, but those ones, I mean, there's a bit tricky because there's a bit of hype around alpha fold and all that. Program alpha fold and all that, but alpha fold is not as good for prediction for smaller domains, and that is tricky when you actually want to use it to feed your network or any machine learning helpers. I can sing, but I'm not a good singer. So, right. So, I know anyway, so basically, you got basically the application. You get basically the applications are quite wide. You can go from basic research, saying structural biology, to understand to actually crystallize structure with a ligand. I mean, that's what's fundamental when you want to understand how a peptide or small molecule wants to modulate a receptor. But right there, for example, if you're not familiar with what are peptide and proteins, they're usually represented as simple as a necklace right there, with little pearls representing this residue, so 20 amino acids. These residues, the 20 amino acids, plus post-transductional modification, the sequencing and the order in which those residues appear will actually favor certain structure. Those are familiar. Now you may be familiar with alpha-fold. You've seen those alpha-electes or the beta sheets. There's actually way more structure than those two. And then you get the globular structure like a tertiary. There's even work on collapse fold and all of that to actually predict quaternary. Predict quaternary and protein-protein interactions. So, that is one area. So, the application in general, well, there is drug discovery, there is antibody generation, there is tissue engineering. You can see, I mean, you can, I'm working mostly on peptides and mostly toxin derived from venom, but there is also antimicrobial peptide that are quite, you know, that's what I'll be talking about today, and are quite popular because of potential alternatives to promotional antibiotics. Antibiotics. A while big pharma doesn't want to invest that much because it's not really profitable. And I used to work, I worked with Pfizer and worked with Piaf, so I'm not familiar with the idea. So basically, the size that you can imagine is like antibodies. So Richard will be talking about this. I'm talking about this. So that is aspirin. So it's a quite small structure. Peptide is slightly bigger. And then you can get albumin, for example, and anti- Albumins, for example, and antibodies and larger structure, just for reference, if not familiar. Now, when you talk about protein design and protein engineering, it's pretty much synonymous. It's the idea that you can actually modify a native sequence to alter the structure or the sequences in order to get the optimal or the desired properties that you're looking for. A good safety profile. You don't want the Profile. You don't want the sequence of the structure to be toxic. You don't want to, because, for example, these antimicrobial peptides that are known to be hemolytic. So you don't want to swallow an antibiotic and spit blood out of it. So that's that there is a couple of things like that. And so the idea is really tricky because we need to work an interaction between sequence structure. So alpha follow is basically this, and then function. Function. So, when you look at all the genomics area, it's mostly sequence comparison. When you look at eventually, we start looking at systems, including machine learning, deep learning, that associated sequence to function. And usually we ignore structure because until the recent approaches, you will use Rosetta or Alpha4 or Actaser, and it will take days to actually get a structure out of it. So, it will not be a man. Not be basically applicable to large biobanks. Yes? So, right there, function, it can be actually the biological function associated with the modulation of a protein, for example. So, let's say it could be binding interaction, it could be antimicrobial activity, could be anti-cancer. So, it could be phenotypic, like the one I just mentioned, or it could be target-based. Target-based. There's actually different kinds because drug discovery is basically phenotypic screening or target-based screening. So when you have with, for example, the design of vaccines, once we knew the spike protein, we could actually design target-based and target-target protein-protein interactions. Before that, it's pretty much screening. Now, when you're actually looking at protein from a sequence point of view, basically you get a View basically, you get a black sheet of sequences, and some of them eventually will fall in a specific structure, and some of them will have a defined function, right? So, here is an example of antimicrobial peptide or regulatory peptide that are actually found in plants, in violets called cyclotides, and there has been found in several applications. And those are RTD teta defancina actually found in both chimps. Actually, found in both chimps and humans. And they both actually have some different kinds of variability properties, including potential defense against pathogens. But when you can imagine that between those two, there's wide differences in sequence, in size, and there is also different potential functions. So it's really when we're looking at observing basically all these spaces, it's quite large, and you don't guarantee that you will actually have necessarily you can. Actually, have necessarily, you can hit and explore a sequence space right there and be right next to an active space, right? So it's basically costly. And I will explain why, because I used to be in a bench, so I know what it is to actually work and synthesize those peptides. So basically, when you think about synthesizing them, there's different approaches. And the common one are either when you have no clue what you get a structure base and you actually don't know about the interaction, you will. Don't know about the interaction, you will start from the ligand itself. So, the peptide. That's only one area. So, there is target-based area, but it's also ligand-based drug design. So, the idea that you only know what the ligand is doing, but you don't know how. So, you will eventually screen. You will screen by doing truncation, for example, right there. Typical one would be the alanine scan, the idea that you mutate every single amino acid once and eventually see which one are actually part of the biological activity you're measuring. Part of the biological activity you're measuring. There is also, well, there is truncation there, there is like overlapping, and eventually you get also position scanning. But that's quite greedy and costly because, I mean, usually the smallest peptide, 20 residue will be done in a day or two. But then if you start looking at 30 residues, 40 residue, then you get complication, synthesis complication. Then you can switch to expression in organisms like E. coli. Organism like E. coli or P.S. pastori, but then even there would be complication expressions, so it comes very difficult. Now, if you think about it, it's no different to this type of cycle that you've seen everywhere, design, make, test, and cycle. You start with a data set, possibly a single ligand or single drugs or molecule. Then you will generate analogs to figure out what function each of the actual function on the peptides. Actual function on the peptides on the small molecule will actually do. Then you test your hypothesis that your mutations will eventually have an effect. Then you do biological essay. Eventually, you are actually interested to improve the inhibition of the target affinity towards the proteins, but you want also to get the peptide to be to maintain solubility. You want the peptide to be able to form a specific structure, a secondary structure. So then you will come to have multi-optic. Will come to have multi-objective optimization. It's really that's tricky. And I will exemplify that. So that's what I was working on in my postdoc between 2012 and 2015. I was working with people in Brisbane, in Australia, and also in the US, in Groton, Boston, with Pfizer. So the idea was we were making GLP-1 analogs. GLP1 or glucayon-like peptal is the hormone that you use. Like peptides D hormone that you secrete to actually stimulate the expression of insulin. And that's what most diabetic type 2 actually cannot secrete anymore. So the idea is that you actually supply to them a compound like baeta. Baeta is actually a compound derived from the saliva of the Guilla monster in north of Mexico and Arizona. It's actually very similar in structure to To DLP-1. It's actually one of the base of some of the drug ducts, Pfizer, and other companies actually selling these days with a couple of modifications to actually do this. So what my job was basically to actually do synthesis of what we call lactam bridges. So lactam bridges are basically you put the side chains of peptides and you connect them to each other. And the idea is to actually rigidify. PEPSA are usually flexible. I don't show any MG simulation. I don't show any MD simulation there, but they will be flexible. And so, the idea of doing a bridge like that is basically to rigidify the actual sober noise structure and to be able to have noise on biological activity or reduce the noise associated with the activity. And so at the beginning, we were screening this by doing because we didn't know, we didn't know where to the interaction was between GLP-1 and its receptor. There is a receptor of class B GPCR called GPLP1. Class B GPCR called GPGLP1 receptor. There's actually a transmember domain and an extracellular domain. So the peptide, I remember doing that, when I was giving that talk, is basically the peptide basically have an enter middle, which is here, this entry that will enter into the transform band domain. And if first, the suma yellow will be the sort of pink in yellow. And so what basically the peptide does is enter, first it recognizes the extracellular domain before entering. Domain before entering into the transmomal domain, and there is a shift into the peptide. Now, the crystal structure of the GLP-1 receptor is entirely done, but back in 2012, there's only the extracellular domain or the trunchomal domain. There was not the two together. There would be simulation, but it was difficult to figure out how the peptide was actually interacting with its receptor. So, you wouldn't even know, well, that is the structure known in solution. Known in solution is not necessarily a structure in the receptor. So that's quite different. So we will, that's why we were investigating how, and by doing constraints like that, how we can capture the actual isogonary structure that the peptide will do in the receptor. And we'll measure a bunch of biological activity. So agonism for agonistic activity, so how the peptide is stimulating the activating the receptor by two different By two different biomarkers. You will use binding affinity, then insulin secretion and more physical properties called alical propensity. The peptide actually forming a coil, like a nalphylysis, and we want actually to see whether that actually has an effect. And when we do mutation, how does that have an effect on the peptide? We'll do a couple of measurements and eventually come up with a winner. And so, but I do it. And so, but I do it as a cycle because it's an iterative process. We don't come up by this just on the first play. And that's quite, it comes like this. So, the idea to use computational machine learning or computational tools is to actually reduce the experimental human resources. Not that I want to fire people, I just am one of those guys that actually want to use AI to assist the design, not to replace. To replace and so ADO equipment as well because it's costly. Now, it turns out that also it's not always true when it comes to drug discovery, but there has been a digitization of the data. I mean, many, many companies still are closed source and they will keep their data for themselves. I mean, it's normal. That's what they do. That's what they get the money from. Then, whenever the data is actually available, you can actually use. Is actually available, you can actually use the data to do either predictive model or generative models and help to automate the decision making. So when it comes to computational protein design or peptide design, the idea is you start from a couple of sequences. Eventually, you want one that has 15 to 30 residue. You want eventually that they have actually a secondary structure defined. So there will be a defined alphabet for it. Then you can use all sorts of algorithms. Can use all sorts of algorithms. Now we're talking about deep learning, but 15 years ago, they were already using genetic algorithm for it. Now we're talking about, now it's outdated, recurrent neural network, it's all about transformers. But I mean, the idea is you generate sequences that will eventually share the same property of the distribution that the one you train them for. Eventually, that they will share also the same biological activity. Then you measure very Then you measure very similarly the biological activity you intested, whether it's just a classification, antimicrobial, non-antimicrobial, or inhibitory and a value, whether it's a protein-binding affinity. Then you will do screening. You will basically, you will have endpoints, like targets that you actually want. That's why you do design. But the idea here is to minimize the number of rotation of cycles. You want two, three cycles at best. Three cycles at best, and eventually you get a peptide with this profile of interest. Now, when it comes to design, it really boomed really the last five years or so, to 2015 onward. And most of the research has been done in this area. It's been done because most of the data, if you look at PDB or if you look at NCBI, it's sequence prior. TBI, it's sequence, primary sequence of peptide. You don't know the structure until AlphaFold was there, you will use Rosetta. It will take you three days to get a structure from a single sequence. So imagine doing thousands, not even possible. Now, AlphaFold, I've done for paper, I've done about 400 structure in four hours. And it's actually possible. But again, I don't trust completely the model. I will have to filter and pick out all the confirmation that doubtful. That doubtful. But so you can see in this list that have been applied to cell-penetrating peptide, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, antiviral, hemolytic toxicity, protein binder, monoclonal antibody, antigen-specific ones, and enzymes. And then when you here, there is an intermediate when you actually look at sequences, but you're looking at sequences that will form only one structure. You will actually do mutagenesis in the idea that assuming that the mutation. Assuming that the mutation will not affect the three structure. And that's what basically machine learning directed evolution is: is the idea that you assume that the three structure will be the same, you generate analogs, few mutations, not the whole thing, and then eventually figure out that the mutation you do will be optimized or you will be to improve the biological activity you're measuring. Anzymatic catalysis, for example, or you can fluorescent protein channel rhodopsin. Fluorescent protein channel rhodopsin. So, that some of the examples have been applied. And the last one, it's one particularly interesting, it has been just popping up the last year or so, is the idea that you can actually explore specific, you do the inverse protein folding idea. You got one structure and you can generate all the sequences that will eventually fold into, likely fold into that 3D structure. And so, there is tools that are actually available like protein and PNN. I didn't put the Protein and PNN. I didn't put the reference there because there will be too many. So you can eventually look at that reference on Chem Archive and the reference are there. But they are the idea that you can actually look for the specific sequence that will fold in that particular window. Now, if you look at from a thought exercise, what's the difference between the two? When it comes to doing it in a lab, you will have Doing it in a lab, you will have to follow intuition or you will do specific mutations because you want to be able to either sell it to your publisher or to your patent. You want to be able to explain the logic behind your mutations. And so you actually follow specific paths to actually get some analogy, actually feel when it comes to computational, you can actually be a bit more risky and explore the space a bit wider. And explore the space a bit wider by using a fitness function as a guideline to optimize. So that it's a bit different as the way you explore the thing. Now, when it comes to designing peptides, it's not a single optimization business. It's actually a multi-optimization. You have several objectives. Many of the peptides, I would say, are highly toxic alone. So it depends on what you want to do, but some peptides can be prospective. Some peptides can be broad spectrum. They can kill a lot of bacteria without discriminating. And you want some that are actually highly specific. For example, scorpion toxins are actually highly specific to ion channels. And so they could be a good starting point to explore peptides to modulate ion channels for central nervous system disorder. You get immunogenicity, you get functional promiscuity, the idea that. Functional promiscuity, the idea that they can not only target ekaryotic cells, but prokaryotic cells as well. So there will be these issues with stability. The peptides, as I said, they are quite flexible. Some of them eventually have bridges or ways to lock themselves. And so they won't be attacked by any enzyme to chop them up. There will be, there is also an issue, for example, in there is one particular area where the farmer is interested. What the farmer is interested is the idea that you can actually swallow peptide pills. The only one available right now is cyclosporin A. So it's pretty much the only compound. So because it's a market, most of the peptides and proteins will be injected. Insulin is injected. And for convenience, that's another market. And so the idea is to actually figure out what are the idea towards this. So now I'll be talking about antimicrobial. Talking about antimicrobes. They are small peptides, usually between 10 and 50 residue, even sometimes around 30. They usually, they have all sorts of mechanism, as expressed there. They usually interact mostly with membranes, but they've also been found to interact either with nucleotides and intracellular proteins. And so they've been interested to actually develop them as potential antibiotics. As potential antibiotics. Now, there's been in the last, yeah, it's been the last five or ten years or so, the development and the use of algorithm, machine learning and deep learning algorithm mostly, to first identify from any source that has been from genome data banks, from I think a friend did it on the human genome to figure out whether domain they would be trying. With antimicrobial activity, they are actually all sorts, but they're usually binary. Here we're talking mostly about binary classifiers: antibiotic, antimicrobial, non-antimicrobial. There are different kinds. We actually published this one where we were also looking at the weaknesses of the current algorithm. So, the idea that you can actually apply with very lot of robustness up to 95. Robustness up to 95-98% accuracy. However, it won't be good or a good predictor for set up types of alphabet because the model hasn't been trained on those alphabets, so then it will be unseen those ones. Not in those ones. Most of the alone, no. No, we actually, right now, we actually do developing algorithms that use Map4. This is a fingerprint. Use map for. This is a fingerprint that is used both on small molecule and that can be used on proteins with post-translational modification. The idea that you can actually merge the two area, and the idea that you can actually map T-SNE or anything like that to actually map the visualization on non-canonical residue. And then more recently, really in 2017 onwards, there's been a use of generative algorithm. It's maybe not as popular as proteins because. Because I mean, there's always adaptation to it. But basically, what we need to do often is the size issue with the data set, the imbalance, I mean, biology data is dirty. You need to figure it and to pay attention to it. One particular area that I've been looking at is the idea of biases for the models and the domain of applicability. I mean, whether you assume that the distribution of your training set is always the same. Distribution of your training set is always the same as your testing set, but it's not always the case. I used to predict blood and bio permeability for small molecules. And the one I was trained on small molecules, but then I was also applying to natural product. And natural product chemically, trust me, they're very different. So when it comes to antimicrobial peptide, it turns out that until now, very little was known about the 3D structure. Known about the F3D structure. And the reason is, I mean, that's one example of the antimicrobial database, APD. And you can see pictures that 14% of them adopt ELIX. And about most of them, those two, basically, do not have a 3D structure. So it's really a small portion. And that actually have two things. One, most people, because they only see alpha lysis, they will assume that all the antimicropeptides will actually be alpha-liqual. Peptide will actually be alpha equal, which is not true. And then that is because most of the three structure that will be released on protein data bank will actually be like that. And then you will have eventually that basically the amino acid composition and the derived properties that you will actually use to predict those models will eventually favor specific structure. That's it. So most of the time was known. So what we did. So, most of the time was known. So, what we decided to do, and then so we were interested also to figure out if there was a potential bias for structure in our existing predictive and genetic models. So, here is an example when the authors basically looked at several antimicrobial predictors, and they were actually interested to see, in that case, about taxonomy. Turns out that many antimicrobials since the 1960s have been isolated from the 60s have been isolated from the skin of frogs, amphibians. Or some of them come from plants, some others come from reptiles, insects. But basically, because you use public data sets that have been documented, they don't actually have a bias towards the sequences that actually occupy. And what those guys actually compare is whether or not the different algorithm would be biased towards specific taxon. And yes, some. And yes, some of them will be preferred peptides that actually originated from invertebrates. So that actually skewed the thing. So we were actually interested to actually do the same thing, but this time for structure, to actually see whether there will be biases towards structure. But for that, I mean, we started this, that was right where AlphaFold was just starting. It was not necessarily applied to large batches. And so you Batches and so you want to be able to use something that is faster and as reliable to actually predict 3D structure. So, we started to use Grampa, which is the largest repository. It's actually available on GitHub, of 45,000 data points. That means about 6,000 unique sequences and about 2,000 structure PDB. What we did was a huge filter using PDB entry to eventually reduce that structure. Reduce that structure. And so we compared different secondary structure states. So each one of them has alices, sheets, and coils. And so we were looking at different existing programs that could actually tell us whether they will be true to the truth. What we considered true was the available PDB structure. We actually filter some peptide will have a single PDB structure, some others will have like 10, depending on how many the different conditions they will be actually solved. Many of the different conditions they will be actually solved, whether using nuclear magnetic resonance or crystallography, mostly, no prior M. And so we were looking at that. We also looked at alpha fold, but the difference to be able to compare alpha fold with this, alpha fold give you 3D structure. You need to go back to secondary structure. You need to use platforms called Stride to be able to, so it's an extra step. But it was as responsive, as good as Pepton. Responsive as good as PEP2D here. And so, what we decided to do is to actually map out the landscape of Grampa. So, that was done with my master students Danielle. So, the idea here is that the structure that will be on the top will be alpha-licle. Those one will be coil and alpha-liqual, coil, and then coil beta, beta-beta, and then alpha-beta. So, there will be a mix of them. Now, there will be a large gap in some. Large gap in some cases and small gap in others. That's actually a tricky part. We're actually resolving that to figure out whether that has to do with the exponential condition that we use during solving the 3D structure. I can't tell you, I'm just doing the correction of peer review right now. But basically, the idea is this. If I can actually establish the 3D structure for one single data set, I can eventually discover potential. I can eventually discover potential new for new structure that I wasn't fully explored. If I got two data sets, eventually I can use it to look at two antagonistic data, antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial. And if I want to do multi-objective, I want to use more than three. And I can eventually see what are the restricted, the alphabet and the actual that are restrictive over the three or four or five different data sets. Different data sets. So we did that with Grampa. We figured that Grampa was mostly, predominantly, alpha-lysis and there's other structures. When it comes to E. coli, which is very specific, we share exactly the same distribution, mostly alpha-lico. And a recent paper, they use VIE as a generative model. They actually decided to truncate some peptides in the first place without cystein and proline because they're harder to synthesize. And that means Harder to synthesize, and that means that the generated paper will adopt mostly alpha lysis. Now, we also did a benchmark across 14 different predictive models and figured out that the models in general were very good. There was very small false positive, what you can see, true positive, false positive, false negative, true negative. And then basically is the gap here that interested us is to see whether the training set will have a weakness in certain type of fold. Type of fold. And so, in general, those motels are really good in alpha liches. They're less good, they're also good in alpha and coil, but they're very, very bad when it comes to beta coil and mixed structure. And that means that the current existing one will only favor alphaly. So that's actually interesting. If you're only interested in synthesizing peptide with alpha-lical structure, fair enough. Good. You do a good job. But otherwise, that's another business. Otherwise, that's another business. And that's it. I ready in two minutes. Thank you very much, Fabian. So we have time for some questions, and there was time for a discussion that has been super compressed now. But because we have some people from the online sessions that you may want to ask questions now. Ask questions now. Thank you, Fabian Beresto. As you saw, as you showed there, the 60%, around 60% of the structure known is what is non-canonical 3D, non-alpha, non-beta. And then also when you look at alpha-fold 2 predictions on all the human proteins or all the proteins, you see that there are. all the proteins you see that they are when there is not a canonical structure alpha fol is really messy so many of the pec of the of the of the peptides that you are looking for the structure or the or then should be go into exploration of this field that or this part of the let's say structural field non-non non the non-de alpha as you say of these bias of the alpha and so These bias of the alpha, and so, how are going you to approach that? Because this is a big problem. So, we did that specifically for alpha-fold and others. We actually, so we explore in different ways we use conotoxins. Conotoxins are usually less than 40 residue, and so alpha, they're not alpha-fold-friendly, really, because they're very small for alpha-fold. Alpha fold is usually 20 over 70 onwards. So, what we look at is whether they are sufficient because. Is whether they are super because alpha volt use multi-sequence alignments, so they will be documented. So, if there is conototoxin actually ranked into superfamilies, there will be tons of them, but there will be basically if there is enough sequences available on protein data bank, then the software should be able to actually document and get a robust prediction. And so, I recently done that on, I'm still, some students are actually doing that for extra data. That for extra data. But basically, when the superfamily has over 100 sequences available, then the prediction is rather robust, like PLDDT over 85, if I remember. So it's really robust. But otherwise, it's actually the same question, the idea of mutagenesis affecting the 3D structure. We've done that as well for also for politoxin, but over Rosetta, itaser, PEFOLD, to see whether they ended here. To see whether there will end here, there is actually a length issue. So the alpha fold and other will be relatively good over 25 onwards. And PEP fold is actually tuned for peptides. It's actually rather not good, including for small structure. So we were actually interested to explore that, to find out what would be the robust one for us. Any other questions for Papa? Any other questions for Fabian? Okay, thank you so much, Fabiana. And I guess so. We have like about five minutes before the picture. If you have questions for any participant, and I would say Celia is back online in Zoom. So if you have any questions for Celia that we couldn't.
