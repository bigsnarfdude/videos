On the subject in some of the following talks, it's essentially about Lipschitz estimates for solutions of non-uniformly elliptic problems. And everything I'm going to talk about is based on a joint paper with Rosario, which has appeared like last year. And I first want to give you some introduction to the general topic, so which I can do quite briefly here. Quite briefly here, and then address somehow Lipschitz regularity criteria, which are already known, and then how we address the problem. And so what is the problem about? It's we study minimization problems of variational integrals, where we have some integrand capital F, which depends on the gradient of a Soppolev function, and then there is some part which depends linear on. Which depends linear on the solution multiplied with this function f, which is given a priori. And so we are in the scalar n vectorial setting. So this capital N distinguishes if capital N is equal to 1, it's a scalar setting. If it's larger than 1, then it's the vectorial setting. And the general aim is to somehow specify what are sharp conditions on this function. conditions on this function small f that guarantees that our minimizer is always Lipschitz continuous under some assumptions on the capital F which is on convexity basically and growth assumptions and which all fall into the regime of non-uniformly elliptic problems so what does this non-uniformly problem mean or non-uniform ellipticity Ellipticity. So if we look at the second derivative of this capital F and we look at the largest and the smallest eigenvalue or on the ratio of the two, then this one becomes unbounded when this modulus of Z goes to infinity. So this is this non-uniform electricity. And why are we interested in local Lipschitz continue or in Lipschitz continuity of minimizers? This is essentially because once our solution Because once our solution is Lipschitz continue, then the growth at infinity doesn't matter anymore. And so we are the standard theory applies from the uniformly elliptic setting. And so something special about the vectorial case. So when capital N is strictly greater than one, then there are counterexamples where you cannot expect regularity of the minimizer. And so we need some. And so we need some additional assumption, like Verena was already talking about. So we need this Uhlenbeck structure that the integrand capital F actually depends only on the modulus of the gradient and not on the various components of the gradient of W. So, what are examples that we had in mind? So, one class of examples is polynomial, polynomial, but Polynomial but unbalanced growth conditions. So, where we have one example of such a capital F, which depends on the different directions of the gradient or on the directional derivatives in such a way that it has different powers for the different directions. And so, this is used, for example, for electroeological fluids. And another example is when. And another example is when, like Iwanka was already telling, so if we have something like P growth, which is slightly perturbed, and all this falls into the situation of functionals with PQ growth, which means that our functional is bounded from below by some modules of Z to the power P and from above by modules of Z to the power Q. And then if Power q. And then, if we look at the second derivative, then actually, so these bounds just repeat in the sense that we have to consider as a lower bound the modulus of z to the power p minus 2 and from above modulus of z to the power q minus 2. And in this situation, if we look at the ratio of the smallest and largest eigenvalue, then this is just something like modulus of z to the power q minus p and this q. Z to the power q minus p, and this q minus p is somehow the gap in the growth conditions. So, this is the first class of examples, and the second one is very fast growth conditions, which, for example, happens for exponential growth, meaning that we look at the capital F given by the exponential of some power of the modulus of Z. So, this can also be iterated that it grows even faster. Even faster. And for a general formulation, you can think about this as the second derivative of this capital F bounded from below by some function G1 and from above by some function G2. And then in the end, I will give some conditions, some general conditions on G1 and G2, which will also yield the Lipschitz continuity of the minimum. Continuity of the minimizer. So, in that setting, we have the ellipticity ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalue of the second derivatives of F just given us the ratio between the two functions g2 and g1. So these are the examples that we had in mind when we were starting this project. And now I want to briefly address some. Yeah, briefly address some Lipschitz regularity criteria, which have been known for quite a long time. And I will discuss this in the first place for the Poisson equation. So when you just have the minus Laplacian of U is equal to F. And so what is the optimal condition on F to have local Lipschitz regularity for the solution U. So in this case of this equation, Case of this equation, you would actually look at the minimization of this variational integral where you have the Dirichlet energy minus this source term F times W. And so one thing which was known for quite a long time is Schauder theory, where you basically know that if you are L infinity or if your F is L infinity, then you are a C1 and even better. So in particular, of course, you're a Lipschitz concept. Of course, your Lipschitz continues. And if you are of class C0Î±, so in some Holder space, then your solution is a classical solution. So in the space C2 alpha. So this is the first criterion, which is a little bit. So the F is very, very regular, and we have actually too much information on the solution U. Then there is something. Then there is something like LP theory, where you transfer integrability of your right-hand side to the solution or to the gradient of the solution. And in this particular case, you can show that if f belongs to Lp, then your solution belongs to W2P. And so in particular, of course, if you have P larger than L. Have p larger than n, then you have embeddings, and you have c1 regularity, and so which is again a little bit more than Lipschitz regularity. So, this would be sufficient. And then there is something like Riesz potential theory. So, and this I notation here, I will use it always for the Riesz potential. And also, in this case, you basically bound the derivative. The derivative by some Ries potential. And so, if the Ries potential of this F is bounded, is in L infinity, then you know that your gradient of the solution is in L infinity. And so, in particular, of course, in C1. And some very nice estimates say that you have a local point. You have a local pointwise estimate, so the gradient of your solution is bounded by something like the L1 average of the gradient. So this is always bounded. And then here is the Rees potential. And this estimate will appear later on as well. Now, what is the optimal condition? This is actually that F is in the Lorentz space Ln1, and this gives you C1 regularity, and this is really the sharp result. So, on the one hand, you have the regularity. So, on the one hand, you have the regularity result, and if it's not satisfied, if you're in a little bit less regular space, then you cannot expect any more DC1 regularity. Now, what is this Logan space? So only briefly. So, this LP spaces, they get somehow a second exponent, which is here called this gamma. And with this gamma, we have a refinement of that. And with this gamma, we have a refinement of the Lebesgue spaces. So if the gamma is equal to p, then we are back to the standard Lebesgue spaces. But changing the second exponent, you can basically you have inclusions, but the inclusions are always of the type that no matter what the second exponent is, only the first one exponent decides on embeddings in LP spaces. In LP spaces. And so in the previous slide, we had this Lorentz space LN1. And so this is the one that we are considering. And it's included. So this Ln1 is included in Ln, but it's still bigger than Ln plus epsilon, where we had already this Lipschitz criteria. And so it's always connected also to the risk potential. Also, to the Reef potential, and we will actually use that if our function f belongs to this low-end space ln1, then we have a pointwise estimate for the rest potential of the function f or of the truncated release potential here, where we have this r as well. And so there are also some simple examples where you have that you are in the Lorentz space ln1, but not in the space ln plus epsilon. Plus epsilon. Okay, now this is the space that we are going to work with. So this ln1. And now I first want to stay with this classical results and leave the linear setting and go to general peak growth problems. And so in that case, you could, for example, minimize the energy where you take as a capital F the modulus of Z to the power P. Modulus of z to the power p. And then you have very, very similar estimates, as was shown by Tuomo and Dosario in 2013. So you can still bound the point-wise, the gradient of your solution, by something, okay, here's the mean value of du again to the correct power, which appears on the left-hand side. And here is again the same least potential. So nothing changes for the release potential. And it's still the same condition like. Same condition like if this one, the Reath potential here is bounded, then you have this Lipschitz estimate. So this was the first remark. So if you drop the F at all, then you have this, you consider P harmonic functions, and then you have this L infinity L P estimate. You can get all types of integral estimates by just integrating this version here. Integrating this version here, and it also holds in the vectorial case. Now, what is the heuristic why such an estimate might be true? In some sense, we look at the problem in divergence form. So, divergence of some function v is equal to this f. And now this v is of the specific form that you have the modulus of du to the power p minus 2 times du. So, this is just the v constant. U. So, this is just the v you're considering, and so from what I told you before, uh, you might expect that if the Reese potential or the truncated Ries potential is an L infinity, then your function V is an L infinity function with some pointwise estimate, which is just the estimate that I was giving you for the linear setting. So, but we just sort of we neglect that now V is not the gradient of some function as it was before, and now if we go back. And now, if we go back that our function v is actually something like the or the modulus of v is the modulus of u to the power p minus one. If we plug that one in, then we are we obtain the estimate proved by Trumo in Drosario. Okay, so this is basically the thing for the The standard growth, and then there are also some works extending it to more general growth conditions. For example, Paolo considered functions which have a more general growth, so which are given in terms of such a function g, and you have conditions on that function g, and then you obtain similar estimates where you basically find yourself with this Riesz potential and some term which actually Term which actually has a very natural growth condition. So you basically find g of this modulus of du bounded by g of the mean value. So which is somehow the natural extension of the previous results here. Now let's come to our proof and I will explain everything for the PQ growth problem case, which is basically a different word. A different version of proof. So, first we consider variational integrals without this small f. So, this is just equal to zero, and we have the PQ growth conditions. And so, first of all, we have existence of minimizers by the direct method. So, this is quite simple. And then we have the existence of irregular minimizers once the Once the gap becomes too large. So basically, this Q over P needs to be close to one when n is going to infinity. And so this was, for example, proven by Marcellini and Jacquinte and Hong. They had counter examples where irregular minimizers occur when this growth condition is somehow violated. Violated. So, but we are more interested in regularity of minimizers. And so, such a condition on the gap or on the ratio Q over P that it's bounded by one plus some dimensional constant is sufficient to have Lipschitz regularity. And there are quite a lot of results, and basically, starting with the result of Marcellini, who showed that once you are in W1Q, which would be You want q, which would be the space such that the integral is definitely finite. You obtain an improvement or regularity improvement to w1 infinity as long as this condition on the ratio q over p is satisfied. And then by exposing Leonech and John, they close the gap that if you have U in W1P, which would be the more natural space. The more natural space, as this is the lower bound, then your solution is actually in W1Q, and then you can apply the Machilini result to come to W1 infinity. And they also have the L infinity estimate in that case. So where on the right-hand side, basically, your functional reappears. And this bound was improved by Pitabello. Proof by Peter Bella and Matthias Schefna. So this was like appeared two years ago. And so they changed the growth condition here from 2 over n to 2 over n minus 1 by some very nice trick. Okay, so now what is the method of proof? Now, when we include also this small f. So here I just collected a So, here I just collected above the verbs conditions, and the main ingredient is a Cachopouli inequality, which somehow works on levels of the gradient. And more precisely, because we are here in this PQ growth setting, on the modulus of du to the power p and then the truncate basically at levels k. And so, what is here the estimate? We consider minimizer, which isn't is now supposed to be. Isn't is now supposed to be in w1 infinity, so it's already Lipschitz continue, but this will be justified at the end of the proof. And then the statement of the Cachopouli inequality is looking at this function modulus of du to the power p minus k. So this is the and the positive part. So this is the function we look at, and we bound the gradient squared by this right-hand side here. Right-hand side here. So, what appears first on the right-hand side? So, one ingredient is the function small f, and the other ingredient here is the function itself, again squared, so the relevant function we look at. And here is the gap. So if q is equal to p, like in the standard growth case, then this would be just simply one. And otherwise, it just represents the gap. So, what why is So, why is this the natural condition here appearing? So, this is basically by testing. So, you go to the Euler-Lagrange equation and then you differentiate the Euler-Lagrange equation such that you have the second derivative of this capital F appearing with one second derivative of U. And now the only thing that you do is plug in a suitable test function phi. A suitable test function phi, which is now given as, okay, here we see the function we are interested in, which is, oops, which is this modulus of du to the power b p minus k plus. So this is the function we are interested in. And then you have the derivative of u appearing and some localization function eta. And now if you look at the right-hand side here, and if the derivative Right-hand side here, and if the derivative acts on the first on this du, then you will exactly get the left-hand side in this statement of the Kachopoul inequality, which comes exactly from the growth condition on the second derivative of f, which grows like d capital modulus of du to the power p. Modulus of du to the power p minus 2. So this is where the left-hand side comes from, and the right-hand side is then just collecting all the terms, applying Cauchy Schwarz inequality, and so on. So, but the emphasis is that the gap in the growth is appearing on the right-hand side of the Karchopoin inequality in terms of a weight in the integral. And what is the interesting And what is the interesting function you're looking at? It's actually this modulus of the u to the power p minus k and the positive part of that. Okay, now that's now what we have so far, that if our function is already Lipschitz, then we have such an estimate. And now we apply, or we just assume, well, we already have Lipschitz continuity. We don't continuity we don't like this weight function du to the power q minus p appearing in our integral and we don't like this part here so we just get it out of the integral by going to the passing to the supremum so to the l infinity norm and then we have very nice cachopoulon inequality which you would usually find when you look at standard growth problems but these constants now of course they depend depend And now, of course, they depend on the L-infinity number of the U. And now we apply the Georgi iteration in the sense that Gilpelein and Mali wrote down in 1994, as Ivanka already told before. And here we have, we are exactly in the situation that we have here with some constant, which I now call in the statement here, capital M1 and capital M2. M1 and capital M2. So there are some constants appearing in front of the integrals on the right-hand side. And in the iteration, these constants reappear to some different power, which is here the M1 squared becomes M1 to the power n half. So here is the squared because here I look at the quadratic quantity. Quantity. And now we apply exactly this iteration technique to our Kachopoul inequality with these constants depending on the L infinity norm of du. And what this gives is, okay, here is the square root becomes n half, and so this q minus p becomes q minus p half times n half. times n half and similar the second term which now has this constants m1 and m2 and if you okay add the exponents up this is exactly what uh what is the result so what don't i like uh about this inequality here is something like du to the power 2p so it is not a very natural quantity comparing with the functional so to the power p would be much better Be much better, and so I now correct this and say, Well, I can take the L infinity norm out of the integral as well, and so I obtain another p half in the exponent of the du. And now I consider this as my bound on my pointwise bound on the gradient of u. And so I know that the gradient of u to the power p, which would correspond with the function of v in the Kilpeline. V in the Kilpelin-Mali argument is bounded here by the right-hand side, where again, somehow the L-infinity norm of the U appears with that specific exponent. And once we know that this exponent and the second exponent is less than P, then we have an L-infinity estimate because then we can just, okay, by some iteration, we can absorb. We can absorb an infinity norm on the right-hand side in the left-hand side. And so, what is this condition? So, just that, okay, this pre-factor here, the exponent of this L infinity norm, needs to be less than p, that I'm able to absorb it. And this condition is nothing else than the condition that we found before, that the ratio of q and p is less, strictly less than one plus two, two half. Two half. And okay, the second exponent is even smaller, so that one is definitely also less than p. And in that sense, after this absorption argument, we would have that the L infinity norm of du is bounded by some mean value of the L P norms to some power, which comes now from this absorption argument, and here by the Lurgens norm of F in this Ln1 space. F in this ln1 space because this was giving an upper bound on the potential of f here. So in this sense, we now have an L infinity estimate under the assumption that our function small f belongs to this Lorentz space Ln1. Now, as the outcome, we have We have local Lipschitz regularity exactly under the bound that I was giving before, so q over p less than one plus two half. So the only thing I was assuming within the proof that was that I had this a priori Lipschitz regularity, so my solution should already be in W1 infinity. And so this is justified by taking approximations for the in the Scala case. In the Skyla case, this works, for example, under the bounded slope condition. But you can also prove it in the vectorial case. And so this is the let's say the result for the polynomial case. But I also want to tell you something about this exponential case, which was formulated with this growth conditions on the second derivative of f in terms of the function g1. In terms of the function g1 as a bound from below and g2 as a bound from above. And now there are these three a bit technical assumptions on the functions g1 and the ratio between g2 and g1, which basically allow you to repeat the proof and the idea of the proof and infer local Lipschitz regularity of minimizers. Here of minimizers. So maybe I only want to point out that the function small f is still in the Lorentz space ln1, so nothing changes here. And okay, then the statement in this general form would be very, very technical. So I only give you the result for exponential integrance. So when I consider this capital F given as the exponential of the modulus of Z to the power P for some P larger than one. Some p larger than one. And then we have such a nice estimate in this specific case that this f is equal to zero. So then the L infinity norm of the U to the power p is bounded by the logarithm of some integral of the exponential of the u of the p, which now has a very nice scaling. And so in the beginning, it seemed that exponential is not. It seemed that exponential is not something usually discussed, so maybe it's harder to prove. But on the other hand, so once your gradient of u becomes large, then it's very, very expensive in the functional. So it counts very much in the functional. So if you want to minimize, then this is something that you definitely want to avoid. So this a similar result was already known before. So in particular, that you have local Lipschitz continuity was known. Lipschitz continuity was known and proved by Marcellini in 1996 for the case that f is equal to zero, but the bound was not as good compared to this bound given here. Okay, so I think I'm now at the end of my 35 minutes, and so I thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Hiri. Thank you very much for your nice talk. Any questions or comments? Questions, comments, remarks? So you can ask some question also to Christiana, who's going to present something similar, including now also an X dependence. May I ask a question? May I ask a question in this QP problem? Is there any progress for P lesson two? So this includes everything. But yes, here there are restrictions, right? Yes, wait. So, yeah, I think on the next slide, yeah, here. Ah, yes. And the next slide, and so on. Yes. Is this essential? So let's say what we what we were thinking about is. We what we were thinking about is extending similar results to the linear growth case, so which would correspond to p is equal to one, but we didn't succeed with those because then you have bounds appearing which get problematic once the u is zero or infinity, depending what and so. I think we didn't think too much about this anymore. All right, perhaps it is more complicated. Any other questions, remarks? Maybe could I just add a remark? Just very nice talk, Lisa. So I just want to remark to this P less than two. Okay, so because there is. Okay, so because there is uh okay, so I guess the for the p q problem I guess the expected bound is uh n p o n minus two that's the max for q now if you take p less than two and you look in the first paper of martial i think it was the first one on this pq stuff he actually has an example showing that for p less than two the upper bound has to decrease so something is happening but uh So, what do you mean by the upper bound has to decrease? Yeah, so then you cannot prove the regularity results if Q is np over n minus 2. Ah, okay. So there is something happening when you let P go below 2. Just, I mean, I don't know whether that was what Igor meant, but so there is something happening. And really, it's not just technical, there's Really, it's not just technical, there's uh there's an issue there seems to be a quite big issue, so it yeah, you can't you can't move it out and so on because it has uh negative power and so on. Thank you. Can I add something? Can I add something? Okay, if you look at our paper, all the results that Lisa mentioned extend to the case B less than two. Case P less than two. There is a problem on the gap bound when P approaches to one, which is created by the right-hand side. So when P approaches to one, then the gap Q over P goes to one with the speed of P minus one. Ah, yes, this was P minus one. But this is only created by the right-hand side. This is only created by the right-hand side. Now, where the Where this could come from. When P goes to one, you approach problems like linear growth problems, minimal surfaces, and so forth. And now, if you look at the meaning of the right-hand side in these kinds of problems, there's a geometric meaning like mean curvature and so forth. And then there are, I mean, results on minimal surfaces equations that tell about the solvability. That tells about the solvability according to the size of the right-hand side, to the size of the curvature, and so forth. And they have a geometric meaning. Probably the fact that Q over P is approaching to 1 is related to the fact that when you go to the linear case, then something more sensitive is happening as long as the right-hand side is concerned, because you're approaching to a regime where not, I mean, I mean, where not i mean well i mean different kind of information start uh start coming into the play and this kind of non-uniform ellipticity reads these kinds of things and it's probably linked to that so these kinds of results for p larger than one are still okay but the bound progressively degenerates when p approaches to one so in the sense that when when you take q equal to p then it is always okay but when um then But when then the distance between Q and P is approaching zero, or the ratio Q over P is approaching one with the speed of P minus one, and these, I mean, it could be, it's like a technical fact, but also the technicalities involved there could be, I mean, could be an echo of the fact that when you're approaching linear growth problems, then the right-hand side has geometric meaning that has to be treated in a That has to be treated by different manners. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any other comments, questions? Just a comment about the linear growth. In the linear growth case, you cannot have uniform ellipticity. Just a little bit of a pair of children, sure. Yeah. Okay, so all such problems are expected, I guess. So thank you very much again. Thank you very much again. And we are going to meet in about 35 minutes. So let us have a break. Thank you all.
