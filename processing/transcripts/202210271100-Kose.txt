Again, I'm Geran and I'm going to talk about the class of knots called symmetric unions and how they appear in the question regarding in the context of questions regarding not invariance. And then like we know that the fundamental questions about like the nut invariance is that whether they distinguish distinct nuts, right? Or like how good are how good they are at distinguish distinct nuts? Distinguish these thing not. Or suppose we don't achieve that, you can also like relax the condition and ask if that invariant detects the unnod or not. And then here's some like examples from the literature that I want to just like tell you about briefly. Like if you consider the if you consider these nuts, let's denote them by k sub n, which are the press and nuts 3, 2n, negative 3. We know that. Negative 3, we know that the Alexander polynomial of Kn equals to Alexander polynomial of Kn prime for every n prime, for every integer. So for Alexander polynomial, we can find like infinitely many knots that share the same Alexander polynomial, but they're distinct. And if you ask the same question, if you ask the question of unnaut detection, we have this nut family called Kinosha terraceca nuts. And then let's deny. Not and then let's uh denote these nuts by KTN. And Kinoshita and Teraseka show that KTN is one for every integer, while none of these notes are trivial. Okay, then we have the categorifications and you want to at least maybe hope to gain some improvement, right? But here it is the same. This is due to Watson and. Is due to Watson and Hedden and Watson. And you can basically use the same knots, same infinite family to show that they have isomorphic knot floor homology. But again, like, I mean, again, as I told you in categorification, we actually gain something that the nut floor homology detects the unnot. Takes the online scale. And how about the quantum invariance? Like for the Jones polynomial, I'll talk about this later, but we still don't know the answer whether the Jones polynomial detects the or not or not. But only after it's like only after two years, Jones polynomial was defined, Canonable came up. Find Canonabu came up with these examples such that let's call this knots K P Q, which depend on two integer parameters where the K P Q, the Jones polynomial of PQ equals the Jones polynomial of P plus Q zero. And how about the categorification? Yes, we still have an improvement that the common homology. Conohomology detects the unnot, which is a result of Kron-Heyermann Moroccan. But similarly, Liam also showed that the nut flowers of these subfamilies of canonobunas also have isomorphic homologies. So, we've been talking about nuts and then I'm sort of like giving these three families of nuts as a sort of test case because they actually belong to a sort of like a general class of nuts called A general class of mass called asymmetric unions, which are which is due to inoishthan. It is a diagram. Sorry, we call it not a symmetric union. Let's say That's metric meaning of, let's say, some other not J if K admits the following kind of diagram, which I will describe now. So we basically build this dot cave. So we basically build this nut K out of J. And then, I mean, the idea is that, like, like at least here, that I mean, build something from a smaller nut so that it's its new, like its invariance can be obtained by the invariance of the smaller one. So, what is that? So, I basically, this is my smaller nuts. Basically, this is my smaller nuts. So we basically take any like random diagram of J and then choose some sphere that is disjoint from the diagram and reflect this diagram across this sphere. And then we take the connected sum of these two diagrams like in a way that the resulting diagram is still preserved. Resulting diagram is still preserved, like leaves invariant on the reflecting across this S3. And now we also have some flexibility that you can actually isotope the diagrams in a way that it still lives invariant, but we can have twists along the axis. And then we can do this as many times as we want, as long as the twists are along the axis and then the remaining. The remaining like away from the axis, if that the diagram is sort of mere symmetric. Okay. And usually the notation goes like K is D sub J union mirror of D sub J, and then you start by putting the number of optimists. But I think it's kind of lengthy, so I will abuse. It's kind of lengthy, so I will abuse the notation, and then for this talk, I will just like to note them as okay. And maybe a little remark. You can also regard this construction as sort of like the generalization of K connected some mirror K. And similarly, any knot that you can obtain in such a way are going to be ripped. The sites, do they matter? The sites do they matter, like where you put, you get this list N1 for NK, right? But where you decide to pull the knot and put the list can change what happens, right? What do you mean, like in the concordance class? No, it's just for what is the knot you get out of the construction. What the extra value. Yeah, what extra value you get? Oh, of course, that's why. Like here, I'm abusing the notation. Like, this is very important. Like, you can definitely have, I mean, I can just choose like. I mean, I can just choose like the very simple diagram of the trefoil and get pressed nuts. But if you actually prefer to do the twisting along here instead of in the obvious way, you can get a more like complicated nuts. Of course, like here, I'm definitely using abusing notation. It's just for the blackboard writing. But this is actually important, but that's why in papers, we usually prefer to denote it that way. Okay. And you can also see. And you can also see the ribbon disc here by just like again, sort of flipping one half of the diagram onto the other, which is just going to, you have your like regular ribbon disc out of the J connect to some mirror J, but like there are some like strips along the ribbon where you just like change those twist with it strips with the twisted twist. So symmetric inzar ribbon. I mean Ruben. I mean, I'm not going to focus on this side of the question, but there's also another interesting question that is in the like in the study of symmetric union, which asks the converse, like we still don't have any example of ribbon that cannot be presented this way. It's still open. Okay. But going back to my chart here, so why did I talk about this construction? Because all the Construction because all the examples that I came here actually belong to this construction, and you can see that, like, here is my sphere, mirror sphere, and then this is the where we like like inserted the twist. And if you like, just like cancel this, you can see that the remainder of the diagram is like mere symmetric. And then you can also work it out to see that if you close this the tangle, you get the unnaut, for instance. So, this is Kino-Shater-seconds, are maybe I can say that. Maybe I can say that KTN actually you to n because here n is so one is and then two is so it's like the half optimistic and then infinity then zero is just you go back to the Is just you go back to the connected sum, or as if nothing happens. Okay, so Kinesha-Terseka knots are symmetric unions of the anodes, and the pretzel knots here, it's the, we can also see it as the symmetric union of the trefoil to and again. And here, Kananobo also used this construction to build his knots, and here you can work it out the details. And working out the details to see that it is actually the partial nut or the nut I started with is the tresoil nut. And now we have two twist regions to insert. Okay. So why is this construction is useful to study nut invariance? Let's talk about maybe the proof ideas in these results. So seven and then lamb later show that the Alexander polynomial of a symmetric union actually only depends on the parity of the inserted crossings. So, you build this construction, and then with an additional condition, you can obtain what you want. And this is basically the main term that the commission. That the Kinushi Teri Saka appealed to to construct non-trivial nuts with trivial Jones polynomials because what, like, I mean, all you have to do is just now choose some like, I mean, complicated diagram of the unknot and like just insert even number of trists. Okay. And then the, I mean, there are, of course, other constructions of non-trivial nuts with the trivial Jones polynomial, like by using certain satellite conjectures, but now I think. Conjectures, but now I think I don't know if the following arguments that I'm talking about can be applied to this case. So for the other, for these, or for the remaining, it's just the symmetry allows you to use the scan relations in a very efficient way. Yes, Venisa? So ribbon here we found a ribbon ribbon. Ribbon disk. It is a ribbon disk. Yes. I'm having trouble with the Euler factory. Trouble with the Euler factor in the calculation. Is it uh what do you mean by the Euler characteristic? I just can't show that it's a disk right now in my head. Um, if it'll take a while, I can ask to make it like this is going to be, if you just like flip this, this is going to be this famous picture. Um Okay, I'm not sure if okay, okay, yes. Like you see, no, this is the unnod. Okay, well, I can't draw it right now, but this is the like the one that you always see. I think like even Adam's talk, there was this like ribbon desk. Just like riven disk. Yeah, I'm not seeing. After you do the connect bomb, like I see the rigid disk, but then when you add in the full print or just clasp even. Well, okay, so forget that you didn't have any twist here. And then when you do the when you just like flip the K connect some Eric, then these two strands are going to build. Two strands are going to build something like that in the ribbon disk, right? Because you're just like rotating, like this point is identified to this point. Is that the color? Okay. So, what is nice about this distraction is just it just gives you, I mean, this like this metric feature and And like adding to this, will give you an efficient way to use the skin relations. Like remember from the Jones polynomial that if I have a nut, let me just like denote it like that. We have this, I might be wrong. I might be wrong in signs, but the oriented resolution. And similarly, for the mouth floor, we have skein exact triangles. Right, with some like migrating shifts that I don't care right now. And similarly for Kavanaugh homology, we have the resolutions. So if we have one So, if we apply these like scale relationships to this construction, you see that this, like, I mean, the nut, you choose a distinctive positive crossings, and then you can choose that crossing along an axis. Then you can maybe say that if this was like kn, and then this will appear to be kn minus two. And this is just going to be some like infichiral link, uh, infichiral. MP chiral and a ribbon link. But in particular, in these two examples, you can see that that link is just going to be turned out to be the two component on link. Then in your exact sequence, these actually, wait, which one is going to be that one? Okay, this one is just going to be very simple. Very simple, so that you can actually obtain the isomorphisms like you want to achieve in an inductive way. So then one way, okay, I sort of forgot to tell you that I will also talk about like two ways to construct nuts with trivial Jones polynomial. With trivial Jones polynomial. So here, I mean, Kanana, we did it with 4-1 trephorl nut, but like what is special about trephorral nut here, right? If you actually just take to be, so take K to be the unknot, let's k to be a spectrokinofian unnot with one twist region, such that when you actually do this resolution, which is sort of This resolution, which is sort of like that move here, right? You get the two components only. Then you can see that the Jones polynomial of k is going to be one. So, in like in any, I mean, if you get actually, so if you get two components only from canonical nuts. From canonical nuts, then you would achieve to have to find the non-trivial nuts with trivial John's polynomials. But you can see from here that this is not the case, where it was the case here implicated the solution. So, I mean, by using similar techniques, more showed that actually, because More sort of generalize this result of Bosson and Hedden for any symmetric union of the symmetric union, not like specifically to the trefoil, that let K to be a symmetric union of J such that this resolution will give you two components only, then we actually get a similar sort of Kino-Steterisaka. kind of characterization for the not for homology and so by using a moisturum with the fact that the majority of the max More stern with the fact that the nut floor homology detects the ion, we can actually rule out this case for an event. But the odd case still remains open. So if k is u to the n such that u infinity is two components only, then k is the unknown. So you can get a So you can get a non-trivial nut by using this construction, which worked for the constructing nuts with this same in vain. So how about in the odd case, this is then I show that actually if you approach this from like a topological point, I mean, whether the twist is odd or even doesn't matter. It's basically. So basically, um K is you and thank you, Steanox. In fact, if you like care about this question that I was like talking about here or in general, like if you care about to understand symmetric unions, that this is this actually fits to a general formula that if you take any symmetric union that satisfies this. Union that satisfies this condition, then it is a very special Montesinov node, which has only three singular fibers. And you can also see that these, like these three examples here, they actually appear as the first three basic simples cases of this, where here these prestal nuts are the canonical nuts. Sorry. Of the nuts, sorry, these pistol knots are the um these um montecinos nuts. And then if you actually just like assume Q is one, you get like two over five, one over P, and then negative two over five. And then we know that the four, one is like in Ficiral, you can do you can choose to express four one as. Can choose to express 4,1 as like 3.5, and then you get the zero Q version. So basically, this basically, like those examples are basically like the first three simplest cases of dogs. So maybe let me talk about the proof of this before we forget. So, I guess also one thing that I want to point out here is that with this construction, you also get nuts. Like if you have this kind of construction, the John Decovanov homology also would be isomorphic to the Covanov homology of the RNAT. And if you And if you like look at the date, it took us a while to get this result. So in that like 10 years, if you actually suspect that maybe the common homology didn't detect the or not, like this just gives you a good way to test your theory. And then I'm now going to show that I can actually prove this theorem by using results. This theorem by using results just dates back to 80s. So, even at the like, I mean, on the node, like as soon as you define not covenant homology, you, I mean, by using this construction, you find that you can construct, as Liam did, you can construct distinct nuts with the same common homology, but not like your construction does not work to construct non-trivial knots with trivial Jones polynomial. With trivial Jones polynomial. So, what I'm going to do, I say that we're talking about the detections, and of course, these polynomials or these algebraic varieties are not the only invariants of a not that detects the on-not. Let me remind you two. So, one of my favorite is a result of Walthausen from 69. If you actually look Actually, look at the homeomorphism type of your nuts double branch cover. And if it is S3, then K is the LNUT. Or in other words, the homeomorphism type of the double branch cover of a NOT detects the LNOT. And then the other one is sort of like the zero surgery characterization, which is the result of Gabai. If we do zero surgery on a nuts, and you can. Not and if we get S1 cross S2, then K is also the or not. So what I'm going to do here that remember the construction of K as Jn. So I basically, we basically have this like vertical tangle replacements to obtain K from J connected some mirror J. Right? Right, so I have J connected some mirror J, and then I get K. Some like antimistier. And if you look at the double branch cover, we can see that this tangle replacement actually corresponds to the one over and surgery. Along the lift of this arc here. Then the double branch cover of K can actually be written as some surgery on the double branch cover of J connect some here, J and And one over n. And here you can also just look at the double branch cover of connect the sun. And this sphere here actually leads to a separating sphere to the component of sigma j and sigma mirror j. And the arc of this, sorry, and the and the lift of this arc is actually going to be also sort of like. Is actually going to be also sort of like a mirror ribbon mat. Because the arc leaves like invariant under the reflection across the sphere. So this reflection have a lift in the double branch cover that actually leaves the lift of alpha invariant. So this is actually a very special kind of knot. So, kind of not. But to prove the first theorem, I mean, I know that I'm only thinking about the NUTS that are the symmetric union of symmetric union of the unnut. So, this is slightly easier because now in this case, I know that this guy is just a street. Sky is this tree. So if you look at my condition here, if K is a symmetric union of the unknown, then the double branch cover of K can actually be obtained as a one over n surgery on some ribbon knot. even not form of a very special form here i think like i should change the orders and now like we know that when we do the infinity um resolution we get the two components only that means that the u infinity which we know that it is now will be zero surgery on this not will be But we know that the double branch cover of two component unlink is S1 process2. Then, by Gabe's result, this knot that we are doing a surgery on is actually just has to be the unnuts. And then the result is like now clear because any one over n surgery of the unnut is S true. And then by Walthausen. And then by Waldhausen because they are not. So again, like these results are from 70, almost 70 and 80s, but you don't need to use any, you don't need to use any actually. I mean, you can know that right on the nodes that you cannot construct non-trivial nodes with trivial. Non-trivial notes with trivial not for homology or common homology by using the construction that work for other cases. Any questions so far? Okay, great. So I can now talk about another way to construct knots with trivial Jones polynomial. So like similar to, I mean, we had this theorem of Amiknesha Teraseka, which tells us about the Alexander polynomial of symmetric unions, right? So you wonder whether there is a formula. Wonder whether there is a formula for the Jones polynomial, and Tanaka derives that. Let k be j n, then the Jones polynomial of k satisfy this formed one. Which you can see the number of inserted twists and then the Johns Poignomial of the nut we started with. Then, I mean, one thing here that you can observe is k is NPC Iro, right, then this formula just tells us that the nuts, the Jones polynomial of the nut is just the multiplication of J and mirror of J. So, I mean, the correlation. So, I mean, the corollary is that then again, I build the smetric union of the unnod, and if it is empty chiral, then it's John's polynomial has to be one. P is the unnot and k is the empty rock. But sadly, this is also not the case. I again show that if you have these conditions, like you just cannot build a non-trivial node. In fact, again, if you want to know, see a general picture. If for any symmetric union of K, with of course, with one this region, if it is antichiral, like it's just actually it never happens in a non-trivial way. I mean, what do I mean by that? That means that you basically inserted your twists either as like a stupid R1 here, or it was already a connected sum, and then you have. it was already a connected sum and then you have this like negatory uh crossings between the sum ads between the symmetric sum and so it's sort of i think it's kind of intuitive because you start with something mirror symmetric and then you add one twist and then of maybe of course you are not going to get something amphichiral again okay i'll talk about the proof of the first one and then if the time remains i can uh talk more about the um More about the proof to the general case. Okay, so there is actually two ways to obtain that result. One of them is again relies on the surgery picture. And then the other one, you can basically just play with the colonal homology of these knots. And then use the fact that colonal homology detects the unknown. And then if you want to construct knots in that way, they cannot be non-trivial and infinite. They cannot be non-trivial and amphichiral at the same time by basically like just playing with the big gradings of the commonal homology. Okay, let's maybe let's first do that. So again, I mean, I'll do very similar things, right? So suppose we have a knot like that, but it is not non-trivial. So suppose K is not. K is not the unknown, then we know that the rank of its common homology. I'm thinking about the common homology over rationals, then it is absolutely by, I mean, it is absolutely greater than two, right? By common number of because it detects the R nods. So we have like some, if you consider the non-lead generators of the common homology of k, it's going to be a non-empty set. So let's say AB. So let's say AB. Yeah, let's say AB then is the sort of like the minimum by grading of non-lead generators of okay. Let's just do it for one and then the rest will follow this and. The rest will follow this, and then like in inductive hypothesis. What I mean by that is that if you have, I mean, so I'm sort of thinking about an order on the bigrade, it's sort of like a lexicographic order that if you have J that is less than b, it's just like the common homology at that by grading will be zero. Okay. Then I can never remember. I can never remember this, but now you can look at the long exact sequence. This link L.B. minus one. Okay, so we have this long exec sequence, right? And if you look at the, if I pick crossings on K1, like this is, if this is K1, If this is K1, this is going to be that link to component link, which is antichiral and ribbon, right? And this is going to be the unnuts because I just get the connected sum of the nut I started with itself. So, I mean, in the general case, like, I'm going to assume that they will die because the cover homology of nut is very simple. It's just two-dimensional. And these exact sequences, they sort of fix the quantum grading of each homology. Of each homology, so only one copy happen at each line, and then I can investigate those cases separately. So we have this isomorphism here, but again, this link, remember this link was infichiral because we just don't have any other crossings along the axis. So this will be isomorphic to maybe to p plus one. maybe p plus one because um we can we know that for for the mp chiral links uh kab or let's say i j k prime is the same as k p prime okay and now the by grading here will be negative p okay one K1, and I have zeros here again because this was just the LNAT, then we will have this isomorphism. But if K1 was apichiral, this will give me another isomorphism to the by grading AB plus, sorry, this is plus B minus Q zero, which will contradict to the minimality of the by grading. So, but the okay, I guess this is nice because this was one thing that here, the John's polynomial wasn't very useful to detect the trivialness of such a construction because, I mean, everything sort of disappeared. But here, at least, I mean, by using the gradings and the long execsing, because you can actually obtain that. You cannot have those two conditions on that construction. On that construction. But I wasn't okay in the remaining time. But if you think about the second, sort of, if you want to generalize this to other nuts, like I couldn't find a way to generalize this. It just requires some conditions on the maximum or minimal by gradings of the nut you started with. So let me give you the topological proof. So if K is antichiral, then its double branch covers well admits an orientation preserving, sorry, reversing homeomorphism, right? Them, right? And now I can actually use this to find two, sorry, like a pair of cosmetic surgeries on S3. Because remember, the double branch cover, if SK was UN, then its double branch cover is actually one over N surgery on some not soft form. So, uh, oh, maybe the okay, I didn't tell you about an important thing. So, this construction is also very nice because if you take the mirror of a nut, you only like switch the sign of the crossings along the axis, which is just you can see that from reflecting across the sphere, right? Or just do the regular mirror along the blackboard and then just like rotate the diagram. So we know that. So we know that if k is u n, the mirror of k is u negative n. Then this tells me this tells me okay now we know um then if k is amphichiral then we have this i mean homeomorphism between these two surgeries on Between these two surgeries on the same notes. And it's actually a conjecture of a Gordon called cosmetic surgery conjecture. If we have a non-trivial nut, and if there are let's k non-trivial, if we have two surgeries on k. Two surgeries on K with different slopes, or sorry, if we have two homeomorphic surgeries on K, then R has to be equal to K. So, I mean, the conjecture is that this never happens for non-trivial nuts. And there are like a bunch of results that proves the conjecture for certain families of nuts, or there are some conditions. Of nuts, or there are some conditions coming from nut floor homology by work of like Niemu or Hanselman. But the one I care is the connected sum, and that's a result of tau. Tau actually shows that, shows a conjecture for connected sums, sorry, composite knots. If K is composite. Thank you, satisfies. Then, here, as you can see, this can never happen for a, I mean, this can only happen if the lift of the arc, if we're actually doing a surgery on the or not. And we go back to the same picture again, right? Then by tau. Tau then our double bench cover is just now again one over end surgery on an L nut which is S3 then again by Walt Hausen I get that K is the so I mean the second construction is not that like it wasn't as trivial as to roll out as As to roll out as the first one, that sort of like still requires results that use like Hagar flow homology. It's coming kind of recent. I think this is from the 2019. Any question so far? Then I think I can end here. Oh, maybe, oh, maybe one little remark is that so far. remark is that uh so far about this this theorem here like so far most of so lam has this like data of symmetric unions of like many more than like like hundred uh ribbon knots and then this was like like i made that observation that is actually there is for none of the mp chiral nuts like you can actually uh have a picture like that just just one twist region and then most Just one twist region. And then, most, I mean, more than half of them are also either like strongly negative amphichiral or strongly positive amphichiral. And you might maybe, uh, you may see his preprint like a couple days ago on like strongly murtable nuts that he is now like trying to build more examples of amphichiral ribbon nuts that by using symmetric union construction because we sort of think that maybe uh there is maybe Maybe they're all like either strongly negative MP chiral or strongly positive MP chiral. And this is basically this theorem just like provides the resolution of the first case to that observation or like maybe conjecture. Great, any questions? So, I mean, I guess, yeah, just I guess, yeah, just like kind of looking at it. Uh, how uh so these techniques that you're using, you don't uh feel like I'm trying to think if there were only two twist regions, and so maybe you had like you had some interplay between two exact sequences, you could say something, or is that just uh uh I actually forgot to comment that like I mean, I mean, here you have to do this, right? Okay, yeah, and actually, yes, I should have said that, like, for the first turn, if you build. That like for the first turret, if you build a symmetric union of the unknown, where you can actually get as many as like the twist region as you want, like in here, as long as when you do the resolution, you get the two component unlinked, they're all going to be trivial, right? Because you can actually work out the proof I do in an inductive way. Because the first one you get S3, now when you do this, I mean twist, you also have a the double branch cover is again like a one over and Again, it's like a one-over-n surgery on the unnut again. Sorry, some nut again, but when you do the zero one, you get S1 cross S2, so you can just keep going down. Okay. So only for that, so only that term actually generalizes to many twist regions, but not the others. Because we also, I mean, we have it, you can easily construct like amphichiral symmetric unions with two twist region, right? Like, you know, having some like P here, negative P here. P here, negative P down there. But I mean, and you choose the part of the diagram in such a way that it is like symmetric. I see maybe a rotation in the middle. Okay. So maybe is then if there are oddly many twist regions, is there something that can well? I mean, you can have the, I mean, just one twist here in the middle, right? There is an example like that. There's like a five twist region and the one in the middle, like the Region and the one in the middle, like the third one, is sort of like that. It's the same, you get a strongly negative ampiciral, I think, because now the rotation axis is here. I see. Okay. Thanks. So I guess this is my main question, but just to check something. If instead of grabbing just two strands, you grabbed like a set of strands from each side, and so now you can start like crossing through. So now you can sort of like crossing between two strands, you have like a full twist between colour strands. That, so obviously it doesn't fit the definition of a symmetric union, but there's not some obvious thing that lets you isotope that into a symmetric union position, is there? Or do you know off the top of your head? I mean, it can be. You just need to use the skin relationship, I guess, more than like a few times. It's not as immediate as this. And then I'm not sure if they're going to be ribbon. Okay. Because this. Okay, because this right that angle replacement is just corresponds to taking like a like a strip of your ribbot band and then basically like changing it with something like that. So, I mean, you still have a ribbon disc. Was that your question? I think you answered the actual question, which is separate from whether or not it fit the exact definition of symmetric union after some messing around, whether the proof techniques, at least for the yeah, I think it's like, I mean, this is sort of easier. So, I mean, you should ask Lean why he chose to like. Why he chose to improve the results by using these examples? Just asking Grant just to try and catch up with what people are asking and what you're answering. The setting where you have everything sorted out is where these knots are, I think they're all sometimes called fusion number two. Yes. So what you're starting with, your ribbons are two discs and then they reach out and line. Disks and then they reach out and wind around each other and you put twists in the disks. But the do you have anything to say about when you start with higher fusion numbers? When you start with a higher number of discs, I mean, I don't have anything to say. I mean, but you're right, but it's sort of a stronger condition that we also sort of want the band to be in a symmetric condition here. Yes, I should have pointed out that. That's true. I mean, that's a good question. That's like, I should probably look. I should probably look for that, but I think there are some examples that when you put like as many resolutions here, you still don't get the on link. But you need that, you need that case. That's the base case, the fact that there is a resolution that gives you, you know, you have this S2 times S1 cover and you have this unmatched cover. And those are the, those are what's, I think that's what's driving, right? I think that's what you're adding, right? And so the question is: what happens when you have connect sums of S2 times S1s, I guess, for these more complicated unions of this? Yeah, I didn't look for them. That's the top. Anyone else here? But I see your point. I think maybe you can use that kind of number, like the fusion number, to get certain balance on the. Yeah, I think it can be this like explored. Any more questions? All right, listening, John again.
