We're going to talk today about interpolation for real linear curves. All right, so the basic question Is when can we pass a given type of curve through a given number of the curves? A given number of general points. So this is a very This is a very old question from a study dates to classical antiquity. So here are some results that were known to Euclid. So if I have two points In a plane, then I can pass a line to those two points. First functulate. If I have three points in the plane, then I can pass a circle through them. Can pass a circle through them. This is proposition five of book four of the elements. So perhaps the culmination of results in antiquity would be due to Pappus. Would be Deutopappus of Alexandria in 340 AD, who showed that a conic section in the plane can be found passing through any five points. So the first real breakthrough in this question occurred in the 18th century with the birth of algebraic geometry. And the realization is basically that a curve has an equation. And we can study the equation d equal to zero at the point, and that determines whether the curve can pass through those points. So Joe Fraser, 1750. So Kramer, 1750, this is the Kramer's rule in linear algebra, showed that a flame curve of degree n can pass through n times n plus 3 over two points and warring. In 1779, showed that the graph of a degree m polynomial, y equals f of x, can pass through n plus one point. And in his honor, this is known as Lagrange's interpolation formula. Known as Lagrange's interpolation formula. All right, so probably car or carve or something like that. Okay, don't worry about it. Sure. It's Kramer. Oh, all right. So the key input to the study of this question in the modern era is Brunether theory. And the reason this is important is it gives us a way of making type of curve precise. Our question was, when can we find a curve of a given type passing through a given collection of points? So what do we mean by of given type? So the basic theorem Is that so? This is a brief review from Isabel's talk yesterday. So, a basic theorem is that there exists Exists a component of, say, the space of stable maps from genus G curves of degree D to PR, or if you like, of the Hilbert scheme or whatever, however, you want to do that. You want to do that. It will all be equivalent. Parametrizing non-degenerate maps whose generic point corresponds to a non-degenerate map and dominating Mg if and only if this quantity rho of GR D G minus plus one times G minus D minus R plus one plus R. plus r sine is greater than or equal to zero and when this exists it is unique so there's a There's a single type of curve, if you will, that is natural to consider for degree D genus G curves in PR. And that type of curves exists exactly under this condition. The definition Call these curves Bro letter curves I'm going to abbreviate on the board as BN curves. Here is the main question Now restated in a precise form so let D G D G R N satisfy, I guess these should be non-negative integers, satisfy rho PRD greater than or equal to zero. Then when When can we pass a bromother curve of degree t and GST through N General points, which I'll call P1 through Pn in projector space PR. So, are there any questions on the what the main question is here? Are we characteristic zero or is it not matter? Are we characteristic zero or does it not matter? Um one can ask this question in any characteristic. The Bro-Leader theorem is known in characteristic P, as stated here. Okay. If not, then before I discuss results on this main question, I want to first First, discuss some applications of partial results on this question. So if you didn't start out by Start out by caring about this question. What are some other questions that you might be thinking about that might lead you to this question? Yes. Very silly question about your question. Yes. Can one fit this, like the conic section statement into these? Yes. Well, a conic section is a Broliner curve of degree 2 and genus 0 in And genus zero in P2. Okay, okay, sorry. The MG was bothering me, but okay, yeah. We just say every genus zero curve is zero Yes. More precisely, do you want a numerical condition on n versus? Exactly. I want a numerical condition that gives me an if and only if answer. That would be my goal. Okay, so here are some applications that I want to briefly highlight. So one is maximal rank theorem. So this is how I This is how I initially got into this question. The statement is let C U P R be a general Roman curve of degree D and G S G. Then the Hilbert function of C is the smallest possible And the idea of how this is connected to the interpolation problem is to use interpolation. To build generations. So, how do I do that? Well, I take some collection of points and I, using a result on interpolation, I find some curve of some degree of genus. Find some curve of some degree in genus that goes to those points, then I find some other curve of some other degree and some other genus that goes to those points, and I consider this the union of these two curves. So this gives me a general machine for constructing degenerations of curves in projective space. Another Application: I want to highlight here is smoothing curve singularities. So the idea is: well, suppose that we had a version A version of this interpolation statement that worked when the points, M general points, were constrained to lie on a hyperplane. Then I could take my curve, and I could pick a point off the hyperplane. Off the hyperplane, and I could do an attractor-repeller action towards this point. And this would specialize to union of lines like this. And so I can study the problem, like if I have a problem. The problem, like if I have a curve singularity with branches, you know, distinct branches in general directions, then is that curve singularity smoothable, embedded in my projective space? So this idea, well, Well, you know, the thing that we attribute this to Stevens because he did a bunch of work on using results on the interpolation problem to deduce results on smoothing curved singularities. I believe the idea of approaching the problem this way creates it. But yes. Yes. The thing that the name is really cool. And the second one, it seems like, so you you can talk about smoothing singularities, but you went the other way, right? Right, so I want to say, given this singularity, can I construct a family of curves that acquires this singularity, smooth curves that acquires the singularity? And the recipe is: well, you take the points here and you construct. Here, and you construct some curve which should be a Br√∏beller curve where the degree is equal to g plus L in this picture. And then you do this subtract your repeller action, which I'll explain in a minute, which converts this picture into this picture. So that will guarantee that the singularity that forms is exactly the one that you want. Exactly. Now, what is an attractor-repeller action? So projective space. So projective space, so let's say I take a, I have a vector space D, and let's say that V is isomorphic to H plus L. So this is a, here's my pH, and this point is my P L. This is sitting inside of Is sitting inside of some PV. Okay, now I have an action of GM here. So lambda times H L is H lambda L. And now I want to take this family of curves that I get by applying this action. And I want to take lambda to 0 or infinity. And depending upon whether you choose 0 or infinity, you can think about that geometrically as things are getting attracted into this point and repelled from this plane, or vice versa. Okay. Are there other questions? Could you say again how the first application goes? The idea? The basic idea of this first application is that this condition on Hilbert functions is open. And so you want to study it via degeneration. You want to produce a special. You want to produce a specific curve, reducible curve, in projective space, which has the expected Hilbert function. And so, what interpolation is doing is it's giving us a tool to construct the generations of curves. So, another Another application here that I could highlight is to the construction of moving curves in the moduli space, but I'm going to, in the interest of time, table that discussion and move on to how we answer this main question. So I want to start by just giving an equivalent An equivalent formulation. This is, there's really no content. I'm just rewriting the main question in a convenient form. So I'm going to take this space of stable maps. I'm going to take the component whose existence is guaranteed by the Bralan theorem. And I'm going to look at this map where I forget the curve, but I remember only where the points go. This goes to PR to the L. And what this main question is asking is, when is this map pi dominant? So, here's the necessary condition for the map pie. Condition for the map pi to be dominant. And that is that r times n, which is the dimension of p r to the n, must be at most, as you mentioned. Of that source. And only have a dominant map when the dimension of the source exceeds the dimension of the target. And this, well, if you use the Renault theorem here, you will get to this dimension. Is this? So, this is some explicit numerical condition in terms of dg, R, and N. And what this is saying, if I rearrange it, is saying that r minus 1n is less than or equal to r plus 1d minus r minus 3t minus 1. So the natural conjecture would be this is also sufficient. And one could make a stronger conjecture, which I'm going to call conjecture 1 plus epsilon, which is that you can meet linear spaces. A collection of the space is the same. A collection of general linear spaces of any dimension. If and only if the sum of r minus 1 minus dimension of lambda y is less than or equal to r plus 1d minus r minus 3d minus 1d. This comes out of a similar dimension count. Similar dimension count as above. And if I set the lambda i's to points, then of course I recover this one. Okay, so we have a beautiful conjecture here and what generally happens after you make a beautiful conjecture is that you find out it's false. A beautiful conjecture is that you find out that it's false. So let's take a look at some counterexamples to this conjecture. So Perhaps the first you would find is EGR is 643. So does anyone recognize this curve? What is this curve? Hmm? Canonical curve. Canonical curve? Do you know explicitly how to describe it? How to describe it through some equations. We're all watching. What? Degree two and three. Degree two and three. Right? It's a complete intersection. Roderick! What? That'll teach you. Okay. This is in P3 in our generation. Sorry. I can write this here if you want. This is going to make you happier. GRD is 436. How's that? Does that make you happier? Make you happier? Cubic is fine. What? Okay. So, quadric intersects cubic, and this conjecture says, if you plug this numerics in here, this conjecture says that n should go up to twelve. But you see, But you see that there is a P9 of quadric surfaces in P3. And so a quadric can only pass through nine general points. And 9 is less than 12. And so, if you can only pass the quadratic surface through 9 general points, you have no hope of passing the curve through 12. Alright, so now question? The chair spoke. The chair spoke. Okay. The chair has a question. All right. Um the RD 6510 This is also a canonical curve and this is a quadric Liber surface Flamer surface intersect a quintic del Pezzo surface. And again, this quintic del Pezzo surface, again, the conjecture says n up to 12, but this quictic del penzo surface can only Can only pass through 11 general points. Again, 11 is less than 12. So by the same logic, the conjecture also fails in this case. Any questions before I erase this point that I just wrote up? Because I want to keep that up. We've made it some minute control. 11, you can do a dimension count on the space of quintic del petzo surfaces. So I blow the plane at four points. Well playing at four points I knew some uh you know automorphism up to automorphisms of P2, there's no real choice in how I blow the plane up, right? Four points. So it's like the difference of the automorphism group of but there but but the but the four points also rigidify the automorphisms of P2, right? So basically So it's basically the dimension of the automorphism group of P5, sorry, of P4, sorry, which is dimension of the automorphism group of P5, which is PGL6. So that's 35 dimensions. And now you're in P5, and so you have a surface, so it's three conditions to pass through a point. And 35 divided by 3 is 11 point something. And so that tells you that this pointed Galpenzo can only pass through 11 points. Does that answer your question? A weird question. Yes. So if you kind of looks like. So if you kind of looks like in this case, like went up in dimension of keeping twelve fixed and things got a little bit better. And the formula for n is sort of homogeneous degree zero for r. So is there any sense in which like if you keep the n fixed and grow the r, get better? Or eventually the value will be achieved? Well, this is always at least r plus three. This is always at least r plus 3. And it's quite easy to see that you can pass a curve, a bro letter curve, always through r plus 3 points. And so as I increase as I somehow fix n and increase r, there's no Increase R. There's no. Do you have any counterexamples to concepts? One plus epsilon that are not? Yes, in fact, this is what I'm about to say next. All right, any other questions? Okay, this is gonna go. Sorry. This is gonna go. Sorry. I only have two words. What? So now we can prove the conjecture again because other examples are gone. That's right. No more counter examples. All right. But I'm gonna. So here's a family I want to consider. So occurs of genus 2 in PR of degree r plus 2. And here's my curve C. My curve is of genus 2. My curve is of genus 2, therefore it's hyperliptic. So there is some hyperliptic involution that exchanges pairs of points. And I'm going to take each pair of points that's exchanged under the hyperelliptic evolution and join it with a line. And these lines sweep out some surface, S. S is a scroll. S is a screw. So the dimension of the space of such scrolls is r squared plus 2r minus 6. So we can draw this little chart. So here is R is three and what does our conjecture Predict, and then what is the maximum that is permitted by the dimension of the space of scrolls? So when R is three. So when r is 3, you conjecture predict n up to 10, but the scroll only allows nine points when R is four, the conjecture predicts n up to nine, and the maximum allowed by the scroll is also n up to nine. But if you look at conjecture one plus epsilon, it infested nine and meets. Meet a general one. And if you look at the maximum amount allowed by the scrolls, you get nine points and you cannot be alone. So just a minute ago, you asked if there is any counterexample. Because it really is very close. Eric, I lost track of who this scroll is. How do I get the scroll from this curve? My curve is hyper elliptic. So pairs of points that are conjugate with a hyper elliptic evolution, and I join them with lines. Volume R equals three? Uh a quadric. In general, it's it's a it's a scroll of minimal degrees. So it's a degree r minus one surface scroll. So in this example, conjecture one plus epsilon is not true, but is conjecture one? Is conjecture one? Yeah, in this example, conjecture one is true, but one plus epsilon is false. R is five. This conjecture is predicting n at most ten, and the max allowed by the scroll is n at most not. So you see That these are counterexamples to conjecture one and this is a counterexample to To conjecture one plus epsilon. It is not a counterexample to conjecture one. So do I have a full hour to talk or do I have 50 minutes or what's the exact length of my talk? Full hour? Okay.  Yeah, I try to fit here. So, what might you now conjecture? So, let's make this conjecture, and I'll call it 1 plus epsilon minus delta, which is conjecture one plus epsilon holds. Except in these five cases. What? You see this game? I can, I have an I have an indestructible conjecture. Okay. So here is some prior work on these conjectures. On these conjectures. So Sakiaro in 1980 and then independently Zivron in 2007 did the case when The case when t is zero. Stevens, in this is the name I attached to the smoothing curve singularities result. So Stevens in 1989 and 1996. In the case of canonical curves in paper did, I believe, show that the conjecture for the canonical curve of F. For the canonical curve of every genus except for seven. And then this 96 paper did the genus 7 points. I think that's right. Next, we have, and these are not, this is not independent. So this is Elling's Rhode and Hirschwitz. In 1984 did some cases, and then Perrin in 1987 did more. And then Atanasa in 2014 did even more, and then Isabel. Isabel Vote in 2018 did even more than completed the case R is 3. Each one of these papers did a successively larger chunk of the problem for R equals 3. Atomosov, myself, and Myself and David Yang, you know, 2019 did the case g is at least g plus r. The linear series is non-special. And myself and Isabel Vogt in 2021 did the case RS4. And so the now you might be wondering why after I wrote these g equals zero results, I switched to yellow truck. And what? I wasn't wondering what the fuck is that? You weren't. You were one of them. Okay. Well, all of these were. All of these results, except for the genus zero case, assume characteristic zero. So the theorem of myself and Isabel Vogue is that Conjecture 1 plus epsilon minus delta holds. So these really are the only... These five counterexamples that I just showed you are the only counterexamples. White is still characteristic 0. And white is still any characteristic. Yellow is characteristic 0. So this is in any characteristic. Now, okay, are there any questions? Does conjecture one plus epsilon is that sort of part of the proof? Like, do you need conjecture one plus epsilon to prove conjecture one? Yeah, so the conjecture one plus epsilon is a better formulation for induction than conjecture one. And what I'm going to explain now is something that's even better than one plus epsilon. One plus epsilon So this so the top thing that you just erased with the Sunsoft Yang, was that non-special? Yes. So the non-special race. So then on special range, there are three. So in particular, all five of these counterexamples appear in this prior work. I mean, in the Stevens' work, you see the two canonical curve examples. And in my work with Thomas Auvignier, you see the three Venus II examples. Those are non-special. The content of the theorem is that there's no more exceptions. So we're asking when is this map pi dominant? And in characteristic 0, this is the same as asking when is pi smooth, generically smooth. But in characteristic B, these are different notions. So this map pi is smooth. Is smooth at a given point. Yeah, if and only if h1 of this twist of the normal bundle is zero. And this condition here Is the same as saying that the Euler characteristic is non-negative. So this prompt The following definition A vector bundle E on a curve C satisfies interpolation. If for D in C a general effective divisor of any degree Either H naught of E minus T is zero or H1 E minus T is zero and And we'll make the following conjecture, which is for C a general vertical curve then C satisfies the current colours. Satisfies interpolation. Well, we should say except in these five cases. And this conjecture, of course, implies conjecture of one plus epsilon. 1 plus epsilon minus delta. So, are there any bets on whether conjecture 2 is true or false? But conjecture 2 is false. And so this illustrates V. Dependence of these previous results on the characteristic zero assumption. Right? In characteristic zero, these are equivalent conjectures. Basically, because dominance is the same as generic smoothness. In characteristic P, you can have inseparable maps. So what's going on here? Going on here. Well, the interesting phenomenon takes place in characteristic two. And what happens in characteristic two is That if I take the dual of the normal bundle and I twist up by one, that this is a pullback underbedience. It comes out of the order sequence and the fact that the bundle of principles. Sequence and the fact that the bundle of principal parts of degree of first-order principal parts is a Frobenius Poleberg. Because the degree of Frobenius in this case is a purely characteristic two phenomena, not a characteristic P phenomena. And if G is zero, what this means is that Is that this is a sum of O of AI with all AI even. And this makes it hard for this bundle to be balanced. Thus, NC can only Can only satisfy interpolation if the slope of this bundle is twice an integer. And this condition is the same as saying that d is 1 modulo r minus 1. And so now when we state the theorem, And so now let me state the theorem for conjecture two, which is that conjecture two holds unless either GRD is in this list of five cases that we've been talking about for a while, or the characteristic is 2 and g is 0, and the degree is 0. And the degree is not one module or minus one. So there are four counterexamples to conjecture one. There is one more counterexample to conjecture one plus epsilon. And then there is, in characteristic two, there is this infinite family of counterexamples to conjecture two. 2 that are not counterexamples to conjecture 1 plus epsilon. Are there any other questions? Are there any questions? It's white, which makes it better than. Genus 0 is white, exactly. So in genus 0, there's an easy reduction argument for conjecture one plus epsilon. Or conjecture one plus epsilon from characteristic zero to characteristic p. And I mean the argument is this: you want to find a curve that passes through some set of points, or meets some set of points, meets some set of points in some linear spaces, whatever. You take the points or linear spaces, if you want, and you lift them from characteristic P to characteristic 0. You find a curve that goes through them and characteristics. You find a curve that goes through the mid-characteristic zero, and then you reduce your curve mod p. And so, why is this using g is zero? Because if I have a curve of higher genus, it's hard to control the reduction type. Like, maybe I have a curve of genus 5, and it reduces the stable map when I go to characteristic. Build a characteristic p, reduces to the stable map where you take this curve of genus 5 and you contract it to a point, and then you send some rational tail out that goes through all the other points. Now, that doesn't help answer your question about whether there's a curve of this genus 5 that passes through these points. But if your genus was zero to begin with, then you're happy. Are there other questions? Are there other questions? Yes. I have a question that's kind of like: so you said there's going to be an inductive process. Are you going to say a couple of words about that? Well, that's up to, I think, Dhruv and Jov and Hannah at this point, right? How long did it take? I mean, I can talk for however long we need to talk, right? Maybe we can do this a lot for a couple of minutes. Let's let's let's let's let me let's let people go and then if you want to hear more I can I can I can say more. How's that? Maybe that's actually the end. So thank you. May I ask a question? I'll just give you the next question.
