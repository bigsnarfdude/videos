Tell them about their work. And so, the first one is Jay Stotsky. He is in the group of Hans Othmar at the University of Minnesota. He will talk about the influence of the cell cortex on cell shape and motion. All right. Thank you for the introduction and thank you for the invitation to speak here. Before I get started, I just wanted to acknowledge my collaborators funding and then also to point out that most of this talk is from an art. Is from an article which has been submitted but is not yet out there. So hopefully that will be appearing soon. And then also at the end, since some of the other talks touched on topics that are very closely related to this, I'm going to talk about another recent work a little bit. So the way that cells move around depends heavily on this connection between the cell membrane and the cortex, which lies just beneath the Cortex, which lies just beneath the membrane. And so the cortex is this layer of actomyosin, along with a lot of cross-linking proteins, and also proteins that can polymerize, depolymerize the actomyosin and reorganize it. And then finally, also proteins that mechanically link the actomyosin fibers or the actin fibers to the cell membrane. And so probably doesn't need to be said since everyone's talked. Doesn't need to be said since everyone's talked a great deal about this, but the ability of cells to move around is very important both for development as organs and different tissues develop, and then also can be pathological and cancer metastasis. So if you can imagine we could somehow, in a targeted way, stop cell motion, we might be able to go a long way towards treating many difficult to treat cancers. And so in the image on the left here, And so, in the image on the left here, this is from a paper from 2009, and the green line here represents the cell membrane. And then, the interior area, you can see where there's texture that represents the cytoskeleton. And you can see that sometimes the cell membrane can actually separate from the cytoskeleton, known as blebbing. And that's one area of interest to study. Today, I'm not going to talk so much about blebbing, but more just about how cells can change shape in general when the Change shape in general when the cortex and membrane are kind of tightly coupled together. And so here's a more detailed image of this membrane cortex system. You can see that there's a lot of different types of proteins that are involved. There's these myosin proteins, which can move the actin fibers relative to each other. And then there's also, it should be cross-linkers and proteins linking the membrane and cortex. And then here's a micrograph image on. Here's a micro graph image on the right of that. And so, overall, the system is very complicated and quite difficult to model. However, with regards to the cell membrane, that's been kind of understood more thoroughly or a lot more thoroughly than the cell cortex. And several models have existed for a long time, at least probably 45 or 50 years since the Helfrich and the Helfrich Can. The Helfridge and the Helfridge Can-M bending models have been proposed. And those models were primarily to describe the different types of shapes that cells assume in terms of the lipid bilayers that surround them. In particular, the cell membrane, which is this lipid bilayer, is typically assumed to be inextensible, so it can't change area very much, and that it opposes bending. Bending because the inner and outer radius of the two layers is slightly different. So there's this kind of force that resists bending. And so that turns out to describe the shape of certain cells pretty well. What's one interesting aspect of that is that if you try to compute the forces that should occur, they always, in the classic model, are normally oriented. So they always are kind of pointing straight inward. Are kind of pointing straight inward or straight outward of the cell. And so then there are different models that could be used to describe also in-plane forces and stresses. One is the Scalact model, which was used to describe red blood cells. And then in more recent years, some very general theories of what kinds of things are needed to describe a realistic constitutive relation to relate stress and strain in cell membranes have been developed. Developed. And I'm not going to talk in great detail about how specifically the cortex is modeled. This paper, in some sense, is kind of the first step where we're looking at what shapes CELCS can assume. And we're basically assuming that the coupling between the membrane and cortex is kind of only going one direction here for now. In other words, what's happening is that the cortex will be able a little later on to exert different types of stresses and forces. To exert different types of stresses and forces on the membrane, but we're not taking into account for now the reverse, how the cortex is remodeled and changed due to changes in shape and due to forces that the membrane exerts on the cortex. And so to get a handle of some of the mathematical aspects, I just want to talk very briefly about differential geometry. And so the basic idea here is that we have some sort of membrane, and at each point on the membrane, Membrane, and at each point on the membrane, we can form some type of local parametrization. And so that gives us these two tangent vectors and one normal vector at each point on the surface. And then this can also be used to develop the metric tensor, which is just dot products of the different tangential tangent vectors. And so the surface metric is important if we're going to integrate over the surface. But another Surface. But another important quantity related to the surface shape is the curvature tensor. And so, of course, that plays a major role in these bending models because curvature and bending are very closely related. And so, whereas the in plane stress or in-plane strain in the metric tensor are related to first derivatives of the membrane position. Curvature is typically related to. The curvature is typically related to second derivatives, so it's a little more sensitive to work with computationally, for instance. And for a surface, the curvature tensor is needed because there can be different degrees of curvature depending on which direction on the surface you're moving. But you end up at the end with basically a two by two matrix. And so we can compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix. And the sum of the eigenvalues is And the sum of the eigenvalues is known as the mean curvature, or it's also the trace of the curvature tensor. And then the product of the eigenvalues or the determinant is known as the Gaussian curvature. And so these both tend to cause different types of shapes to form. Here I'm just showing kind of the characteristic shapes when each of the two types of curvature tends to zero. So mean curvature tends to zero, a kind of saddle shape. Tends to zero at kind of saddle shapes where there's curvature kind of in positive curvature direction and then a negative curvature direction. So when you add the two eigenvalues together, they cancel. And then the Gaussian curvature is set to zero along cylindrical type shapes. So it's flat in some direction and curved in another one. And of course, for flat surfaces, both of them are zero. And so, as I mentioned before, these kind of very general models for General models for membrane elasticity or surface elasticity can be found by proposing various energy density functions that depend on the surface metric and the curvature. And so getting back to the biology of it, these bending models were, as far as I know, originally used to describe the different shapes of red blood cells. So there's this biconcave shape, but also a more cup-like shape. But also, more cup-like shapes or shapes or stomatocyte shapes can be described as well. And so, in the image on the left, there are some red blood cells. And on the image on the right, this is an equilibrium shape found by minimizing this energy functional, which I'll describe in a second. So, this is the basic Helfrich model. And so, we have resistance to changes in the mean curvature and resistance to changes in the Gaussian. To changes in the Gaussian curvature. And so this extra term C0, known as the intrinsic curvature, accounts for differences in the chemical potential between the interior and exterior sides of the membrane. And this is important in some lipid bilayer situations because one side of the membrane might be chemically modified in a different way. And so that changes the energy associated with it. And so then the Associated with it. And so then there's compensatory curvature that tries to reduce the size of that membrane to reduce energy. And these two quantities, kappa B and kappa G, are known as the Bending moduli. They're typically in, well, they're in units of energy and typically have values around one times 10 to the negative 19 joules for cells. And often in the literature, these are. And often in the literature, these are treated as constants. But as I'll discuss a little later on, we're also interested here in a case where both these moduli can vary. And so in addition to the forces related to bending, it's also often assumed that the cell membranes are of a fixed area, so they can't change area, and that the cell itself is a fixed volume, but these are. But these are certainly big assumptions in some situations. For one thing, cell membranes can have these caveoli or these folds in the little folds in the membrane where excess membrane material is stored. And one can imagine that under certain types of stress, perhaps these caveoli can open up. And the extreme bending that occurs around them, you would think that would create a huge force. You would think that would create huge force, but it's typically stabilized by various types of proteins that allow for this to occur. And with regard to volume conservation, that also is very approximate, as discussed in one of the talks yesterday. One way that cells might be able to move and extend various phylopodia might be through the uptake of fluid, at least locally, in some area of the cell. Locally in some area of the cell. And so then you can't really say that's conserving volume. But nonetheless, because of the high water content in most cells, probably the fluid itself is incompressible. And the question maybe is more what's the rate of mass transfer across the membrane. For here, I'm going to be talking mostly about equilibrium shapes. And so because we're not dealing with the cell actively changing shape in most cases, I'm going to change the shift. In most cases, I'm going to assume area and volume conservation, but certainly as dynamic situations are considered, that requires a lot of careful thought. And so to include area and volume conservation into the energy, we add two additional terms, one for volume, one for area, and this leads to different Lagrange multipliers that are needed to enforce these relations. And in addition to kind of this global surface area and global volume conservation, it's also possible to talk about surface elasticity and typical measures of deformation such as the deformation gradient tensor or and the Cauchy-Green tensors can be formulated fairly easily once the shape of the surface is known and as long as there's some reference surface to relate it to. Surface to relate it to. And aside from global area conservation, it's also often useful to look at local area conservation. So in the global case, all I'm assuming is that the total amount of membrane is not changing, but it's also often the case that the membrane could be locally inextensible. And so then rather than having a single Lagrange multiplier, you basically end up with a Lagrange multiplier function. Lagrange multiplier function. And this function mu corresponds basically to a surface pressure variable. And in the numerical methods, rather than directly calculate the surface pressure, I essentially am defying an equation of state that relates the pressure to the amount of local area change. And it turns out that if this parameter kappa alpha, kappa A here, A here, which is just a constant in the limit that that goes to infinity, then we recover the result, the surface pressure that would be obtained via the Lagrange multiplier function. And the reason I want to do this is twofold. First, since cells don't exactly conserve surface area, I don't know that any real gain in accuracy is obtained by enforcing that numerically. That numerically compared to what cells really do. And secondly, it's easier numerically to simulate situations where the Lagrange multiplier function doesn't have to be considered because there's a lot of subtleties with regards to what function space this Lagrange multiplier function is defined in, even more so than the case where a three-dimensional A three-dimensional fluid is just being simulated where you have velocity and pressure, and then the function spaces for velocity and pressure have to match up. For the surfaces, it seems like it's even more difficult to do that correctly. And so now I want to get into the types of shapes that we can obtain with this type of model. Even without any forces to represent the cytoskeleton, there's a lot of subtleties that can occur. Of subtleties that can occur. For instance, if the starting, if I create starting shapes that are different types of ellipsoids and then allow them to evolve in some way to functions that, or to shapes that minimize the energy functional I've proposed, then depending on whether you start with a prolate or kind of elongated shape or an oblate or a flattened out ellipsoid, different equilibrium shapes can be obtained. Equilibrium shapes can be obtained, and the shapes are shown here on this slide. On the left, we have this kind of dumbbell shape, and on the right, there is the kind of biconcave shape that is observed with the oblate ellipsoids. And even in some cases, it's possible to get a third kind of cup-like shape. And one way to try to characterize these different shapes is through the introduction of some sort of reduced. The introduction of some sort of reduced volume, which is basically comparing the volume of a contained in a certain size surface to the volume contained in a sphere of the same surface area. And there's a few different ways to define this, but they should all be equivalent in some sense. And the way I've done this here is that I take the volume of some shape V gamma, so it's the volume of the surface, and divide that by the surface area raised to the three half. By the surface area raised to the three-halves power, and then that ratio, which should be non-dimensional since the volume contains just based on the dimensional analysis, we divide that by the same ratio for a sphere. And so it ends up that this reduced volume, its maximum value is one when you have a sphere, and then it can shrink all the way down to zero theoretically. In practice, I look mostly between reducing. I looked mostly between reduced volumes of about a half and one because lower reduced volumes can lead to self-intersection. And so I didn't want to add that sort of complexity into the model about how the two surfaces have to repel each other when they get close enough. And then various people have used this type of idea to create kinds of phase diagrams to elaborate the different shapes that can be found. And this is all without any. And this is all without any forces or any variation in the bending moduli. And so I've done some simulations here just showing the different bending energies that result from oblate or prolate shapes. And what I've seen is that it looks like the prolate shapes tend to have slightly lower energy. Somehow, the axes got a little messed up here. This is reduced area and this is energy. Area and this is energy. They tend to have lower energy. But then when I did a very extreme simulation, it actually had a higher energy compared with an oblate shape of the same reduced area. So I'm not sure if that's just that I didn't run the simulation long enough for things to get reduced, or that maybe as you get to more and more extreme levels of reduced area, that there's some sort of shift in which one is lower and which one is higher. One interesting thing that comes from this, though, is that even though as I reduce the volume, the overall energy curvature energy of the surface is increasing, the energy per unit area decreases both for the prolate and oblate shapes. And the way that kind of makes sense of this is that as you're adding material to the surface, you're increasing energy because there's more material. But in some sense, a speech. But in some sense, a sphere is kind of the maximum you can do with a certain size, certain area surface. And so, if you add more area to that surface with the same level of volume, it allows for more freedom in the shape of the surface. And so you can end up with a lower energy density. So, the real interest, though, in this talk is to try to start accounting for the To start accounting for the shapes that could be obtained by the cytoskeleton acting on these different surfaces. And so, starting from different equal minimizers of the potential energy without any imposed forces, I'm going to start imposing different force gradients or tension gradients. And so, here's an example with a normal force gradient. So, we have zero force. Gradient. So we have zero force at one end and then the largest force at the opposite end. And here, notice that I have the normal vectors pointing outward, but usually in practice, they actually point inward. And the reason for this is that if we imagine that the cytoskeleton lies beneath the cell membrane and is exerting some, is contracting or trying to contract, then that kind of imposes something like a surface tension on the shape. On the shape, and that could be variable in space. But since it's a surface tension that's trying to essentially reduce membrane area, then the sign needs to be pointing inward, that it's pulling, trying to pull the surface inward. Here I've just shown it pointing outward just to help visualize it because it's kind of hard to see when the arrows point inward. And aside from just normally oriented forces, we can also add in tangential forces. Add in tangential force distributions, and of course, there's two different options: there's these kinds of front-to-back forces that might account for some of the examples where there's almost like a cytoskeletal flow going from front to back. And then also kind of torsional forces where you have a rotation that's kind of a torque that's being applied almost to the surface. And mostly, I'm looking at these front-to-back ones here, but certainly. Front to back ones here, but certainly might be interesting to look at the rotations as well. I just don't know of examples in biology where that is supposed to show up. And so, as I showed a while back, we end up with this kind of system where we have three different vectors at each point. And one other subtlety here is exactly how the different types of forces are added in. They can be kind of what I call Lagrangian. Can be kind of what I call Lagrangian or Eulerian. And in the Lagrangian case, what I mean is that if I, at the beginning of the simulation, attach a certain force to a certain material point, and that material point then moves as a surface deforms, the force associated with that point remains constant. Whereas in the Eulerian case, what I do is I say that there's some sort of fixed. There's some sort of fixed force distribution in space, or at least a force distribution relative to the front and back of the cell. And so, if one point starts at the front of the cell and moves to the back of the cell, then the force that that point is exerting on the membrane will change. And the difference between these two types of force distributions I found is typically relatively small, except when there's a large tangential flow, which makes sense. Which makes sense. If there's a large tangential flow, then the position of a point relative to the shape can change a lot. Where if there's very little tangential flow, it's much more difficult for that to happen. And so now I'm going to look at the different shapes that result from varying these different forces and also how reduced area plays a role. So if we first vary the normal force, so we have here we have a weak distribution where even Distribution where even at the maximum side on the right-hand side here, the force is relatively small. The shape doesn't change very much over what the equilibrium shape is with no forces. And of course, as we increase the level of force being applied, the shape becomes increasingly deformed. So we have low force, medium force, and high force on the right-hand side. And what you see is this typical kind of bulb-like shape where there's strong force. Where there's strong forces at the back and weak forces at the front here, and the front is enlarged relative to the back. In the tangential force case, so we're adding a force that points from front to back, and it has a gradient from front to back. We actually kind of see the mirror image resulting. So, again, at weak tangential force levels, the cell shape doesn't really change. And as you increase the tangential force, the cell becomes increasingly. Force the cell becomes increasingly deformed, but in this case, the area where the force is highest is also the side of the cell that ends up being larger. And so this is kind of an interesting result. And in fact, what we see is that if we plot all the different combinations or a few different combinations of normal and tangential forces, that along this diagonal here, where there's a certain level of normal and tangential force, the shape remains essentially. The shape remains essentially fixed. What's also interesting here is that the cell shape is more sensitive to tangential forces than normal forces. At this level of reduced area, the normal forces are about one-third the strength of the tangential forces. And I think this has to do with the fact that here there's only bending forces and resistance to area and volume change. And so those types of forces tend to be. Those types of forces tend to be normally oriented rather than tangentially. And so, a lot more deformation can occur because it's much more difficult for forces to be generated to oppose these tangential forces as composed with, as compared with the normal forces, where since the bending force points in the normal direction and involves higher order derivatives of the surface, if you change the surface even a little, or if you apply even a small norm. apply even a small norm or a large normal force to the surface, the bending forces can rapidly oppose that type of force. And reducing the reduced volume, we see more and more extreme levels of deformation, especially when tangential forces are applied. And what ends up typically happening is that for low enough reduced volume or high enough levels of tangential forces, Levels of tangential forces, you end up with these very long kind of necks that stick out from the cell. And so, what's kind of interesting about these distinctions between what the tangential forces can do and what the normal forces can do is that I think they might suggest different means of which a cell might be able to move around. And to compare with some experimental results, there's an experiment from 2015 where they were able to. Where they were able to induce these very strong cortical flows in cells, and you end up with basically cytoskeletons. Well, the theory is that it's somehow being transported to the front, kind of forming into a cortex along the membrane, and then drawn towards the back by contractility. And so, we end up with a very large accumulation of cytoskeletal material at the back. It's believed that. The back, and it's believed that there's high levels of contractility at the back, and so this likely leads to strong levels of surface tension, which should primarily point in the normal direction. And if we apply normal forces, we actually see this kind of similar shape. They have a kind of similar tail region where there's very concentrated cytoskeleton and likely high levels of force. And then the cell and the expression. The cell in the experimental image is moving to the right. In my simulation, I happen to apply the forces from front to back in the opposite direction. So here the cell is moving to the left, but the same type of shapes are resulting. And so now, so the other aspect of this is that since there's an accumulation of the cell cortex towards the back, the cortex also is varying. The cortex also is varying a lot in thickness from front to back of the cell. And my theory, I guess, is that this also should change the bending modulus, not just the level of force on the cell. And so very few studies have considered variable bending modulus, and I don't know of any actually that have done simulations with a variable Gaussian curvature modulus. And so just to go over a little bit about how the forces are derived. Bit about how the forces are derived. They're done by taking variational derivatives with respect to deformations of the surface, and it ends up with this kind of complicated force term. The main, the most important terms for the bending energy typically are the normal ones. The tangential terms are much smaller in magnitude in most of the cases I looked at. Of course, if you choose some sort of very sharp variation in the bending modulus, then the tangential forces become. Then the tangential forces become more important. So that would be something to look at in the future as well. And typically, so if we set the intrinsic curvature to zero, we end up with basically two terms in the normal direction. One involves a basically Laplacian or Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on the curvature. And the second is an algebraic term that involves the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature. And it turns out that for a sphere, this algebraic term is a very terrible term It turns out that for a sphere, this algebraic term, and actually, if the bending modulus is constant, the Laplacian term also tends to zero. So, for a sphere, that's a minimizer of the bending energy. And so, spheres kind of can be favored in some cases to be equilibrium points. And for a cylinder, on the other hand, the algebraic term, even though the Laplacian is zero for a cycle. though the Laplacian is zero for a cylinder as well with constant bending modulus, the Laplacian term is non-zero, or sorry, the algebraic term is non-zero. And so I think this has some implications for the simulations. In particular, it means it's very hard to go from 3D to 2D simulations because you have to somehow account for the curvature. And one way to do that is perhaps assuming axis symmetry, but certainly just going directly from 3D to 2D. Going directly from 3D to 2D, you shouldn't expect that the same sorts of results occur. And just to try to understand what happens when the bending modulus is variable, I considered just a kind of simple test case and just analytically computed the different forces. So here we have a cylinder and there's an indentation in the cylinder. So the radius is diminished in some area. And what we see is that the algebraic term. Is that the algebraic term, which is this red line here? That term doesn't change a whole lot, it has some variation, and then it goes kind of to a constant value. And of course, if I made the deformation more extreme than, or made this indentation more extreme, rather, it would change more. But in general, it's less sensitive than this derivative term, which has a big spike near the area of high curvature. And also notice that it changes sign. And also, notice that it changes sign here. It has this non-monotonicity, which is very typical of the forces that develop from bending. You see, I see a lot in the numerical simulations. And the forces due to Gaussian curvature also have a kind of similar spike in this case. And these are the normal forces, so I'm not looking at the tangential here. Interestingly, the Gaussian curvature forces involve third-order derivatives. Involve third order derivatives of the surface position, whereas the bending forces actually, the bending modulus involve, sorry, the mean curvature forces involve fourth order derivative. So one might expect that the mean curvature has a sharper effect. And so to look at what this happens more generally as opposed to just some simple test cases, I basically I basically put this into a numerical method, and the basic approach is to use over dynamics and then finite element method. One difficulty with solving this kind of shape equation directly is that it's very numerically stiff and so very small time steps, even if things are done implicitly, have to be used. I found actually that kind of embedding the membrane in a viscous fluid and using the method of regularized stoke. The method of regularized stokeslits was actually much easier to manage in simulations that could use somewhat larger time steps and didn't have as many instabilities developing. And my theory about why this is is that this matrix that results from the method of regularized Stokeslitz is essentially doing some sort of averaging of the force vector around each particular point, and somehow that's smoothing things out. I haven't analyzed exactly what's going on as far as that. Exactly, what's going on as far as that, but it seems like it works pretty well. And since I'm looking at equilibrium shapes, at equilibrium, the velocity should be zero or in reality close to zero. And since I have volume conservation already accounted for in the membrane energy, the fact that there's a pressure distribution that results from a fluid shouldn't matter a whole lot. Lot. And so it also just remains to talk about the local area elements because those end up showing up in the elasticity forces. And so basically I assume that, or I'm looking at the set of triangles that each point is contained in. And so the local area is just one-third of the area of all the triangles that it touches. And the one-third factor is just the we're not double-counting things when we look at the local area around. Things when we look at the local area around adjacent points. And then incorporating the forces due to the Gaussian curvature model. I think this is new. I haven't seen anyone else do this numerically. And so they're relying on basically a weak approximation of this gradient of the normal vector. And it's necessary to do this weakly because the normal vector has discontinuities. Has discontinuities as you go from one element to the next element on the surface. And so if we set there to be a gradient of the bending moduli from front to back, we can end up with different types of shapes. And so here the mean curvature modulus is varying. Here it varies from one to five and here from one to ten. And you see that it leads to this kind of asymmetric dumbbell type of shape and the asymmetry becomes more extreme. The asymmetry becomes more extreme as the gradient becomes stronger. And we also see a larger kind of neck area as the gradient becomes larger. The Gaussian curvature modulus has similar effects, but the shapes end up being kind of different. You can see that there's more of a longer neck here, whereas with the Gaussian curvature varying, there's a shorter neck that has a more extreme curvature. And this kind of makes sense because the Gaussian curvature is. Of makes sense because the Gaussian curvature is large and negative when you have this kind of net shape. And it's also interesting to look at not just forces, but imposed surface tensions. And what's rather interesting is that with area conservation, there's not, in some cases, I mean, it depends exactly how the surface tension is imposed, but in some cases, you can end up with situations where the imposed surface tension actually doesn't. The imposed surface tension actually doesn't change the shape all that much. And this is because the surface pressure can essentially oppose the surface tension forces to a large degree. On the other hand, if the surface stress tensor, rather than just being an isotropic tension, is anisotropic, then you end up with very significant kinds of deformations that look almost like cells doing a very simple, very simplistic way. Very simple, very simplistic model of what might happen during mitosis. Of course, there's many details that are missing, so I'm not claiming that this is what happens necessarily, but I think the contractile ring that does occur, the fact that it has fibers that are oriented circumferentially probably has a large effect on the ability of the cell to contract. Another interesting aspect that I haven't explored a whole lot, but seems to show up in certain cases. That seems to show up in certain cases if I add surface elasticity is that radial symmetry can be lost. And what I think is happening here is that there's some sort of there's enough elastic energy that develops that the cell tries to buckle, but because there's also curvature resistance, it can't really fully buckle. And so you end up with these kind of strange shapes that almost look like a mix of an oblate. Almost look like a mix of an oblate and a prolate shape. And I don't know if this shows up in any experiments, but it's just kind of an interesting result that I saw numerically. And so to include this section here, the main point of this work was to develop a numerical method that can handle curvature forces and shape equilibria in general 3D shapes. 3D shapes. And so that's what I've hopefully shown. And also to explore kind of the variety of cell shapes that can be obtained. And now, of course, the next step is to start talking about how to do more detailed models of the cytoskeleton and how that links back to the membrane forces. So we have coupling between both the membrane, both cortex to membrane and membrane to cortex. I've also I've also started working on taking into account that the membrane and cortex don't have to have the same types of deformation that they can separate. So here, in just a kind of simple 2D model, I've imposed a cortical contraction that's strong enough to oppose the linkage or to break the linkages between the membrane and cortex in certain areas of the cell. And so you see that. And so you see that that happens. And then also another thing to look at is the interaction of the cell with its surroundings and to start trying to account for more of the dynamics of the motion. So one way to do this is to embed the cell in a fluid and now allow for viscosity contrast between the inside and outside of the cell, and also to look at potential effects of the shape on hydrodynamic interactions or even Coupling to barriers and things in the environment. And this has been shown in some works to be very important for cell motility: that certain types of cells, if they're just free-floating, they can't really move. But then the instant they touch a surface or get confined, they can start moving. And I also just wanted to spend, so that's all for that subject, but I also just wanted to talk very briefly about a previous. Briefly about previous work because I've seen a lot of previous speakers have talked about some of these stochastic models of how cells are moving around. And even though this work was done with a little bit of a different system in mind, I think that it has a lot of applications to this area as well. And so, what we had in mind here was studying how a protein called decapentiplegic, or DPP, which is very Or DPP, which is very important in the patterning and growth of the Drosophila wing disc, is able to spread around. And so the Drosophila wing disc, it's a kind of proto-organ in Drosophila or fruit fly embryos that eventually turns into the wing and some surrounding tissues. And this protein, decapentoplegic, is believed to play a role in how the tissues get patterned. Tissues get patterned. Basically, it's secreted by certain cells in the middle of the wing disc, and then cells on the exterior exhibit a concentration-dependent response to it. And so, there's all these different hypotheses about how this transport happens. Does it just diffuse or is it kind of uptaken and released sequentially from adjacent cells? And part of the confusion about what's going on results from. What's going on results from different experiments that measured vastly different several orders of magnitude different results for the diffusivity of DPP? And so we wanted to try to construct some sort of model that can explain how things that the cell are doing locally can impact the overall tissue-wide distribution. And so we did this with continuous time random walks. And this is kind of, of course, a simplification because we're assuming that the Simplification because we're assuming that the DPP molecules are essentially undergoing small jumps. I'll talk a little bit in a minute about how to get rid of that simplification in certain cases. But the main concept here is that we have some sort of jump distribution operator that tells you how likely it is that a point that a particle at point y arriving there at time tau jumps to point x at time t. And so This operator is in general quite complicated because it has dependence on two different times. And Montreal and Weiss developed a simplified form that's been used in a lot of situations. So at least for a first approach, I think this makes sense. And after a number of algebraic simplifications, one can get a master equation in integral or differential form to describe the position. Describe the position, the probability that the particle is located at position x at time t. And I'm not going to go through all the terms in detail here, but they're discussed a lot in the paper. And this is also sort of a classical theory of the Montreal-Weiss random walk. In some cases, also, what's interesting is that the whole problem reduces to a system of ordinary differential equations. Of ordinary differential equations, and this occurs when the waiting time distribution, or how long it takes on average, or not on average, but the distribution of times for the particle to jump is a Poisson distribution. And it's also possible to talk about systems of chemical reactions with this kind of master equation approach. And what we had in mind here is that a particle is moving around and might be able to enter different internal states. Or different internal states that have different transport properties. And so the next step is to combine the internal reactions with transport. So what we have here are kind of spatially non-uniform types of lattices that have different waiting time distributions at different points and also can have chemical reactions going on at each point. So you can have changes from a free state. Changes from a free state to a mobile state, and then also differences in the transport properties at each position in space. And so the idea is to be able to describe something like a particle moving in the intracellular or extracellular space in the cell and also landing on the membrane. And so it's possible to then construct general differential equation systems when things are Poisson distributed that describe this. That describe this, and the matrices that result have special kind of block Laplacian structures which end up having nice properties. And so, in general, this doesn't even have to be on like a straight line, but can be embedded in something like a hexagonal lattice. So, this is approaching some sort of more realistic description of transport in a hexagonally packed tissue. And so, there's a huge amount of detail embedded. So, there's a huge amount of detail embedded in all these internal states along each edge. And then, the next step to obtain something usable at the larger scale with the tissue scale is to compute effective waiting times for a particle to jump between adjacent kind of primary vertices or junctions in the graph. So, if we imagine that there's junctions where there are three different edges meeting. Edges meeting, the points on the junctions can be treated differently than the points, what I call secondary vertices that are intervening. And so we've collapsed a lot of the detailed biological information into these effective waiting times. And what's useful about this as well is that it's possible to then approximate these effective waiting times to obtain simplified versions of them, because, of course, Versions of them, because of course, there's a certain amount of detail, and that somehow has to be reflected in the exact solutions to the effective waiting times. But at the larger scale, we want to get rid of perhaps all of the details and just capture the most important. And so in some asthmatobic limits, we can obtain different reaction diffusion equations with coefficients that depend precisely on the micro scale types of models. And so, with regards Of models. And so, with regards to the Drosophila wingdisc problem, the idea was that we're connecting kind of local diffusivity to global diffusivity, because that's one of the issues that has shown up, that one group has measured essentially local diffusivity and found that it's very large. But you also need to take into account things like immobilization as well to understand what the global diffusivity or how fast things are spreading out. Or how fast things are spreading out on a larger scale. So the same sort of process can also be applied to hexagonal lattices and also hexagonal lattices with both kind of edge jumps, whoops, edge jumps, and also jumps to the interior of a cell. And again, we can derive kind of macro scale diffusivities from this. And then also even to problems that have anomalous. Even to problems that have anomalous diffusion. So, anomalous diffusion occurs when there's very prolonged trapping in a system. So, a particle is moving and gets stuck for a very long time. And this really alters the dynamics. And so, that also can grow out of this type of model. And so, there's a lot of extensions here. And I just thought some of the previous talks just kind of brought that into my mind that maybe there's a That into my mind that maybe there's a way to study cell motility as well with this type of model, and in fact, some people have done kind of similar models like that. So with that, I just wanted to thank everyone for listening, and I'd be happy to take any questions. Thank you very much, Jay. Really cool stuff. So I open the floor for questions. Please use the chat or raise your hand. Use the chat or raise your hand. Marco, you want to start? Yes. Hi, Jay. Hopefully you can hear me. Yeah, so thanks so much for a very great talk and also very nice to see you. It's been a while. But so just about So, just about the first part of your talk, I was just wondering if you could tell us, give us a little bit more details on the numerical method that you used and also how you incorporated the sort of local incompressibility penalty term. And then I was. And then I was also very curious about the sort of trends or the result that you mentioned: that if you increase, I think it's the stiffness of the penalty term, you essentially reach the sort of two-dimensional Stokes sort of like fluid membrane regime. And I wondered how that plays out. How that plays out in the numerical method that you use. Sure. So let me address actually the last part here. I'm just trying to find the slides where I discussed that. So with regards to the limit where the elasticity coefficient is increasing um sorry hold on a second there we go um yeah so what ends up happening at some value of it um i was basically computing like let's say it's equal to a thousand um i forget exactly what the units are in it and then if i change it to two thousand what ends up happening is that the value of mu basically stays the same Basically, it stays the same. In other words, as I change this, it's compensated exactly for by changes in how much the local area measure is changing. So if I double it, the local area measure changes by one half. And as this gets very large, the actual change in the local area measure becomes very small. So if k is, or kappa is 1000. Is our kappa is 1000, then the local area change might be just 0.001. And so I didn't analytically derive it, but what should happen in the limit that kappa alpha becomes infinity is that this mu becomes approaches some finite number, which is then corresponds to the Lagrange multiplier or the surface pressure. Numerically, let me go there. Well, so with regards to this surface stokes flow, for now I actually haven't included any kind of surface fluidity. Kind of surface fluidity right now. That's definitely something that I've been thinking about. I know that's something that we were working on a while back as well. But for now, since I'm just looking at the equilibrium shapes, at the equilibrium, the velocity along the surface is very small. And so the surface fluidity shouldn't play a large role. And so that makes it much more easy to simulate numerically. Much more easy to simulate numerically, of course, if there's no surface fluidity. And with regards also to conserving the local area, so here I have second order Lagrange finite elements. So the dark lines represent the outlines of the elements. And since it's a quadratic on each element, there's an additional degree of freedom along each edge. And so what I did. Along each edge. And so, what I did is connect the additional degrees of freedom into like kind of a refined mesh and then calculate the area around each point. So all the triangles that touch a particular point to get some sort of approximation of the local area element. And then that's also compared with the local area element that the surface. Um, that the surface had when it started the simulation. Um, does that answer your question? Uh, yes, it does. Thanks a lot, Jay. Yeah, thank you, Marco. Jay, I was wondering about these thin cell philipodia and cell extensions. It seems like the cell throws out all understanding of surface tension and just extends in very thin philipodia. And very thin Philipodia, very, very long. Or would your theory support these kinds of things? Yeah, I think it's really interesting. And I've been trying to think if that really makes sense. Like, is that maybe what's going on biologically? Because I always had this kind of idea that actually the phylopodia, maybe there's like cytoskeleton pushing near the front of the phylopodia. Near the front of the phylopodia pushing it along. But this seems to suggest that maybe if you have forces kind of at the back of the cell almost pushing the opposite way, somehow you end up with that it's pushing out these thin protrusions. I don't know. I don't think I know the answer offhand, but I think it's something I'd like to definitely look at further if there's something to this. Something to this now. As you mentioned further, I see many different directions you could go now, right? You could look at the insights, the first generation. You could also look at movement or swimming or what cells do in tissues. Are you going to do all of this? Well, I'd like to do some of it. Actually, the previous talk with the cells touching each other with just a pair of cells or even four cells, I think. Even for cells, I think also is very interesting. And I wonder if there's some way to do that in this type of framework where, like, imposing an additional adhesion for when two surfaces are close enough might end up with similar types of shapes.
