So, I'm going to talk about a problem that comes from the vibration of ice shelves. Feynman had this great quote about physicists versus mathematicians, and I think it sort of applies to applied mathematicians versus pure mathematicians. That the physicist or the applied mathematician is interested in the particular problem, so scattering from a wedge or something like that. But we're going to. Something like that. But we're going to start with a particular problem and kind of move to the general problem a little bit here. But it's good to have this very concrete example to motivate us to see that this just isn't something that, you know, it's something that practically appears. And it's connected to things, lax phillips scattering, leaky modes, complex scattering frequencies. These are ideas that maybe some of you have heard about, but it's connected with that problem. So this is the model for the ice shelf, is extremely. The model for the ice shelf is extremely simple. It could not be any simpler. So, one of the best things about simple models is that you know the real world will be at least this complicated. So, whatever, you know, an actual ice shelf is going to be at least exhibit more complicated behavior than the one I'm going to show on this model. But this is a model that's used by geophysicists, and it's not something that's not completely made up or anything like that. Not completely made up or anything like that. So, and how much of the details of this model you need to understand is not clear to me. You need to know that out here, we're assuming the water is shallow, so it's just the wave equation. So, in what follows, out here, we're just going to have the wave equation and we're going to non-dimensionalize that. The speed is going to be one. And under the ice shelf, we've got a complicated equation that couples the bending of this with the water. So, this is this equation here. So, it couples the This is this equation here. So it couples the velocity potential and the displacement of the ice shelf. Now, there's some boundary conditions that we have to apply, free edge conditions, and there's some edge condition here. So in a real ice shelf, it's very variable in its thickness and the water cavity is not constant's depth. Probably it is shallow to some extent because these are very long vibrations. It's vibrating on the order of kilometers, if not tens of kilometers. Kilometers and then we have some wave that's going to come in here and it's going to excite it and cause it to vibrate. And there is evidence that ocean waves swell, things like that do excite them. And you could also imagine some kind of tsunami wave or something like that. Okay, so here the system of equations is really simple. You end up outside here, you just have an incident wave. We've gone here to the Helmholtz equation. We've assumed a single. Helmholtz equation. We've assumed a single frequency. So we have an incident wave here. We have a reflection coefficient. And then under the eye shield, we have six unknowns that come from this six-order polynomial. So we've got one plus six, seven unknowns, and we need seven boundary conditions. And we solve with a matrix matching to get the coefficients. So solve for this Hillmoltz equation. It could not be simpler, the solution of the Hillmoltz equation. And we've got the modulus of R. We've got the modulus of R, the reflection coefficient has to be equal to one from conservation of energy. Okay, so and this the solution of this equation goes way back to works of Stoker, and they were using it for a model for breakwaters in the Second World War, the Mulberry Harbour. All right, I'm just going to show a movie here, okay, which is playing, which is amazing. So, this is a Playing, which is amazing. So, this is a simulation in the time domain. And I've excited this eye shelf with a packet that's close to a mode of vibration of the plate. So, what happens is that the packet comes in and gets reflected back, and it causes the plate to vibrate, to move in this mode. So, the plate itself, it's kind of remembers that it's a plate and it wants to vibrate in modes, but there's actually no modes in the system. No modes in the system. So, one of the explorations is about the modes. It's actually, you might think energy is not conserved when you see this picture. But it is, I promise you. I have not created a perpetual motion device. All right. So, what's happened is, if you think about this problem, the incident wave packet, if we Fourier transform that and then multiplied it by that reflection coefficient and then inverse Fourier transforms, that would be. And then inverse Fourier transforms, that would be the mapping from the incident wave to the outgoing wave. That's one way to think about this problem. All right. Okay, not sure what's going on here. Go back. Okay, here we go. Brilliant. All right. So, first of all, if we look at this reflection coefficient and we explore what it actually looks like in the complex plane, we find this amazing structure to it. The reflection coefficient is written as this. Reflection coefficients written as this infinite product of k minus kn over k minus km bar. So it has a pair, these pairs of zeros and singularities on the complex plane. And the modulus of r, you can see privilegedly why the modulus of r is equal to one. So each of these zeros and each of these singularities is what's giving rise to that mode. All right. So, and this is a beautiful picture of a This is a beautiful picture of it. So, this everything that follows is a consequence of this structure of the R. So, any problem that has this structure, all the rest of this will follow. I bet money on it. I'm not, you know, how certain that is, I don't know, but I'm 99% sure. Okay, so now we go into a bit of theory. We're going to write this as an abstract wave equation with some operator a squared that's positive self-adjoint. A squared that's positive self-adjoint. So, this is just how, I mean, the exact form of this A is actually really tricky to write down, but we can show that this A is self-adjoint in this inner product that includes the bending energy of the plate. So, and it's really not that important to understand what A is. And it would take maybe a day to. Maybe a day to prove the self-adjointness or something. If you started to calculate it, you take a few wrong turns. It's not very simple to do it because it's exactly the form of that. But it turns out that those solutions that we calculated, they're the eigenfunctions of this A. So we know this operator. We know what the eigenfunctions of this operator are. That is just Helmholtz equation. So this equation is equivalent to what I had written down before. So this is a little bit of a detail. This is a little bit of a detour in my talk. So, and whether this is a good idea or not, I'm not sure, but I've got a bit of time. So, if you think about it, if you wanted to solve this problem numerically, the first thing you'd do is you'd take this and you'd approximate A by a matrix. Okay, it's a linear operator. We're going to approximate it numerically. We're going to get a matrix. And the best way we want to solve a problem like that where A is We want to solve a problem like that where A is a matrix and A squared is self-adjoint positive. We're going to do a decomposition into a diagonal matrix. We're going to diagonalize that matrix A. And that would be the best solution we could come up with. Because numerically, we'd end up, when we solve it, we've got to do a matrix multiplication. Remember that P and P adjoint here are inverses of each other. So you don't need to calculate one matrix. You multiply by a matrix. One matrix, you multiply by a matrix, multiply by a diagonal matrix, and multiply by this other matrix. So it will be a lot of work to calculate for a given matrix of high dimension. It's a bit of work to do this decomposition. It may not be numerically stable, but actually what we've done gives us a method to calculate these D and the P. So that it's actually, so we can, at this point, we could take a path. You know, path, a different path, and we could come up with a numerical method to solve it. And then I just want to talk briefly about this idea of a group theory, because a lot of the time when we think about these problems, we think we're going to solve it and we're going to find the solution, which is this function that satisfies Hermoltz equation for a given k. And that's the idea, that's our goal when we've solved the problem. We found a function. Solved the problem. We found a function that satisfies Helmholtz's equation. But if you stop and think about this problem for a second, you realize what the most important object is the operator that takes the solution of your wave equation at time t equals zero or times t equals 10 and maps it to time t equals 8 or t equals 13. So that forms a one parameter group. And you know, the same operator that takes you from one second to two seconds will also take you from 20 seconds to 21 seconds, right? 21 seconds, right? And that group, that operator, that group appears here naturally as this object here. So that, when not only have we solved the problem numerically, we've found this group, a numerical representation of the group, that's the mapping. And I think that object is more important and more central than anything else. But of course, it's built from the solutions of Helmholtz equation. So that's why, but that's, you know, But that's you know, that's an aside, maybe. But um, but you know, whether you're, you know, but if you're solving in the time domain, you kind of need to get access to this group. And one of the things that's really amazing that tells you about linearity is that with this group, I can calculate the solution from t equals zero. I can go to any time I want with the same effort because I'm going to have to calculate. All I do is the only difference going 100 seconds ahead or a million seconds ahead is just calculating. Million seconds ahead is just calculating the exponential here. So that's that's very odd feature of linear problems that you can once you track, you can go from any time to any time with the same effort. That sort of tells you that the world can't be linear. Because we definitely can't take knowledge now and immediately go to what it was like in a thousand years or whatever. All right. So the next step of this problem is To write it as this at the moment, the second-order system is actually a bit of a pain to deal with because you've ended up each k there's two eigenfunctions there's because you've got one for either the ik and either the minus i k. So you write it as a second order system, but this is this is nothing more than just repeating the equation above, right? I d by dt is that, and if I square that, I get a squared. And it's really simple to see that this. And it's really simple to see that this is this new operator here will be self-adjoint in this strange inner product here. Sorry, I should have labeled these. These are the old inner products we had before. It's missing that E label. So this inner product contains that bending. So, and again, we don't really need, it doesn't really concern us too much. We know that the eigenfunctions of this operator are exactly this pair here. And you can see here that even though this eight is the same. Here, that even though this eight is the same for positive and negative k, this you introduce this k factor here. So we know the eigenfunctions in this space. This is a bit of a weird mapping, but we actually need that to do what follows. So now we introduce this transform. So this is the thing that I studied so much in my life, these generalized transforms. So I just want to explain what we're going to do. We want to solve the solution in the time domain. So we want to write the initial condition. So, we want to write the initial condition as the sum of all these Helmholtz solutions. So, we've got the solution. We want to write any arbitrary initial condition as the sum of things that solve Helmholtz equations. Then we can solve in the time domain by multiplying by either the ikt. So, this equation here is probably east place to star. So we have some function f of k that's going to be, which sums up all these different solutions of Helmholtz equation. Of course, it's like a Fourier transform, right? If we didn't have a nice short. If we didn't have an eye shelf, it would reduce to the Fourier transform. And then this expression here, this inner product, in this strange function space here, you know, which I wrote down before, which has all the, if I go back here, you know, it contains all, it contains the second derivatives. And now I've expanded it and I've added this operator A in. In that, inner product space, that gives you a representation for F of K. And it's quite a computable object. So we can map. So we can map. So, what we're doing is we're taking our solution in the physical domain with that I show and all the complicated motion, and we're mapping it into the Fourier space where we have this function f hat of k. And that f hat of k is just, just like the Fourier transform, it lives in L2 from minus infinity to infinity. It lives, it's an, so we've got an incredibly sort of, we couldn't imagine a more beautiful representation of the problem than just functions that are analytic on minus infinity to infinity. On minus infinity to infinity in the complex plane. And this mapping preserves the inner product. So if we take the inner product of two functions in one space, we get the same inner product. It's like a unitary transformation, but of course, the function spaces are so different. One of them has the bending and all this stuff. The other one's just L2. But let's think about the consequences of that. The consequences of that for a second here because this problem has three very natural subspaces that are orthogonal. One is the waves that are coming in, that are in the fluid and are coming into the ice shelf. One is the waves that are going out. So we call that D plus and D minus. So this is the incident waves and these are the outgoing waves. And then the other thing is the waves under the eye shelf. So how it's moving. Under the eye shelf, so how it's moving. And you can sort of see why they're going to be orthogonal because you had a function that's zero outside the eye shelf and a function that's zero under the eye shelf. When you multiply them together, you're going to get zero. So where do they get mapped to under this mapping? Well, the incident waves get mapped to all the functions that are analytic in the upper half plane. And the waves that come out, it's not all the functions analytic in the lower half plane because we multiply by r of k. So it takes all of the functions. Of k. So it takes all the functions analytic in the lower half plane and it puts zeros and singularities into those functions. And the waves under the eye shelf is what's left, which is this orthogonal decomposition, the difference between functions analytic minus all, like i.e. they're orthogonal to every function that's multiplied by R of K. So what is that? And here's where we use the fact that R of K has this incredible. Fact that R of K has this incredibly simple form. So, what does that space K look like? Because we're not really interested in the waves coming in. We know they just move by translation, and we're not really interested in the waves going out. So, at that point, it looks really confusing, but this is the most important thing here on the slide. If we take the function that's analytic in the lower half plane, we put it into the inner product, we conjugate it, so we flip it into the other half plane. Half plane. So that means our f of k, if it has a singularity exactly where r has a zero, it's going to be zero when we evolve when we do the contour integration, right? Because we're going to pick up the singularity here, which is going to be r of k n, but not r of k n, r of k n bar. So k will be r will be zero. So we suddenly we've got in this incredibly simple description of the modes of vibration in this space. They're just these singularities of the function. It's exactly like the. function that's exactly like the Laplace transform you know one over you know one over k minus one over s minus one or something these are the modes of vibration like you get when you do the Laplace transform or the Fourier transform and then it's quite interesting to think about the group so that that operator that maps from one time to the other in the original space it's going to be very complicated because it's got to turn that incident wave packet into that funny one you saw coming out. Into that funny one you saw coming out. But in this transform space, it's just multiplication by e to the minus ikt. So the groups become incredibly simple as well. So and we can introduce a semi-group, which is basically just think about the ice shelves. Only solve in that space, take the initial condition on the ice shelf, let that evolve, and then project it back. So it's this double projection. Projection. So, in some senses, this is where we go: okay, what would this, what's the most beautiful representation we could have for that semi-group, i.e. for this ice shock behavior? It would be that this operator, it's got to be, can't be self-adjoint because it's losing energy. So, what we'd hope is that we can do a decomposition of this. We can diagonalize this operator, but we'd have to do it. It's not going to be the diagonalization is going to involve. The diagonalization is going to involve a biorthogonal system because the operator is not self-adjoint. So, is that possible? And the answer, of course, is yes, it is, because we can introduce a biothogonal system with respect to our singularities by knocking out one of the zeros. So, this is the function that we produce here. Okay, this isn't just a normalization here to give them, to make it. Give them to make it unity, but you can think about this function here. If you start to multiply by a singularity, when you take the conjugate, it's going to pick up one pole, and that pole will be cancelled by it. So we've got a biorthogonal system, very simple representation of this operator in this transform space. And then we can go back to the actual physical space and we can get this expression for the solution as the sum of modes. The solution as the sum of modes here. So there should be a minus here. So we've got an expression here for the, so this is like a, you know, you can imagine if you had the just the I short by itself with no fluid about it, it would be written down as the sum over modes, and you project the initial condition onto the mode and then expand it. So, in this case here, the phiens and the sciens and the phiens, these two modes are different. And the phi ends, these two modes are different because one of them forms a bi-orthogonal system. And these phi ends, these are the leaky modes. And so they have this slightly strange behavior that, and people find this a bit mysterious because they grow towards infinity. They don't have finite energy. But of course, we're only interested in the solution under the plate. So under there, they have finite energy. So, what does this mean for the ice shelves? And it means that the ice shelf is moving in these modes of vibration that are leaking energy, slowly losing energy to the fluid. And these modes aren't orthogonal to each other, but we can form a bi-orthogonal system to them. And we have this transformed space that these modes are simply one over k minus kn. And the real part of the mode is the frequency, and the imaginary part is this rate of decay. The imaginary part is this rate of decay. All right. Let the magic happen. Okay, brilliant. So, this is just another simulation here showing you how this works. So, we started with some initial condition in here, and we can solve it by these two. Solve it by these two methods, and this is giving you the expansion and mode. And of course, they match perfectly here under this. This is in some non-dimensional units here. This is under the eye shelf. This is out here. What's slightly mysterious is that the expansion that we wrote down, none of the theory tells us that it works outside in this region here, but actually it matches. But this sort of points to something a little bit mysterious. Like, why does it work out here? And it takes some time to work, but actually, these modes, when But actually, these modes, when you're not really supposed to extend them out here in our formulation, but if you do that, you end up recovering the solution. All right. So that sort of hints at some deeper structure here. All right. So there's lots of questions about this whole analysis. So, first of all, So, first of all, we need the reflection coefficient to have this incredibly simple form where it's written as the sum of these poles. If it has, there's no, just because it has unit amplitude doesn't guarantee that. You could have some kind of exponential factor added into it. It's like someone talked about it in one of the other talks. There's like some Blaschke decomposition theorem or something that tells you what functions like this, but it can have a more complicated form. So, and it's very difficult to show for this problem. Very difficult to show for this problem that the reflection coefficient has that form. We just found it numerically. So, why does it have the simple form under what circumstances? And then, so what happens if the wave equation becomes more complex and includes dispersion and all of that? So, we can still do the transformation. We can still construct this group operator. We can still construct a transformation. We can still find a space where the operator, the group. Space where the operator, the group, is just multiplication by e to the ikt, but it doesn't follow that we can get such a simple structure when we invert it. For example, if you take water that's deep or you take something like a waveguide, the incoming and outgoing modes aren't necessarily orthogonal to each other anymore. So we lose that structure. And then the finding these inner products in which the operator is self-explanatory. Products on which the operator is self-adjoint is really important, and that's not always trivial to find. You can make arguments based on the energy, but in this case, here we've sort of lost the energy. It isn't actually the energy that we've ended up finding that works perfectly for this problem. All right, I'm going to finish there.
