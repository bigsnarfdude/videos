Large dimensions. Please, Bruno. Okay, thank you very much. So, I'm very glad to be here today. And, of course, I thank the organizers for inviting me to this conference. And as usual, with these Zoom talks, I'm not seeing anything absector for my PDF. So, please don't hesitate to interrupt me if you have any questions because I don't see your reactions. So, I'd be glad to answer it. So, right. Answer it. So, right, today I'm going to try to describe the construction of specific blowing up solutions for families of critical stationary Schrodinger equations in large dimensions. So, I will start by describing you the setting of my talk today. So, I will work on a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary of dimensions larger than three, and I will mostly work with the following family of equations. So, I will consider sequences or families as you will. Sequences or families, as you wish, u epsilon of positive solutions of the following equation here. Okay, so Laplacian of u epsilon plus a function h or sequence h epsilon times u epsilon is equal to u epsilon to this nonlinear power to star minus one. Here, the family h epsilon, which I will sometimes refer to as the family of potentials, is just a family of C1 functions converging in C1 towards a function in M. My Laplacian is. function in m. My Laplacian is the non-negative Laplacian, so it's minus the divergence of the gradient. And the power that you see here, star, it's the maximum power for the embedding of the subordinate of H1 space into Lebesgue spaces. So in particular, what you have on the right-hand side is a non-linear equation, which is critical for the embedding of Lebesgue spaces, of subordinate spaces into Lebesgue spaces. And as we shall see in a second, this is critical in terms of rescalings, and particularly the power for which classes. Particularly, it's the power for which classical bootstrap techniques do not work and where defects of compactness do appear. So, there is a very well-known specific case in the case in which all the potentials here h epsilon are equal to a given geometric quantity, so it is dimensional constant times the scalar curvature, then this equation here is the celebrated Yamabi equation, okay, that constrains the scalar curvature of a conformal metric in M, which has been thoroughly studied. Been thoroughly studied. Okay, so this can be seen as some sort of generalization of the Yamabi equation when you let the potential vary beyond the geometric one. And what I will be interested in today is trying to understand the blow-up picture for positive solutions for this equation here. And in particular, I will be interested to construct specific families of solutions which behave like bubble trees, trees of bubbles, or more precisely as towering bubbling solutions. So I will describe all of this in the following. Describe all of this in the following slides. So, maybe let me start by explaining what I mean by finite energy blow-up pictures. So, if I'm again considering a family of solutions of such an equation, all positive, I say that it blows up if the L infinity norm of my sequence goes to plus infinity, as my parameter goes to zero, and I say that it blows up with finite energy if its H1 norm remains bounded. And in this case, we have a well-established H1 theory, which goes back. H1 theory, which goes back to Brésis-Coron and Schmuy in the 80s, that says that in this under these assumptions, my sequence U epsilon canonically decomposes in the energy space as a weak limited knot plus the sum of a finite number of defects of compactness plus a remainder which is small in H1. So this remainder is something whose H1 norm goes to zero. So what are these defects of compactness by epsilon? Well for positive sequences they are all classified in a way they are They are all classified in a way, they're canonical, and they're all given by the same family of functions. And each of these effects of compactness is about by an i because it depends on a specific sequence mu i which goes to zero. This is some sort of concentration parameter. And by a center, c i epsilon, which is just a point in m. So this is sometimes called the center of the bubble. See, and these defects of compactness here come with an explicit expression. So it's they're given by mu i epsilon to some power m minus two divided by two divided by divided by 2 divided by mu i epsilon squared plus the distance to xi epsilon squared at the power n minus 2 over 2. So these are very simple things and just to make it clear what do I mean and these are defects of compactness? Well because they represent the canonical way of losing compactness for a positive sequence of equations such as the one I'm considering. And just again to recall very simple facts but they will be important later on. But they will be important later on. What do I mean by loss of compactness? Well, it's easy to see that if I take one of these functions here, b i epsilon, one of these sequences, it blows up. So it's an infinity norm, goes to plus infinity. This is very easily seen when you just evaluate it at its center. So if you take x to be equal to psi epsilon, where you realize that this function behaves like a negative pi power of mu i, which is a sequence going to zero, it's also easily seen that It's also easily seen that all these functions carry the same amount of energy. So their H1 norm is up to a small O of 1. It's a dimensional constant, which is positive. And yet these functions weakly converge to 0. Okay, so this is an instance of non-compactness since you have a sequence of functions which weakly converge to zero, but do not strongly converge to zero in H1, and they blow up. It turns out that, of course, if you're using Of course, if you're used to working with optimal solar inequalities in Rn, or if you're used to working with equations in Rn, of course, these families here really look like the so-called standard bubbles in Rn, or sometimes the Talenti bubbles, which are given by the same exact expression with the Riemannian distance replaced by the Euclidean one. And there's a reason for this because, in a way, as things concentrate, in the previous equation that I wrote down, the two main Equation that I wrote down. The two main terms, the two fundamental ones, remain the Laplacian and the linear power. So, in the end, your equation behaves asymptotically as if it were the Yamabi equation in Rn. And as it turns out, these functions here are the unique positive solutions of the Yamabi equation in Rn. So whenever we're looking at positive sequences of solutions for our equations, this is the only way loss of compactness can occur. And well, it turns out that we know something about when. Something about when compactness defects like these ones can occur or not. And so this goes back to 2004, where Drouber and Robert obtained an improvement of Schruve's compactness result. And Drouier and Robert showed that the canonical decomposition of Truve, of a sequence of solutions of this equation as a weak limit plus a finite number of directs of compactness, can be extended in surrounding energy spaces. So it can be shown that the remainder which That the remainder, which was only small in H1 before, actually turns out to be small, globally point-wise small with respect to the first-order terms appearing in the decomposition. So with this and suitable pods, I F-type identities, it's then possible to quantify when the effects of compactness for this equation here are likely to occur. In particular, there is a result of Douet, which would be important for us, that states that in every dimension larger than four, except dimension six, which is a bit specific. Except dimension 6, which is a bit specific. If you assume that the potential h epsilon converges to a limit that never touches the geometric threshold, so here I mean that the limit h of x is never equal to the Yamaid potential x, well then every finite energy sequence of solutions is uniformly bounded in n infinity. Okay, so another way to say this is that if you want to see bubbling solutions here, if you want to see blowing up finite energy solutions, then you're limited. Finite energy solutions, then you're limiting potential H as to touch the geometric MRV potential somewhere. I should also mention in dimension three, compactness results for this family of equations have been obtained by Li and Zhu. And well, the situation is a bit different in dimension three, so I won't go into details there, but there is another quantity which is involved, which is the mass of the operator here that has to be positive in order to recover some compactness result. But we will mostly be interested in. But we will mostly be interested in large dimensions. And I'm interested here in some sort of converse of Double's result. And I wonder in the case where our potentials converge to the Yamabi1, well, does blow-up occur? And most precisely, which blow-up configurations can occur? So for the sake of simplicity, just not to consider generic potential, I will restrict to a specific case in the following rest of my talk, which will be the following one. So this is... Following one. Okay, so this is a simple time model, but that captures everything that is going on at the level of the block configurations. So from now on, I will assume that my function h epsilon is just the Yamabi potential plus a perturbation, so just plus epsilon, as epsilon goes to zero. And this is the equation that I'm considering in the rest of my talk. And as it turns out, for this equation here, when h epsilon is this form, it's positive is staying wai. Esposito, Pistoy, and Betois have shown that, well, as soon as your potential has this form here, then there are sequences of solutions that blow up. Okay, so they've constructed sequences of solutions that blow up with a zero limit and that blow up as finitely many isolated concentration points. So what does it mean? If we go back to the Schruve decomposition that we had before, it means that the solutions of expositopistry and bit one look like the sum of finite sum of a finite number of bubbling profiles up to first order term. Okay, sorry, you use not should be zero here. And when I say that they blow up at isolated concentration point, it means that if you look at the respective distances between the centers of these bubbles, they're all positive, right? So they are bounded from below by some positive constant, which doesn't depend on epsilon. So you should really think of concentration points being isolated from each other. And from each other. And it turns out that when you're looking at this equation here, so when you're thinking the other way around, and you're trying to understand what happens at the level of compactness results, for instance, there's nothing that guarantees you that concentration points will be isolated. So in general, whenever you're tackling these kinds of equations, you have to make sure that you take into account every possible configuration. So in general, concentration points are not isolated, there is bubble accumulation, and so on. And so it's pretty interesting in general to try to understand which To understand which bubbling configurations can occur and under which conditions. And in general, you can expect any bubble configuration to occur under this blow-up, but you realize that some of them are most more interesting in a way, always in terms of a toy model that tries to capture what is going on. And for us, two kinds of configurations will be of particular interest. So, what I will call respectively clustering configurations and towering configurations. Okay, so here's a quick picture. Okay, so here's a quick picture of them. So, what I call a clustering configuration is the case in which I have several bubbles, so several bubbling profiles centered at points which all converge to the same point and that concentrate with the same speed. So the parameters mu i epsilon in the description of the bubbles are sort of all equivalent in a way as they go to zero. Okay, so you shouldn't really think of some bubbles clustering towards a point. Bubbles clustering towards a point. And the other one would be the so-called towering configuration, where I'm putting bubbles over bubbles. Okay, so you should really think that again, all the bubbles converge to the same center, but the orange one concentrates much faster than the red one, and the green one concentrates much faster than the orange one. What does it mean in terms of analytical terms? It means that the parameters that define the bubbles go to zero much faster, much faster one with respect to the other. Okay, so that's the that's the So, that's the idea. And today, we'll mostly be interested in the towering configuration. Because it turns out that when you're looking at clusters, the picture is almost complete in a way. So, Robert and Vétois and Pistoy and Dyla have constructed instances of such clustering behavior when the manifold is non-locally conformally flat. So, as you will see later on, there are technical assumptions come into play. In dimension 4 and 5, In dimension four and five, Tizi and Vetois have constructed sort of an analog of these results. And this sort of sums up the picture for clustering configurations in a way. And I should say that in a recent paper, Robel and Betois have found sort of existence of blow-up solutions, one bubble once in the case of more general potential. So this gives a bit more perspective on the condition under which this can happen. Happen. But right, we will be mostly interested today in generic in constructing towering configurations. So I will now move to the description, to the statement of my main result. I still have one last technical bit to introduce, which is the definition of what I will call the Riemannian mass, which will be a key ingredient in my proof. So I will recall a few facts which are pretty well known from the theory around Yamabi equations and so on. The theory around Yamabi equations and so on. So, let me recall that I'm working on a closed Riemannian manifold, compact without boundary, and I will always assume that the Yamabi operator is coercive. Okay, so this is the Yamabi operator, the Laplacian plus this geometric Yamabi potential, and I will assume that this is positive. So, this is the case in manifolds, which are usually called of positive Yamabi type, and so on. And it's well known that in this case, this operator possesses a positive green function. Okay, so this green function, which I call g of x. Okay, so this green function which I call g of xy is the distributional solution to the following equation. The Yamabi operator applied to g is equal to the direct delta at x. And it's also well known that at first order, since this is a geometric equation, the green function behaves like the Euclidean one. But there is a very important result, which goes back to Shenyao, that gives a bit more information in the case where the manifold is locally conformally flat. flat. So if my manifold is locally conformally flat around some point x, what does this mean? It means that up to a conformal change of metric, so up to multiplying your metric g by some function which I call lambda x, you get a metric which is flat. It turns out, without going into the details, that this operator here, the yamab1, is conformally invariant in such a way. And what Cheyenne Yao proved is that in the case where your manifold is of positive mab1111, Where your manifold is of positive TMAB type and is locally conformally flat, around a given point x, your green function expands just like the Euclidean one, up to a lower order. Okay, so more precisely, the green function of the conformal flat metric behaves at first order as the Euclidean green function. So it's one over n minus two times the area of the standard sphere times the distance. Standard sphere times the distance from the two points at the power 2 minus n. So if you had the absolute value, this would just be the Euclidean green function. And the perturbation from the geometry comes at a very low order, and it comes in the form of a constant here. So this constant mg of x is what is called the Riemannian mass at x. So locally, the difference between geometry and being plainly Euclidean space comes under the form of this constant here, which smoothly depends on the point x, and which is On the point x, and which is just a real number. And what Chain and Neu proved is that unless you're working exactly on the standard sphere, which from the level of conformal geometry is just a credence place, then this additional constant here that appears at a lower order in the development of your green function is positive everywhere. So it's really positive at any point of your manifold x. Okay, so this will be important for us here. And for those of you which are used to working with For those of you which are used to working with similar problems in Euclidean space, you should know that there is a crucial difference, because in Euclidean space, this is what would be called probably the Robbins function. Again, the constant appearing in the expansion of the Green function. And in Euclidean space, in bounded open sets of our n, say, it will be negative. Okay, so this is a crucial difference here. Geometry turns the sign of this constant positive here. Okay, so what is the main result? What is the main result I want to prove here today? It's a result which states that on large dimensions I can build up configurations of towers of bubbles on a locally conformally flat manifold. Okay, so more precisely, I'm working on a locally conformally flat manifold of dimension larger than seven. This is necessary, as we shall see in a second, which is a positive Yababi type and which is not, conformally speaking, the standard sphere. I'm working I'm working, I'm letting psi naught be a non-degenerate critical point of this mass function. So, of this function which appeared at a lower order in the expansion of the green function. Then what I claim is that if I look at the equation of being considering since the beginning of my talk, of this perturbed MABI equation, I can always find a family of positive solutions u epsilon that blow up with a finite but arbitrary number of bubbles at the point xi naught, and that really blow up. point xi naught, and it really blow up like a towering blow-up point. Okay, so if I look at my function pointwise, my function looks like the superposition of a k bubble concentrating much faster each one than the previous one, that really looked like this towering phenomena that I described before. Okay, and yeah, I will show you a picture in a second to see what is going on. Okay, and I just for the sake of it, I should. I just for the sake of it, I should mention that there is nothing specific about the epsilon here. One should take a bit more general perturbation. So one is allowed to take epsilon times a given function f, for instance. And in this case, you can still get really the same results with concentration points occurring at zeros with non-zero degree of some reduced function involving f and the Riemannian mass. Okay, so this is just a Mass. Okay, so this is just a technical assumption. Okay, right, so there are a few remarks I want to do on this theorem and then we'll move on to the proof. The first one being about the dimension. So yeah, the dimension restriction is necessary. So this theorem only works in dimension larger than 7, but in lower dimensions up to 6, these towering configurations of bubbles, upper bubbles, don't exist. Don't exist. And this is by the techniques, by the point-wise techniques developed like in the way. One way to see this is the following one: is to say that for this family of Yamabi-type equations, as the dimension grows, the interaction between different bubbling profiles become weaker and weaker. So in a way, in low dimensions, the interaction between different bubbles are too strong, and by this I mean too constraining, too rigid. Too rigid. And this prevents you from really constructing solutions looking like superpositions of boundaries. And starting from dimension seven, interactions become less constraining, and you're allowed to have the freedom to build such solutions here. But in any case, the restriction of the dimension is necessary. And the main point of this theorem here is that there is no symmetry assumption imposed on them. And there was a previous result about the construction of tables of bubbles. Of towers of bubbles, nice result by Morabi-Topistoy and Vaira that build towers of bubbles on symmetric manifolds, non-locally conformally flat one, but symmetrics, symmetric with respect to a point. And here the main difference in this work is that we're not assuming any symmetry here. So we're working the general case of an inhomogeneous manifold. And actually, this forces us to work at a much higher precision. Okay, and this is one of the main difficulties in this work, as you shall see in a second. As you shall see in a second, it forces us to have to prove estimates at a quite high order. And the fact that we're concentrating our solutions to a critical point of the mass is also necessary. So it follows from the technique of Louis and also from the techniques by Curie, Marques and Chain involved in the proof of the compactness of the Yamabi equation that if you have a tower of bubbles for such equations in large dimensions, they will concentrate to a They will concentrate to a critical point of the mass. And of course, the other way around, if you want to construct sequences of blowing up solutions, well, assuming some non-degeneracy on your critical point is a very mild assumption, which is generic in G, which makes sense. And just to give you an idea of what is going on at the geometric level, so this is what the solutions that I'm constructing look like. So if you think to this equation by If you think to this equation by analogy with the Yamabe equation, you can look at the conformal metrics that this equation originates. So you can look at the metric given by u epsilon to the power of 4 divided by n minus 2 times g. This is a conformal metric to the metric g. And having k bubbles superposed blowing up one faster than the other sort of amounts to produce a manifold that for this matrix here looked like a connected sum of Look like a connected sum of k-spheres. Okay, so the first sphere would be given by the lowest bubble concentrating, then on top of this one, the second bubble would amount to gluing a second sphere, and this shaded red region here, which really shrinks at the geometric level, so its which goes to zero, would be the gluing region, and so on. Okay, so this is an instance of what is called a bubble tree sometimes, but you should really keep in mind that in a way, for this family of matrix G here, you're For this family of matrix G, here your manifolds at the limit converge to K, a connected sum of K spheres. So, this is the idea. Right, so if you have no questions so far, in the last 12-13 minutes, I will move on to the sketch of the proof of this theorem. And well, the proof of this theorem is a constructive result, and the proof is constructive. And the point here lies. The point here lies in the variant on the approach. So let me start by maybe very simply giving an idea, an overview of the proof. So this is an idea which is by now pretty standard geometric analysis. So what is the idea? The idea is to start with an approximate solution that really looks like a tower of bubbles. Okay, so I'm going to pick an integer k. I'm going to pick k sequences of positive real numbers going to zero. So these are the concentration parameters. Going to zero, these are the concentration parameters. I'm going to pick k sequences of centers all converging to the same point. And I want to make sure that every concentration parameter is much smaller compared to the previous one. Okay, so I'm really thinking of this sum of bubbles here as a tower of bubbles, just like in the picture I drew before. So each one is concentrating at a faster speed than the previous one. So what is the idea now? The idea is that if you just look at the sum of the cables, At the sum of the k bubbles, well, this is almost a solution of the equation I'm interested in, right? And you can look at this, you can compute explicitly error, and you can say that it is small in some norm. So now the idea, the very simple idea, is that if you add something to this profile, to this anzat, if you add a remainder phi epsilon that you expect to be small, well, you've got a, and if you're lucky enough, there's probably a way to make sure that by picking suitable. Make sure that by picking suitably the remainder as well as by picking suitably the parameters of your construction, you can make sure that this whole thing here ends up being an actual solution of the equation you're interested in. And it turns out that if you want to do this, there is actually a machinery which has been developed in the last one year, which is by now pretty standard and that works quite well to produce you at least an approximate solution of the equation you're trying to solve. Okay, so there is a standard technique. So, there is a standard technique which is called the Leopold-Schmidt technique or the finite dimensional reduction techniques, which provides you with a canonical choice of a remainder in an energy space H1, such that when you look at the sum of bubbles plus this remainder, it almost solves the equation, the Yamabi equation with an epsilon here. And by almost, I mean that it solves the equation up to some order terms on the right-hand side. So these are these blue order terms. And what are they exactly? Well, they are some coefficients. Well, they are some coefficients lambda ij, depending on the parameters of my construction, multiplied by these functions z hat. And what are these functions? These functions are duals of the elements of the linearized Yamabi equation at my profile, sum of bi epsilon. So there is really nothing mysterious here. All I'm doing here is actually writing down some sort of inverse function theorem outside of the kernel. Theorem outside of the kernel. So basically, I'm saying that if you linearize the Yamabi equation, and so the linearized operator becomes invertible outside of its kernel, and then you can run some sort of nonlinear fixed point theorem outside of the kernel so as to get a solution of the nonlinear Devabe equation. And of course, by some very easy fret-on properties, you're left with kernel elements on the right-hand side. And the whole idea of the construction is to make sure that you can make this blue term here on the right. You can make this blue term here on the right-hand side vanish. And since we're running an inverse function theorem in energy space, this canonical remainder phi here comes with explicit bounds. So in particular, you know that the h1 norm of this remainder here is small and it's quantified and it's actually less than some integer norm of the error. So my quantity r epsilon here is just the error that the approximate solution given by the sum of the bubble. Given by the sum of the bubble makes when you test it to being a solution of the equation, right? So it's just the Yamabi equation applied to the sum of bubbles. And of course, you can expect, and you can check it, that the L 2n divided by n plus the norm of this error term goes to zero. So in the end, what you get here is really something that respects a Schubert decomposition because it's something which is small in the energy space. Okay, so this is the idea. Okay, so this is the idea. And once you have all this in mind, well, the idea of the proof is to make sure that you can find the specific value of your parameters so that the coefficients here on the right-hand side are annihilated and so that the blue term vanishes and you're on the left with an actual solution. So it's quite complicated here to cite all the people that contributed to this, but I should say that in the following form that I'm using here, probably the Probably the reference I was the most inspired from were Ray, Ray Wei, and Androsetti Malchiodi. Okay, so it all worked around this equation here. So far so good. The point here is that since we're trying to work with a specific configuration of towering bubbles, well, this is not enough. And it's not enough because this H1 estimate doesn't quite capture the interactions at hand. Capture the interactions at hand here. Okay, so this simple energy estimate, which is all that you get by the nonlinear method in H1, doesn't capture what is going on at the point-wave level. And it's not accurate enough to perform an expansion of the kernel elements that I want to annihilate. And why is it so? Well, it's probably, I'm going to give you a proof by picture. The idea is that since we're working in a situation where you've got bubbles over bubbles concentrating much faster and accumulating. Concentrating much faster and accumulating, and you can have any number of bubbles finitely at any. Well, it turns out that the higher you go on the bubble tree, the higher the precision of your computation becomes. But if you're looking at this error here, this error is just the error made by your sum of bubbles to satisfy the equation. And actually, it turns out that since B1 is not an exact solution of the equation, well, in this error term here, R1, you have In this error term here, L1, you have some errors left due to the lowest bubble, and then you've got some error left due to the mutual interactions of all the bubbles. And it turns out that whatever happens, the precision of this error term r epsilon here is always limited in way or in the other by the lowest bubble. So the higher you go in the bubble tree, well, you reach a point where the precision of this estimate here is really not accurate enough to be able to make all the computations that you want. The computations that you want. And I should mention that this is really unrelated to the way you choose your bubble. You can pick your bubbles to be as precise as you want. You can pick them to be almost solution of the equation you want to solve. But this is not related to the precision of each bubble. It's related to the fact that even at the point-wave level, bubbles interact with each other really in these sort of gluing regions here. And you need to follow the precision of all the The precision of all these growing regions. So, what is basically what I'm saying here is that the problem here comes from the point-wise interaction of the bubbles in their mutual glowing region that happens at a very high precision. And if you're just working with integral norms, there is no way you can capture this. So, what is the solution to this? Well, the solution is working with a bit more precision and working at the point-width level and trying to obtain a sharp point. Trying to obtain a sharp point-wise estimates for the remainder. So, trying to improve the H1 control that comes from standard Leopold Schmidt techniques into much more precise, accurate point-wise estimates. So I'm going to state this as a preposition and then I'm going to comment on this. There will be estimates which I won't really comment because I don't really have the time to go into the details. But let me state my main technical reasons. My domain technical result in the following way. So I'm looking at the linearized equation of the Amabe equation at my approximate solution. So here what is on the left hand side, I just really, so the linear part doesn't change, and I just linearize on a linear part at the, at what I expect to be my approximate solution. On the right-hand side, I just put the error term, which is error term which is which is of this of this approximate solution and I'm considering phi epsilon a solution of this equation up to kernel elements again okay then what I'm saying is that I can get precise estimates on this phi epsilon here at each scale in the bubble tree okay and these estimates depend on the pointwise precision of the error term and they are very accurate so here the error term is really the error of the approximate solution Really, the error of the approximate solution to being a solution of the MAB equation. Okay, so I'm going to write down one estimate, then comment on it. What am I saying here? See, I'm working on some another region. So what I called A L L plus 1 here, without going into the details, is a difference of two bubbles. And it's basically the region in which the bubble number L is dominant in my bubble tree. Inside this small ball, the bubble on top of it becomes dominant. Outside of this large bubble, It becomes dominant outside of this large bowl, it's the bubble below becomes dominant. And what I'm saying is that in each one of these influence regions of each bubble, well, I can get very accurate estimates on my remainder, pointwise ones really, which, as you see, involve the distance from the center of the bubble number L, but they also involve interactions with the higher bubbles, this is the bubble L plus one, and they involve interactions with the lower bubbles. Involve interactions with the lower bubbles. So something is hidden here, but this would represent, for instance, the interaction with the lower bubble. So this probably doesn't really, if you're not used to this question, it doesn't really say what is going on. So by rephrasing a little bit, by skipping the technical details, what is going on here is that I'm just saying that if you look at the solution of the linearized Yamabi equation at the sum of the bubbles, which is your approximate solution, and Is your approximate solution, and for a right-hand side, which is given by the error of this approximate solution? Well, then, what I'm saying is that a solution of this errorized equation behaves in every way as if it satisfied a much simpler equation. So what I'm saying is that when it comes to point-wise estimates, your solution phi epsilon here behaves as it solved an equation, where you got rid of everything, when you got rid of this non-linear term, which is sort of the involved term coming from the linearization of the critical power. Coming from the linearization of the critical power, and where you also got rid of these kernel elements, because anyway, during the course of the proof, you end up estimating these elements and you end up realizing that they are actually very small. So, what I'm saying here is just a sort of pointwise version of the classical H1 reduction results that say that the precision that you have in your error turns defines the precision that you get in your remainder. But now, what I'm saying is. Remainder, but now what I'm saying here is that it still remains true at a pointwise level. Okay, so it has to be as a pointwise improvement of the classical H1 theory. Again, another way to see this is to say that by working hard enough, you can make sure that the point-wise estimates that you get on your remainder are the same ones that you would get if you just plugged the error epsilon into a Green's function, into a representation formula, and you estimated what you get. Okay, so this is really. What you get. So, this is really the point-wise counterpart: this idea that the precision of r epsilon determines the precision of the error and so on. And recently, a similar kind of estimates, so similar sharp estimates for a linearized equation have been obtained in the case of the Euclidean case by Deng Sun and Wei. And yeah, I should say that once you get this on the linear equation, This is on the linear equation, as always, things automatically follow from the non-linear problem. Okay, so once you've got this on solution to your linear equation, you recover the same thing for the non-linear equation. It's always the same thing, right? As soon as when you have blow-up, you can look at your non-linear equation as a perturbation from the linear one, and everything follows. And in particular, the idea here is that if you proceed in this way, actually, this technique allows you to recover a priori estimates. A priori estimates. So, even if you're just looking at an a priori solution of this equation and not if you're running a constructive method. Right, so I wanted to give you a hint of the proof of this proposition, but I'm just going to skip because I won't have enough time. The idea is just it's an induction process in the bubble tree. So you start from the highest bubble, you sort of get some estimates in your remainder that are obtained by representation form. That are obtained by representation formula and so on. And you're managing a way to propagate these estimates all the way down the bubble tree by actually tracking down all the quantities which are involved during all the process. So you sort of push down your estimate, you propagate them down to the lowest bubble, by still keeping tracks of everything which is happening at each step. There's a self improving argument in the end, which allows you to estimate some of the quantities and then come back to the desired precision. Come back to the desired precision until the top of the barometer. And what you get in the end when you run this thing, so just kind of describe the last part of the proof, the last step. So when you improve actually these estimates and your remainder by in the way that I did, by the thing that I described, you end up having a solution of your Gammabi equation, still up to the same blue error terms than before, but it now comes with Now comes with very precise estimates on your remainder here. Now it turns out that on these sharp estimates in your remainder, you can actually estimate each one of these coefficients here, and you can perform some expansion of them. You can make sure that they are annihilated in the end. So I'm just going to give you two examples of the sort of expansions that you get, maybe to give you an idea of what is going on, and in particular to explain where the mass comes from. comes from. So this right hand side, on this blue term here on the right hand side, see there is a sum over i's and j's and each i corresponds to a bubble and so for each one of these bubbles you've got n plus one kernel elements. And for instance, so each of these coefficients lambda i here corresponds to a possible deformation of your bubble. And for the lowest bubble, if you look at the coefficients that correspond to deformations Deformations of the position of the center, so the degrees of freedom given by imposing your center on the manifold, well, you can find that they involve the mass. So for instance, the kernel coefficients along the lowest bubble come as a sequence which is close to zero times the gradient of your mass function here. And so what you really want to do is make sure that you're concentrating at a point where this At a point where this the gradient of the mass has a zero, which has a non-zero degree, for instance, to make sure that up to a perturbation in C0 you will get a point. And for instance, the condition of the non-degeneracy of critical points of the mass. So this is just to show you what is going on here and how this geometry condition is coming into play. Okay, and I think that I'm a little bit over time, so I will stop here and thanking you for. And thanking you for your attention. Thank you, Bruno, for your talk. Are there any questions or comments about this? Yes, Bruno, thank you very much for your nice talk. Do you think you could add a non-degenerate weak limit to the Tower of Babel? Yeah, sure, sure. So you could run the same thing here. Same thing here. Say, you could obtain an analog of this proposition here by adding a non-degenerate weak limit, for sure. Now, about whether you could conclude the construction, I would say yes, but I haven't checked it. So roughly speaking, at the very end, so sorry here, the generator will limit what comes into play at the very end. And in this sort of towering process, as soon as you can As soon as you can construct the first bubble, you can make sure that then you can glue in the other ones on top of it. Okay, so your degenerate weak limit would appear here in the extension of the lower coefficients along the lowest bubble. So if you can make sure that you can have all the quantities interact together, you're probably likely to succeed. Yeah, it will probably be true only starting from higher dimensions. Only starting from higher dimensions. So, probably starting dimension 10 or 11 or so. Yes. Yeah. But it's just, you know. Again, this. And another extension I'm thinking of. So if you consider the case of a general potential that would touch the scalar curvature at order one non-degenerate critical point, so you have a mass associated with this potential. And then do you expect? Then, do you expect that it could work under this context? Probably, then you can, it might depend on the sign of the mass. I understand well, when you have mass negative, you have a construction of sign-changing solution. When you have mass positive, you have a construction of positive solution. Yeah, exactly. I didn't mention this, but this is what happens here. So, but your idea of if you have a potential touching the mass at first order, sorry, sorry, touching the scalar curvature at first order here, you only have a Adverse order here, you only have a mass in small dimensions, right? Or four or five, or something like this. So you don't know if, yeah. I mean, if you are sufficiently flat, yes, if I don't know if you have no curvature term, but only the edge, if it touches sufficiently, if it touches the scalar curvature at a sufficiently high order, you will end up getting a mass. Yes, yes. Will end up getting a mask, yes, yes, yes, that's what I think. But then, if you need a non-degeneracy, then that might not be in conflict with this high-order vanishing of the potential. I don't know. Yeah, this is true. But at least, let's say, formally, at least, if you have a mass and if you have a potential touching the skeletal vasure sufficiently high order so that your mass is defined, you're likely to recover the. Is defined, you're likely to recover the same mass here. Yes, yes, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. More questions? I have a naive question. So this is Rupert Frank. I'm trying to understand this pointwise bound, or why you were emphasizing the pointwise bound compared to the H1 bound. So, what would happen? So, two questions. How about you? How about you would prove an H1 bound, but in these annuli? Right? I mean, not a global H1, but do it in the annuli. So, number one, question number one, would this give you the result? Would this be good enough? And number two, would this be easier to prove? Right, so there is a, in the previous result there was by Morabi Topistoy and Vaira. Rabbit, Opistoia, and Vira, they proceeded differently, and I think in a fashion that was a bit closer than what you're suggesting here. Because of these problems that they had also in, well, because of this precision due to H1, they were basically using a remainder at each bubble, right? So instead of using one global remainder, they were splitting sort of the remainder in K different remainders. So each one which came at the size of each bubble. And then what they were doing was basically, yes, obtaining an H. Obtaining an H1 bound for each remainder basically in this annular region here. Okay, and so I tried to do this at first here, and I still couldn't work out the things until the end because, so if let me go back to the last slide. So, in the case of Morabito, Piste and Varia, they had symmetry. So, basically, they didn't have to constrain the centers of their bubbles. And it turns out that the That the coefficients here in this expansion, which are associated to the center displacement, so to the n degrees of freedom related to the choice of the center, come at one higher order of precision than just the constraining the eighth. Okay, so roughly speaking, if you look from lambda i0 to lambda ij, see here there is an epsilon mu i squared, while here there is an epsilon mu i cubed. And this is related to the fact that This is related to the fact that sort of your centers are very close to each other. So when you're differentiating, you're increasing the precision and so on. So I couldn't reach this precision even by splitting the norm in H1 terms. So of course, I'm not claiming that it's not possible, but I'm claiming that in the end, I had to sort of resort to this point-wise estimate to get what was going on precisely and conclude by sort of brute force computations. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Right, thank you, thank you. That's interesting, illuminating. Thank you. Good. So if there is no more question, I would thank Bruno again for his interesting talk. Thank you. And now we have a break and we shall start again at 9.25. See you soon. Jiram, are you going to share the next talks, or shall I proceed? What do you prefer? As you prefer, I'm happy to continue from this one or the next one. No problem. Share the next one and then you take over. And then I will do the freelance. Yep, we can do that. Oh, I need to stop the recording. I'm bad with that. I'm bad with that. Stop the recording.
