The mission of my work is some conjectures concerning the action of torsion groups on non-positively curved spaces. Beginning with the question of Swenson whether the infinite torsion groups can act properly and co-compactly on Kaziro spaces. It was recently extended by Damian Piotr and Sierra. Damien, Piotre, and C.K. Norin conjecture that every action of the finite-generated torsional group on the finite-dimensional Kazio complex is elliptic, where elliptic means that there exists a global fixed point. And Damian with Thoma-Hetel actually suggested that maybe that's something that happens for all non-positive decades complexes. And for more than And for more than just torsion groups, and this here as locally elliptic actions, which are actions where every group element has a fixed point. So this mechanical lecture basically says about actions that were defined yesterday by Piotr as descent, I believe. Okay, so as Piot said yesterday, one of the examples of some One of the examples of such cases are trees. That action sold them behave like that. But some other examples, these cases of this meta-conjecture, finite-dimensional catzero cube complexes, localefinite two-dimensional catzero complexes, uniformly localefinite heligraphs, which were defined yesterday by Motiams. I think I can tell you about them, I guess. I guess. Informed finite group of hyperbolic graphs and some real bits. And the motivation for my work was to do it for small cancellation complexes. Page is not done yet, but we try to finish it with Mark Infstein. And trying is the good word. Yeah? Okay. So thankfully we reached the top. Thankfully, we reached the talk, so I won't have to explain everything about small cancellation. I will just add that I'm giving the same definition as Zach was, except I'm adding simply connected, so it's slightly less alive than Zach did. But only slightly. Okay, that's I think the uh pictures are not unnecessary here. Not unnecessary here. Zach already defined CP condition, so it's well he defined it slightly differently. So a state standard version, so we do not have any two-cell which boundary can be covered by fewer than d pieces. Also, in this example that is wrong here, this is C5 because you have only one. Because we have only one internal two-cell, so only one that can be covered by pieces, and there's five of them. But we could add, for example, two two cells like that, and it would only be C4. And unfortunately, no one defined the TQ condition, so I have to tell about it, and I will just tell a lie here. But the definition that is written is correct. So it states that States that it's a complex satisfy sticker condition that there are no reduced disk diagrams with internal vertices of balance between 2 and Q. But I don't want to talk about reduced disk diagrams and everything, so let's just assume that this tells us that every internal vertex well, material, every internal vertex of the complex, when we are looking at the link of this vertex, it Vertex, the embedded cycles are of length 2 or at least Q. For the purpose of this talk, this works, but it's aligned. So the small cancellation conditions give us non-positive curvature if we put C6. Well, technically C6, T3, but it's clearly visible that T3 means nothing. So C6. So C6, C4T4 and C3T6 give us non-positive curvature. C3T6 is not very interesting because it's Kazio. But the other two are the ones that there should be. So some examples. Well, C six is just statistical of plane by hexagons, C forty for steslation by plane by squares. By squares. And the talk is about small cancellation groups, not small cancellation complexes. So, what is small cancellation groups, or rather, a group which is small cancellation presentation as a group which really complex satisfies conditions. And some basic examples. Well, there is for example z squared with standard presentation is c forty four. C44. Since everyone here likes acting groups because we are talking about them all the time, then there are types of acting groups that have C44 presentation. And C6 is, for example, something like that. Okay, so the main result of my work is this version of the meta conjecture for small cancellation complexes. small cancellation complexes. So if we take C X C for T for C F small cancellation complex and take a group acting on it by automorphism, but we add this assumption that the action on the one skeleton is free, then we have this property that the action is decent in the sense that what got defined. So obviously this is significant Obviously, this is significant restriction of the well compared to the conjecture, but even with this restriction, it allows us to get useful results for small cancellation groups because it follows that the torsion subgroups of those groups are finite cycling. Okay, so how it follows from the first theorem? Well, because any subgroup of G acts on complex of G freely on one skeleton. And since H is torsion subgroup, the action is locally active. So we can use here on one. We have a global fixed point. And this global fixed point turns out to be some two cell. And since we have three actions on one skeleton, Three action on one skeleton, and this group is fixing a two cell, then those are basically rotations. So it has to be the final cyclic. I still have like 10 minutes, which is so I can tell a little about the idea of the proof of Fiora Man, uh but I will try to do it only in C for T for testing. Try to do it only in C42. So we actually have three steps of what we are doing. First, we show that every group element actually, well, every non-trivial group element actually fixes exactly one two-cell in a complex. This is uh easy uh stuff to do. Uh we just assume it's not true, take two different two cells uh or the ones that are closest to each other. The ones that are closest to each other, and we showed that something between them has to be fixed as well. And since they were close to each other, because the action was free on a one-skeleton, well, they're closer to each other, so what is fixed has to be in one skeleton, but the action was free on one complex. And after this, we are going to some dual complex of X. Of X called, well, in C44, it's called quadrization. This is something introduced by Nima, and this is an example of his quadric complexes that he was talking about yesterday. I will try to explain it a little in a moment. So we go into this dual and take a vertex that corresponds to this two-some that is fixed by our element. Fixed by our element. And it turns out that there exists some power of this group element that turns, that moves everything in a link of this vertex, in this dual complex, far enough. In this case, far enough means at least two. So not really far, but it's enough. And then it turns out that And then it turns out that if we take such powers for any two elements that do not have a common fixed point, then we can produce an element of infinite order and that element cannot have any fixed point. So some details how it works. So we take our easiest example of C44. Of C44 complex. The quadratization is obtained by taking a vertex, well, building a bipartisan graph where we put vertex for NA two-cell. And another, well, that's one set of vertices. And the other set of vertices are just vertices from our original graph. And we are joining them by edges wherever you have a vertex at the boundary of the two cell. And then we are filling. And then we are filling all four cycles with squares. And the idea here, what we want to obtain our element of infinite order, is to build an axis in this complex. So we are taking two fixed points corresponding to some two servers. So they are distinct, two elements with distinct fixed points. And we take geodesic. And we take geodesic between them. And we want to start extending this geodesic by its images and build the axis. But if we don't move far enough, it won't be geodesic. So that's why we want to move far away. Indeed, it turns out that for this step where we want to find a good k, it's just enough to take one that moves. Just enough to take one that moves everything in our two cell, in a small cancellation complex, as far as possible. And it will work out because if it won't move everything in the quadratization by at least two, then we obtain one of those two cases and we create C4. And then, when we already have Then, when we already have this property that everything in the link is moved far away, then if we take any geodesic in our quadrup complex and well, we take two geodesic, only in one fixed point, and one of them is image of some part of the first one, then such extension is always a geodesic. And with that, That we can just by induction build this geodesic axis and obtain the group element of infinite or okay. I still have time. It's surprising to me. But I'm actually kind of prepared. So what's the difference with C six case compared to C fourteen? So the steps are very similar. The first one is exactly the same. The second one we also go to Second one, we also go to dual, which in this case is nerfed complex. And like qualitation was quadric, this is systolic. And we again want to find some power that moves everything far away. This time far away is free. But it turns out that it's not always happening. It sometimes may happen that we are stuck with. That we are stuck with always the distance is two, and that's when F cubed is identity. And then the third step is exactly the same, but there's additional step at the end that we state with group with where all elements have order free. But it actually turns out that this is a finite group, and because it's portion. With its quotient of repairs length with order free, and that gives us that all fixed points are well, there is a global fixed point. So, some note about the step two in this case is well why the third power sometimes shows up is well even in the easiest example, like here. Like here, where we go to this nerve complex and we take the joint between two points, it might turn out that we only have rotation by 120 degree of this hexagon, and we end with only those options, and we would wouldn't ever be able to extend this to a geologist. But fortunately, that only happens for That only happens for F2 that has ordered f I guess I finished. Other questions? Do you consider infinite represent the small consolidation groups or finite representative? More questions? Is it your birthday today? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Carol, happy birthday to you.
