So I'll be talking about morphological transitions and membranes. I'm a postdoc at the University of Chicago where I work with Aaron Denner and Suri Prince and Auckland. Right, and so how this movie is supposed to be. So we're going to be looking at things like this. So membranes that are growing and sort of changing shape and how we can try to use thermodynamics to say something about how these sorts of processes take place. Okay. Okay, so the plan is: I'm going to start by giving a short background on membranes, which I know none of you probably need. Then I'll talk about how we can think about connecting non-equilibrium driving with the growth dynamics of simple vesicles. And I'll start with a sort of continuum mechanics, linear irreversible thermodynamics perspective, where we make use of a paper from a few years ago. And then we'll do some simple tests and simulations and think a little bit. And think a little bit about stochastic thermodynamics and how that can sort of give us some additional relationships that tie into this continuum mechanics stuff. And then, so once we've thought about growth and driving, we'll think about how driving can affect material properties. So changes in surface tension of the membranes that we're thinking about. And then at the end, hopefully, if I have time, I'll show some future stuff. So the things that we'll definitely be seeing. So, the things that we'll definitely be seeing are these growing vesicles. If we have time, we'll get to dividing dropouts. Right, okay, so membrane dynamics. Biological membranes are amazingly dynamic. Lots of interesting things happen. We know that there's this really important coupling between the mechanics of the membrane. They live in sort of two-dimensional fluids in three-dimensional space. Their morphology, which, because they're so soft and fluid-like, they can change their morphology in really. And change their morphology in really interesting ways. And then, of course, material exchange is incredibly important. So, this image in the upper right is a sea urgent egg that's undergoing cyogenesis. So, if we were to assume that this egg was spherical and it was dividing into two spheres of the same volume as the initial sphere, then the area of the membrane would have to increase by about 25%. So, anytime that this sort of process is happening in cells, This sort of process is happening in cells. There's a really significant exchange of membrane material from the inside to the outside. And this can come from reservoirs or other processes. But it has to happen. And so these aren't just simple static, I guess, membranes, but they're membranes that are growing constantly. Another sort of important process in which growth is essential is in phytocytosis. So if a cell is So if a cell is sort of engulfing other particles or other cells, every time it does that, it's losing a significant portion of its membrane. And then finally, this is just a movie that I think everyone's seen probably 100 times. So this is a familiar character. But I like the sort of membrane images that this movie has. So you can see sort of this complex, fluctuating structure that is, I believe, the Golgi Emperor is a movie. But you can also see these sort of tiny But you can also see these sort of tiny vesicles that are popping out. And yeah, I think it's just a nice way of highlighting what we're thinking about. Great, so that's sort of the current biology and how membranes play a role. There's also some interest in thinking about how the sort of coupling between growth and dynamics affected the development of early cells. So, biology billions of years ago. So, Jack School's X group at the University of So, Jack Show's X Group at the University of Chicago, previously at Harvard, has done some really interesting work where they take GUVs and they place them in a sort of bath of excess lipids in the form of micelles. And these micelles can incorporate in the membrane and sort of cause it to form these sort of large tubular outgrowths. The whole thing can turn into a giant tube. And then, if this thing is sort of put under some external stress by things like a shear, this tube can break into. This tube can break into smaller droplets. And then these can then undergo growth and tube formation and further division. So that's sort of a proposed mechanism of how early cells may have gotten started in dividing, at the very least, as tiny containers that replicate. So, this is just a movie of that happening. It's not super easy to see, but Well, in the movie, it turns into a tube and then splits off into smaller vesicles. Another mechanism that doesn't require this sort of externally affected stress is just simple growth. So they've done more recent work where they've taken, again, vesicles, GUVs, placed them in a bath with micelles, and they showed that if the rate of growth is sufficiently fast, they can get division. They can get division that's just driven by the morphological changes of the vesicles. The vesicles grow really quickly, they start to buckle and bend, and eventually smaller vesicles will sort of pinch up. This is a movie of that. Great. So, this sort of thing is what we're going to be thinking about. We have sort of one driving force, which is the growth, and we want to know how. Want to know how these sort of crazy morphological changes can happen. A really nice experimental example that sort of couples these ideas to mechanics is from this paper from 2006 by Patricia Bassaro's group, where they took GUVs with a positive surface charge and placed them in a bath of SUVs, so small even luminal vesicles. You'll notice the length scale is very, very, very different. Is very, very different. These are 50 to 100 nanometers, these are 10 to 50 microns. And these length scales are very different from the one you may be familiar with with SEDs. So that's how we're thinking about them. Right, but so they see sort of a similar thing to what we saw in the SHISTAC videos, where you have growth and you get this sort of crazy output. But what I think is really nice about this paper is they use this sort of well-known technique where you can A well-known technique where you can use video microscopy to measure the contour fluctuations of a vesicle, and they extracted a valuable surface tension as a function of time after they added the GV to the bath of XS bubbility. So this is what they see. So the tension is on the y-axis. Time after injection is on the x-axis. So zero is somewhere over here. They add the GUV to the SUVs, and the tension starts out. And the tension starts out relatively constant, and then as soon as the parameter starts to grow, the tension drops off precipitously. So, this is a log scale. They essentially say that the tension becomes negative. And that kind of conceptually makes sense. If you have a negative surface tension, then your growth is sort of pushing out the membrane instead of sort of pulling in like regular surface tension would be expected to. So, we'd like to. So, we'd like to, for our purposes, we'd like to answer the sort of question: can we say anything about trade-offs between morphologies, these crazy buckling scenarios, and the material properties and how these are related to driving forces that are sort of pushing this process forward? Right, so the scenario we're thinking about is we have a vesicle and we have material that's sort of being incorporated and being removed from the vesicle. So, what kind of So, what kind of theory can we write now for this situation? We know from just simple linear irreversible thermodynamics that we can write the entry production as the sum of products of generalized forces and fluxes. So, if we're close enough to equilibrium, we can then say that these fluxes are a sum of products of forces, so a linear combination of forces with these generalized conductances, LKJ. L j. Conversely, you can write the forces in terms of fluxes in a similar way where the matrix is just inverted. And we know from Ansar's papers in the 40s and 50s that these coefficients have to be, the matrices are symmetric. So Lij is equal to Lji. So this act kind of gives us some extra information that we can use in addition to what we already know from conservation of mass. Already know from conservation of mass, conservation of energy, momentum to try to simplify the description that we have of the system. So you can use these sorts of things to come up with, for example, constituting relations that you can then make predictions about how a system like this will evolve. Right, so there's this really beautiful paper from 2017 by Frank Bueliber and Salbro, where they took They took this sort of linear reversible thermodynamics idea and they applied it to a general fluid surface in three dimensions. So this is kind of a complicated thing to do because surfaces in three dimensions can take on all sorts of shapes. So you need to make use of differential geometry. And this they've done really, really nicely in this paper. So the sort of basic toolbox from differential geometry that you'll see later in the slide is that we have Later in the slide, is that we have some surface that we're defining in terms of two parameters. We can define a local basis in terms of the tangent basis vectors, the formal vector. And then we get from this, at each point on the surface, some value of the metric tensor and the curvature tensor. We can also, so we're assuming that our surface is made up of materials, so we have a velocity at each point on the surface that we can write in terms of these basis vectors. And we can define a strain rate. And then we can further define the rate of change and curvature and all sorts of things. So, what they did in this paper is they took these, in the framework of this sort of differential geometry way of looking at things, they wrote out the concentration of mass, the variation of free energy, and the force and torque balance for a simple fluid surface. And they showed. And they show that you can get a sort of expression for the entropy correction rate in terms of a set of forces and fluxes, which is what we expect. That is, where the forces and fluxes are things that look like the stress times the strain rate. Here, Tijd is the non-equilibrium part of the in-plane stresses. So we have some in-plane stress tensor-like thing, which is actually the in-plane tension tensor, and we're subtracting off the value. And we're subtracting off the value that we would have at equilibrium. So if we're out of equilibrium, this force is not zero. And the Bij is the corresponding flux. And then these other ones are sort of other things that you have to consider for these two-dimensional 3D. So Bij is the curvature tensor. This is the co-rotational derivative of the curvature tensor. And then M is the non-equilibrium part of the end plane, the mean moment tensor. But the really important pair of forces and fluxes for our purpose. Of forces and fluxes for our purposes. And this is a little bit different from what they had in the paper. We have a driving force that is this difference in chemical potential between the bath, the sort of reservoir that we're imagining, and our membrane. And then Jn is the flux of particles into our membrane. So what's sort of cool is we can take, using the sort of conservation of mass, the continuity equation, we can rewrite this, sort of wrap this chemical. Sort of wrap this chemical potential driving term into the force that comes from the stress tensor. So here we have this sort of combined thermodynamic force and the corresponding flux is the strain rate tensor. Right, so then we can kind of go through the process that they lay out in the paper, write the forces in terms of the fluxes, apply what we know about the About the Ontario's relations, the in-plane rotational symmetry of the surfaces versus assuming it's a fluid. You can sort of simplify the expression for this force in terms of the various fluxes into this very simple expression, which is just relating the force to the, this is its sort of dilatational viscosity, times the trace of the strain rate tensor times the contravariant punching tensor. Uh times the contravariant tensor. Um and you get additional expressions for the uh pending moment uh forces uh that sort of thing. Is that can I ask the question? Yes, so uh you're uh so you have continuity here, so you're looking at the strain on the surface of the lactosome, but you're you're saying that you're conserving max while the SUVs are fusing to the GUV? No, so yeah, what we're I'm yeah, the picture that I showed wasn't a great uh illustration. Wasn't a great illustration, I guess. So I'm imagining that I have just a surface and there's material that's moving in. So at each patch in the surface, there's some flux of material. And we're assuming compressibility, so you can relate a flux of material into the strain, the trace of the strain rate sensor. Does that make sense? Yeah. There's no hardware flux listed in the middle. Right. Well, so I mean, the flux, there's some value of, I guess, the flux in, so for a patch, there's flux in, and then there can be outward flux into the rest of the membrane, I guess. But yeah, you're right. I shouldn't have, I suppose, showed the, I'm always assuming that the path, the reservoir, is at a higher concentration than the membrane. And do you have to prove that you have linear relationships between the forces and the membrane? So that's. Um so that's I my understanding of w of the sort of procedure here is that you assume that if you're sufficiently close to equilibrium, then you you will have a linear relationship to the horses and forces. And that's something that we can, I mean, yeah, we have to assume that we're pretty close to equilibrium, but then we can test that in simulations. So we get, we can sort of rewrite this if we If we assume that we're sufficiently close to equilibrium, that this sort of tension part vanishes, as just a simple little expression relating the excess chemical potential to the rate of change in the number of particles in the membrane, essentially. And this will be useful when we look at simulations. But you'll notice that we have this KT over D here, where D is the sort of product of area, concentration, and our viscosity. Of our viscosity. This is, it turns out, the diffusion constant for the number of particles in the membrane. So, right, so this is sort of giving us a relationship between our driving force and the flux of particles in, and also saying something about their fluctuations. Right. Okay, so we'd like to test this in these relations. We use this sort of We use this sort of simple triangulated membrane model that people have been using for a while. This is Vivikoffer and Kroll. So we have some surface, we triangulate it, and then we can calculate the energy as the sum of the number of terms that depend on the shape of the membrane, the relative positions of the vertices. So we have this bending energy that's just the Helfrich Hamiltonian. For vesicles, this Gaussian. For vesicles, this Gaussian curvature term is negligible. We have a tether energy that is essentially just, it keeps the vertices close but not too close, and keeps them far enough, but not too far. So it's essentially something that is used to make sure that this thing acts as an incompressible surface, at least in plane. And then we have an additional area conservation term that sort of Term that sort of does the same thing as the Tether energy, but helps to keep crazy things from happening in the surface. And if we have a closed vesicle, we can add a volume energy term. For the things I'm going to show, we don't use this term, so we have Kb equals zero. But it's it's something that in principle we can have. Um, so how to make sure the global constraint will error at one? So, right, so this is a, it's essentially active, so we're calculating the area of each triangle, and we're defining some reference area that. Oh, the P here is for the individual. Yes, yeah, yeah, so sorry, so this, yeah, T is triangle, this is a sum of our triangles, some of our faces. So we have our system, we have our inner We have our system, we have our energy. Sorry. So, what we do, since we're interested in exchanging material with the reservoir, is grand canonical Monte Carlo. So, we define a set of moves. The first set is just the kind of regular moves that you would use for this sort of model without material exchange. So, you have translation moves where you can sort of move vertices from one place to another. Moods where you can sort of move vertices from one place to another. That gives you, if you don't have anything else, that'll give you just the behavior of a fluctuating elastic sheet. We then add these flip moves that people have been using for a while that give you fluidity. So we sort of propose a flip, accept it with this probability. And if that happens, then you have sort of a new edge here that you didn't have before. And this one's. Here, that you didn't have before, and this one's no longer there. And so, you get sort of forces that kind of move things around. But they, so it's been shown that this is kind of a it you end up with something that acts like a fluid membrane that you can measure the viscosity of and various things. So, we're kind of just assuming that that's an okay model to use. Right, but then the material exchange part comes in by adding and removing braces. So, this sort of move here. This sort of move here, we have what's called an edge collapse. So we take the center edge and collapse it into one vertex. And we can do the inverse where we take the one vertex in the center and split it into an edge. And there's some complexity about how you should go about retriangulating the surface and stuff, but that's something that people have thought about for a while, and I think it's discussed in this paper. But so here the acceptance probability has this additional Additional contribution that comes from the chemical potential. So, as we change the chemical potential, these sort of addition or removal moves will be more or less likely. Right, so we define a chemical potential that sets the relative chemical potential of the reservoir, and then we start our simulation after sort of cooler grading without the applied chemical potential. And what we see is that the number of vertices, as you would expect, sort of fluctuates. You would expect sort of fluctuates. So there are vertices being added and removed. And this is just the it's sort of normalized by the initial value. But you can see in this case, the chemical potential is a little bit higher than the equilibrium value, so you get sort of slow fluctuating growth. And here the x-axis is microlos. Right, so if we don't have any, if we're at the equilibrium value, we just give us a whole fluctuating fluid membrane. But with some change, it's a little bit. But with sorry, exchange is a little bit different. But the net exchange at the equilibrium value is zero. Okay, so right, so we define an excess chemical potential as the difference between the chemical potential that we apply and the equilibrium value, at which there's no net flux of particles into the membrane. If this is relatively small, then you get sort of steady growth. So you'll have a sphere that sort of grows, but it kind of remains a sphere. It fluctuates around. Remains a sphere. It fluctuates around what looks like an equilibrium membrane. If delta mu is really high, then you get something that looks like this, where the membrane undergoes this sort of unstable buckling events. And you can conceptually sort of think about what's happening is the rate at which particles are being added is outpacing the rate at which the sort of elastic properties of the membrane can force the scope back into a To back into a spherical shape. So your surface tension essentially is decreasing as you go farther and farther away from the equilibrium value of the potential. So is this a surface tension, or is it a surface to volume issue? So we're actually, we don't have a volume exchange here. Ah. Yeah. Is that, I mean, is that consistent? Like, do you expect fluid to be able to transfer? Expect fluid to be able to transfer between the inside and outside freely? In a real system? Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, I guess. Depends. But yeah, so this is, we're kind of trying to imagine the simplest possible thing we can do, which is just have one. I see. So your idea is that the rate of increase in surface is basically outpacing the surface relaxation. Outpacing the surface relaxation time. Yes, exactly. So there was a friction in there? No, so this is actually this is Monte Carlo, so there's no actual dynamics, I guess. But the yeah, I mean rate in the Monte Carlo sets up rate, I suppose. In order to get a time, you need to relaxation time, you need some kind of friction in some way. Right, there's no time. So it's, I, I mean, in the sense I mean, in the sense that you can think of running a Monte Carlo trajectory as something proceeding in time, there's some number of steps over which you'd expect some deformation to relax, I guess. If I were to take one thing and... Yeah, it's an implicit friction. I guess so, yeah. The probability for one of those junctions to draw hot. Yes, yeah. So there's a temperature. But yeah. Oh, maybe no, yeah. Oh, maybe no, yeah. I think I see what you're saying, the viscosity, like the in-plane, the flipping type. Or to move the cells around, you have to do a multi-colour step. Yeah. There's a probability for that to happen in each step, isn't it? Yes. Yeah. Um, quick question on the the surface tension. So, I mean, the area is raw. Yes. So the penalty for creating an area is Yes. So that's sort of the tricky thing. So we're thinking, I guess, of an effective surface tension. So you can imagine, I guess what we'll do is take configurations and look at their distribution, look at the, calculate the height fluctuations, and then imagine that we're close to equilibrium, or that we can sort of. Or that we can sort of say the system is at equilibrium with some effective surface tension. And that apparent surface tension decreases. But it's right, the idea of surface tension, I guess, is kind of. Well, yeah, that's like the apparent surface tension decreases. Because what's favorable here is to increase area. A decrease area. Well, I mean, the membrane is still, it still has, you know, a lot of. It still has elasticity, it still wants to relax, but that's sort of competing with the addition of the material. The relative value of those two things, I guess. Sorry, Christoph, the yeah, so the probabilities are pure, I guess. So we, yeah, I mean, we have some probability. It's standard. We have some problem, but it's standard GCMC. Okay, there's an energy penalty and then the chemical potential time. Yeah. But it's allowable, like, so if you're using on SAGROS, you're assuming you're I Yeah, it's the internally. Yeah, it's eternally. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you need to think about that. Talk about it later. Alright, okay. How many are we on time? 14 minutes. Okay, to hard stuff. Okay, thanks. Alright, so just one more question. So the trajectories look something like this. These look very smooth, but they're actually fluctuating. These look very smooth, but they're actually fluctuating. The y-axis is the number of particles divided by the initial value. So we're starting with a sort of quasi-ebelum vesicle and then applying this excess gimpal potential. If the excess is negative, then you have a net outflow of stuff into the reservoir. So in that case, you get what's apparently a very high surface tension, and your vesicle stays sort of super spherical. Vesical stays sort of super spherical. As we increase the excess chemical potential for small values, you get a sort of steady linear growth, which is sort of what you would expect if we're close enough to equilibrium that you have a linear relationship between the thermodynamic force, which is the chemical potential, and the flux, which is the change in the number of particles per time. And then, if we get far enough away from equilibrium, that sort of assumption starts to fail, and that's where you get this really unsatisfactory. Really unstable behavior. So you get this sort of crazy out-of-plane buckling. So we can kind of map this out as a function of the excess chemical potential, just to sort of conceptually see what's going on. So there's this regime of stable growth at low values of the chemical potential, where the vesicle grows sort of as a sphere. So the configurations that you get look like a regular vesicle that just happens to be bigger. Just happens to be bigger than it was before. But when you get far enough away from equilibrium, you start to see consequences of this dramatic non-equilibrium growth. Okay, so right, so we can calculate the, we do an ensemble of trajectory, and we can calculate the average rate of growth as a function of excess chemical potentials, so we get this sort of linear relationship. Or we can then calculate the ifysippi, which is the variance. Which is the variance of the change in the number of particles divided by twice the time of the simulation. And we see that this is sort of a constant value for low chemical potential close to equilibrium. And then as we get sufficiently far, it starts to change. And this, of course, is a little bit funny trying to calculate what the growth rate is for these sorts of things, which is why. For these sorts of things, which is why you, I mean, when you have a nonlinear curve, it's sort of, I guess you see the effects of that here. Right, but going back to what we said earlier, we have this relationship between our driving force. If we are assuming the continuum mechanics approach that Uliker wrote out, and the relationship between the driving force and then our flux. And we can. And we can we show that we can rewrite that as delta mu is kT over d times the rate of growth. And if we, so if we divide this by this and plot it as a function of delta mu, we see that at low values of the chemical potential, close to the equilibrium value, this relationship is satisfied. And then as we get farther and farther away, you start to get pretty significant deviation. So it sort of drops off. Deviation. So it sort of drops off. Right, so that's the regime that we're sort of, it's unclear what's going on, but we're thinking about a little bit more now. Right. So yeah. So are you guys interested in having these kinds of instabilities then go into tombs? Yes. I mean, because then you need like an additional time scale. If you arrested the If you arrested the volume, then one way to relax that surface would be to protrude too. Right? So is that something that you guys are, does that make sense as a strategy to go forward? See what I'm saying? Like, if you keep the volume fixed and this thing has too much surface area, it could just smooth things out by protruding tubes and getting rid of that material. Yeah, yeah. So I. Yeah, yeah. So we haven't done that yet with the 3D stuff. I'll show a little bit in the 2D where we started. I mean, where we have additional constraints, I guess. If we were modeling a real system, we would want to have some volume constraint or something that resists changes in volume to think about the flux in and out. But we just haven't, because we haven't done it here, I guess. But yeah, that would be interesting. Okay. So the So the other approach that I mentioned was sort of led by its grad student, Michael, who's a student of Ceres. And what they did is they imagined that you have a sort of ring polymer that has additional removal. We have an excess chemical potential again. You can take the configurations and look at the height fluctuations and sort of calculate an effective energy. If you assume that you have this kind of Helfrich-like Hamiltonian. like Hamiltonian. And so for this sort of system, if we measure, if we want to think about the growth, the rate of intro reproduction, we can express it as the sum of the intro reproduction of the system and the environment. The second law says that it has to be greater than zero. And we can write that as the sum of these two terms, where on the left is the average rate of growth over a number of trajectories. And then on the right is this kind of string. And then on the right is this kind of strange ratio that is essentially a reorganization cost. So it's the KL divergence, the relative entropy between the probability distribution of configurations that we see and the corresponding equilibrium distribution. And it's we can calculate it if we know the sort of the equilibrium free energy and energy and the effective energy and free energy. Energy and the energy. Right, and so the second law with this expression says that delta mu minus this epsilon dis term has to be greater than or equal to zero. But that's not quite as good as we got from the continuum mechanics approach. We know that this, well, I guess we don't necessarily know how this is related to. Yeah, moving on. So we can now apply, if we want to get a better bound, If we want to get a better bound, we can apply the thermodynamic and circuitry relation, or one of the thermodynamic and circuit relations that were laid out by Siebert and Barato and Gingrich and many others, that essentially say that the total literature reproduction of a process is related to the flux and the variance of the flux for a generalized flux in the following way. So the total energy reduction has to be greater than or equal to 2kt times the square of a flux divided by. The square of a flux divided by the variance. And this is a super general relationship. And if we take this and apply it to our system, where now the flux is the rate of influx of particles, d is the diffusivity of the number of particles, then this gives us a relationship that looks a lot like what we got from the continuum mechanics approach. But now instead of that TID, the endpoint stress sensor over the concentration. Over the concentration, I guess we have this epsilon distribution. But this tells us a sort of strict bound. So this quantity is always greater than this quantity. And that actually applies irrespective of how close to equilibrium you are, which is neat, I think. So they did simulations of the system, essentially springs with some bending resistance. What they get is close to equilibrium for a small delta. is close to equilibrium for small delta mu, you get sort of sphere, or sorry, circle-like growth. And then as you go to higher and higher delta mu, you get this sort of non-equilibrium crazy buckling behavior. In their case, the way that the Monte Carlo steps were done, you get sort of this spiky-like behavior, but it's if you do it with more general steps, you get configurations that look a little bit more normal. Right, so the Right, so we can take these configurations, and they did it, and calculate the height fluctuations, the function remote number, and extract effective values of the hemming rigidity and surface tension. And from that, an effective value of the energy and the free energy, et cetera. So we can calculate that epsilon disc term and check if the bound is satisfied. Right, so on the left here is the effective surface tension as a function of delta mu. You see it as a Delta mu, you see as we go to higher and higher delta mu, it decreases, and then eventually it becomes effectively zero. So this kind of looks like what we saw in the simulation, sorry, in that initial experimental paper with the GUVs and SUVs. The surface tension drops. Well, I guess it's not quite the same thing. But essentially, we see with an external driving force we get a drop in surface tension. So that's conceptually at least similar. On the right here, we're plotting the delta mu as a function of. Delta mu is a function of the surface tension, and we're plotting the various bounds that we came up with earlier. So the first thing that we said was that delta mu has to be greater than epsilon dys. So this bottom curve is epsilon dys. So delta mu values below here, we essentially, if we apply some delta mu, we can't get a surface tension that's in this range. In this range. The tighter bound that we derived that incorporates the flux and the fluctuations gives us a much tighter bound on the actual chemical potential and surface tension that we measure in the simulations. So you can see that using this sort of relationship, you get a very close correspondence between the two. This sort of deviates as we get to large values of delta mu. To large values of delta mu over here. Right, so that's the predicted bound from the theory. In the 3D case, again, we saw that the bound was satisfying. And just to emphasize, there's this sort of interesting correspondence between the stress and this reorganization cost term that we're trying to understand. Yes, right. So when we go through the process and measure the surface tension, And measure the surface tension, we don't get quite as good agreement. So, what we do is we take our trajectories and apply this sort of procedure from Bassero, where they looked at, they take the central contour, calculate the, take the Fourier transform of the radius as a function of angle, and you can then write the sort of fluctuations of the normal displacement in terms of the surface tension and bending. Surface tension and bending rigidity. And for our case, these are the effective values for our system. So we take our configurations, take the central contour, and do this computation. And we can do the same thing with spherical harmonics. We have, and we get the same answer. But I think this is nice because it's kind of what's done commonly in experiments. But you're doing this while there is a flux of the mathematics. No. Yeah, so we're taking snapshots. Snapshots at a particular time in the simulation and comparing configuration across countries. So, it really is an effective surface tension. Yeah. That I'm still struggling with a little bit, but it's a good question. So, right, so we can estimate values. We see that the surface tension decreases as we increase delta mu, just like in the QB case. Delta mu, just like in the QB case. How long do you want to come to? It's truly a minute left. Oh, geez, okay. Right, so that's the questions, yeah. Yeah, this bounding doesn't quite work. And we think the reason is that kappa, so in the 2D systems, kappa remains essentially constant as you vary at delta mu, but in the 3D case, it drops off. I mean, not quite as dramatically as the strike extension, but it does. And right, what I wanted to show is this, we've now started looking at this model. Now, started looking at this model from this paper by Maharavan's group, where they considered 2D cells that have a flux of material in amount and growth in the surface with an additional division theorem. So if two parts of the membrane come close enough to one another, they can sort of split off into two. And you can sort of describe the behavior of these systems with a particular dimensionless parameter. And as you vary that parameter, which depends on the flux and the growth rate, you get this sort of crazy variety of. Variety of, I guess, trajectories where you can get stable division of a cell into smaller cells or sort of inward vesiculation from the surface of the membrane. Right, and so these are just movies showing what that looks like. We'd like to try to apply the ideas that I was talking about to this sort of model. But I'll end there. Thank you for listening. And yeah. We take some questions while we switch to the video whatever. Any questions? I still struggle with this idea of why you don't just draw this here homogeneously. Why do you get this length scale in the wrinkles? So you're putting down material randomly anywhere. You're putting down material, like You're putting down material. That's just separate rates, right? If you have a different rate, you get a different length to it. More rate, more wrinkles, right? Why don't you homogeneously draw the whole thing into a larger sphere? There's no volume constraint. Enough time to relax from that point. Yeah. But you add stochastically everywhere. So you add with this probability that depends on the. On the although it's back there in that sense. I see. Alright, let's thank Jordan one more time. Our last talk of the morning session will be from Johnny Mao. Something about fibers and isosticity and topology, I see further memory. I'm sure the title is on. There it is. Okay, Jumming, please. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so last talk of the morning session. Please.
