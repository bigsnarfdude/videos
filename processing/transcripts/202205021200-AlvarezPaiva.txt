Finsler manifolds from convex geometric point of view, but actually, what I'm going to do is try to show you that there are some surprising theorems in Finstler geometry that are actually just consequences, or rather, sometimes simple, sometimes not so simple, consequences of convex geometric results. So, usually, I've been interested in Been interested in studying Finstler manifolds to do something in convex geometry, but the other way around works actually, maybe even better. So let's start with, let me start with just basic definitions, which are not too much. First of all, I'm going to be talking about Minkowski norms, Minkowski spaces. These are spaces that have an asymmetric norm, but this asymmetric norm, which means just the unit ball. Means just the unit ball is a convex body with the origin inside, but it's not center at the origin. Notice it's symmetric. And I'm going to assume the boundary of this convex body is smooth or C2, and it has positive, strictly positive curvature if you put any Euclidean metric on it. Another way of saying is that the norm is C2, and its Hessian is positive definite outside the origin. Outside the origin. Okay, and then a Finser manifold. I mean, start with a continuous function, okay? A continuous Finster manifold is you have a function defined on the tangent space, okay, and it's going to be a Finsler manifold if the function is C2, at least C2, CK outside the zero section, and the restriction to each tangent space is a Minkowski norm. So you have a bunch of norms on each tangent space. Bunch of norms on each tangent space. The unit balls of these norms are convex bodies whose boundaries are smooth and very nicely convex. Okay, this is important. Sometimes it's not so important, but sometimes important. Depends. If you want to look at the dynamics, if you want to pass to the dual and do Hamiltonian dynamics, you do need this sort of thing. But sometimes you can get away with that. Now, note that if you have this thinster function, which is Have this Finster function, which is for every tangent vector, it gives you its norm. Okay, if you restrict it to a tangent space, that's going to be the support function of the codisc, the unit codisc, which is just the dual of the unit of the tangent unit ball. Okay, so that's that's that's the definition of a finster manifold, but what is it? Okay, so a finster manifold is a So, a Finsler manifold is actually many things. So, there are many viewpoints. So, one of the things is it is a Finsler bundle. So, if you have a vector bundle, you can consider, you can define a Finsler structure on it by putting a convex body in each tangent, in each fiber. Okay, so I'm going to do the same thing I did for Transcriber manifolds, but I'm not going to assume any. But I'm not going to assume any regularity beyond continuity for the time being. It's just to give you an idea of what I'm looking at. So it's just you have a function on the tangent on the bundle. I'm sorry. The final total space. There's a question for Antonio. He asked, could the body be of smaller dimension? No, no, no, no. That's a good. No, that's a good, uh, that's a good, uh, that's a good uh, no, the bodies, no, people do look at these things also, you know, at uh you have a body of smaller dimension. It's uh people do look at the do control theory and they also there are people also that look like at convex cylinders. That's that turns out to be sub-Riemannian or sub-pinsler geometry if you look at uh in each tangent space. At in each tangent space, you have a convex cylinder, which means that in the dual, you have a body of lower dimension. So, yeah, it could be, but I'm actually not considering that now. I'm just doing Finsler. But it could be, it could be, and it's interesting too. So, the Finsler bundle, the Finsler bundle is basically just a bunch of tangent spaces with convex bodies in each fiber. In each fiber containing the origin in the interior as an interior point. Okay, that's one thing that could be, you can think of it. You can think of a fensive manifold as a bunch of convex bodies on the tangent bundle of a manifold. Now, a fensive manifold is also a metric space. If you have a C1 curve, for example, you define the length by parentheses missing, but you define the length as by taking the norms of the As by taking the norms of the derivative and integrating. And then you can define the norm in asymmetric norm, or I'm sorry, norm, not distance, by saying I'm going to take the infimum of the lengths of all curves that go from x to y. And that's going to be the distance from x to y, not necessarily the distance from y, which is not the same thing as the distance from y to x. Okay, so okay, so. So, a Finson manifold, there's another point of view, a third point of view, and that it is a Legendron vibration together with distinguished contact form. I'm not going to go too much into that, but I'm going to tell you what the contact form is at least. So, if you're given a Finson manifold, C2 Finsymmetric, you can Fin symmetric. You can define a bundle map from the tangent space without the zero section to the cotangent space without the zero section. Okay, by this formula. Just delta f of vx is going to be a form, a covector. So hitting a vector wx is going to be, you take the derivative of f of vx plus t wx t equals zero. Geometrically, this is the Legendre transform. This is the way you pass. Legendre transform. This is the way you pass from if you take a point in your convex body on the surface of your convex body. Let's say you have a convex body, you take on the surface of it, you take the unique, because it's smooth, you take unique tangent plane. That tangent plane is given by c equals one for some covector xi. So the vector v in the unit unit sphere, in the unit sphere for the norm, is going to go to a covector C in the universe. To a covector C in the dual unit sphere. So, this is the Legendre transform, but you can do it this way as well. And when you pull back what's called the canonical one form on the cotangent bundle, this is the form P d q, sum of p i dqi in the standard coordinates, that you get something called the Hilbert form associated to your Finsler metric. Now, this form in local coordinates takes this very easy. This is very easy expression. And because it is home, because the function is homogeneous of degree one, the form is homogeneous of degree zero and lives on the spherized tangent bundle, STM, which means you take the tangent rays. This is the bundle of tangent directions or tangent rays. And this makes it into a contact manifold. And the natural vibration that associates to each tangent ray its base point is a Legendre. point is a Leisandran vibration. Now, what's the use of this? Well, you go into Hamiltonian dynamics this way, or this one of the ways, one of the most geometric ways to go into Hamiltonian dynamics, because then you can define the red vector field, the Hamiltonian vector field of the metric, simply by these equations. d alpha f contracted with xf is zero and alpha f of xf always equal to one. Always equal to one. This gives you the geodesic entropy. The orbits of this project onto geodesics of the Finstra metric on the base manifold. And if you look at them, what you're just really doing is you'd have point and direction, point and direction. The orbits of this are point and direction, point direction of geodesics. So you get the geodesics this way. Okay, so there are three points of view. One is There are three points of view. One is it's a Finser bundle, so it's a bunch of convex bodies on each tangent space. And it's also a metric space. And it's also a space where you have this dynamics, this geodesic flow, okay, and the dynamics. So the idea, of course, is nice theorems or sort of nice theorem is to use convex geometry together with the other, with the metric aspect and the symplectic aspects to get some nice results for. Some nice results for Finsromanovs. Okay, that's sort of the idea. And okay. Okay, so I'm going to start with as a first sort of first example, something, an old theorem by Auerbach, Mazura and Ulam, which I'm going to write differently here, okay? Because I'm just going to see it as a question about FinServices. Going to see it as a question about Finsler bundles. Okay, so are there topological obstructions for a Finsler bundle to admit for a vector bundle to admit a non-Riemannian Finsler structure? I mean, by non-Riemannian, I mean I don't have ellipsoid center at the origin on every fiber, which is, of course, I always have a Riemannian structure on these bundles, but I want a non-Riemannian finster structure where all the convex bodies are nevertheless linear. Bodies are nevertheless linearly equivalent. Are there topological obstructions? And in fact, there are topological obstructions to this. And in fact, you have this sort of result. This is rather easy to prove. So the theorem here is it basically does go back to our back, Mazur Ulam, not exactly, but yeah, it's sort of an easy theorem. If a physical structure on a non-trivial plane bundle on the sphere, so you have the sphere and then you have a bundle such that And then you have a bundle such that every fiber is R2. Okay, is such that all convex bodies in its fibers are linearly equivalent, then all these bodies are, I'm sorry, center ellipses. Okay, it's not ellipse, so it's yeah, I carry it away there. It's ellipsis, okay? So all these convex are ellipses. Okay, I'm in a plane bundle, so this is ellipse. This is easy because what happens is. The set, the group of linear symmetries of a convex body in R2 is either infinite, in which case you have an ellipse, or finite. There's nothing else, just finite or infinite. So what you do is you look at sort of the group of this bundle, or you just switches, you know, the GL2, the GL or linear transformations are two. You look at You look at each point. And of course, it always can reduce to SO2 or because if it's oriented or O2. But in this case, it's going to reduce, you're going to have a reduction to a finite group. Or if you think of it the following way, you take the North Pole and then you say, I'm going to look at all the isometries that are from the North Pole from the. The north pole from the from the fiber in the north pole to a fiber in a particular point x and i know they're going to be finitely many isometries because they're not ellipse uh usually they're going to be finitely many isometries but they're not ellipses if they're not ellipses and i know there's always going to be the same sort of group because all the bodies are affinely equivalent so now you have a a covering of the sphere for each point x you For each point X, you look at all the transformations that are isometries from the fiber X to the North Pole, and you have a covering, but it's covering of a simply connected manifold. So you have a section, and with this section, you can construct a non-zero vector field. So it's this easy thing. And then this is the application that people usually remember as Auerbach Mazur Ulam. As our back mazurulam, is if all the plane sections of a three-dimensional convex body passing through any tier points are linearly equivalent, then the body is an ellipsoid because, well, you can construct your bundle. Your bundle is going to be sort of a tautological bundle or RP2 or RP2 dual. And then you know that all the sections are ellipses, and then you prove that means the body is an ellipsoid. Okay, so this is a sort of a topological theorem. A sort of a topological theorem on sort of finster bundles and geometric applications to convex geometry, but bounce it okay, there it goes. Then wait a second. Oh, wait a second. Okay. Okay. And then it should computers. Oh, just a second, okay? I don't know what's going on. Maybe try arrow key. I'm sorry. Maybe try an arrow key. Yeah, that's what I did. I tried arrow key and the thing. So let me just. The thing. So let me just just demo talks IMG talk okay. Um okay oh man. Okay, no problem. I have the another version. What's going with this? You just can't advance the slide? Is that the problem? Yeah, yeah, I can't advance the slide. Let's see. Let me check with this with the arrow key on top. No, okay, when it doesn't matter. I have another version of this. IMG. Unfortunately, this one doesn't come. Doesn't come with this one. It's one page. Yeah, this one is one page. Are you good? I mean, yeah, would you like? Are you seeing this? Yeah. Yes, you can see it. Okay, so now there's no more surprises. It's one page where the pages come whole, but doesn't matter. Okay, so let's that was a convex geometric application. Let's try some Finster applications. Okay, so let's. Okay, so let's uh first definition. Okay, say two Finster metrics are going to be affinely equivalent. Whenever you have a geodesic of one, you can reparametrize it in this very particular way. Just put a constant velocity, right, factor there. You pass from gamma t to gamma of lambda t. So it's just a very simple parametrization, and that gives you geodesic of the second metric. The lambda depends on the geodesic. Second metric. The lambda depends on the geodesic. Okay, so you take one geodesic, you may have to multiply, you have to go perhaps two times faster, and the other geodesic, you have to go three times faster. I'm just considering, remember, I'm considering geodesics as orbits of some vector field, or with parametrization in this case. So this is going to be a fine equivalence. Affine equivalence is very restrictive in Finsler geometry. Is very restrictive in Finzler geometry, but hasn't been much studied. One case it has been studied is this: when you have a Finsler manifold that is a finally equivalent to Riemannian metric, okay? A Fincer metric that is a finally equivalent to Riemannian metric. That's usually called a Burwald metric, although definitions differ, but it ends up being that. And the theorem of Ichillo is that in that case, the parallel transport preserves. Preserves the norm of the vectors, the Finsler norm. Of course, the parallel transport of G preserves the Riemannian norm, but it also preserves the Finsler norm. In particular, because you do parallel transports of the unit balls, of the tangent unit balls for the Finnsometric, you're going to end up with the fact that all unit tangent spheres or all unit tangent Spheres or all unit tangent balls in your Fincer manifold are linearly equivalent. So you have a case in which everything is linearly equivalent. Okay, so then if you use the sort of Auerbachmazurulem result that I quoted earlier, you're going to have this: that if it's a metric on a two-sphere that is a finally equivalent to Riemannian metrics itself Riemannian, now the previous thing is not a whole proof. The previous thing is not a whole proof because you need to do a bit more. Because if the manifold, if the metric is reversible, that's true. If the metric is not reversible, you need to do a bit more. But the key fact is that all the unit spheres are going to be, all the unit circles, in this case, tangent circles, are going to be ellipses. And this is the key to the theorem. And then another thing is if you have a compact Finsler surface that is isometrically inverted. Surface that is isometrically inverted into a three-dimensional manifold, then that is a finally equivalent to Riemannian surface if and only if it is Riemannian and the Minkowski spaces, three-dimensional norm space is Euclidean. And that is because of the Auer-Bach-Masura-Ulan theorem. You know that the tangent spaces are going to be all the same from all the convex bodies are linearly equivalent. And since the tangent spaces in an isometric immersion are basically just Isometric inversion are basically just the sections with the or the sections of the convex body through the origin, then you know all sections are linearly equivalent, and therefore you have an ellipsoid. So that's an example of how to use sort of a convex geometric result in Finslow geometry. Okay, I don't know. Okay, and that theorem of Auerbach Mazur Ulam was greatly generalized by Gromov. In fact, what Gromov did was he noticed this thing about the bundle. So if he says, I'm going to have a convex body, a point in the convex body inside, and then I'm going to take sections, let's say k-dimensional sections. Sections, let's say k-dimensional sections. They don't have to be hyper-plane sections. Okay, then Gromov notice: well, I'm going to look at the Grasmanian, the Grasmanian of K-dimensional planes in Rn. I'm going to look at its tautological bundles. Over each point in the Grasmanian, I put the plane that corresponds to it. And then I have a Finsler structure on this bundle. And if all these convex bodies are linearly. These convex bodies are linearly equivalent means that bundle, the grass main, the tautological bundle of the grassmanian, must admit a reduction of its structure group. And then he says, ah, okay, for which one does that happen? And then he finds out, and then he shows, for example, that if all the sections of an odd-dimensional convex body odd, means dimension bigger than one, okay, so three, five, and so on, passing through an interior pointer. Passing through an interior point or linearly equivalent, then the body is an ellipsoid, center at the origin. Okay. For four dimensions, that was open, but I see with a lot of curiosity that Sergei is going to talk about that. But in this, this, Gromov did this in all dimensions, and then he did it also for k-dimensional planes, not just hyperplane, not just hyperplane sections. And here I mean hyperplanes. Sections and here, here I mean hyperplane sections. I'm sorry I didn't write that down. If all the hyperplane sections of a non-dimensional body, convex body, passing through an interior point, equivalent that the body is an ellipsoid. Okay, and I shouldn't have have put centered either. Sorry. It was a bit of a hurry getting these things. Okay. And a corollary of that is that if you have a compact Finsler manifold, Have a compact Finsler manifold isometrically inverse of the hypersurface in an odd-dimensional Minkowski space, then that manifold is going to be a finely equivalent to Riemannian surface, I'm sorry, to Riemannian manifold if and only if it is Riemannian, then the Minkowski space is Euclidean. Now, again, this is because it's a hypersurface that is hypersurface that is compact and immersed then you're going to get all possible all possible um hyperplanes passing through a point or passing through the origin and then you know all these sections are going to be linearly equivalent and you can apply gromov's theorem okay so this is this is the sort of thing that you can get uh with this sort of thing okay so Okay, so now I'm going to pass to something different. I'm going to go something called Gromov's systolic inequality. I'm going to show you, well, don't have, this is a very deep theorem and sort of very hard reading, Gromov, but he has a nicer proof these days by Stefan Wenger. But let me put it, this is a sort of simple statement. Simple statement. I'm going to take M to be RPN or TN. Okay, usually you can take M to be something called a central manifold, but these are the two examples that come to mind usually. And then what Roma proves is that for any reasonable definition of volume on Finster spaces, there exists a constant C such that every reversible Finster metric on M with volume V carries a non-contractible closed geodesic, or actually closed curve, it doesn't matter. Actually, closed curve, it doesn't matter, of length less than c times square root of nth root of the volume. So if you control the volume, you control the length of the shortest non-contractible closed geodesic or the shortest, what's the same thing is the shortest non-contractible closed curve. Okay, now if you remove the hypothesis of reversibility, this is no longer true. Okay, now an example. Now, an example, you can construct an example as follows on the two torus. You take a two-dimensional torus. Well, it depends on what volume you choose, actually. So let's choose something that's called a Boosmann-Hausdorff measure. Boosmann-Hausdorff measure is basically you look at the unit tangent, okay, the unit tangent ball at every point, and you say that tangent ball in that space. Tangent ball in that space has the same volume as the unit Euclidean ball. And in the reversible case, you get the Hausdorff measure from that. In the non-reversible case, you get something that I've never sort of understood the intuition for it because it has some strange behavior. For example, you can construct a two-dimensional torus that has That has small volume, okay, and huge non-contractible geodesics. And the way to do that is just you simply take a, you can take ellipses in the plane that contain one integer point, one point with integer coordinates, and that's it. And they have very, very large area. The thing is, they live. Area. The thing is, the ellipse is not centered. Okay. And if it's centered, you can't because you have Minkowski theorem in the geometry of numbers. But if it's off-centered, then you can get this. And then that's the way you construct counterexamples to Grumov's systolic inequality if you choose this Bussmann-Hausdorff measure, which is sort of a favorite in Finsler geometry. I'm sorry, there is some question. There is a question. Yeah, I'm seeing that. Wait a second. I don't know. Yeah, and then what? I don't know. Okay, it's a sorry question. Okay, so that's so it's not obvious how to extend this to the non-reversible case. Reversible case. Now, for the non-reversible case, you do need ah okay. Yes, are there counterexamples on RPN also? That's a good question. For the Busman-Hausdorff, you mean? Yes. For the Busman-Hausdorff, I don't know. I don't know because I'm interested. I don't know because I'm interested. Well, I'm more interested in this one because it comes from symplectic geometry. So, yeah. And the other one doesn't work for the torus, but yeah, I think it doesn't work either for the other one. But let's see. Okay, so what we're going to do is instead of looking at this Busman-Hausdorff, which is sort of trying to copy the definition of the Hausdorff measure, let's take something. Measure. Let's take something that is sort of more intrinsic in the sense that you're looking at the symplectic geometry of the unit CODIS bundle. You take the unit CODIS bundle of a Finnsler manifold and you measure its symplectic volume. You divide by some standard number. And in Riemannian geometry, that gives you the volume of the manifold. And here, you just define the volume of the manifold in this way. Okay, so the Holmeson volume of dimension n. Volume of dimension n is the volume of its unit, the symplectic volume, its unit code disbundle divided by the volume of the n-dimensional unit disk in Euclidean geometry. And then the areas, you can, to compute areas intrinsically in the sense, you look at the sub-manifold, it inherits a Finsler metric, and then, okay, then it's a Fincer manifold with volume of the right dimension. So this is a So, this is a sort of definition. This definition goes back, well, Holmes and Thompson did this from the convex geometric viewpoint, but before this, Dazor was studying this sort of thing. Okay, and now this Holmes-Thompson volume has sort of a double life. It lives in symplectic geometry, but it also lives in convex geometry. And to do that, you have to look at the volume form or the volume. Volume form or the volume density, which is what measures the volume of parallel topes formed by tangent vectors. Okay, so if you have V1, Vn is a basis of your tangent space, the n vector is a volume form on the tangent. The n vector V1, wedge, wedge, wedge, Vn is a volume form of the cotangent. And then in the cotangent, you can measure with that volume form, you can measure the codisc, okay, the unit codisc. Okay, the unit code disk, and so well, in sort of it as an integral gives you this thing that's written there, okay. And then this is easy to see because you just push forward the symplectic volume onto n by the canonical projection, you see that that's what you get. Okay, so this is through. So it's now I'm going to go use convex geometry. Convex geometry. So I'm going to remember the Roger Shepard inequality, which is if you have a convex body in Rn, you take the symmetric difference of that convex body, you measure its volume, and that volume is less than a certain quantity, 2n factorial divided by n factorial squared, of the volume of the convex body. And this is, if you divide by the volume of k both sides, then on one side, you get an affine invariant or linear. get an affine invariant or linear invariant of your convex body which is k minus volume of k minus k divided by volume of k that's linear that's a linear invariant and that linear invariant is always less than 2n factorial divided 2n factorial squared and the equality happens if and only if this thing is a simplex so now we're going to just finselerize this convex geometric result now i'm going to take a n-dimensional finitzon manifold i'm going to define something called I'm going to define something called that I'm going to call the central symmetrization, which is just very simple. I'm going to take the Finson manifold f I'm going to take f of v plus f of minus v and I'm going to divide it by two. I'm going to call that f of s, f s of v. So I take the norm of a vector, the norm of minus the vector, divide, I add them up, divide by two, and I, that's a symmetrization. Now, geometry. Now, geometrically, what does it mean? You remember, f restricted to each tangent space is the support function of the unit codisc. This Fs restricted to each tangent space is the support function of the symmetrized codisc is the codisc at x minus the codisc at x divided by 2. So you just apply. So, you just apply the Roger-Shepard inequality, and you have that the volume density for the symmetrize is less than 2n factorial divided by 2 to the power n, because I divided by 2. Okay, it's Fs is F of B plus plus F of minus V divided by 2. And so the 2n appears there. So the 2n appears there, and then you have n factorial squared times the. Squared times the volume density for this for the for the F. Okay, so you have this simple inequality, and now this simple inequality does everything you want. Okay, so if you want to extend Gromov's systolic inequality to non-reversible metrics, if you use the Holm-Thompson volume, then which is the symplectic volume, then this is easy. You take M to be RPNRTN, then, okay, now it's for any metric, okay? Now, now it's for any metric, okay? And the proof is very simple. You take the systole is going to be the infimum of the length of all central non-contractible curves or the smallest non-contractible geodesic, the length, because F is less than two times the symmetrized, right? Because the symmetrized is F plus F reversed divided by. F reversed divided by two and the two times the symmetrize is f plus something. Okay, so since it's less, then the lengths of the closed curves of non-contractible curves are going to be less for f than for two fs. Now, but fs is symmetric, so I can use Gromov. And now I can use Roger Shepherd. And that's it. So for Busman Hausdorff, it doesn't hold. It doesn't hold, but for this one, it's just a very easy application of Roger Shepard. Okay, so that's that's one, and this, I'm sorry, this theorem put ABT, this is a little part of a long paper wrote with Balashev and Sanev on just lots of, you know, the relationship between Between geometry of numbers, systolic inequalities, and convex geometry. Okay. So in particular, in that paper, we also show that if you have the systolic inequality for Finsley metrics in RPN, for reversible Finsley metrics on RPN, if you can prove the Sharp systolic inequality, then you prove the Blaschke, the Mahler conjecture. Conjecture. Okay, so it's okay. So now let's change topics again. So each one of these topics is something which you have to use some convex geometry to get something out of it. So this one is geodesic reversibility. So Robert Bryant, when he was working on some things around Hilbert's fourth. On some things around Hilbert's fourth problem, um, came up with this definition of a geodesically reversible Finste metric. Okay, so you have a Finsometric is geodesically reversible if every one of its geodesics can be reparametrized backwards, you know, orientation reversing way, so as to remain a geodesic. Of course, reversible Finsler metrics where you have the norm of a vector equals the norm of minus the vector, they are geodesically reversible, but we want But we want something not so trivial. So, for example, something not trivial. You take an asymmetric norm in Rn and it is geodesically reversible, but it's not reversible. Or you take a Finsler metric and you add a closed one form small enough so that it remains a Finsler metric. So that it remains a phenolmetric, or a differential of a function, again small enough so that the sum remains a phenolmetric, and then you haven't changed the geodesics in any way. But the parametrizations are different now, but you haven't changed the geodesics after reparametrization. And every geodesic can be reparametrized in the other way so as to remain a geodesic. Okay, these are two examples. And the thing is, Examples and not, and the thing is, when he gave this definition, he applied it to Hilbert's fourth problem. And the metric he ends up having, which is geodesically reversible, is the sum of a symmetric metric, of a reversible metric, and a closed one-form or actually a differential of a function. I started thinking about this, and you know, I wanted to build examples to have nice examples or prove something. It turns out to be very rigid. To be very rigid, but it's hard to see that it's very rigid. So, here's an example of a rigidity theorem. If you have a geodesically reversible dissolve instrument, which means all geodesics are closed with the same length, all primes are closed with the same length. Actually, the geodesic flow is periodic with minimal period. Then, F is the sum of a reversible solvent. Sum of a reversible Solfin symmetric and the differential of a smooth function. So geodesic reversibility in Sol means reversibility, modulo, a closed form, a closed one form, a differential of a function. Okay, and if you apply that to Hilbert's fourth problem, that's nice because the asymmetric case in Hilbert's fourth problem, it's been open for a long time, but this solves it in the case of RPA. This solves it in the case of RPN because in the RPN it tells you the solutions of Hilbert's asymmetric solutions of Hilbert's fourth problem are the reversible solutions of Pugarelov and Sabo and so on plus the differential of a function. Okay, there's nothing new. That's not new. Can you remind us what Hilbert's fourth problem is? Yeah, Hilbert's fourth problem is to construct and study all And study all Finsler in Finsler language, okay? So construct and study all metrics on Rn or RPN or convex bodies in Rn such that geodesics are straight lines, straight line segments. Okay, so in RPN means all geodesics are projective lines that gives you its soul. And then since it's Sol and you have this theorem, it means that you have a reversible metric that has the same geodesics. That has the same geodesics plus plus a differential. So, okay, so that in the case of RPN, Hilbert's fourth problem in the asymmetric case gives you nothing new. This is the rigidity result. It's not the same in the non-compact case, but in this case, in the compact case, then you have nothing new basically, just differentials. Basically, just differentials, just add differentials of functions. Okay, and here's another example of a result: which is if you take these two Fincer metrics, if you take two Fincer metrics on RPN, which are projective, so that projective lines are geodesic, so solutions of Hilbert's fourth problem. Then, and these have, and you assume that these have the same Holmes-Thompson density, so the same volume. Density, so the same volume form, okay, so or volume density in the cases where this thing is not orientable. Then the difference is there of Z3 function. So the volume form, the volume density characterizes the metric if you suppose it's projective to start with. So these are, okay, so these are examples of the sort of thing you get. And we'll see how you can get at this. We'll see how you can get at this very simply out of Bromenkovsky inequality. Okay, so Bromenkovsky, I'm just going to use really basic Bromenkovsky. So it's not just, it's just if you have a convex body, then the symmetric, the symmetric, the volume and symmetric difference is bigger than to power n, the volume of k. And this holds if and only if k is symmetric about some point. K is symmetric about some point. And the Finslerization of this theorem in some ways is the following. Is the Holm Thompson volume density of a Finsymmetric on a manifold is less than or equal to that of its central symmetrization? Remember, central symmetrization is you take the norm of a vector plus the norm of binary vector and divide by two. And that gives you another Finsler metric, which is reversible this way. Reversible this way. So the Hom-Thompson density of the metric, of the Finzon metric, is less than the symmetrization, and they are equal if and only if the metric is symmetric up to some one form. Okay, it's not close to one form, it's just up to some one form. And this is just apply Bruminkovsky to every code disk bundle. To each of the codisk bundles, you apply. The code is bundles, you apply the Bruminkovsky theorem, and this is what you get. There's nothing with the easy stuff. Okay, so and as I say, this is the proof. You notice that the unit codisk at X is the body supported by the restriction of F to X, and the restriction of Fs to the tangent space at X is the support function of the. X is the support function of the symmetrized body. You apply the Brominkowski. Okay, now, how are we going to use this? Well, the reason is that, you see, you have this theorem that says that when you symmetrize the body, when you symmetrize the method, Monica, you need to mute, please. If you symmetrize a metric, you increase the volume. But suppose you are in a situation where you cannot increase the volume. Ah, then it must be that your metric is symmetric. The metric is symmetric up to addition of a one form. Okay, let me look at the okay, sorry. Okay. Okay. So that's what exactly what happens with sole manifolds. Symmetrizing it will not be able to, we will not be able to expand the volume. Okay, so this is this old theorem by Booth B and Wang. This is one of the earliest papers on contact geometry. And then Weinstein. And it's what Weinstein did is. It's what Wangshen did is can also be seen as a really easy application of what Boothby and Wang did about contact. They were looking at contact manifolds that are circle bundles over symplectic manifolds. In this case of Zohl manifolds, you look at the unit cosphere bundle, and that's a circle bundle over the space of genetics, which is a manifold, which is a symplectic manifold. So what it tells you, what this theorem tells you, is that the home What this theorem tells you is that the Hong Thompson volume of a Zohn manifold, of an n-dimensional zone manifold, is equal to a certain to an integer multiple of, okay, epsilon n n factorial, okay, epsilon n is the volume, the volume of the Euclidean unit disk of dimension n. So it's just some factor, okay, an integer multiple of some factor depends on n of the nth power, the length of any of its prime geodesics. Length of any of its prime geodesics. So the length of geodesics of the Sol manifold determines volume. Okay. The integer multiple depends on the topology of the Sol manifold, but if you're within a Finstrom manifold, then just length determines volume. So the theorem, the proof of the theorem that says that a geodesically reversible Sol Finsler manifold is the sum of reversible, I'm sorry, geodesically reversible Sol-Finsler manifest. Reversible Solfinzler manifold is the sum of a reversible Solfinsler manifold of metric and the differential smooth function is very simple. You take the reverse metric. Now, what I call the reverse metric is the one that you take f of f reverse of v is f of minus v. Okay, f reverse of v is f of minus v. So just the norm of v is actually the norm of minus v. That gives you another Finsler metric. Okay. But because But because it's reversible, geodesically reversible, means the geodesics backwards are also geodesics. And so you have F minus is also is all metric with the same geodesics and the prime geodesics have the same length of those of F. Okay, that you can see because you turn around, you say, okay, what's the length of this geodesic? Then you turn around in the unit sphere bundle. Sphere bundle until you come back because all genesics are closed of the same length. Okay, yeah, you're not changing. Oh, the length of the geese are the same. Okay, but then you take a convex combination. Okay, the convex combination of if you have two metrics with the same geodesics, any convex combination of them is a metric with the same geese. And so you have a continuous path of solid metrics by taking the convex. path of sol metrics by taking the convex combination one minus tf plus tf minus and all of these have the prime geodesic the same length so they all have the same volume now for t equals one half that's exactly the symmetrized metric but the volume then then is the same because it is its own metric and the prime geodesics have the same length so the volume is the same but the volume must be greater unless Unless the metric is the same as the symmetrize, where you have a one form. And then you have to prove that one form is closed, and that's easy. But that depends a bit on calculus of variation, the Hilbert form. It's a bit different. But so you see, it's that one. Once you set it up, all you need is to put yourself in a situation in which your symmetrizing cannot expand the volume. Okay, and then you know, okay, since I cannot expand the volume, the volume is always going to be bigger than or equal, but I cannot expand it, so it's going to be because my metric is reversible plus one form. Okay, so that's sort of powerful. Okay, so that's that. Now, geodesic reversibility, as I said, it's sort of a hard thing to get around, so I try. Get around. So I tried something else. I said, okay, Finster, Sol is very nice. Sol is integrable. These are integrables, Hamiltonian systems in a very nice way. And I want to see something. So how about something ergodic? It turns out the ergodic case is also rigid. And I'm going to show you this result, which is you have a two- or three-dimensional manifold. Manifold and that is geodesically reversible if the geodesic flow does not admit any non-trivial continuous integral of motion. So that was what we call ergodic. It doesn't have any integral of motion. Then the metric is not exactly what usually takes as a differential ergodic, but let's put it that way. The metric F is the sum of a reversible metric and a closed one form. So, and here, unfortunately, So, and here, unfortunately, you see there is a restriction on the dimension. The two-dimensional case is very easy. It doesn't use any convex geometry. It's easy. I'm going to do the three-dimensional case. And actually, there is a convex geometric conjecture that would give the n-dimensional case. Because, as you'll see, I'm going to reduce the proof of this to a theorem of Shakarian that says that bodies That bodies of, roughly speaking, bodies of constant width and constant breadth in three dimensions are balls. But there's a relative version of that, which I'm going to. So I said, geodesic reversibility seems to be really rare. Okay. For example, I do not know any Finsler metric, any Finsler metric, any non-trivial, non-trivial, geodesically reversible metric. So, I mean, it's either reversible, reversible plus plus closed one form, or it's, it's, if in a torus, it's or in a Klein bottle, it's flat. Okay. But I don't know anything that's not of that form in two dimensions, in two dimensions. I don't know, I don't know if there is. I don't know if there is a single non-reversible, geodesically reversible metric in S2, which is not just sum of a one form. I have no idea how to prove that. You'll see some, even in this case, it's not so easy. Okay, so but the key to the theorem, the key to reducing this result on rigidity to This result on rigidity to convex geometry is the following, which is, if I may say so myself, a neat result because it's also true in Rubenian geometry, and no one had remarked it up to now. So that it's also true in Rubenian geometry. If you have two Finsler metrics that have the same unparameterized geodesics, if the geodesic flow in either metric does not admit non-trivial integrals of motion, Integrals of motion, then in fact, the areas of hypersurfaces are always proportional with the same constant of so there is a constant nu such that the Homson area of any hypersurface in Mf2 in F2 for MF2 is new times its area at MF1. Okay, so having the same antparametrized geese and ergodic geodesic flow. And ergodic geodesic flow gives you that any other metric is going to have the same area functional up to a fixed constant. And that depends, this depends on a bit of integral geometry, space of geodesics, a bit of symplectic geometry. It's easy, but so. but I want to look at the convex part more. So the key here is this, this Hom Thompson area, of course. Now, let me talk about the, I talked about Hom Thompson volume, but let me talk about the area. I said at the beginning, when I define the volume, I said, well, if you have a sub-manifold, If you have a sub-manifold, it in here is a metric, so it's now a Finsler manifold, and look at the volume. Okay, that's the intrinsic viewpoint. The extrinsic viewpoint is a bit different. So you take K vectors that define a K-dimensional subspace. So then you wedge them. So you have a decomposable K-vector. And then you have the natural inclusion of that sub-tangent subspace. Tangent subspace into the tangent into the tangent space Txm. Now you take a dual map. The dual map goes from the cotangent of m at x to the dual of this space that was generated by the k vector. And then you and this dual map projects your code disk onto a convex body. Now, since Now, since A is a volume form in this dual space, since this K vector is a volume form, then you can compute the area of this projection. Now, this is intrinsic because we're doing Finster Manifold, but if you look at just a single space, okay, a single in Rn, okay, then you have the unit ball and you have. You have the unit ball and you have the polar, which is you take the dual and then you bring the dual back to Rn using the inner product in Rn. And then you can identify these things. You can identify the areas with the K projection function of the dual, of the polar. So you project, you have orthogonal projections of the polar body onto different k-planes, and that's how you measure areas. Okay, now. Okay, now here's the geometric here's the convex geometric component and this is the stereo Shakarian. You have a stereosymmetric convex body in R3. Okay, this is just three-dimensional in higher dimensions it's open. So whose boundary is C2 and has strict positive curvature. Now if you have another convex body whose width and brightness are constant relative to B, what does that mean? Relative to B. What does that mean? It means that I project B and K, I project them onto different lines, and I look at the ratio of the lengths of their projections, and I always get the same ratio. It doesn't matter which line I'm picking. Or in the case of planes, I project K and B into onto different planes. I measure the area and I look at the ratio. Area, and I look at the ratio of the area, and it's always the same ratio, doesn't matter what plane I have. Okay, then that's called constant width and constant brightness relative to B. Okay, then if you have body constant with constant brightness relative to B, then K is the same thing as B up to dilation and translation. Okay, uh, I'm going to need a definition to, I'm going to make this theorem slow. This theorem slowly more Finsler. Okay, so I'm going to look at the Blaschke body of a convex body, which is the unique zero-symmetric convex body such that the areas of orthogonal projections of K and nabla K onto any hyperplane coincide. That body exists by Minkowski's theorem of one of his famous theorems of Minkowski. Theorems of Minkowski. And since a body k is always a constant width relative to k minus k, then Shakiria's theorem you can restate in the following form. K is a convex body in R3, such as the boundary of k minus k C2 and has strict positive curvature. If the Blaschke body is a dilate of the symmetrized body here, K minus K, then K is symmetric about some point. K is symmetric about some point. Okay, so all you need is you want the Blashkin body to be a dilate of K minus K. If that happens, that happens if and only if your body is symmetric about some point. Okay, now when you have this sort of result, you already have, you get the idea that you're going to get a result of something is symmetric up to a one form. And that's exactly what happens. So, first thing you have to do is, well, define. Define sort of a new sort of symmetrization of a Finsler manifold. If you have a metric on a Finsler manifold, there exists a unique reversible Finsler metric, Fb, B for Blaschke, that defines the same n minus one area density. How do you do that? Well, basically, you just replace the codiscs by their Blasch by their Blask bodies. Bodies okay, so just replace bodies by Blasch bodies on the cotangent space. Um, okay, and then so you get two, you have two different symmetrizations of a Finstrom manifold. So either you have the central symmetrization where you measure the length of a vector plus the length of the minus vector, of minus the vector, and divide by two, or you have this other one, which gives you the same areas, but it's symmetric. And then the proposition. symmetric. And then the proposition here is that if you have a C2 finsometric manifold on a three-dimension, a C2 finsometric on a three-dimensional manifold, its central symmetrization is conformal to its aerial symmetrization if and only if in fact the metric is symmetric up to some one form. And the proof is easy because it's the hypotheses translate into saying that the Blaschke body Into saying that the Blaschke body of the codisc is dilate of the symmetrized codisc. And by Shakarian, that means that the codisk is symmetric about some point, and that's it. Okay, now for the finishing, because I don't want to go over board too much. Here's how you prove the theorem. Okay, so you have a three-dimensional manifold, genetically reversible and ergodic flow. Basically reversible and ergodic flow, you want to show that in fact F is reversible up to a close to one four. Well, then the proof is because the metric is reversible, it has the same geodesics as the central symmetrization. Moreover, the geodesic flow of F has no integrals of motion. So you know that the areas of F, the high Of F, the hypersurface areas of F and the hypersurface areas of F S coincide up to a multiple, constant multiple. Okay, so that means that since F B okay since F B since the super the surface area of F is the same thing as the surface area of F B, because the unique symmetric Symmetric fins reversible symmetric that has the same areas, then both Fs and F B are symmetric. And since both these things are symmetric, Fs has to be the same as S B, okay? Because Fb is the unique symmetric reversible metric for which the areas coincide with that of F. So it has to be the same thing as Fs. Okay, so these things are proportional and therefore conformal, then you know that's. And then you know that's then the metric is symmetric up to one form, and then you can prove the form is closed by an additional argument. Okay, so in all these results, basically, it's always you have to find, you have to set things up, look at the metric, look at the dynamics and so on, but you try to set things up so that at the end you have some convex geometric results. Convex geometric result, some strong convex geometric result you can use. Now, I've never been able to say, I'm going to apply this convex geometric result and find this out. It happens by chance, but I'm hoping this will change one day. Okay, that I say, okay, I'm going to look at, for example, well, there are examples of other inequalities I would love to use, but I don't know in which case they would actually give a nice result. Give a nice result, okay? So, that's that's all great. Thank you very much, Juan Carlos. Let's thank our speaker for showing up a little icon there. And other questions? Questions, Daniel, Daniel? Yeah, hi, Juan, Carlos. Carlos, you um you used a result by Shakir Jan about the constant width and constant brightness in space. There's a more recent work by Ralph Howard who proved this without smoothness and solution. Is this helpful for generalizing the final result you mentioned? Well, actually, no, because the thing is, you see, I need a C. I need a C2 finsler anyway because I to get the theorem that the that the areas of two projectedly equivalent metrics where the geodesic flow is ergodic, that the areas were multiples, were constant multiples. So I didn't need Ralph, but I'm wondering more if I can use some of your results with Ralph. Some of your results with Ralph in other dimensions, but I'm not seeing where I can. That's one of the things I'm looking at is what sort of other theorems. Because then you can finslarize your results, okay, in all these dimensions, the things you did with, you can finslerize them as I've done, okay, with k-dimensional, you look at the k-dimensional areas and so on. And then you can start thinking, okay, what sort of. What sort of nice? Well, it's something to look at, but I haven't done much. Okay. I have a question. So the possible decrease in the volume in non-symmetric finster manifolds. So when I was looking at phonetic, I also noticed that. And full geometry, I also noticed that Boozman definition is wrong and the Paul's Thompson is the right one to use. I guess my question is double fold. Is there any I'm sorry, can you speak a bit louder? Because I'm not getting you. Yeah, I guess my question is: is there any reason why the Bozeman definition doesn't work for non-symmetric metrics? And is there maybe some Of metrics, at least there may be some way to nevertheless get a metric definition of volume in a non-reversible setting. Yeah, I also thought about this, but the thing with is the justification for the Busman definition in Finster geometry is that it gives you the Hausdorff measure asymmetric space. But in the asymmetric case, the Busman Hausdorff measure. Asymmetric case, the Busman-Hausdorff doesn't seem to give you anything, it's just sort of you try to copy and there doesn't seem to be much of a justification. But I don't know if I think I tried mass star actually, I tried with mass star in the, in the in the non non-reversible case. Non-reversible case because it and the thing is, you there are ways. I'll send you something. It's basically, yeah, there are ways to make it work so that it gives you something. But you have to, I think in some sense, you have to penalize lack of reversibility. For example, I mean, you start things like, if you think of something like a funk metric or a Think of something like a funk metric or a Hilbert metric, okay? A funk metric. In the Boosman case, the Funk metric has, you know, the Funk metric on a convex body. I think it's finite. It's finite. But you have this thing is going to be, you know, you have infinite distances in tons of directions. So it's sort of strange. We have a question from Sergei Ivanov. We have a question from Sergei Ivanov. Oh, thank you. Hi, Juan Karl. So I'm maybe a stupid question. I was kind of lost in volume inequalities between the manifold and symmetrization. This was only to Holmes about Holmes-Thompson definition, right? Both of them. Yeah, yeah. Of course, you can try doing something like that in the other definition as well. Okay. Definition as well, okay. Uh-huh. Um, so the yeah, you do it in the tangent bundle, not in the cotangent. You apply Bruninkovsky, and I forgot the other shepherd in the cortangent in the cotangent bundle, yes, yes. Oh, yeah, I see, I see. So, so in the symmetrizations can make the cortangent ball larger. Cortangent ball larger, and therefore the volume can be larger but not too much larger, right? This is exactly, yeah. Yeah, oh, thanks. Now I get it. If you try to do it in the tangent bundle for the for you have to add the Hamiltonians, but adding Hamiltonians apart from, let's say, if both Hamiltonians have the same, have some integral of motion in common, the sum also has integral of motion in common. Also has the integral of motion in common. But geometrically, it's not so clear what adding that Hamiltonians give. Thank you. Are there further questions? Here we go. Leo? Yeah. Hi. So you had the definition for volume and for surface. And it was, if I understood correctly, it's a function on. It's a function on the k vectors or on the simple vector of the exterior algebra, right? Yeah, what do you need for this? If I give you a function, would any function define a satisfactory area, let's say? What do you need on this function to be called an area? Yeah, well, I wrote a big, a big paper on that. It's called Volumes and Areas on Normed and Finstler Spaces and so on. You need lots. You need lots of things. For example, if you want your areas to be sort of intrinsic, you basically have to define them through definition of volume. You have to first define the volume of a Finsler manifold, because then every time you have a sub-manifold, it inherits a Finsler metric, and you want the area in the ambient space to be the same thing as the volume of the intrinsic metric on your manifold. Symmetric on your manifold. That's basically, well, that's one of the things. So you want a definition of volume, really. And then your definition of volume has to have a few things. It has to be... By volume, you mean like volume form also? Like volume form on the tangent space at each point. Yeah, exactly. You take n vectors, simple n vectors. So you have to volume vectors. So you take n vectors, and you want to associate to every n vector. Associate to every n vector a positive number. And then there are some conditions on this, which are basically you want, for example, some sort of monotonicity. You want the volume of a in a bigger metric, you want the volume to be bigger, stuff like that. Okay. And you want, well, there are lots of, you know, in that paper, Thompson and I do it a bit axiomatically. So we think of these things. Axiomatically. So we think of these things as sort of functors on the space of norms, on norm spaces, because you have a norm space, and then you want, you have a norm, you have norm spaces of dimension n, and then you want to go to norms in dimension one. So that's a volume. Or you have norm spaces of dimension n, and you want to have another norm in the space in a space of dimension n, which is the n minus one vectors in lambda n minus one. You want to have, and so you have to think of these things. And so, you have to think of these things. If you think of these things functorially, then it turns out there are lots and lots, okay, of possible definitions. And it's not so easy to understand which one is good or not. An experiment I did once was, for example, totally geodesics of manifolds are minimal in Riemannian geometry. That's not true if you use Fincer geometry and Hausdorff. Sphinzer geometry and Hausdorff measure. You can construct the metric in R3, all of whose geodesics are lines, and therefore all planes are totally geodesic, but not all planes are going to be minimal. But it is true for the Home Thompson. It is true for the Home Thompson. So the Home Thompson in lots of things is nice, but I think one has to keep an open. But I think one has to keep an open mind. Sometimes, if at some point some other metric, some other measure works, it works. They're sort of like different invariants of finster geometry. You have different volumes. It's part of the landscape. Okay. Thanks. Great. Further questions? All right. Thank you very much. Oh, yes, please. I have a question. Okay. First, Christina, I think, is first, yeah? Okay. Uh, Christian, I think, is first, yeah. Okay, I'll be quick. And so, there's something called an area factor. I don't know if you know about it, it's basically you take the uh the housewife measure of a parallel pipa that contains the unit ball. So it would be a parallel pipette containing your convex body. Yeah. And you one, one you take the housewife measure of the ball divided by the house-which measure of the parallel pipette, and that skips what's called an area factor. Yeah, is it that massive? Yeah, isn't that mass star? I mean, that's isn't that Gromov didn't do that? Is this that's not Gromov? That's the Ambrosio Kirheim one. Ah, okay. That's and because in classic convex geometry, there's the one where you take the smallest parallel tope that encloses your convex body and you say that that has area 2 to the power n. And the other one is you take the biggest cross-polytope that is inside your convex body and you say that. Is inside your convex body, and you say that one has area two to the n divided by n factorial, something like that. Okay, and how is it related to your areas? A mass star is bigger than mass star. The one Grove Moff Mass star is bigger than Hom Thompson. The other one, the one from the inside, it's not convex, which means what I'm meaning is hyperplanes are not always minimizers in. Always minimizers in norm spaces for Holmes-Thompson. For mass star, yes, that's Gromo's theorem. It's very good. These K-planes are minimizers. But the one that is dual to MassStar, the one that starts with the cross-polytope from the inside, that one is not. That one is not convex. But the Ambrosio-Kija mass, I mean, this area factor, that's exactly the. Affected, that's exactly the Gromov mass star. And it's also, you need this, otherwise, you don't have lower semi-continuity of the mass, right? If planes are not minimizing, then you wouldn't have any lower semi-continuity of the mass. So the Ambrosio-K-Him mass is exactly the Gromov mass star. Okay, thanks. And the Hobbes-Hobson is always smaller? It's smaller than mass star, always. It's a smaller than S star, always. Yeah. Antonio, do you have a question? Yeah, I have a question. So it was again about this definition of volume. So what is volume, which I find quite interesting. So just to understand, so wouldn't the minimal, so the minimal way of defining volume be through just through Aussie measure? To Hausdorff measure? Yeah, but as I speak, it has some drawbacks, this Hausdorff measure, because, well, one of the drawbacks, you lose the integral geometry. For example. Yeah, okay, say, say, yes. Okay, so for example, you can construct metrics in R3. That's also, I did that with Gautier, and you construct metrics in R3, all of whose genetics are straight lines. R3, all of whose geodesics are straight lines. And however, you don't have a Crofton formula for the area of hypersurfaces. That's one thing. So the other thing is totally geodesic sub-manifolds are not necessarily minimal. That's another sort of bad thing with the house of measure. But then, you know, in other things, it's nice. For example, the house. It's nice. For example, the Hausdorff measure is always bigger than Hom Thompson. And it's equal if and only if the manifold is Riemannian. So if you can prove something with Holm Thompson, then you can get really nice rigidity theorems that way, you know, because of this theorem that the Holm-Thompson is always less than Hausdorff and equality if and only if the manifold is remaining. Sorry, and when you mentioned Sorry, and when you mentioned that you lose the craft on integral geometry, instead with other definitions, you can recover it. No, with Hom Thompson, yes, you have integral geometry. Ah, okay. So that's quite interesting. Yes, of course. I agree. I agree. Okay, thanks. I was just a little bit. And there is this paper that Andreas point is out. I think this is on the This is on the subject. Okay, maybe I'll ask. I'll find it. Okay, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Andres. Good pop. Okay, fantastic. Final questions? Great. Let's thank the speaker again. Throw up a little.
