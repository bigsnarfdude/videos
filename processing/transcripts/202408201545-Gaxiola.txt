Thank you very much. Let me start thanking Osuea and also Jorke and the organizer for the invitation here. Today I want to talk a little bit about quantum walks on graphs. So first let me tell you something about the motivation. Something about the motivation, why I'm trying to speak here about this. The motivation is a very personal motivation, very, very personal. Yeah. This thing, many, many years ago, seven years ago, I was visiting Professor Obata from Tohoku University in Japan. I was doing my PhD, and I was only visiting him to find something which we can. we wish we can we can work on it but he introduced me to another another professor uh professor segagua seguagua was working with with kono professor and they they they told and segagua told me about this quantum quantum vaults on graph so but i did nothing after that i did nothing about this about this this stuff and when jorge told me about the uh givea uh Give a talk here, I said, like, okay, maybe it's a good time to retake this project, a very, very personal project. But please feel free to interrupt me if I say something wrong, because this is not my topic. And I only want to obtain something from you, to me, to do something. is to do something. So let me tell you about the objective. The objective of this talk is to introduce quantum worlds on graphs and say something about or try to convince you why this is important to study. The other one is set some difference between random walks and quantum walks. A little bit difference. There are a lot of difference, but some difference. Some difference. And show techniques, show one technique used here by solving a related problem used by Konos, Obata, and Sega Guasan. And they use this technique called quantum decomposition of graphs, this method. So I want to show something of this. And the other one is find people in this workshop who are interested in collaborating and being able to use their expertise. able to use the expertise. This is the, if someone wants to do something in this way, feel free to approach me and let's talk about it. Okay? So what is a quantum walk? Quantum walk is a quantification quantum version of a random walk. A random walk is a stochastic process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space. Okay? Okay, quantum walls are the quantum variations of these random walks. Random walks are found in many, many applications in computer science. And of course, as analogous, quantum bulks on graphs are considered in the spirit of developing some techniques in quantum computation. So, quantum for quantum algorithm. Okay, let me first talk about this quantum walk on the line. This is a The line. This is a quantum ball related to workers and Binis and some collaborators. It's just as analogous. If you have a particle in the line, for instance, if you have a particle in the random walks is if you want, you can go right or left according to flip coin, and then you can go right there. In the same sense, That okay, in the same sense, uh, or in the value sense in quantum work, you can you can lean in every everywhere you want at the same time in each step. So it's this is the spirit of the quantum walks. So let's start with this space of R and L, with this vector, is like right and left. The other one is a classical state, this pair. state this pair n in z and d in in this sigma okay uh this quantum state is this this these vectors in the in l2 of c tensor the l2 of the sigma and this forms an orthonormal basis for for uh hilbert space and this each of these states is identified with the classical state and d And D. And we define, or we have this Hadamard transform that I think you really know about this transform. So if we have this one, we can, okay, maybe how we can apply the Hallabar transform to the direction component of this particle. So it's called this chirality in this way. Okay? And And we have this translation operator. Do you have special names for these operators? I don't know exactly how you call it, momentum and this position and momentum situation. Direction. So we define this W as this operator that this operator here is called the represent one step in the Hadaban wall, one step. So if we want to do a So if we want to do a n-step or t-step walk, quantum walk or Hadam work, we apply n times or t times this operator. Okay? So this is a Hadamard walk in the line. So let's start with this two-way infinite time Hadamer walk in the line. We don't have barriers. We can do whatever we can go right, left according to this. According to this quantum coin flip. So we initialize the system in the classical state zero. Okay. And for any chooses numbers of steps t, we apply this operator to the system t times and observe the location of the particle. Okay? That's Hadamard work. Okay, here we this this these and binis obtain this theorem that it that says that if p is uh pi t is the uniform distribution in the in the set set of z this integers in this interval so there is a constant for such that this this and sufficiently large t this This probability, this probability means like the probability being too far from this, the uniform distribution is very small. Okay? So it is more like the position of the particle after many steps, sufficient steps, is only uniform distributed. This is a it's very different from the from the It's very different from the classical walk, the random walk, because this distribution is the particle tends to go to infinity. And here is uniform, almost uniform distributed in the line. So, okay? So, this is the first one. So, the second problem that they started in this paper. Stated in this in this paper was the semi-fiddle Hadamard walk. You put a barrier in zero and you initialize the system in the state in the state of the number one and you apply the Hadamard transform or the Hadamard walk and you observe accordingly if the particle is in the in the zero or not. You observe not. So if the result If the result of this measurement was yes, then the process ends. And if not, repeat the step two. Okay? So they obtained this theorem that says that the probability that the measure of whatever the particle is at the location zero eventually results in the answer, yes, is two over pi. This is this. This is different from the classical situation because the classical situation, this probability tends to one very fast, by the way. So this means that a huge bunch of particles stay in infinite states. So if we add If we add another another another barrier, we have this finite Haderma walk. We start in the same state one, and if we put a barrier in the state zero and another one in the state n, we do the same. We made a mesh. We made a measurement, and if the result is yes, the process ends, and if not, you continue with it, you do again the second step. Okay? So here the results are that if we set this Pn, the probability that process exits to the left, that the particle is in the state zero, and the Qn is the probability that the process. Qn is the probability that the process exits to the right, the particle is in the state N. The sum of these two probabilities is one, okay? But here we have this limiting behavior that the probability of the particle to reach the state zero is one over the square root of two. This is surprising because this particle. This is surprising because this probability is greater than the last one. This one? Okay. So it means that if you have one barrier process, so you have this probability. But if you put another barrier, you have more events staying in the barriers in the zero barrier. In the barriers, in the zero barrier. So, this is different. You know, I think that you really know, you, the audience, know why this is very different from the random vault, the classical random vault. This is because one situation that is present here in this kind of process is called interference or something like that. Quantum interference, something like that. interference or something like that i don't know exactly the name of of this this situation but it's this this this is why we have these very different situations different from the the classical the classical random bulbs okay w is the the this this one uh q Is this operator here? This one. This is the Hadamard transform, and this is the identity. And this T is the translation operator. So this is called the Hadamor walk. It's one step. Is what one step this W is one step of the Hadamobo. Okay. So let me tell you something before I talk about the technique that Obata, Segagua and Kono used to solve this one problem in a very specific kind of graph. Specific kind of graphs. Let me tell you something about quantum decomposition of graphs. What does it mean? What do the composition do? If we have a graph, we made a stratification of the vertex, of the set of vertices, fixing one vertex. We have one distinguished vertex called make the root if you want, and you made it. We can make this stratification taking the distance between the root and the others. Let me tell you what is this graph. We have this graph, and this is the distinguished vertices called the root. And we can have this. So this is only V0. This one is the set B1 because it's the same. the the the set b1 because it is the the first level they are the the the vertice vertices that are a distance one from the from the root and this one this this this this no this one are the two and so on okay this is the stratification okay so I don't know with three. Yeah, it has cycles here. We have like we only choose the distance is the length of the minimum path, the smallest path between them. Yeah? Okay. Okay. So we actually say that a hybrid space to this certification. To this stratification by these vectors here. These vectors are called, okay, if we define these vectors, these vectors form an orthogonal basis from this space, this direct sum. Some so and we define these adjacency these matrices adjacency matrices it could be this by this repetition we we have one if x and y are related or are neighbor but if the distance if this this according to this this notation is always the same notation that we use in the That we use in the first day, this epsilon. So, if we have that x and y are in different levels, so if, but this is in level B n for instance, and this is in level B n minus one. So in the A minus X. minus xy is one. Okay? For instance, here if let me tell you like this is x and this is y so a let me cycle x y is one because they are in the same level, the same strato, and they are related in the in the rack. Okay? Okay, so that's why, and if this theta a xz okay is zero, but a a xc x is one. Okay, uh, do you see this? Okay, do you see this? Everybody, I'm sorry if you don't look. Okay, so this is called the quantum decomposition of the adjacency matrix. It's A plus plus A minus plus A circle. Okay? Okay, maybe I can, I will, I will say A DAGA, something like that. A DAGA, something like that, because it's related to an interacting Hilbert focus space. In general, this Hilbert space is not invariant under the action of A epsilon, but it's very, very, we have special cases. For instance, this space is variant under these sections when we have distance regular graph. Distance regular graph that is something that you are interested in. And there are another one that there are other spaces that are not invariant, but they are asymptotically invariant under these sections. So we can find many, many properties and we can study of this thing. You can look for this in the book of Hora Onobata called Hora on the batter called spectral analysis of RAS and the quantum decomposition. So, okay, this is the quantum decomposition. Okay, let me define these omegas, omega sub epsilon, as the number of vertices that are in the level related to with this epsilon in the for each. In the for each x, for instance, here for this x omega plus of x is two because it has two omega minus x is one and omega simple is one. Because of this. Okay? So, okay? This, these, uh, this proposition is if the Hilbert space related to the graph is invariant under the actions of the A epsilon, if and only if these omegas are constant in each level. If we have this constant, If we have this constant, this space is invariant on the reaction of the quantum decomposition, the action of the quantum decomposition. When we have distance, this irregular, this is constant, of course, because if you don't have loops, if you don't have, if you don't have, you can have, but when you are just irregular, the that you are distant regular the these omegas are almost are the same okay so uh if you if we look at this okay if we have this invariance we can so uh we can write the action of the a plus in in each vector as this uh sum sum of all The sum of all the vertices in the next level, okay, normalized by this quantity. And the A minus can be written as the sum of the omegas plus of the numbers of vertices in the last level, the level below. And this one. And this one is the same level, the same decomposition of the same structure, but in the same level, with the vertices in the same level. If we have these numbers, and if we have that the space is a variant of the actual A plus, A minus, of the A star cycle, then this entropy is an This entropy is an interactive box space, and the A circle is a diagonal operator. And this is important. The associated Jacobi coefficient is given by these numbers. So we can compute the Jacobi coefficients only if we have this invariance in the graph. We can compute these numbers. And I think that the simplest... I think that the simplest example is just regular. That's why. But it's not the only example. We can have something special asymptotically. Okay? How many minutes do we have? Okay. Okay, let's talk about global work on graph. This this omega n is, I mean, it's the this it's given by by this number, the number of vertices in the in the in one level what level under on the the the level that the the the y is why why do we can we can we can write here and anything what we wanted in the in this level because it's is is this okay the variance the variance exactly exactly the invariance yeah that's why that's why if we don't have a variance we can do something else but not in the library we can do something In the library, we can do something. Okay, let's talk about rubber walks. That is almost the same as the hard armor walks in the lab. It's almost the same. We start with a graph. We define this set of, this is called the set of directed edges. I don't remember exactly the name, but if the fact that the pair But it definitely that the pair u v is in the set if u is connected to v in the in the graph. And we define a huge space by this, the whole quadratics, summable quadratics of this set of vectors. We define this inner product and any unit vector in this space is called, it's an estate. Is called it's an estate. Okay? And this is the these vectors here, these deltas uv forms an autonomous basis. And if we have one, if we take one vertex in the any vertex, we define this h u as the expanded by the all the all the. By all the vectors of the rack here, with all the vertices related or neighbors of u. And we can make this decomposition, this direct sum of every space related to each one of the vertices. Okay? With this in mind, we can define the group. We can define the Grover operator by this inner product. And we define the coin flip operator by this sum of over all the vertices that are related to you. And this point flip operator is almost the same as the T in. It plays the same role, plays the same role as the T in the Hadamard vault. And this shift operator plays the same role as the Hadamard transform. Okay, and this operator U is this is called the Grover vault in any graph. But at this moment, we are interested in moment we we are interested in in a special kind of raft called spider uh this is the definition of a spider net but a spider net it could be uh thinking about uh as uh almost regular regular tree almost regular i mean it it almost regular only the the the root can can have can have uh different different degree Degree from the other vertices, but only the root and all of the other vertices have the same degree. And these spider editions, you can add large cycles in the tree, but only in the same level. Let me show you how this is an infinite, infinite. This is an infinite, infinite graph because of this, this, okay, because of this, this number here. This number, the C, the C. It's an infinite. Let me show you how. Let me write if we have a this three. etc okay this is a a spider net but this is a tree it's a regular tree actually but if but by and with this definition we can add And with this definition, we can add a cycle here. This is still a spider net because, but only the cycle is in the same level. This cycle is in the level one. Okay? We can add another one here, for instance, in the second level. Yeah. And this one? No, the other one? Yeah, yeah. And this is a spider net. You have the two cycles. This is a spider net. And that's the definition of the spider. No? Okay. But you can see here that this is almost almost the space will be or it seems to be almost invariant, but it's not invariant, not necessarily, but it's almost invariant. Okay? But what this is meant in Okay, but with this in the mind, we can initialize our global walk in this initial state defined by this sum over all the neighbors of the root. And if we set this P, Q and R by this constant this constant came comes comes from the definition of the spider net. The definition of the spider net. So, Kono of Atanzegagua found that the distribution with respect, I mean, this, you have a special name for this. You call it this. I don't remember the name of it. Okay. But this is, this has a special name. And it's given by this expression where this mu. This mu is the free Maxwell law with parameters q, pq, and r. And let me tell you very quickly what is the free maximum law. If we have this density, no, you is the rover wall. Yeah, you is the rover wall. And if you want an n-step rover walk, you apply u n times to the initial state. It's analogous to the Padma world. So, free Maxner Maxwell laws, if you have this density here, and you can also add these two mass points, at most two of them. And this is called the Free Maxder law. Okay, you can see here, a very important situation about this Free Max law is the coefficient, the coefficient, the Jacobi coefficient. The Jacobi coefficient are given by the first one, omega one is p, and the other one omegas are q. And the first one of alpha one is zero, and all of the other ones are a. Okay? You can see here, if we take p and q equal both to one and a equal zero, we have this. This semicircular law. Yeah, with coefficients, coefficient 1, 1, 1, 1, and 0. This is the semicircular law. So the semicircular law is a special case of Free Magnet. And if we have P and Q just greater than zero and A equal to zero, we have the Kester distribution. We have the Kest distribution that appears in these words from Kesten and Mackay in random graph. So, okay. Maybe I don't have so many. Okay. Let me tell you, I won't be able to finish what I want to say, but let me tell you something about this situation. This Dijacobi coefficient appears in the Digacovic coefficients appear in the proof of this theorem that Kono about and say, well, because of this quantum decomposition that they made from the action of these operators of this one, this operator here, the coin, the flick point, and the transl and the. And the and the translation and the translation or the shift, you can say this, this one. And this looks like very as an interacting Fox space. And then from this, you can obtain the coefficients. And also these coefficients came from these orthogonal polynomials here. Okay, this is, but they use this quantum deep. use this uh quantum walk this this pq quantum walks on the only in the integers in the in the positive integers and they related this this one to the the the robert walks they they say that it's the same okay the robert walk is on a spider net restricted to a closed super space spanned by this this uh uh size here it's it's just a peak It's just a PQ quantum wall, okay? It's a kind of, it's almost a Hadamire wall in the line, but only in the half, in the same half line. Okay? This one, this one, this one, this one, and tell you some questions that I have. I mean, these questions, maybe they are not open problems. I don't know exactly, but these are questions that I... These are questions that are in my mind at this moment. Okay, let me tell you. That's why. Okay, I didn't talk about localization. Segawa, Cono, and Novata worked on this kind of specifically phenomenon called localization. Localization is a special Carrisation is a special phenomenon that occurs in some kind of graphs. They characterize which kind of spider nets show this localization phenomenon, and they define also the exponential localization or localization exponentially. I don't remember exactly. And I have the question that where we can find another kind of families of graphs which Which show this kind of localization, localization and exponential localization. Okay, this one is one, and the other one is this is not working. Okay, graph showing asymptotic localization. I don't know exactly if this makes sense for all of you. And other kind of behaviors. of behaviors that appears in the quantum in the quantum environment and what about graph product if we can say something about the the behavior of the quantum walls on graph product just knowing the the the behavior of the of the quantum walls in each of of the of the graph and then if there are any others If there are any other questions that you have, you can imagine about this topic. Thanks. So, this works on grammar we get some discrete probability distribution. Discrete probability distributions on the graph. Are there cases where you get continuous distributions as well? Exactly. In the limit. So you mentioned the same circular law can come as a limit distribution for these things. Like maybe Gaussian also can come as it can. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. can yeah yeah yeah but i don't in in uh if if you associate a distribution to a graph or or and a growing graph you you each one of these graphs has a discrete discrete probability and you can obtain the limited this this uh semi-sQL allow for instance or something continuous continuously. But in the sense of quantum bots, I don't know exactly. I don't know. But I think that it's possible. But I think that it's possible. It is possible to approximate something like that. But certain distributions can come as limits, others cannot. Or whether the limits have been classified? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Okay, I was thinking in the other way. No, no, no, not only. You know another classes of droughts? Only in the limit, asymptotically. But but not another one. The distant regular graphs are default space seem fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's because the proposition of these omegas, they are constants. I don't know. I know asymptotically, but not in the I don't know about the variance in. Know about the variance besides the distance regular. I don't know. Can you show again the density of this mice free mice? And the the so di uh this is uh uh the most gener because I remember that Bozeko and Brick introduced reminds yeah and this is the most general remice or there are other other ones uh I think that this I don't know this is this the more general I think that this is what is general but you can I mean this is not only you could you can I mean, this is not only you can add these two points, these two mass points. Up to the addition of the atom. Exactly. This atom. Yeah. And you say that this has the Jacobi coefficients is omega n is constant after n equal to. The alpha n is just alpha one, it's zero, then it's constant. Yeah. So essentially, this is a An asymmetric version of the arcsine because if you put all alpha A equal to zero, you get arcs. The arcine is this problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And in more general the case distribution is more general than that. Okay, so this is for arbitrary. This is for arbitrary P and Q. No relation between P and Q. No, no, no, no. Essentially, not. Possibly not. Thank you. So let's thanks speaker again.
