Presentation, yeah, so okay, so let's start. Let me first explain what is the title of my talk: Finite Dimensional Erection of Dissipative Dynamical Systems. So, effectively, it means we have always some evolution equation, let it be this abstract equation one. And this equation, it lives on some phase space. So this is the space where the initial condition lives. Let's call this space X. It's here. And so to this equation, there corresponds. There corresponds some dynamical system. So, this is this picture. So, dynamical system, very roughly speaking, means that you have some solutions u parametrized by time t. And so, dissipative system, it means that you have, it always means you have some kind of absorbing set. It means you have some bounded set which absorbs all the solutions for large enough times. Large enough times. And moreover, you also typically have the situation that there is a so-called global attractor. So there is some kind of uniquely defined limit set which is compact and invariant with respect to dynamics. Okay, so this is the typical situation, the typical picture of what I mean by dissipative dynamical system. And I want to speak about the projection or reduction, finite dimensional reduction. Finite dimensional reduction, so it means that I want to have some kind of really projection which takes everything to some set, say some compact set K in Rn. Okay, so now you are in some blank space, now you are in Rn and really my idea is if here is some dynamics, some solutions on the attractor, then I would like to have some. Then I would like to have some corresponding solutions here in the finite-dimensional setting. So it's like here is a PDE world and I would like to have some ODE reduction of this PDE. So maybe two points to emphasize. One point is that if the projection If the projection, I mean, the projection is important, but what is really important is kind of the quality of the inverse. For the projection to really be true, it must be invertible. And for the projection to have some good properties, I want that the inverse is somehow regular. So, ideally, Lipschitz inverse would be perfect. And maybe the second point, in some sense, the global attractor is too small object for the description of the large term dynamics. So I would like to have some better set, which is possibly larger, but which gives a better description of the long-time dynamics. Something like, for example, the exponential attractor. So the exponential attractor, which Exponential attractor, which I will not give the definition, but exponential attractor, you can think about it as something like enlargement of the global attractor, something which is larger, so it attracts the dynamics faster, but it still has good properties. For example, it has finite Hausdorff dimension or something like that. Okay, so this is my picture. Now I wanted Now I wanted to show you this table of some overview of results because there are many results of various type for various equations and of various strength, I would say. So in this table, in the first column, I have always say the type of the result. In the second column, I try to describe what is needed. Describe what is needed for this type of result, meaning what is needed on the part of the equation. And last column are some examples. So in first row concerning the existence of global attractor, so what is needed to prove the existence of global attractor? Essentially, what you need is you definitely need a global existence of solution, and you need some dissipativity. Solution, and you need some dissipativity, so you need to prove that the solutions are bounded for long times, and you need some kind of asymptotic compactness. And this is something you can really prove for many fluids. We have seen yesterday in talk of Eduard Feyerizel that even for some very complicated fluids with stochastic forcing, you can still have all these results. And if you have all these results, you can define some. Results: you can define some in some sense the attractor, at least the trajectory attractor you can define for such a fluid. I will come later to what is meant by trajectory attractor. I will also explain this. So, I mean, this first row is very optimistic. You can prove it for many fluids. But of course, I want stronger results. So, I want to show that the attractor not only exists, I want to show it has some, in a sense, finite dimension. In a sense, finite dimension, like finite Hauser dimension, for example. I want to show there is an exponential attractor, I want to show this projection is well defined. So to prove something like this, I need more of my equation. I need definitely at least uniqueness, but I also need, concerning this finite dimension, I need some higher regularity of the ST, ST is the solution semi-group. So I need uniqueness, I need some more regularity. I need uniqueness, I need some more regularity. And this is, of course, more difficult to prove. So, very roughly speaking, typically, just in 2D situation concerning at least the fluid dynamics, you can have uniqueness, you can have this regularity. Fluids, I would say some 2D fluids, yes, some, and I should maybe emphasize incompressible because in compressible situations it's even more difficult. It's even more difficult. So many 2D fluids, some even 3D fluids, you can prove this. Okay, and finally, concerning the, so to say, kind of best possible result on the finite dimensional reduction is the existence of inertia manifolds. It means that you have really kind of embedding of the attractor to a Lichitz manifold. And this is the best result I can hope for, but this is at this. Is at this at this moment, it's impossible to get because you need some kind of special condition on the spectrum of the operator, and it's generally known that this holds only in one-dimensional situation. So it's not applicable even to 2D maverast talks. It's not known. Okay, I left some space here. So I would like to now say what will be my topic today. So I would like to speak a little bit. So I would like to speak a little bit about so-called Lipschitz manifold with delay. I will explain later what is meant by this. So, this is another kind of concept of finite-dimensional reduction of the dynamics. What you need to prove the existence of this kind of delayed manifold. Delayed manifold. So it turns out that very generally it is enough to have the so-called smoothing property of the flow. I will also explain it later. And what is good about this is that pretty much under all these situations, you can also prove this kind of result. Yeah. So not in all situations, but in many situations which are which are which are like two D fluids with some regularity, some 3D fluids. Okay, I want to list some references concerning the table. So there are many books and many papers on this topic. I listed just a few of them. So for example, concerning So, for example, concerning the attractors, there are at least these three classical books by Taman, by Ladizhenska, or by Hale, concerning the finite dimension of the attractor and concerning exponential attractors, etc. Also, concerning inertia manifolds, you can look to books by Konstantin. Books by Konstantin Voash, Eden, and others, etc. Okay, I promised to say something about trajectory attractors, so at least here are some references and I will maybe explain this in a moment. Okay, I also listed some Listed some interesting results from the Russian school. There are nice papers by Romanov about concerning inertia manifolds. And there are some interesting recent results by Sergei Jalik and his collaborators concerning this. And the last line, these are some references concerning these manifolds with delay. Manifolds with delay. So I will come to this topic in a moment. Maybe now I would like to explain the concept of trajectory attractors or the dynamics of trajectories. So let me go a little. Yeah. So this is again just explaining by the means of the picture. So, again, here is my evolution equation, and the standard way to describe the dynamics is using this operator st. So, this operator ST or this semi-group. So, these are just the usual solution operators. Solution operator. So, as long as you have uniqueness, you can define this operator which to any initial condition assigns. Any initial condition assigns the value of the solution at time t. But what is the dynamics of trajectories? So the trick is simple. You can just, instead of the points, you are just looking at the pieces of the solution. So you can call them trajectories. And L T is the analogy of this semi-group, but working on the trajectories. So it's something like let's call this trajectory semi-group. Let's call this trajectory semi-group. Yeah, and here, here, the important parameter is the length of the trajectory L. So the question is, how long should the trajectory be? Because it can be actually long, it can be short, it can be even infinite. So it really depends in which situation you are. And one important, I mean, One important, I mean, you can have trajectories of zero length, which are just the points in the original phase space, but you can have also infinite trajectories. And these infinite trajectories are, they are usually used in a situation where you have no uniqueness. Basically, I would say the rule is that as long as there is a unique continuation, you can just kind of end the trajectory. But if you have no uniqueness, you need to work with infinite trajectories, and it's also. Work with infinite trajectories, and it's also okay. Yeah, so without going to some technical details, I would just say that this description with trajectories is in many situations more, say, more convenient from the point of view that you can prove better properties about this semi group than for the initial ST semi group. For example, compactness is easier to get here than for the solution semi group, etcetera. For the solutions I might, etc. Okay, so let me go back to my kind of abstract setting. So I said I would like to, sorry, by the way, what is the time at this moment? I'm a bit five minutes, six minutes. Five minutes, six minutes. Okay, okay. Yeah, so. Yeah, so let me go to this. So I promised that I will say something about the existence of Lipschitz manifolds using the smoothing property. So good. So here is the definition. So smoothing property, it's a property of some operator S on space X. So I say the operator has smoothing property on some set B if there is another space Y. There is another space Y, which is compactly embedded to X, such that there is a Lichitz continuity of the operator from X to Y. So this is the smoothing property. And there is a simple lemma which says that if you have two spaces Y compactly embedded to X and you have some arbitrary small epsilon, then you have always there exists. Then you have always there exists finite-dimensional projection p such that you can estimate the norm in x by some small piece of norm in y plus some constant and this projection absolute value. This is norm in Rn, so I write it as absolute value. So this is kind of very simple lemma from functional analysis. And now the theorem I have is that if the operator have is that if the operator S1, so let's think of the solution semi-group at time one, if this solution semi-group has smoothing property on the global attractor, then I can construct the Lipschitz, the so-called Lipschitz inertial manifold with delay. So what I mean by this, again, it's explained on the picture and proven at the same time. So imagine that you are on the attractor A here and we have two solutions. So let's maybe u is this solution Ut and V is solution V T and so let these points be the value of the solution at time zero. So this is this difference and I want to estimate this somehow using the values of the projection here in the space Rn. Rn. So I'm here in Rn and these trajectories are just the projections of these trajectories. And so what I do, I use first the smoothing property here. It says that the y norm is estimated by x norm at the previous times. And then I use the lemma. So here I use the smoothing property. And here I use the lemma from the previous. Use the lemma from the previous slide, and I just estimate this norm by a small piece of the y-norm and the projection. And then I repeat this. So then I just repeat the estimate for this. And I go further back and back, and you realize that you can just using these points, and then again at time minus two, and then again at time minus three. and then again at time minus three etc you can you can really estimate you can really estimate this left hand side by some finite sum and a small piece of the y norm and if you know if you now take the limit if you now take the limit n goes to infinity you of course this this disappears and you will have some infinite sum here but what But what is this infinite sum? It really somehow measures the difference of these solutions, the history of the difference of these two solutions. And what is interesting is that we have some kind of exponentially decaying factor here. Because this is somehow smaller and smaller if you go to the past. So if I'm just very quickly say what I obtained. Say what I obtain. So, this was my PDE, my original PDE on the attractor, and what I'm able to obtain is some kind of ODE using this projection, but it has a delay. At least in the nonlinear term, it depends on the complete past history of this projection. But the good point is that it slipsheets because of this construct. Because of this construction. Yeah, so I think I should be very close to the end of my time. So let me just mention one example of fluid which is of some interest to us recently and which would be good candidate to this kind of abstract framework. And it's really this example of nonlinear fluid with dynamic boundary condition. So what I have So, what I have here in some domain omega, I have just incompressible fluid with the pressure and the stress tensor S. And let's think for just simplicity that the stress tensor is something like this, some general nonlar relation. And moreover, what is important for this fluid, I have this kind of dynamic. I have this kind of dynamic boundary condition. It's dynamic because you have time derivative on the boundary also. And you have some prescription on normal and tangential part. So this is some kind of fluid for which you can have kind of good existence theory. You can also prove uniqueness at least in 2D, but it's probably. It's probably difficult to get higher regularity and even in 2D, but I mean, but it's still enough regularity for us to get this kind of result that we can reduce the dynamics to the infinite system of delayed equations or delayed ODEs. So it's a fluid which would kind of fit, say, Kind of fit, say, to this last line of my table. Okay, so I think I have finished my talk and also my time. So that's all. And thank you for the. Okay, thank you for a nice talk, Talibor. Good one. So there are some questions, comments? I might add a comment if it's possible. Yes, first of all, I think. First of all, I think it's important to mention when you talk about trajectory attractors that there was a lot of work by Vysik and his group. In fact, there's a book by Vysik and Chibyshov at the end of the before Vishk died about projector attractors. So this is very important to mention their effort there because you mentioned the Russian school. Yeah, this is the thing. And the thing about inertial manifold with the About inertial manifold with delay that you mentioned, yeah. One of the purposes of inertial manifold was to do reduction, namely from PDE to ODE. That's what's the purpose of inertial manifold. And when you do this delay, as you mentioned, this work of the Bush and Timam, which gives you a differential delay equation, which is in principle, it's an infinite dimension dynamical system because it lives in the space of functions rather than. functions rather than with initial value which is an Rn. Initial value would be a function on a small interval of time and that's why it's some sense it's a reduction from infinite dimensional to infinite dimensional but with different twist so that's basically what is the conclusion that you have in that case you are right yeah it's infinite dimensional space but you can you can at least say there is this kind of exponential There is this kind of exponentially dying weight in this industry. I understand. Yeah, so this is the other thing I want to mention: there's recent work for the last, I would say, five, eight years by Hoyash, Jolly, and myself and company. We call it determining form, in which we have shown that there is a map. In fact, this map is fresh differentiable, in fact, it is analytic, in which if you give me the whole history of the low modes, you can recover the solutions. You can recover the solutions. So, there is a map which takes you from the low modes, but the whole history to the full solutions. In particular, it determines the attractors in a unique fashion, this particular map. Of course, it does not give you finite dimensional reduction. The advantage of this map is that one can investigate it further and one can show that there is only one parameter that distinguishes. Parameter that distinguishes one element in the trajectory of the attractor from another. So maybe you want to search about determining forms, and then you can see lots of work in that sense. So in some sense, we claim that turbulent flows are determined by one parameter. It's an abstract parameter, namely that we show there is one parameter which determines or distinguishes one element in the attractor from another element of the one trajectory, not element, one trajectory in the attractor. So, this is recent work in the last five, six years by Frees, Jolly, myself, and co-workers. Yeah, I know this result of yours. I'm sorry not to put in all the this. No, no, no, I just mentioned no, because it is consistent with what with your philosophy. No, I I didn't mean that it's impossible in twenty minutes to to cover everybody. So I'm not complaining. I just basically want you to make comment on the on the on your beautiful lecture, that's all. On your beautiful lecture, that's all. There is some time for short questions. If someone has so if not, so then I have a question concerning the last slide. Can you put the last slide? This one? No, no, the last one, not this one. So, my question concerns this dynamic boundary condition. What is the difference in general? Condition. What is the difference in general in dynamics as we would take just standard non-slip boundary condition and this dynamical boundary condition? So, what is the essential difference between them? Well, this is definitely one of the questions we would like to understand. Where is the, I mean,
