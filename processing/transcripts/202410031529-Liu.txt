So this topic with diameter is the coloring of graphs. Um so we call the veraces. So we just say pay coloring is the coloring on the veraces, but let's only use p-colors in photo. And Louis has already talked about something about monochromatic component and it's the same terminology here. So whenever we have a k coloring, you can consider monochromatic component, which is just a component of the subgraph induced by a color graph. So, the proper K coloring shows coloring such that every modeling component has only one vertex. But in this toggle, we don't want to consider proper coloring. We want to consider improper coloring. Now, we don't want to color the vertices such that every model component has only white vertex. We just want to make it look having white vertex. We want to use smaller number of colors. And there are many ways to say how your graph. Many ways to say how your graph or modeling component looks like a one-fortex graph. You can say, okay, size one, or you can say maximum degree zero, or you can say diameter zero. So if you use different points of view, you get a different kind of improper color. So for example, you can ask this question. So I give you a graph G and I want to find the minimum K such that this graph has a K coloring such that every molon component has boundary size. Boundary size. You need to find the integer n, such as that the size of the morning components at the most n. And that's the class of coloring that Louis just mentioned. And if you consider another notion, if you treat, if you feel the graph as boundary maximum degree graph, then you get another improper color called a defective color. That's called a circuit matching on Boundary. And you can also consider diameter. So that's basically the topic of this token. Topic of this talk. But when we ask this question, we should be careful. So we should consider dependence with this graph G and the integer n here. So if you allow this integer n to be the number of vertices of the graph, then you just need one color. It's not interesting. You can also ask a question that n depends on the graph G, maybe say n is the log of G. Then it's a reasonable question as well. But in this talk, we will consider the case when n is independent with the graph G. Case when n is independent with the graph. N should be an absolute constant. But to make it make sense, we need to consider graph class instead of just one graph. So the question we really want to ask is that, given a set of graphs, we want to find a minor k such that there exists a constant n only depending on the class F, such that every graph in this class has a K coloring, such that every modeling component has size at the most n, or maximum. The most n, or maximum degree of most n, or diameter at the most n. And Louis just talked about exactly the case when the component has on this size with minor cross families. Actually, KD minimum free graphs. Okay. So this talk is all minor cross family. I think I don't need to define what the minor is, and I don't need to define minor cross families. Just a class of graphs that's cross-undertaking minor. If we have a graph G that belongs to this class, and I know I have another graph. This class, and I know I have another graph H, it's a minor of the first guy, then the second guy is also in this class. There are just tons of concrete examples about minor cross-families. You can define it by using topological conditions or spectral conditions, and the people consider how we go contribute to a special case for coloring where I think minor cross-family. Okay, so I don't want to, I mean, how we girls are still open. I mean, I can approve it. We girls are still open. I mean, I cannot prove it. But this talk is about improper coloring of minor cross families. Just try to reduce the number of colors if you allow improper coloring. So in this talk, we focus on weak diameter coloring. So what's the weak diameter? So we first fixed the graph G, and the weak diameter is the parameter defining on a subgraph of this graph G or subset of G Graph G or a subset of vertices. They are the same. So formally, the weak diameter in G of a subgraph of G is the maxima distance between any two vertices in the graph, in H, but you should compute the distance in the whole graph G instead of compute the distance in the subgraph H. But if you compute the distance in the subgraph H, then you get the diameter. If you compute it in the whole graph G, If you compute it in the whole graph G, then it's called weak diameter. That's the terminology we use here. So weak diameter and diameter can be very different. Because if you take a very long path and add a new vertex adjacent to all other brackets in the path, you call the whole graph G and this long path H, and the diameter is huge, but the weak diameter is two. So it's pretty different. And usually, so weak diameter is what I use. So, weak diameter is what I use in graph theory, but then like in magic geometry, people usually just say diameter. Like materials talk, just use diameter. But I prefer to say weak diameter to avoid the confusion. So, we want to consider weak diameter coloring. So, we say a coloring has weak diameter at the most end if it is a coloring such that every model component has weak diameter at the most end. So, this weak diameter. So, this weak diameter coloring actually is considered earlier. So, it was studied in distributed computing. They started something called the weak diameter network decomposition. So, they want to decompose the network into parts with small weak diameter so they can communicate inside the parts quickly and then communicate with different parts. And also, this notion is closely related to the asymptotic dimension starting the metric geometry. So, Andrew just mentioned it. So, the NGOs just mention it. But I don't want to define it asynchronous dimension here. But basically, asyncomic dimension is just a large-scale weak diameter color. You need to consider weak diameter coloring for the powers of the graph. Okay, so we are interested about this parameter called the weak diameter chromatic number of the graph class. It's the inking r case such that you can find the constant n such that every graph in this class. Such that every graph in this class has a tape coloring with weak diameter at the most end. So it's exactly like the class forming number that Luis just mentioned, which is just change the size of the component by weak diameter. So we don't want to. So in a few years ago, when we determined the asymptotic dimension of minor curls families, we proved these results. So we also determined the weak dimension correct number of minor curls families. Damage the correct number of minor cross families. So, in particular, we prove that if f is a copper minor cross family, meaning the minor cross family does not contain all graphs, then we just need three colors for weak diameter color. And the least bond is optimal because of the triangular grids that we just mentioned, the hex lemma. If you just give a two coloring of the triangular grid, red or blue, either you get a red path from that. Either you get the red path from left to right or get the blue path from top to bottom. So, in any case, you get the monochromatic path, which has a large weak diameter. The weak diameter is roughly the size of the grid. So, if F contains all triangular grids, then you need three colors. And in particular, triangular grids are planar graphs. So, in particular, if the class contains all planar graphs, then we need three colors. On the other hand, we show that. But on the other hand, we show that as long as this class does not contain any particular planner graph, then you just need two colors. It then just means if you screw one planet graph, you get a boundary three ways, then you just need two colors. And this boundary two again is optimal because the long paths need two colors. You cannot just use one color to colour paths. So that's what has been done before. In this talk, I will focus on the list color inversion of it. Yes. Obvious question. Obvious? Yeah. Obvious question. What if the F does contain all graphs? That's infinity. Is it? Yeah. Yeah, because expanders. Powers of expanders need infinitely many colors. Okay, so we want to consider list colorings. So we need a notion called a KDIS assignment. So KDIS assignment shows the function that assigns each vertex. The function that assigns each vertex a set of at the least the k colors. And now, when we want to color it, we consider L coloring, which shows the function that assigns vertex to a color in this particular set associated with this vertex. And the older notion, the choosability of a graph, just says that if g is k choosable, then it means the graph has a proper L coloring for any k assignment. For any k is the assignment. But here we want to consider weak diameter coloring. So we say a graph is k-choosable with weak diameter at the most end. If for every k-dis assignment, you can find L-coloring with weak diameter at the most n. And we say a graph class is weak diameter k-choosable if you can find a distance n for all graphs in this class. And the net neck and surge prove this result. They prove that if you fix an arbitrary surface and consider the graphs embedded in this surface, then this graph is weak diagnostic choosable. And again, this boundary is optimal because the triangle grids are planned graphs and you need two colors, even for non-listed coloring. And the main result of this talk is that. And the main result of this token is that we can strengthen the results to any proper minor curls families. So, actually, for every minor cross-family that's not connect all graphs, it is weak diameter 3 choosable. So, we use circuit results, and the net egg circus results. There's a strengthening here. And also, it's a strengthening of the previous non-leaster coloring result. And also, we can prove that if f does not contain any particular pinnacle graph, Does not contain any particular kinetic graph, then it becomes weak diameter to choose a one. So again, it's a generalization of the non-lister coloring version. So I forgot to say these two results is joint work with Joshua Crotch. So these two results are just like listed coloring version of the prefix non-listed coloring version. And the proof uses similar ideas, but listed coloring is much harder to work with. Much harder to work with. So we need to prove something much stronger. We need to prove that actually when f is the minor cross-plane does not contain all planar graphs, we should be able to color the graph in a much stronger way. In the sense that no matter how I give you the two-least assignment, and no matter how I give you a subset of verices, A subset of various, as long as you can pre-color this subset with bounding weak diameter, you can always extend this color to the foreground to make it still have boundary weak diameter. So that's a pretty strong statement. And actually, in particular, if you take an arbitrary stable set, then no matter how you color it, you get a coloring with weak diameter zero. Then you can always extend this coloring to the whole graph. Extend this color to the whole graph to make it still have boundary weak diet. So, in particular, minor closed families have boundary degeneracy, so you can find a stable set with linear size. And you can color the stable set in any way you like. You still have weak diameter zero. So, actually, we can prove that actually any such graph has exponentially many these the color we bound in weak diameter. A formal result means that this is a real number greater than 1 as an integer n such that every graph in this class, for every graph in this class, and for any case assignment, actually 2D assignment, we can find a c to the number of vertices of this graph in different L cardios. Each of them has boundary weak diameter. So we need such a strong result to prove the first one. I probably don't give any I probably don't give any details about it. Okay, but these two results have some applications to other things. So I will spend time on them. So the first application is to cluster coloring, like Chris mentioned. So a coloring has bounded clustering, say clustering at the most n, if every monitoring component has size at the most n. The weak dimension coloring and the class coloring are pretty different. The cluster coloring are pretty different. And usually, cluster coloring is much harder to work with. But that becomes equivalent if the graph is bounding maximal degree. Because if you fix the maximum degree of the graph and the fix the weak diameter, then you can only bound the number of vertices there. So so if the graph is only maximal degree, then bounding weak diameter implies bound size. Grass bound size. But I forgot to define this. So we consider this coloring, listed cluster colouring. So we say graph is K-choosable with clustering N. For any K-dis assignment, this graph has a coloring, L-coloring, with clustering at the bottom. Okay, but anyway, put everything together. You take the previous result for the weak diameter list coloring, you minor cross-family, but now you add an extra combination. Family, but now you add the extra condition that the graph has bounded maximum degree, then you just get the three choosability with boundary cluster. Or more, it just says for any graph H and for any integer delta, you can find a constant N such that every H minus every graph from quin to grade most delta is retoosable with crossing N. And this is the generalization of the early result with single eye. So in the past we can only prove the non-vister color infrared. The non-lister color information. So we can only prove that those graphs are three-colorable with boundary clusters. But not actually true for listed color. And if you, again, you apply the weak diameter list colour results to the graph exclude the planner minor and add the boundary max R degree condition, then you get exponentially many two list coloring with boundary curves. The same state of joint. The same state, just repress weak diameter by clustering, but you add extra condition that have some dimensional degree. And again, the generalization of all the results, so a long thing obligation-Fernigan proved the case that if the graph boundary tree width exactly is grouped up plain and minor, then the graph is probably two-choosable, so two-colorable, and the Devian I later can generalize to cluster two-choosable. Cluster two choosable. But now, actually, we can prove that actually there are exponentially many such colorings. And a nice thing for the exponentially many colorings, like if you just take a random coloring, then with positive probability, the coloring is probably one. If you just repeat it constantly number of times, you can get a coloring one with probability. Okay, so there's another application of the weak diameter list coloring. So all those results are all about All those results are all about minor cross families. But actually, we can also apply our results, actually, the machine learners, to non-minor cross-families. And here's a particular example, GK planner graph. So we say a graph is GK planner if you can be drawing a surface of all your genus at the most G, such that they are at the most k processing on each edge. If you just take the case when k is zero, the g. The case when K0, the G0 perennial graphs are the graphs that can be drawn in a surface with all your genus at the most G with no cause. But on the other hand, if you allow k to be non-zero, so in particular consider zero one plane graphs, somebody called it one planal graph. It's already well known that every graph is a minor of some one-planet graph. So the set of zero, one plane graphs is not a minor cross-space. Like a minor get everything. But we can still apply our results to show that for any integers gk and delta, we can find exponentially many different three cluster colorings as long as the graph is gk printer with magnetic grammar delta. So the proof is basically Truth is basically okay, I'll talk about this later. But anyway, that's the corollary of our previous results. And it's a strengthening of earlier results of Louis and when Gerate. So they prove the case by case zero. So it proves that if the graph is embedded in the surface of all your genus Q and the graphs are bounding maximum degree, then you can find a graph that's free color. But now actually we show that there are exponentially many different three colors. Exponentially many different free colors, bounded colours. But I should point out that here we can only do coloring, not at least the colorings. And the way we really prove the stuff for GK printer graphs is via the notion called the layer tree width. So the layer tree width of a graph is the minimum w such that we can find a layering of the graph and a 3D competition of the graph such that the intersection of any layer and the graph of the graph. The intersection of any layer and any back, the size atomostel. So, layer tree width is known to be able to capture graphs with certain geometric properties. So, like for example, it's known that every GK planetary graph has bounded layer tree. And another concrete example of graphs with boundary layer tree with is the GK string graphs. So, they are the intersection graphs of a set of strings in the surface. Set of strings in the surface of all genus atomos G such that every string contains atomous k costs. And again, it's known that every g k string graph has boundary layer tribes. And how we really prove this about boundary layer tribes? So we prove that if you fix the layer tree with and make another degree, then we can find an exponentially many different cluster color, cluster three color. The colour, cluster of three columns. So, in particular, to get the previous result for the GK print address, because GK print address boundary layer attributes. And also, it's a strengthening of the earlier results. So, we can only prove the existence of one color. We can prove exponentially many colorings. But the proof basically is the same here. So, how can we prove this the existence of one coloring? How about one colouring? Is that we take a layering that gives us the layer tree width, put more layers, and you label the layers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. And you focus on the layer with index i, where i is congruent 1 of 3. So you focus on the layer 1, 4, 7, etc. And we can show that no matter how And we can show that no matter how you color the union of those layers, you can always extend this coloring to the whole graph. Well, actually, be more careful. So I want to use three colorings for the whole graph, but now what we showed in the past is that if you just use two colors to color these particular layers, then you can always extend it to the whole graph. And here the bounding mass are decreased to T. That means bounding mass decrease makes everything much easier. Degrees makes everything much easier. So now, if we just take our results for weak diameter color, if we just take those layers, the union of those layers, they still have boundary attributes, still bounding tributes for each layer. But because the layers are pairwise far away, so I can say I can color this part with boundary weak diameter, then taking union, still have boundary weak diameter. And now you just pick a And now you just pick a layer that contains at the least one circle vertices for whole graph. And the previous result says you can find a two-list coloring for boundary tribes graph. I mean, we can find exponentially many such two coloring. So you just pick those colorings. For each of them, you can send the whole graph. But that's why we can get exponentially many different three colours with boundary crossing, as long as we bound it. Okay, so. Okay, so one more. So we can do another generalization for minor cross values. It's another thing called out minors. So a graph H is an outminer of another graph G. If H can be obtained from a subgraph G, then contradicting all edges in H card. So it's a very special kind of minors. Now we can only contrast special kind of edges. So if H is other minor of 2, then H is 2 minutes. H is odd minor of g, then h is a minor of g. And one motivation of odd minor is to preserve the parity of the length of cycle when we do contraction. So it can be shown that if h is art minor of a bipartite graph, then h must be bipartite. And the people also consider colorings on other minor cross-families as well. So in particular, Huron and the pole proposed a straightening of Harvey Gauss conjecture. So he says that. So it says that if kt plus 1 is not odd minor of g, then g is probability colorable. So again, it's hard, I don't know how to prove it, but I want to consider the improper color inversion. So we can prove that for any graph H, there is a constant N such that every R H minus 3 graph has a three coloring with boundary weak dial. And again, we cannot do list of colouring here, we can only do color. But again, if you apply this result to graphing maxima degree, then you recover an earlier result of saying your eye again. So if you pick arbitrary graph H and then fix the maxima degree, then you can show that every R minor free graph boundary maximum degree has a three-color boundary cluster. And again, three is optimal because the triangular grid is the lower bound. Okay, so Okay, so again this is for coloring, not least the color. How about listed color? Well, bipartite graphs are outcase 3 minor 3. So you cannot expect you only use a bounding number of colors if you want to do the properly. So it's well known that a theorem of Alon says that if g has average degree at least d, then g is not small of log b choosable. Usable. The number of cards you need for properly listed color graph really depends on the density of the graph. But we have seen a lot of examples about weak diameter colorings. So like Louise mentioned, even though we consider cross colouring for KT minus 3 graphs, we still need like T colors or T minus 1. So we cannot drop the number of colors. If we consider listed colours, If we consider list color, the weak diameter color, we can reduce the number of colors to constant. So here we might want to consider a similar question. If I just allow weak diameter coloring, can I significantly improve this lower bound here? And we prove it's another case. So we can prove that there are infinitely many integers delta, such that if f is a set of bipartite vertical makes the argument most delta, then f is not. Delta, then f is not log delta of log log delta choosable with bounding rib dynamic. So it means that if you take a deregular bipartite graph, and our loan theorem says you need to look at the colors for properties the coloring, but here it says even though you allow boundary weak diameter coloring, you still cannot improve too much. The log log delta vector there. Okay, so Okay, so that's basically how I want to say that. So I want to finish the talk by mentioning some open questions. But it's an obvious question. That's the question I put in the open problem. So what's the small things f of delta such that the class of bipartite graphs with maximum degree most delta is weak diameter f of delta chosen? So on Monday I use cluster coloring, but now we have bounding maximum degree, so weak diameter coloring and the cluster coloring are the same. Weak damage curry and the cluster current are the same. So the lower bound is something about log over log log, and the upper bound is delta over log delta. So the gap is big. And also if you believe the old conjecture says every paragraph meta degree delta are delta choosable, it means that the right answer here should be close to the lower bound here. And another open question is about the Open questions about layer tree weeks. So, our results for founding layer tree with colourings. Now, we want to ask whether it's true for choosability. So, we conjecture that if F is a class of graphs above the layer tree with, then F is weak diameter 3 choosable. So, just one hour ago, I sent this conjecture just like you tried to improve the previous result on the layer 3 width from coloring to list the coloring. From coloring to list coloring. But after I listened to Louis's talk, I noticed that his proof uses a lot of stuff when we work on boundary layer tree width and the cluster colouring. So if you want to find a simpler proof, like the Louis version proof, for cluster choosability for KT minor free graphs, then you might need to solve this conjecture first. Because if you want to. Because all the if you want to extend the machine learning that proof from color to list the coloring, you need to work on data tree with first. Sort of okay, so I want to stop here. Thank you. But but in your your the question that you posed yourself, did you try improving the upper bound there? I didn't try actually because I didn't notice any obvious reason why having boundary clustering or boundary wave diameter can save number of colours. I mean intuitively it should be, but uh I didn't find a way to prove it actually. Fine every reasonable question. Yes, that's a reasonable question. The palettes are kind of ridiculously far apart also for the original. There are no more questions, then let's take our speakers.
