So we're starting with a topological groupoid, we're not assuming it's Hausdorff, but we are assuming that our unit space is locally compact in Hausdorff in the relative topology. We call a set B and G a bisection if the restrictions of the range and source map are injective, and we label the isotropy of G. The isotropy of G as iso G. G is a tile if the range and source maps are local homeomorphisms. And because of those local homeomorphisms, every atal group OG has a basis of open bisections, and those open bisections are going to be Hausdorff because they're just inheriting the Hausdorff structure from G0. So while our overall topology is non-Hausdorff, there is a lot of Hausdorff structure. A lot of Hausdorff structure going on that we're going to be using to build our C-stra algebra. An etal groupoid is ample if it has a basis of compact open bisections. And so some examples of non-Hausdorff groupoids that you might be working with is groupoids of self-similar actions, just coming from the Grigorchik group, and groupoids of inverse semigroups. So non-Hausdorff groupoids introduce some new wrinkles, the unit space is no longer closed. The unit space is no longer closed, units can converge to elements outside your naught, compact sets aren't closed, and the big one for building a sister algebra, products of continuous functions, may not be continuous. Fortunately, the non-Hausdorff structure, because our multiplication, our range and source, and our involution are all continuous, that kind of controls the non-half-strail structure into the groupweight structure. So we say x and y. So we say x and y cannot be separated if whenever x is in open set U, in y is in v, there's this non-trivial intersection. And these are the problem points. These are the non-hausdall points. So if x and y cannot be separated, then they have to have the same range and the same source. If I have a problem point, then everything in a group point with the same range and source is going to be also going to be a problem point. Point, and if you've got something compact in G, not closed in G, but I can map it down into the unit space and get something compact and closed. So I can sort of suppress Hausdorff by going down into the unit space if I want to. The non-Hausdorff is approaching. So I'll just sort of highlight some groupoid properties that change a bit for non-Hausdorff groupoids. The first is actually one that stays the same. So we talked about an etile groupoid being minimal if the If for every unit, the orbit, all the other units that you can get to from U in the groupoid, is dense and G0. This is the same as for a Hausdorff groupoid. The next three, there are some different names floating around the literature, so this is not canonical. This is what I'm calling them for today. So we say that G is topologically principal if the set of units with trivial isotropy is dense in G0. G is effective if the interior Effective if the interior of the isotropy is just G0, and we say it's topologically free if the interior of the isotropy minus the unit space is empty. And topologically free is one we're going to want to be using it, use because it's always implied by effective and always implied by topological principle. If your groupoid is Hausdorff, you actually get equivalence between effective and topologically free. And if your groupoid is second count, And if your group point is second countable, but not necessarily Hausdorff, you get equivalence between topological principle and topological free. So if you're making sensible life choices and working with Hausdorff, second countable, all of these are the same and you can go on with your day. So building a C-star algebra, normally for a group with C-star algebra, you take the continuous, compactly supported functions on G. Those are not going to Those are not going to stay continuous. So we're going to use the fact that we have all these Hausdorff open sets lying around. We have a basis of Hausdorff open sets. And we can consider functions that are continuous and compactly supported just on an open Hausdorff set. So we're looking at functions f from G to the complex, such that F restricted to V is continuous and compactly supported in V. It's supported in V. And I'm going to say if vanishes outside of V. And we're going to take our star algebra to be the span of functions of this type. So if you apply this to a Hausdorff group point, you get back exactly the compactly supported functions. But here, these functions are not going to be. These functions are not going to be continuous. And because our groupoid structure is suppressing some of the Hausdorff, the Hausdorff structure, you actually do get the same convolution and involution that you used to in a groupoid C-star algebra. So now we want to complete this. We'll assign a norm to it for a unit in a In a unit space, we have a left regular representation LU from these curly C sub C of G into the bounded operators on L2 of GU. This is exactly the same sort of formula as you see for a normal Hausdorff Griffith algebra. And we can define a reduced norm by just taking the supremum over all of these things. things all of these left regular representations for each u and this reduced C star algebra is going to be the completion under this norm. Now this gives us a C star algebra we can work with it. It has a big problem for what we're interested in is if you take J J from C star R of G into the bounded functions on G to be the Renault J map. So here you're not keeping continuity when you go into functions on G. We can talk about the singular functions, or the singular elements of our reduced C-star algebra. And these are the elements where the support of the Renault J-Map. Of the Renault JMAP of that A is meager. So it's got its support has empty interior. And this ideal doesn't intersect our continuous functions on the unit space. And so if this ideal exists, obviously our C-star algebra isn't simple, but it also obstructs extending traces from continuous functions on G norm. Continuous functions on G0 to the whole C-Star algebra. So they don't stay faithful, or they can't be guaranteed to stay faithful. So when we want to do work with it, we're going to want to sort of address that a little bit. Now, throughout the talks this week, we've sort of had a lot of discussion about how to manage conditional expectations, and particular conditional expectations when you don't have When you don't have an obvious candidate. So recall for a Hausdorff group or G, the natural conditional expectation from the reduced C-star algebra to continuous functions on the unit space is just the restriction, F restricted to the unit space, and that extends to a conditional expectation, and it'll be faithful. So for So, for a non-Hausdorff group weight, our unit space isn't closed anymore, and so this restriction is not going to be in the continuous functions on GNOW. It probably wasn't continuous to start with. But because we've cut off everything outside the unit space, there might be a problem point outside the unit space that we've cut off that's now gone, so it might not even be. That's now gone, so it might not even be in our original C-star algebra. So we have two options. I think both of these are fighting, as Zeda put up on Monday. So we can say, okay, well, this thing is actually just in the bounded Borel functions on G0. And so we can just say, okay, it's going to a different C-star algebra, but it still is a weak conditional expectation. And if this is going to be a faithful And this is going to be a faithful expectation into the bounded Borel functions. And just to note, this is contained in the double dual of C0 G0. So that's one option, but that doesn't really address the problem of having these singular functions lying around. The other option is we take a quotient to kill the singular functions. So let Let m of g0 be the functions in the van der Borel functions where the support is meager. And then, oops, sorry, there's a subscript missing there. The restriction to g naught quotiented out by these mega functions, this extends to an expectation, not faithful, from the reduced C-star algebra into this, the local multiplier. Into this, the local multiplier algebra of the continuous functions on G0. And the essential group with C star algebra is going to be the quotient of the reduced C star algebra by the kernel of this expectation. And so that makes the essential expectation faithful on our essential C-star algebra. And CNOV GNORG has the idea. C0 G0 has the ideal intersection property in the essential C star algebra. So when we go to extend traces to the essential C star algebra, they stay faithful if we want them to. So now we're going to move on to what these conditional expectations let us do. And so we're going to look at And so we're going to look at proving the dynamics of our groupoid relate to properties of the C-star algebra. And what we're going to be looking at is that we have a dichotomy given some conditions between a stately finite C-star algebra and a purely infinite C-star algebra. And so there is an extensive literature for the Hausdorff case. So the next sort of sequence of results. The next sort of sequence of results very much follows Medifin Lee, Renaud, and Sims for ample Hausdorff groupoids. And Ma has worked to extend this towards to Atal Hausdorff groupoids. So at the moment we're going to be working, well it's quite a sort of tame example here, letting G be the ample non-Hausdorff group width with a comeback unit. Known Hausdorff group we've got a compact unit space, so our C-structure algebra is unital. And we're going to consider the functions that are sums of characteristic functions on compact open bisections. So for these functions, we can say that f is less than or equal to, is groupoid less than g, if there's finite bisections be, such that I can fit f below the sum of the sources of Of the sources of these bisections, and G fits above the ranges of the sum of the ranges of those same bisections. And so we say F is group width equivalent to G if it's both group width less than and groupwood greater than. And if we take a quotient of this thing by this equivalence relation, we get a monoid with addition of. monoid with addition and partial order given by just addition of equivalence classes and partial order given by the groupoid partial order. And we call this monoid the type semi-group of G, which we're going to call type G. And using this relation, we can now define a notion of paradoxicality for g so for integers j, So for integers j greater than k greater than 0, we say if is jk paradoxical, if jf is groupoid less than kf, where j is bigger than k. And so just rewriting that in the explicitly, we're fitting more copies of f below something that then Something that then the dynamics take to something below less copies of f. So this is sort of where we're getting an infinite projection flavor where a projection is infinite if I can fit a copy in inside itself with a little bit of room to spare colloquially. And so this is the same idea, sort of captures in the dynamics of the groupoid. And we say if it's completely non-paradoxical. F is completely non-paradoxical if I can never do that if there's no j and k such that it's j and paradoxical. And g is completely non-paradoxical if every of all of these functions are completely non-paradoxical. And so what we're working towards to show is that these two conditions sort of describe when it's purely infinite and when it's stably finite. When it's stably finite. And so these are the two equivalence theorems we've got for our result. So we're going to let G be an ample, minimal, topologically free group void with a compact unit space. So minimal and topologically free, ensure that our C star, the essential C star algebra is simple. And And if every f is 2,1 paradoxical, so I can fit two copies of f below one copy of f in this group sense, then usangel-sea straw algebra is purely infinite simple. So we have always one in place two. If type G is almost unperliferated, so this is this means that the order This means that the order is well behaved in a particular way. Then I can go back the other way and we have equivalence. And we get a similar result for stably finite. So let G be an ample minimal group point. We don't need to assume simplicity. So we don't need the topologically free here with compact unit space. And we get equivalence between G being completely non-paradoxical and Non-paradoxical and the essential C-star algebra being stairly finite. And then last slide, if we have both of those sets of conditions, so we're ample, minimal, topologically free, compact unit space, and our type G is almost perforated, then we have both of those equivalencies, but we further have that this is actually the only two cases we can have. So we have that the essential C's are algebra simple. Have that the essential C-star algebra is simple and is either purely infinite or stably finite. And so this key dichotomy here is that this is the existence of states on this monoid. And if you go through the proof, either there exists non-trivial states on the monoid, and then the minimal, these These conditions mean you can amplify it into a faithful trace on the essential sister algebra, getting stately finite, or there's no states on this monoid, and so you get no traces, and so you get a purely infinite sister algebra. But I will stop there, I think, on 20 minutes.
