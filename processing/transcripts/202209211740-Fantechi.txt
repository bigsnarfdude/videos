Object C art, and these were actually the algebra whose spectra are fat points. So, schemes such that the reduced structure is spec K. And in particular, we introduced the notion of small extension, where these were a map in art and And I times Mb is equal to zero, which means the module structure is just a vector space structure. And we were interested, given a morphism of schemes and a pi in X to the following question given a commutative diagram. Like this, where this is exactly the map X, is there a map making the diagram still commute? And if it exists, how unique or non-unique is it? How many choices do we have? And now Do we have? And now, what I will do is I will take this map, which is very useful because, as people notice, this kind of lifting problem exists in a number of different contexts. And rewrite it so that you don't see the commutative diagram anymore. So, let me notice that as we said from the beginning, we can identify a scheme with it. Identify a scheme with its unedal functor or functor of points, which are the morphisms in values of the morphism to the scheme. And so, for instance, we can say that HX goes from schemes to sets and maps scheme S to the morphism from S to X. And of course, instead of on schemes, this is on. This is opposite because it's contravariant. We can only consider it on affine schemes. And this, of course, is equal to finitely generated algebras, because remember, I have defined schemes as being locally of finite type. So, in particular, the algebras I and of course, inside here, I have. I have in particular my Artenian algebras. But what I notice about Artenian algebra is that if I have A an Artenian algebra, I have by definition a surjection to K, but I also have an injection, which is just because it's a K algebra, and this composition is the identity, which means that Which means that every functor on Antimian algebra decomposes over the value over the point. And so, in particular, my hx is the disjoint union over the points of the functor where this of A are the morphisms. The morphisms from spec A to X such that F restricted to spec A is the point X. And if this map is Y and I can call inside here, I have Y is equal to f of X. And so now for readability, I So now for readability, I will write F for H X and G for H Y. These are both functors from art to set. And of course, F induces a natural transformation of factors. And by natural transformation, I just mean that for every morphism here, I get a morphism here in a functorial way. In a functial way by composing with F. And now I want to redraw this diagram. So, first of all, what is this mysterious arrow here? This is a map from spec B to X, which maps to here. So, this is an element. Let me call this alpha. Our alpha we are looking for is in f of B. And what does it mean? And what does it mean that these commutes? Well, it means that if I call this beta and I call this gamma, and these are already given, this gives goes to beta, gamma inside, so beta is in F of A and then times G of B. But of course, I also have as a necessary condition. Have as a necessary condition to assume that this diagram commutes. And this means that this is actually that when I compose this way from spec A to Y and I compose this way, I get the same L. So this is the fiber product over G of A. And so what I have is I have this point here and Point here, and I'm asking whether it comes from here. And now, once I've written it like this, I notice that I can ask myself this question for any functors. I don't need that they are the functors that come from a scheme, they are just functors, and so by definition, given an F And f from F to G natural transformations, where F and G are functors from art to sets. And I will always assume that the image of spec K is one point, because if it's not one point, I can decompose by the same argument. We say Vector spaces P0F T one F R V tangent and N obstruction space notice the articles for F if for every small A small extension. I will not rewrite it since I have it directly here. There exists a natural. There exists means we are given, we choose, we can choose. We have an algorithm. If you want, there is again a functor, but I don't want to have too many functors. We have a functorial. A functorial exit sequence of groups and sets as follows: zero goes to id. Tensor, if I don't write anything, it's always tensor over k p0f to now. I have to copy. That's nice. I don't have to. P1 F I do one and one F. So it means that for I if you want, it means that for every choice of the small extension, I have Small extension, I have an induced obstruction map, which is just a map of sets from here to here. And what do I mean that this sequence is exact? Well, first of all, I have to tell you, you know, usually when you define exact sequence, you expect to have vector spaces, abelian groups, modules. But these two are just sets. So what do I mean? Well, this map, I know what it is, it is the natural projection. What it is, it is the natural projection. For instance, Fb to F A is given by the fact that F is a functor, and F B to G B is given from the fact that F is a natural transformation. So, this is clear. This is the one I'm assuming I have. And I'm also assuming that I have this map here. And you see, who is a group here in this top? This is a group, a Belian group, and this is. A group, abelian group, and this is an abelian group. In fact, they are vector spaces. These two are sets. So, this is just a set map because the only way to go from a set to a set, there is nothing else. This is also a set map because this is a set, doesn't matter if the image is a group. But here, I'm asking a little bit more. When you have a homomorphism of vector spaces, you have an action of the first of this. An action of the first of this on the second by translation, and so here I'm asking that this means an action of ideal tensor, T0F on FP. So if I have to write it all down, it means whenever I have such a sequence, I have both this action and this map in the world. And what do I mean that it's exact? Exact means here, what does it mean if these were abelian groups? It means that if two points have the same image, if and only if they are in the same orbit. So exactness here means that, let me give it names. This is point one. This is point one, this is point two, and this is point three. Exactness at two means that two elements of F B have same image, have same phi if and only if they are in the same orbit of the action. Of the action. And once we have this, what does this zero mean? The zero means that the action is fixed point free. And finally, the exactness here says that an element in the fiber product is in the image even only if the obstruction is zero. The obstruction is zero. An element beta gamma belongs to the image of pi if and only if the obstruction. So this obstruction is I have given the diagram, and then I have this machine that tells me whether the alpha exists or not. And here I say functorial. And what do I mean by functorial? That if I have a morphism of short, of small extensions, so I have one and I have another and I have these are maps in art, and this is induced linear map. I want. Map, I want I get a big diagram and I want that it commutes in appropriate sense. And note, I will just mention this, but I will not give details. There is a similar version when F and G from R to the same point. From art to group points, which means instead of taking isomorphism classes, I take the object and the isomorphism, but I don't quotient. Yes. So, beta, remember, what is a beta gamma? Beta gamma is a pair like this. Is a pair like this, and to say that it's a fiber product means the diagram commute. Exactly. So, what I mean is that what you see, beta and gamma are both determined by alpha. Alpha, if it exists, may or may not be unique, but determines beta because it's this composition, and gamma because it's this. So, alpha alone tells me beta and gamma. And so, the point is. And so the point is: I have beta and gamma. Is there an alpha that determines them both? And the answer is: well, I have to check whether somebody is preventing me to get there. And something is an obstruction to solving my problem. Ah, what did I write? Ah. Yes, you see, this is the kind of you I shouldn't have dragged the mescar. Okay, so that is. Okay, so that is uh yes yes yes it's uh the point is what you really get I mean this will be in the exercises and you really get the linear map from I to a vector space. So this is sh this with the tensor is because I have to fit it all in the same blackboard. To fit it all in the same blackboard, yeah, but it's still contravariant, it still goes against it. Okay, then it's wrong because it should go in the same direction. Then it's I, and that's it. I don't know. Look, let's go in the same direction. It's supposed to go in the same direction. I still think it's supposed to be I dual, but the I will have to see. You're right that it should go in the in the same way. Let me get this tomorrow. Let me get this tomorrow. Okay. And now that I am there, I want to say, yeah, and there is a version. And again, there is in the literature often instead of P0 and T1, in this case, you get T1 and T2. And we will see examples because there is also a T0. So we will go back to this question. So, we will go back to this question. The point is be careful because both this notation and this notation are used. And let me discuss instead why this is there and this is n. So, what you can check is that if this is the case, you apply it to sequences like k epsilon mod epsilon square and k epsilon 1 epsilon 2 modulo, epsilon 1 square. modulo epsilon one squared epsilon one epsilon two and epsilon two squared and map them both to k so these are both small extensions and you show that this definition completely determines t zero of f so if it exists it is unique up to canonical isomorphism but it is at the same time quite obvious that it cannot determine Quite obvious that it cannot determine T1. Because for any choice of T1, you embed the T1 into a bigger space and it still works because the only thing that here you can see is whether the obstruction is zero or not. And so that is the way it is. And let me discuss. So this is all very abstract. Can we find a concrete Can we find a concrete example? Yes. So this at the end of Green Floyd, you said T1 and T2, is it the same definitions of the literature? You just want them to use the same sequence here. Yes. Except that there isn't really a zero here. And there is a more complicated statement which determines the third vector space, which is at the zero. We will have an example in. Have an example in 10 minutes. So, yes, exactly. In particular, it's not just that there are non-trivial automorphisms. T0 in that case becomes the tangent space to the automorphism. So, if the automorphisms are discrete, we are good to go. Everything works the same way. Or, in more highbrow parlance, if we are not looking at schemes, but we are looking at the Lindman for stacks, we are still happy and these are. We are still happy, and this argument works. And if we are looking at our team stacks, then it's more difficult. Okay, so this is the situation. So before I give a concrete example, let me introduce a very important concept, which is the naïve cotergion. We said it yesterday, but let me remind you: quotangian complex of a morphism. Of a morphism of schemes. And this is something that always exists, but I will define it only in a special case where F factors, where this is a closed embedding and this is a smooth map. And this, for instance, can always be done if X and Y are quite. If x and y are quasi-projective, and I like x and y to be quasi-projective. And in this case, the cotangent complex of the morphism, a naive cotangent complex, or I call it usually L-tweedle for brief, brief, is defined as the complex I pullback of I X in M. In M which goes to I pull back of omega pi. This is in degree zero, this is in degree minus one, and this map is the differential. And this map is linear as a function on Ox, because when you write the Leibniz condition, the part which wouldn't be linear is not there, because if you multiply, if you restrict a function in the idea. A function in the ideal to x, you get zero. I'm sorry, I can l is I pullback of the ideal of x inside m goes with a differential to I pullback of omega pi. So if you want, this is starts with the usual map from the ideal to the omega, and then this omega map. And then this omega maps to a relative omega. And you can prove that in the derived category, this does not depend on the choice of the factorization and, in fact, can be defined globally with a lot more pain if there is no factorization. And then what you can prove in our case, so the main example. Maybe the main example is that if x is a point, I want to write x as a point in x, but I want to see it as a map is a point and Y is its image. Then, and we consider the induced map F, I'll still call it F from HXX to HYY, then we have that if we define PI of f to be H minus I of F. Of X pullback of L twiddle dual. So this defines you, this is in degree zero and degree minus one. I pull them back. You can be very fancy and pull them back in a fancy way as a derived category. Or you can be not fancy at all and just a tensor product and the And the cohomology doesn't change. What you get changes, but the cohomology does not. And then you get two vector spaces which are finite-dimensional and you dualize them. And then you get that T0F is the tangent space. And this is not so surprising because we know that there is an exert sequence when you have a closed embedding relating the Relating the ideal shape and the omega. And this is not difficult, and the part which is a little bit more difficult is the following. P1F is not only a tangent space, an obstruction space, but in fact it is the minimal. Obstruction space. So anything else to make V, any other V into an obstruction space is absolutely equivalent to giving a linear embedding of P1F defined this way. So it's really, and this is a So it's really, and this is the reason I don't do this at the Blackboard is not that I am drunk with Mescal, but that it takes time. But it's not a difficult argument, it's just long. It's basically based on an exercise in Hartshorn, like a lot of useful mathematics. And so this is really the key examples. And of course, in the moment, I've done the relative version, but I The relative version, but I can always consider the case where the image is the constant functor that just returns a point, whatever you do, or if you want the morphism to spec k. And then I just do the absolute version and I speak of T1xx or TIXX or TIF. So that is an absolute version. And now let me talk about examples from actual functors. From actual functors. So now I notice that I can do the same whenever I have a function. I can do a similar argument by choosing one point. So one value of the functor in one point. So let me give you an example. For instance, this example, in fact, the functor is a projective scheme. So you take X to X to be a projective scheme, E, a coherent sheaf on X, and you also choose an extra sequence like this, which corresponds to saying that f is a point in a quark scheme, where P is the Hilbert polynomial of X. Polynomial of X. So I have taken a shift, I have taken a quotient and given F and given a name S to the kernel. And I view this as a functor, because remember, the quad scheme is defined by a functor. And in this case, you have the Ti of the quad scheme at the point F is there is a calculation. There is a calculation that gives you X I S F. And this I don't write because I have written it in notes in the book FGA. There is a small article by me and Lotter, and this calculation is there. It's a very elementary calculation, but it involves a very big. Calculation, but it involves a very big diagram. And yeah, and then let me go back to the case of the Hilbert scheme. So X is still a projective scheme. And now I take Z inside X, a closed sub scheme. Sub-scheme such that I is a regular embedding. If you know what the regular embedding is, yes. So the tangent is home and the obstruction is X1. Okay. Now my panic is always. Now, my panic is always that I never remember who's to the left and who's to the right, but my solution is to think of this as the Grasmanian. And then to change, if you have a vector space, you have a subspace and the quotient, to move it, you have to change the map, a map from the kernel to the co-kernel, and you make it into a graph. Okay, so what does a regular embedding mean? So, what does a regular embedding mean? If you like algebra, it means locally is generated, the ideal is generated by regular sequence. If you are me, you think of x, for instance, as irreducible of a given dimension, and then this means that this embedding is generated, the ideal is generated by r functions, and each function lowers the dimension by one. It's not quite the same, but it's very closed. The same, but it's very closed, and in particular, it has a consequence that the I pullback of the ideal of Z in X, which we call the conormal, is a vector bundle on Z. And in this case, Ti at the Hilbert scheme of X. Hilbert scheme of X in the point Z is Hi of Z, the normal bundle. So the dual of this. And what you can check is, of course, these two cases have an intersection, right? Because the Hilbert scheme is a special case of POT. And so, in particular, you get you get two different you get that in this case if you you can also view this o z in quad o x and so you get what do you get as t zero and t one t zero you get either home or x O X IZ OZ or you get global sections of the pulpit of IZ dual. And you can check that in fact these two are canonically isomorphic. On the other hand, so this is the T zero, and this is okay because as we said, the T zero is uniquely determined. That T0 is uniquely determined. So we know if they exist, they must be the same. You see, what is this? This is the same as a home OZ I pullback of IZ OZ, but now this is a vector bundle. And so home from a vector bundle to another vector bundle is the global sections of the dual of this tensor depth. And tensoring of Z is not the big deal. Is not a big deal. But what about T1? And T1 in one case gives X1 IZ OZ and in the other case it gives you H1 of Z the normal term and is that a little Okay, seems okay. No, I think it's okay, whatever it had. And now, these two are in general not the same. And of course, if you are good at the commutative algebra, you can figure it out yourself. If you are not, you can have Angelo Pistoli tell you. So, whichever way you prefer, you can check that in general. You can check that in general these two are not the same. And so this really tells you, and what happens is that in either case, this is a very natural. Let me give you a very quick idea as to where you get this normal bundle. What you can do, pretend everything is smooth. Okay, X is smooth and Z is a smooth sub. X is smooth and Z is a smooth sub-variety. In that case, it's certainly a regular embedding. Then, what you can think of is you can think of deforming the inclusion as deforming. First, the sub-variety and then the map. The forming smooth variety has tangent H1 of the tangent and obstruction H2. And the forming a map. And the forming a map to a smooth variety has tangent h zero of the pullback of the tangent and obstruction h one. And then you just write the long exact sequence. You have something which has a contribution from the tangent of z and something which has a contribution from the pullback of the tangent to x. And if you put them together in a sequence, what you are left is the normal boundary. So it is really what is the philosophy. So, it is really what is the philosophical difference between these two is that here we view the shifts as shifts on the ambient, while here we view this inclusion as we really are looking at two different schemes and a map between them, which happens to be a closed embedding. So we are really looking at the same problem in two different ways and we get two different answers. Two different answers. And since I told you I was going to talk about the moduli of coherent shifts, in the same way, if you look at code X X for X a projective scheme and you take F a point and remember this now is a functor to group points not to schemes to sets and I get that the Ti per X F is Is X I plus one O X F F and so we have even a T minus one which is home F F and this turns out to be the tangent in the identity of the Of the endomorphism, of the automorphisms of F, because the automorphisms from F to F are an open subset of the vector space of all endomorphisms. And so the tangent space to an open subset in a vector space is the vector space itself. And so this really shows you, as we were saying, that now we really have an Saying that now we really have an altering stack. We have something where the objects have a positive dimensional, or not necessarily positive dimensional, but an automorphism group with non-trivial tangent space. And we could write something similar, but it would require two blackboards instead of one. So I will not do it, but I hopefully can do it in the notes. Okay, so this is the picture. This is the picture. And let me look at the special case which I find very interesting. Let me look at the case where I look at peak X, where the shape I want to deform is a line bundle. And so I take an element here, which is now a line bundle. And so X I plus one L L This is H I plus one X L dual tensor L, but if this is a line bundle, this is H I plus one X O X. And so I get that the tangent is H1 of O and I think you all know that this is the dimension. That this is the dimension of the Picard, of any component of the Picard group. But if you look at the obstruction, you may be confused because the obstruction is a failure of smoothness. And you can ask yourself: if the per group is smooth, it's a disjoint union of a billion varieties. How is this not smooth? And the point. Smooth. And the point is that this thing here does double work. It's not just the obstruction to Picard, but it's the obstruction to a more general problem, which is I take the moduli of pairs XL and I map it to the moduli of X. And in particular, the pic. And in particular, the pickup group is the fiber over not the forming X at all. And now we know why this is here, at least if you are me and pretend that all the groups are the complex numbers, because your term class has to be an element in H11 intersected H2 of Z. When you deform, the part in Z can't deform randomly. It's an integer, it can't jump around, it's determined. Jump around, it's determined. But when you start moving, maybe the projection onto H2O4 will no longer be zero. And so, whenever you do a deformation, when your first term class becomes, gains a copy, a component in this term of the Hodge decomposition, you are screwed. You can't extend the line bundle anymore. So, this is here. So, this is here, it looks like it's not doing anything, but in fact, it's doing something. It's doing a relative thing. And so, in particular, if X is smooth, then there is a map from coherent shape on X to line bundle on X. Bundle on X, which I like to call the determinant. And it's given by if it's a vector bundle, it's the determinant. And otherwise, you take a finite resolution by vector bundles, you take the determinants and you tensor them with alternating sign, like with every whatever you do when you have a resolution. And then what you have is that there is a map. Is that there is a map from the TI here to the TI here, which does exactly what you want. It sends the tangent to the tangent and the obstruction to the obstruction. In particular, if you are only interested in deforming your shift over a fix X, you do not need to look to the whole X2F, but only on the part which maps to zero. part which maps to zero in H2 of O. And since this is a differential, the differential of the determinant is the trace. And so what you get is that you don't need the whole X2, but you only need the traceless X2 to get the obstruction. And in particular, this is how Mukai proved that module That moduli of sheaves on a K3 surface or more general, are smooth because the obstruction is non-zero, but the non-zero part of the obstruction is exactly the true of all. And again, it only is there to check that, hey, look at your sheaf. If the first churn class is non-zero, maybe when you deform the K3 surface, The K3 surface it will stop being of type 1.1. Yes, it's a very interesting. Well, the point is here, the difference is an interpretation of the obstructions as a relative obstruction. While here, it's really the point we will discuss this tomorrow. Discuss this tomorrow that this means that we have two moduli problems. So, this means that we have a larger moduli problem and we see our special one as a fiber. While here, we are really looking at the same moduli problem in the non-derived context, which in the derived context becomes two different problems with two different solutions, two different derived modules that. Derived moduli structures. And I had promised something about the miracle that occurs: the fact that the Hilbert scheme of points on a surface is smooth. Sorry? Let me discuss. Let me discuss this tomorrow. Okay. So let me instead now discuss something that I find much more interesting because it's something that I was very confused by and miraculously it no longer was confusing. The case of n of S. Even in this case, I have two interpretations for the same moduli problem with Problem with two different obstruction theories. So, of course, one possibility is to view it as what? And let me take here a scheme. Notice that if my scheme were regularly embedded, I would already know that it's unobstructed because H1 of the normal bundle has to be zero because Z has the Has to be zero because Z has dimension zero. But of course, not every subscheme of codimension, a subscheme of codimension one is regularly embedded. Codimension two, maybe, maybe not. Depends. So here, if you apply, so the point is I cannot really apply this because it doesn't always apply. But I can always apply that and I get. And I get tangent is H hom IZ OZ and the obstruction is X one IZ OZ and you can find the calculation by Fogarty proves that this has Proves that this has dimension equal to 2n and also this has dimension equal to 2n. However, I can also do something different. I can look at the z, of course, is determined by IZ instead of inside OS, right? So it's the pair. So it's the pair shift and immersion in OS, but this immersion, if you want, is just a double dual, or if you want, this implies that the determinant of IZ is OS, because the determinant of IZ has to be a line bundle, but away from a zero-dimensional subset, this is the structure shift. The structure shape and the line bundle on a smooth surface is determined by what it does away from a finite set. And so now I use this fact that I'm looking at fixed determinant and I get as tangent, I get so now I get the T minus one. Get the t minus one, which is the h0 of the, let me write better, the home traces from IZ to IZ. And you can prove that the only homomorphism between an ideal shift and itself are scalar multiplication. And the trace is the scalar itself. So the z. Itself. So the zero ones are zero because they have to be traceless. The T0 is the X1 traceless of IZ. And this we know has dimension 2n. And we know it because we know that the tangent does not depend on whichever picture I've chosen. The tangent is the tangent. Is the tangent. How about the T1? The T1 is the X to the 2. And by traceless, I mean the part which maps to 0 in H2 of O. So I take the X2, and then I want, I know that there is a map in H2, and I want that only the part which goes to 0. And so let me look at X. And so let me look at X two. And X two by the local to global spectral sequence of X has three inputs. One input is the home, the sorry, the H zero of X two IZ IZ and this is zero. And this is zero because Ic is torsion free, and so it has a resolution which must have two terms, not three. And so x2 of IZ, anything else, is already zero as a sheaf. And if it's zero as a sheaf, it doesn't have sections. Then you have H1 of. H1 of X1 IZ IZ. And this sheaf here has to be supported on Z because away from Z, IZ is a line bundle, and so it doesn't have any X1 sheaf. So this is supported on Z, but Z has dimension zero. You cannot have an H1 of something which is in. Of something which is in dimension zero. And finally, the last bit is H2 of home IZ IZ and this is exactly H2 of OS. And now we have to take, so this may be non-zero, but what we have to take is the kernel. What we have to take is the kernel of the map from this to H2, and this kernel is zero. And so, what you get is that, in fact, here I have the point is you can check that the zero here is the part which guarantees that this is still an ideal shift. If you don't get traceless, you get things like ideal shift, tensor, align bundle. Shift tensor align bundle of the first turn plus zero. So you can always deform in that direction. But if you fix the determinant, you can't. And so this way you get that the obstruction is zero. And so you must get something smooth. So the miracle is explained. And in fact, if you think this is a funny exercise for me to entertain you, this is true. But the way I learned this. The way I learned this is not by somebody explaining to me the Hilbert scheme, but by people like Richard Thomas defining these invariants for Talabiao threefolds. So that if you do the same, but now not on a surface, but on a threefold, you have this vanishes for the same reason. These two both. These two both exist, but again the level three does not exist. And so, in this way, you get that there are just the tangent obstruction, but nothing else. In fact, they have the same dimension. And so, you get the case that you expected dimension zero and you get the virtual count. And the amount of calculations that have been done on this in the last 15 years is quite impressive, not necessarily on this. Impressive, not necessarily on this direction, but on calculating numbers out of moduli of stuff on Calabi out three faults. For some reason, the physicists like that. The problem is you are fixing a shift with the correct rank and churn numbers, which I cannot compute standing here, with fixed determinant. Fix determinant. And it turns out that in this case, if you deform this shift such that you don't change the determinant, the only way you get the determinant has to be this inclusion. Yes, so the point is it's a moduli of ships with fixed. So in general, what you do in this case, I did not. Do in this case, I did not write it down. Is you really write the format a moduli problem of pairs, where the first object is a sheaf and the second object is an isomorphism of the determinant of the sheaf with whatever you want the determinant to be. And in particular, in this case, O. And it turns out that this kills the automorphisms because if you move your ideal. Your ideal by a scalar, then the determinant also moves by the same scalar because this is rank one, and so you get and if you work with higher rank sheaves, you are left with some automorphism. If the rank is R, you get the Roots of unity because the Root of Unity acts trivially on the determinant. But if R is prime with If r is prime with a characteristic, the r root of unity are a reduced scheme, and so they don't have a tangent space. And if you are in characteristic non-prime with r, you do get an altern stack and you can start worrying about what you should do. Okay, so I do have another five minutes. Okay, and And so this starts now. I want to say something about I want to define what is a principal obstruction theory by trying to explain what is the relationship between all this stuff. So let me start back to our original example. I have M as. A smooth variety of dimension D and E rank R vector bundle on M and S a section and I define X to be the scheme theoretic zero locus or if you want I have M Have M which goes to E, and here I have the zero section, and this is the fiber product. Actually, let me put the S0 here and the S here. This is a Cartesian diagram, and this is a regular embedding of codimension R. And so, what the book of Fulton intersection theory tells us is that if Here it tells us that you get a map S0 upperschricke from the NECH of M. Let me write it better. So, you can pull back child tasks, but the other thing I would like. But the other thing I would like you to interpret, what does it mean? Well, the fact that you have a section means that you have a map like this. That's what the section of a sheaf is. Or equivalently, you have a map like this. And what is X? Well, the ideal of X is the Of x is defined to be the image of S dual inside O M. That's what the zero locus is. And so this means you get a commutative diagram like this. So and sorry, two So, in particular, you have that E dual surjects in Ix, and now you can pull back. And this still surjects. And remember, we had our naive cotangent complex, which was this one. This one, and of course, we can use this map here, and we get a commutative diagram. And now, what happens? This complex here is called the perfect complex, it's perfect because it has. Perfect because it has a rank. Both terms are locally three. It's perfect of perfect amplitude contained in minus one, zero. And this is the cotangent complex. This is a morphism. And this morphism, you can view this as a morphism of complexes. And you have that H0 is an isomorphism and H minus. And h minus one is subjective. And this means, remember, I just erased it because I'm not very well prepared, that if you take this and you pull back it in a point, you can use it to compute the tangent space and the minimal obstruction space. And here you notice that surjectivity, when you dualize, becomes injectivity. Dualize becomes injectivity. And so this means that H minus I, H minus N of I pullback of dual to I pullback of omega n dual defines for n equals For n equals zero defines a tangent space of x and for n equals one defines an obstruction space, which in general may be larger than the natural one. And remember, we have an expected dimension. The expected dimension is d minus r because we expect every equation to bring Expect every equation to bring down the dimension by one, and what we get in this case is that we have a pullback. And the theorem that we originally proved was that definition An obstruction theory called the morphism F is a morphism phi in from a complex E to the naive cotangent complex in In the derived category of sheaves of cox modules with coherent homology such that H0 of phi is an isomorphism and H1 of phi is a surjective. H minus one is surjective and it is perfect. If E is perfect in minus one zero. So it's locally isomorphic to a homomorphism of vector bounds. And then the theorem, and this of course is my very old work with Kybern. Also, the definition comes from there: is that in if to A perfect obstruction theory, given a perfect obstruction theory, it defines a pullback map from CHI of Y to CH I plus the rank of E of X. So it's a similar situation. X. So it's a similar situation as here. It's a special case is if you have X goes into M, goes into Y, where this is smooth and this is the zero locus of a bundle. But in fact, you need the less. So you have these two extremes. In one case, you have this very special zero locus of a bundle on something smooth. In the other case, In the other case, you have this miracle that point by point you have tangent and obstruction, and the induced aspect dimension, which is tangent minus obstruction. So, tangent is how many variables you have, and the obstruction is how many equations are you imposing, is the same at every point. So, you have this evidence that this has an expected dimension. Dimension. In general, it does not mean that you can write it as the zero locus of a section of a bundle, but you can still do this. And I'm sorry I'm over time, but I would like to have one final sentence to motivate what we will do tomorrow. So I explained to you one miracle, namely smoothness, but there are many more miracles around us. The miracles that happen is that, first of all, That first of all, whenever we have a morphism of these moduli spaces, we know that it must induce a map on the tangent spaces. But why does it have to induce a map on the obstructions? It always happens. You sit down, you do the calculation, but it's not obvious. It doesn't have a universal property because it's an obstruction, not the obstruction. And the other thing. And the other fact is that whenever you have a moduli space where you can compute the tangent obstruction, the expatriate dimension is locally constant, it turns out it basically always have a perfect obstruction theory. Maybe sometimes almost perfect, quasi-perfect. It would be perfect, but we have to pet it a little bit. But it seems like a miracle again. And so we ask ourselves. And so we ask ourselves, where does this come from? Why can't we have a theorem that says that this stuff maps from each to the other because it has a universal property? What is the universal property? And this is what we are going to discuss in the last lecture. Thank you. So, thank you, Margaret, for the nice talk. Is there more questions from the audience? Yeah, you mentioned that you can get around this the closed emergency closed embedding small boxing factorization for the definition earlier, but is it a required condition for the theorem? It was originally a required condition that we that so what was a required condition for the theorem was if I remember correctly that E has a global presentation as global presentation as morphismal vector boundaries. Now there is a slightly, now means since 20 years instead of 25, there is a slightly weaker assumption, namely there is a theory of pullback by the theory of child groups has been extended from the Limb Vanford sex, which existed at the time due to work of, of course, Angelo Vistali. To work of, of course, Angelo Visteli, to Artin stacks by in a series of papers. There is first a paper for quotient stacks due to Edidin and Graham and based also on conversation with Bertotaro, and later the thesis of Andrew Crash. And so, if you have the assumptions of the thesis of Andrew Crech, which are a bit technical and I'm not willing to repeat them while standing. Willing to repeat them while standing here, but then you don't require the global resolution. In practice, in all cases, I know, again, finding the global resolution is not so difficult because I have projective assumptions everywhere and I keep myself held at them very, very strongly. Thank you. More questions? Maybe the answer tomorrow, but if you look for a somehow a UDL. somehow you give us our theory of that shouldn't the I mean the the people or the diva or the divine it somehow be unique or mean or it has so in fact the the point is that it is unique but after you have asked the correct question and the correct as I this is him That as I this is hinted at this thing I had mentioned, that when we look at quad and hilb, we really can look at them as two completely different problems. In the case at least where the hilb is a hilb in a point where it's a regular embedding. When it's not regular embedding, I'm not going to make assumptions because there's not so much in the literature. In the literature. But, and the point is, this is exactly what we want to discuss. What is the correct assumption? And this is what we will discuss tomorrow. And this will involve simplicial methods. So if you want to think about it and have sweet dreams tonight, I suggest you remember that you have at some point hopefully studied topology and you have learned that you have. And you have learned that you have continuous maps, but we also have homotopies. And then you can do homotopies among homotopies using a square, but what we will think of is we will think of doing them using triangles and pyramid, tetrahedra, or simplices, so that we get a simplicial set structure on the morphism on the continuous map between topological spaces. Topological spaces by saying that a zero map is a map, a one map is a map from x times an interval, one simplex to y, a two map is a map from x times the triangle, so a two simplex to y, and so on. And we have all the phase maps, the generations, whatever, and this gives me a nice simplicial set structure. Do you want to consider the embodied? I will, yes. All the you here, you see that at some point you have some eyes that have a meaning, and all the others that are there doing nothing. Why are we paying for all these people to do nothing? We want them to work. And so, when we have done that, all these people will have a proper job. Okay, then thank you again, Barbara.
