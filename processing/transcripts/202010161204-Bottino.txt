Okay. So this is entitled Stuff I Wish I Paid Better Attention to in Grad School, but it's really more about math modeling and oncology drug research and development. I've been working in oncology most of my career. So a little about me. So I went to a liberal arts undergraduate school, Hamilton College. Arts undergraduate school, Hamilton College. I did a bachelor's in mathematics and comparative literature. Tulane University was where I got my doctorate in applied mathematics. Then I went to University of Utah, which is where I met Thomas Illen. And I was an instructor there for three years, which was sort of like a postdoc, but it had a teaching load as well. Then I was a postdoc at University of California, Berkeley, working with George Oster on cell motility modeling. On cell motility modeling, which is what I'd started with my PhD research. Then I joined a company called Physiome Sciences after meeting someone from Bayer at a job fair, and he was the only person at the job fair who understood what mathematical biology was. And so he pointed me in the direction of physiome sciences. And so I got a job there. We were like a QSP modeling startup company before QSP modeling. Startup company before QSP modeling had a name, and then that didn't go too well for the company, so they shut down. We spun off a colleague of mine and I licensed some technology from the original Physiome Sciences and spun off our own company, which we did for, I did for a couple of years before leaving to see what goes on really in pharmaceuticals. So I joined Novartis Pharmaceuticals around 2005, Roche Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Pharmaceuticals in 2011, and then in 2013, I moved up to Boston to join Millennium, which became part of Takeda Pharmaceuticals. So that's where I am now at Takeda. I really enjoyed the Pfizer motto, breakthroughs that change patient lives. Our motto is less interesting. It's be less evil than Pfizer. And sorry, that's for Richard. So just putting. Just to put things in perspective, when I was in grad school, biology to me seemed like: you know, you torture a bunch of mice, you throw them in the blender, you run a Western blot, and then you send the results to nature. But now with the Omics revolution, things have changed a lot. You torture mice, throw them in the blender, run a gene expression array, and then send the results to nature. So these are great times. But what I really want to talk about. Times, but what I really want to talk about is cancer specifically. And so, this Vice President Biden at the time, right, four years, five years ago, started on a moonshot to cure cancer, which got me thinking. It's important to realize how many places there are to bring mathematical thinking into drug RD. And that is because things are much less quantitative than you would imagine they would. Quantitative than you would imagine they would be. They're mostly, the field is ruled by statisticians who like to turn everything into binary variables, and that's not necessarily the best way to do things, in my opinion. And so I thought a good analogy would be what would going to the moon look like if we did a moonshot the way we develop cancer drugs today. So we would pick the dose for the drug by first taking three rockets. Taking three rockets, give them one barrel of drug. If none of them explode, then we give three more rockets two barrels of drug. Maybe some fins fall off, but nothing too drastic. Then we give the three more rockets four barrels of drug, and one of them explodes. Well, then we try three more rockets at that same number of barrels of fuel. Sorry, fuel, not drug. Fuel, not drug. And if one more explodes out of those three, then you declare the next one down as being your maximum tolerated fuel level. And that is often the drug level that you go in into your next phase of studies in oncology. So the corresponding analogy in oncology, the real thing is we still do this sometimes in oncology phase one. In oncology phase one, first in human studies. We take three patients per dose level. We carefully measure many, many parameters in great detail over time. But then we just binarize each patient to say whether or not they had a dose-limiting toxicity after one month. If they don't, then you go up to the next dose level and try out three other new patients. And then there are these rules. And then there are these rules. If you end up with one out of three not doing well, then you try three more. If you end up with two out of six not doing well, that's an untolerated dose. And the maximum tolerated dose is the one below that. So it's a very information lossy technique to take measurements that are very rich. And right away, before you start doing any modeling or any analysis, you reduce them to binary variables. Even on the efficacy side, we see that too. So, if you went, if you're trying to go to the moon and you took very detailed telemetry data at every moment that the rocket was in the air, you know, one way to do it would be to then categorize the data on how well you did. You could have a complete success where you landed on the moon. You could have a partial success where you end up on the moon. You could have complete failure. You could have complete failure where you just crashed back to Earth, or you could have a stable trajectory which is maybe floating around in a not moving very quickly somewhere in outer space. This is how we still, and this is 40 years after these criteria were developed, I think, many years at least. We have technology called a CT scan, right, that passes X-rays through the patient's body. X-rays through the patient's body, and then the machinery solves a massive inverse problem to reconstruct the 3D shapes and locations of the tumors and the volumes for that matter. But what we end up doing is we pick up to five of these tumors and just take their longest diameters. Then we add up those longest diameters and then we build, we bend the sum of the longest diameters changes into one of four responses. Complete response is when you can't see the tumor anymore. Partial response is when you lose. Partial response is when you lost 30% of the tumor burden. Progressive disease is like failure, and that's when you increase by 20% over baseline, and everything else is staple disease. Okay, so again, this is a very information-lossy endeavor, the way we're doing it now. So, what I propose instead, and there's more analogies like this for the survival analysis, and then we have And then we have baseline biomarkers that it's sort of like if you don't have a mechanistic reason to believe in that biomarker, you're asking, you know, do the rockets do better if the moon is under the North Star when we launch? Or predictive signatures, you're asking, you know, does the mission go better when the moon is under a bunch of stars, like the Big Dipper at launch? But instead, what if we had a mathematical model for how the moon and the rockets or how it came? How the moon and the rockets, or how cancer progresses as a function of time and other inputs. And so you can think of model-based oncology as this way, tumor volume being an evolving quantity that is dependent on tumor size as well as concentration of the drug, for example, and other patient parameters. And then your death hazard might be a function of the volume of tumor and potentially other factors. Factors. So, another analogy which I've used in the past is we had a model of chronic myeloid leukemia where we measured disease burden as log change in BCR Abel transcripts. And the analogy is sort of like predicting a hurricane. You know, when I started grad school, hurricane predictions took the last two points where the center was and shot a straight line. It's like a forward Euler type method. It's like a forward Euler type method. And that wasn't very accurate in terms of determining where the hurricane would be in a few days. We do that kind of thing in oncology still. But now in weather, we have high parameter mechanistic models of weather that can do a much better job of predicting how hurricanes will move, not in a straight line, but based on prevailing weather events. So if I had So, if I have a minute, I'll take one of these vignettes and show how a mathematical modeling was applied. So, this is work I've done with a lot of collaborators. And what we had was a drug that was targeting a ligand that the ligand usually dimerizes a receptor, and that receptor lets cancer cells grow and survive and migrate and metastasize. So, we want to block that receptor. Receptor. So we make an antibody, this little Y shape, which is our drug D, and we want to block out and displace the ligand so that the ligand can't dimerize the receptor. So the idea is that the drug can now, and it does in vitro in certain conditions, eliminate or reduce proliferation survival in these other cancer hallmarks. However, antibodies have two little binding arms. Antibodies have two little binding arms, and so sometimes you can get an effect where the cancer draw the anti-cancer antibody itself dimerizes the receptor it's supposed to be hiding from the ligand. And if it dimerizes it, you still get your proliferation, survival, and migration signal. One of the hallmarks of this phenomenon is kind of interesting mathematically. If you have, sorry. Sorry. If you have a small amount of drug, then you have a low amount of dimerization and a low signal through the cancer cells. If you have just right amount of drug, you have your maximum signal. If you have too much drug, then each receptor gets its own drug molecule if you push the concentration of drug higher, and then you're back to a low activation level. So you get a bell-shaped concentration response curve, which is very interesting. Which is very interesting, not standard pharmacology. And in fact, with this system and this drug that we were testing, we do see in the absence of the ligand, the drug activates the tumor cells, not transiently, activates the tumor cells at intermediate concentrations and less so at higher concentrations. So the team, the project team at the time, had data at all these points. The drug gave us good net. The drug gave us good net inhibition here. This is the concentration of the natural ligand. This is the concentration of the drug. The drug had no net effect in these yellow points and had net stimulation, which we don't want, at these reddish points here. What we didn't know as a project team is in the regions of interest in the published range of ligand concentrations, which is this range here, and the target drug concentrations we thought we could achieve in patients. We thought we could achieve in patients, we had no data. And so, what we needed to do is build a mathematical model of how the drug and the ligand compete for receptors and dimerize them under certain conditions. We assume that the amount of dimer is consistent with the downstream signal, and we assume that the single is fast to steady state. And I just wanted to share a nice little application of mathematical modeling here. When you solve this and you make a steady state, When you solve this and you make a steady state assumption, it turns out that the answer, the solution to this simulation, has a closed form, not a closed form, but it is the zero of a fifth degree polynomial. If you remember from Galois theory, there is no closed form solution to the zero of a fifth degree polynomial. So then we used MATLAB, of course, to numerically find the zero. And then my engineering colleague asked, well, how do we know the solution is unique? Know the solution is unique because it's a fifth-degree polynomial. And then it struck me from the University of Utah, I taught remedial algebra there, and we learned Descartes' rule of sines. And you can apply Descartes' rule of sines to that fifth-degree polynomial and show that there is only one positive real root. And so that's a nice application of mathematics, even high school or college level mathematics to pharmaceutical RD. So basically, before R D. So basically, before modeling, this was our picture. We knew nothing about a region of interest. After that, modeling, we were able to show what was going on in our region of interest. Unfortunately, when you put drug on, let me skip to this part, depending on where your ligand is, concentration of the ligand, you could either get a bad effect from our drug, or you could potentially get a beneficial effect from our drug. And it depends completely. Our drug. It depends completely, depends not so much on the drug concentration that we choose. See that this line is pretty vertical here. It depends much more on this transition from here to here, which is the tumor ligand concentrations, which is not something we can measure in the clinic. So unfortunately, based on this modeling, the oncology leadership board made a decision to discontinue this drug. So let me pretty much stop there. Let's see. I don't think I have many. Let's see, I don't think I have many. There are other examples where you have distributions of measurements, and that leads itself well potentially to Fokker-Planck-type modeling systems. I have another example with face portraits and face planes. And then finally, there's one. Let me just jump off to that. I don't know if I can do that fast. It's taking too long. Sorry. Okay. When you have a drug-drug combination, sorry, I skipped ahead. You have to make sure you're not hurting the patients. That's the toxicity constraint. And then you have to figure out how to optimize efficacy, which is the green surface. And so this is a constraint optimization problem, which you might have done in Calc 2 or CALT 3 with. Recall three with Lagrange multipliers. I just thought I'd throw that out there. But that's the end of my presentation. We basically, the way I see modeling fits into drug R ⁇ D is we integrate data and knowledge to quantify the relationships between the decisions we take as pharmaceutical companies and the uncertain outcomes that drive the value that we finally provide to patients. So thank you for your time. And I can come back at 3 Eastern Time. Eastern time, if there's a QA session after that, yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah, we will still be here. Okay, I'll be back for that. Thank you, everyone. Thanks very much, Dean. Thank you. Yeah, then we have Dean's questions later, as well as Richard's questions also later. And then I move.
