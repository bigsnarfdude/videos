And Abolic. And I don't know how to do math, I know how to do examples, so do that. Thank you. Right, I said hyperbolic. So free group, right? When are subgroups of free groups hyperbolic? You want to say all, you're wrong, all plan to generate it. All finally generated subgroups. Okay, good, very good. We're also smart. Surface groups, right? That's a nice example. I can't reuse surface. Well, finite index is a surface group, infinite index is a free group, so all fines are generated. Good, but I have a button. What happens in general but in general there is a finitely generous. a finitely generated subgroup of hyperbolic group and age not hyperbolic. The rich construction is that I'll just finish words when the board ends. Also, a second but there's a right what's the next best thing after five Alright, what's the next best thing? After five is generated, expansion presented. And actually, here, all subgroups are fancy presented as well. These groups are coherent, or maybe that's not because. Anyway, fancy presented, hyperbolic. Age is not hyperbolic. First example was Brady. If I understood correctly the literature, it's nineteen ninety nine, correct me if I'm wrong. Correct me if I'm wrong. And excitingly, there's an example of a finite type subgroup, a hyperbolic root, which is non-hyperbolic, and that's it's not okay to cut names. Italiano, Mantelli, Italiana. Montelli, Italia, Motelli and Migliolini. They did much more, but they got this in 21. Cool. So what was special about these two examples? Um I'll tell you that answer. What was special was that they were low dimensional, right? Free groups are one dimensional, surface groups are two dimensional. Surface, which are two-dimensional, and in general, these boards were not built for me, clearly. Jerston proved in 96 that if T is hyperbolic, the cohomological dimension of D, but I will not call it apologies, is two. Age is a subgroup which is finitely presented. Which is finite represented, then a desyprovolute. Very good. Example of a group that satisfies that is a G hyperbolic one relator total free. And then all finitely presented subgroups are hyperbolic. Subgroups are hyperbolic. And actually, all fancy generated subgroups are hyperbolic because of Lincoln-Friekend, right? Or maybe notorious. Okay, but chromological dimension is an algebraic definition. And actually, if I'm being pedantic, there should be a Z here. It's chromological dimension over Z. Now, what happens if you take a general rank R? So, So when reminder for R, a ring, the chromological dimension of a group over R is smaller than the chromological dimension over Z. So if I can upgrade this theorem to be over some root R, then I gain stuff. Then it's stronger. You would ask me, or you think you know what my root Or you think you know what my rings are, I'm saying general rings, you're thinking, ah, okay, community general rings. No, they don't have to be community general rings. Maybe 0 is not equal to 1, 1 exists. So Gerson's theorem was generalized by Aurora and Martinez Petrozza Tuane. And they proved that G is hyperbolic and rational chromological dimension of G is 2, then a finite represented subgroup is hyperbolic. Cool, that gives us more examples, right? Um like any hyperbolic formulator. Any hyperbolic formulator, torsion free groups? No, not torsion free. That's it. Hyperbolic formulator. But now you're going to say, okay, but that's not a good example because these are virtually torsion free. And the probabilistic is a quasi-semi invariant property. So I didn't really give you examples, but it's okay because Justina and Mess did. They provided us with a probability group which has rational chromological dimension 2 and integral chromological dimension 3. So in particular it must be partially free and Gerston just does not apply. Okay. I actually liked you because Gerston proved something stronger and that's not it. Should prove something stronger, and that's not okay to not say it. So it is okay. That's fine. F V to Z. So he doesn't need fancy presented, it needs F V to Z. Interesting fact. When he proved this theorem, it was not known that F V to Z is not equivalent to fancy presented. But I will remind you that it's not. And reminder. Minder file represented implies fp2z, but not vice versa. And that implies fp2r for any ring r. Because again, it's an undefined property that we can define over any ring. So this is not true, and this is not true. Cool, so the Aurora Martin has preserza, is that actually? They actually make it a matter of. But that's fine. Because we can have. So, this is a theorem with Bob Kroppler and La Dublanko, and we proved Kirsten's theorem over any ring, G hyperbolic. Topological dimension over some ring R is 2. Age subgroup, which is FP2R. Then age is equivalent. And the first, so this talk, I decided. So this talk, I decided you're a good audience, so we'll ask you a lot of questions. We don't really have examples, and we'll be happy for example, so if anybody knows anything, and I'll be happy to chat about it. We're here until Friday. I will point out that still, even if we don't have examples for G's, where the comological dimension over R is two and they're hyperbolic, and over Z or Q it's not. Q, it's not. You need to check less about H. I have G with, say, integral coherent dimension 2, and hyperbolic, and I have a subgroup. I want to ask, is it hyperbolic? I need it to only be FP2R for summary R. So would you not have examples as groups that are typological essential where some R that's not that it's not Q, yeah. Are there examples for for Q but not? For Q but not Q? It's VMS? Right there. Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry, yeah. But really, can you say, like, in two words, what the best VMS example is, or is that too difficult? I cannot. No, it's maybe it is not difficult. I didn't even. Blame it in past. You couldn't have time. Yeah, sure. I just, it's a VNA example. I have 10 more minutes. Perfect. Minutes, perfect. Right, so that idea of the proofs of, maybe I should say that actually Petrosian and Vanco proved it the rational case. So, generalization. So, that are your thing to apply to something new, like there could be a subgroup of that group that's hefty to no, because once you type. No, because once it's hyperbolic, it's fine to present it. Oh, I see, it says that. So it's just a way to check that it's fine to present it. But it's like you're dealing with some group, you have a subgroup, you don't know a lot about it. Oh, I actually know that it's FP2R. Good, that gives me it's fantastic, it's a provider. Yeah, but it was actually fantastic. So you did know it. No, you didn't know it, but now you do. Right, that's a, you can say you know all of the truths in that. Sketch of proof of all theorems. It's embarrassing to call it this sketch. We have the hyperbolic. So it satisfies some form. Let's emphasize the word some form here, which I will not write, a linear isotropic inequality. If you don't emphasize the word some form, If you don't emphasize the word some form, then you just think our proof is trivial, but that's not true. And then because of that, and the algebraic properties, we get that A satisfies a linear ischemic inequality. And then you need to prove that whatever form of isport inequalities you are dealing with, which is different in all the different theorems, implies that H is atropholic. Good, so now you just need to have. Good, so now you just need to ask me what it function equality am I dealing with, and I will tell you. So I need some norm, right? So I'm David students, I'm in this right name. R is a ring, G is a group, but we know that. We say G satisfies, we could have just done it 10 centimeters. So linear isomorphic inequality over R if there exists a projective resolution P three, F two, F one. F1, P0, R. So it's a projective resolution of R using RG modules. These guys are free with chosen bases and this is my. And this is my boundary map. Then, actually, what does it mean? And they're trying to generate it for you. It means that the elements here are just vectors in the group ring. So I can define a norm on them. So that's what we'll do. So a linearized particle equality is if there exists a k, some constant, such that for every For every boundary, so something in the image of the boundary map, there exists a feeling such that the feeling and the norm of C is bounded linearly by the norm of V, where the norm of an element of the group tree. The form of an element of the grouped ring is just the size of this apart and then L1 norm on vectors. So if you want C is a vector, group elements or group print elements. Group elements, or group ring elements, each one of them, the size of the support, sum it up. So I actually took a discrete norm on R. Everything is one except zero, where h is zero, and that let me define a norm on Rg. And that let me define a norm on science-generated free models over Rg. And I would be happy to think about different norms on R and what. Norms on R and what arises from that. But, okay, but we didn't do it here. And this is our linearized prompt of inequality. And I have four minutes or five because I think I started one late. But actually, here, I wrote what linear means, but you can ask C to be smaller than some function, my plus my orange. Some function of the norm of v, and that, and the smallest function would be our. That function would be your isoperometric function. And I care about those. Cool. So that's pretty much what the quality we worked with. And okay. It's fine, okay. It's cool. This is not the right thing. This is algebra, which most Algebra, which most of was done in the Arbor Martines de Grosa paper. This, the proof from Brighton and Alfiger kind of works, and is written carefully in the Keylab Peter Propeller, one of their papers. Right, when the last names, same last name, different people, you write that. Name different people. We write the first letter or the first name. And we prove this. Yeah? And this. What did we get? We get that our type of linearized primary equality, the discrete norm, is equivalent to the same thing over Z with the absolute value norm, which we know. Value norm, which we know is equivalent to equivalentity. Maybe these isochrometric functions in general are equivalent, maybe not, I don't know. Same for higher dimensions, maybe when it's sub-Euclidean, they're equivalent. I don't know. And you have to know, so tell me if you want to talk about it. We also proved, tell you that. Do that. Subquadratic is a primary inequality, meaning the minimal function you can put here is subquadratic. So then actually the minimal function you can put there is linear. And we proved this is also usually not. We prove that in higher dimensions as well, so if the cohomological dimension over some ring of D is N, H subgroup D is type F P N R, then the isoparametric function Of H is smaller as a function class from the edge parametric function of P. And the edge parametric function being this function with this norm, but when you take here n and n minus 1, and you keep the resolution going. And that is related to something called hierarchy probabilicity, that clatter and long detective. Paper publicity, that clatter and long define. And I would also be happy to speak about that if people here are interested. I think that's a point. Are there questions? What about relatively antibod groups? Is you going to have that colour information relative to the parabolics? We are working on it. More questions? Thank I will speak again. Doctor, five minutes thing.
