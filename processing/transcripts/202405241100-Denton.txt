To cast variable conformity. So, to start off with some definitions, a cultural variant is any aspect of thought, speech, behavior, or artifact that is learned and transmitted socially. So it could be anything from whether you're wearing a pink shirt or a blue shirt to whether you're wearing a mask or not wearing a mask or the presence or absence of any behavior. So, a conformist is an individual that adopts a more common variant, in this case, the pink one. Variant, in this case, the pink one, at a rate greater than its frequency, so here greater than two-thirds. And an anti-conformist would adopt a less common variant at a rate greater than its frequency, so the blue variant. And these biases have been observed in humans, so insert joke about how we're all using the word spice when it's a very clear conformity bias, but they've also been observed in several non-human animals. For example, there was a study by Pike and Leyland. Pike and Leyland on Ninespein sticklebacks, where there was conformity to sticklebacks that chose feeder one or feeder two. There was this study on great tits where there was a puzzle box and you could either open it by pushing a slider to the left or to the right, depending on the choices of other birds. And my personal favorite is this study on Drosophila melanogaster, where the females were looking at who other females chose to meet with, and males were painted each. With, and males were painted either pink or green, and there was conformity to the choices of the other females. So these are the order of the studies. There's also been a lot of theoretical research on conformity and anti-conformity, and most of the models date back to this study by Foyden Richardson in 1985. So in this model, there are two variants, which can be just called A and B, and A has a frequency P at time t, and then B is just one minus P. V is just 1 minus V. So offspring are assumed to take a random sample of n adult role models. So this would be n equals 3. And a little side note is that the math is actually the same if offspring sample other offspring, as long as those offspring inherited the trait of their parents. Otherwise, they wouldn't have a trait. But for the talk, I'm just going to focus on the sampling of the parents because it's a little more intuitive that way. So this is what the model looks like on the left. Looks like on the left, we have the frequency of variant A in the next generation, and then B is just 1 minus that. Here we have a binomial, which is the probability of taking a random sample and getting J of type A given the frequency of A. Then conditional upon that J, we have the probability of actually choosing variant A. So that's just the frequency in your sample, so J over M, adjusted by this conformity coefficient, either up or down if it's anti-conformity. Down if it's anti-40, and then we sum over all day. So, to recap, the probability of choosing A is just the probability of choosing A given a particular sample times the probability of that sample summed overall sample. So, hopefully that makes sense because this is going to be the whole rest of the talk. So, is there any questions? No, okay. So, first in this study, my collaborators and I, Yo Graham, who's here, we looked at what happens when you change the number of role models that are sampled. Models that are sampled. So, a lot of previous studies assumed n is 3. 3 is the smallest number you can have to have some majority and minority. So, that was a very common assumption. So, here are some examples of studies that have taken this Voider Winterson model and specifically used n equals 3. In this model, there are only four possible samples that you can get. So, you can get all A, all B, 2A and 1B. B, 2A and 1B, or 2B and 1A. Since the order of the role models doesn't matter, these are the only types of samples you can get. So if you have all A, then the offspring will just pick A. They can't come up with B without seeing it. Similarly, all B, pick B. In the case with 2A and 1B, offspring will pick A with a probability of 2 thirds, so that's the frequency of A plus the conformity coefficient. So that's this term we talked about earlier. And then otherwise, they'll be B. But what's really Otherwise, they'll be weak. But what's really important here is that, in this case, with 2B and 1A, A and B are just flipped. So you need to apply the exact same rule to B as you did to A. And the reason you have to apply the exact same rule is there's no bias for A or B. So A and B are treated as completely equal, and under conformity, only the frequency matters, not the actual content of the variant. So for that reason, there's just one conformity coefficient in this model, which makes Conformity coefficient in this model, which makes it very tractable, which is why people like to use it. This conformity of T is positive, and anti-conformity of it's negative. So, what happens to a population of conformists over time? On the y-axis, I'm going to show the frequency of A. So above 50%, the population is dominated by A, and then here it's dominated by B. And then on the x-axis, it is time. So, as you might expect, if the population starts with predominantly A, then A will go to fixation. With predominantly A, then A will go to fixation, otherwise, B will go to fixation. With anticonformists, the story is just the opposite, where no matter where you start, you'll stabilize at a frequency of half A and half B. So if you start going above a half A, A is popular, anti-conformists don't like popular, it'll get pushed back down. So that makes sense. And it's very intuitive. And a lot of models have said we're gonna take n equals three, because if we increase n, the dynamics are the same, so it doesn't really matter. The same, so it doesn't really matter. So, we wanted to test that and look at are the population dynamics actually the same if n is greater than 3? Because we tend to observe 1, 2, well, very old. Or fruit flies, or whatever. So, with n equals 4, the short answer is yes. It is exactly the same, which is probably what gave confidence to this. Okay, it's probably the same for all n. But with n greater than 4, the answer is no. So, first I'll talk about n equals vibral models. And I'm not going to show all the possible Models. And I'm not going to show all the possible combinations of dinosaurs because there's too many. But you can have 4A and 1B, or you can have 3A and 2B. So I'll just show these two. And in the first case, applying this rule that I said earlier, you pick A with probability of 4 fifths plus D4 over 5. So that's that formula from before. And in the case of three role models of A, then you just pick A with probability of 3 fifths plus D3 over 5. And the important thing here is that there's two conformity coefficients now, and they don't need to be the same. Now, and they don't need to be the same. So, if they're both positive, the dynamics are the same as n equals to me. So, conformity, and this is true actually for any n, so conformity, the dynamics are the same. If they're both negative and relatively small, then again, yes, we see the same dynamics. But they can be negative and pretty big as well. So, before, with n equals 3, this parameter d2 had to be greater than or equal to negative 2. Had to be greater than or equal to negative 2, otherwise, the probability would not make any sense. But now we can have down to minus 2.9, minus 3.9, and so on. So when we have this, we can get cycles, which was not possible in the previous model. And the intuition for this is if something is popular and you're really strong anti-conformists, then it's going to be so strongly disfavored that it's going to overshoot one half and then end up at a frequency that's quite low, in which case anti-conformists love that, then it will go back. Anti-conformists love that, then it will go back up and so on. And as n gets bigger and bigger, you can have more and more negative numbers, and you can end up having chaos in the system. So chaos is possible with n equals 10 or greater. There's another thing going back to n equals 5 that I want to mention before moving on, which is that the conformity coefficients can be different signs. So you might think of it as if something's sort of popular, you might want to adopt it, it's trendy, it's cool. But if it's too popular, It's trendy, it's cool. But if it's too popular and everyone's doing it, then it's kind of lame. That's an example in humans. But actually, fruit flies also did this, which is a little bit surprising because the authors of this paper only said fruit flies are conforming, but in the actual data, based on the definition of conformity that they use versus what we're using, it was actually this structure. So the fruit flies always adopted whatever was the majority with the probability of around 70%. With the probability of around 75%. And they didn't have five, but they had six. So if there were four of six group flies doing something, it was conformity because they would adopt it with 75% and not two-thirds. But if there were five out of six group flies doing something, they adopted that thing with 70%, right? So it was anti-conformity. Because that would be something like 82%. 70 is lower. Okay, so in this case, we get new dynamics as well, which is these. Dynamics as well, which is these asymmetric stable polymorphisms. So, in summary, are the population dynamics the same if n is greater than 3? Not if there's strong anti-conformity or some mixture of conformity and anti-comformy. But yes, if there's only conformity. So, in this study, we did some additional analyses. So, we looked at what happens when we include selection, what happens when we have a genetic modifier of the conformity, so looking at the evolution of. Looking at the evolution of the capacity to conform, and also looking at population subdivision with migration. So, there's this claim in a ton of different papers that conformity homogenizes groups and preserves between group differences. And we found that that was not true. Conformity can erode between group differences. So, yeah, I don't have time to talk about all of them, but would love for you to check out the paper. And for the sake of time, I'll just move on to the next study. The next study. So, in this one, we looked at what happens when conformity is allowed to change over time. Because, in reality, we might not expect every generation, like our grandparents and so on, to have the same levels of conformity. And it was kind of loosely inspired by this meta-analysis of ASHIN conformity. So, you might have heard of the ASH line judgment task. It's a slightly different definition of conformity because you actually are considered a conformist if you go against your intuition. You go against your intuition and pick something that's obviously wrong based on the choices of others. And in our model, we had no like prior and then posterior. But it kind of captures a similar thing. And in this meta-analysis from the 50s to the 90s in the US, there was a decline in conformity over time. This other study on baby names showed that in the past we tended to be more conformist, especially towards male baby names, and now we're pretty. And now we're pretty much anti-conformist across male and female. Both of these studies had kind of clear trends, but we just looked at random conformity, not assuming any particular trend, but just it can fluctuate with some probability. Okay, so the model is very simple. You just add a subscript T onto that conformity coefficient. And these conformity coefficients are randomly sampled from some probability distribution in each generation. We try to leave it very general. The question is: Are the population dynamics with this variable conformity similar to those before with constant conformity? And for the terminology here, I'm going to say stable equilibrium when it's a state that's guaranteed to be reached if you start near it. And then this stochastically locally stable SLS equilibrium. This is from Carlin Lieberman, 1974. If the state is very likely, but not guaranteed, to be reached, if the population To be reached if the population starts near it. So, with three role models, we previously had these dynamics here. And now I'm going to tell you about dynamics with conformity expected and anti-conformity expected, because in different generations you may get conformity and then anti-conformity and so on. But what is the average expected value of that coefficient? You can get very similar dynamics as we saw before, or you can get states with all possible equilibria being. Possible equilibria being stable at the same time. So counterintuitively, you could have conformity expected but reach a state of half A and half B, or anti-conformity expected and reach 0 or 1. And with n equals 4, it can get even weirder, where you can have anti-conformity expected and have the one half point actually unstable and only the two fixation states possible to be reached. So that it's a dynamic that looks more like conformity than anti-conformity. Like conformity than anti-conformity. And then with n-role models, we used the martingale convergence theorem and we were able to prove the following. So, no matter what the bounds on the conformity coefficient are, so no matter how negative it can be, and no matter what the distribution is sampled from, as long as conformity is expected, the population will reach an equilibrium, and that equilibrium will be either 0, 1, or 12. This result also holds if the number of role models. If the number of role models is allowed to change. So in one generation, you can sample three, then you can sample a billion, then back to three, it doesn't matter. This result will still hold. So that was kind of surprising to me. And then if anti-conformity is expected, convergence is not guaranteed. So to answer our question, are the dynamics the same with temporally variable and constant conformity? It depends on the question. So if the question is, does the population reach equal Is does the population reach equilibrium? Then, yes, the models do give the same answers. But if the question is which equilibrium, which is probably more likely to be the question, then the models can be extremely different. So, I've talked about these two studies so far. You might also be wondering in the back of your mind, like, why would a population only have two cultural variants, A and B? So, people usually choose that because they're interested in the presence or absence of a behavior, but it gets weird. Of a behavior. But it gets weird when you think about names, for example. So if we had the presence and absence of coolia, there's so many different ways to have an absence of coolia than the presence. And you wouldn't assume that the population stabilizes that 50% coolia, right? So it's important to actually explicitly model multiple variants. So that's what we did in the third study where we included conformity to multiple variants. And it's not so easy because if you have this huge distribution of baby names, which ones Distribution of baby names, which ones do you call popular? Which ones are unpopular? It was actually quite a non-trivial problem. So I was going to say talk to me more later. The conference is basically over, but email me if you're interested. And then we also combine this multiple variants with the stochastic, and then finally with Igor. Igor led this study on finite population size. And it's really cool. Check it out. Really cool, check it out. So, thank you so much for listening. Here are my acknowledgements. And yeah, let me know if you have any questions. We certainly have time for some questions. Yes. Have you tried doing this, so so so currently you're you're updating ev ev everybody everybody updates all at the same time. Um and so you can you can have this overshoot. Yes. You could have this overshoot. So, have you tried this where there's some kind of sequential update? No, we haven't, but that's a really good point. I wouldn't expect there to be this huge overshoot if you had that. So, yeah, that's a good question. Haven't tried it. So, I mean, for some of the other things, probably some of the later things, it might not make, it may or may not make differences. So, yeah, so the jump-in won't be robust to that, but it's unclear what the others would do. What the others would be. There are some studies on networks, and weirdly enough, they're in statistical physics. So, the red and blue that I was showing, it's like the up and down spin of an electron. And there are a lot of studies that effectively do conformity, but to electrons. And they don't have this discrete generation thing. They have networks with one individual changes and so on and so on. So, the Ising model type thing. So, there is some study of that, but Study of that, but we didn't do that together. That's a really good question. Yeah. Yeah, I'm curious about like this, you know, as soon as you make it random, you get this kind of anything can happen. But I guess conformity, if you're thinking of it culturally, it might not change completely with me. So I wondered if you thought about putting autocorrelation in there and see, like, that probably moves you from this sort of sane world of its constant to this insane world that it's constant. Not insane. Yeah. Much more variable. Yeah. So, yeah, carries for that. Yeah, so by autocorrelation, do you mean some dependency on the previous conformity coefficient with the current? Yeah, actually someone asked that at a previous time I gave this talk and I was like, that would be really cool. We haven't done it yet. But I think it would be not only cool, but also more realistic because those previous studies that I showed of empirical research, it was not totally random. Was not totally random. It was a steady decrease in conformity over time. So I think that would be super interesting and a more realistic approach. So, yes. Do you have any of those social science experiments that are, you know, about where a bunch of people give a wrong answer and then somebody's asked to try to conform or not? Do any of those really estimate? Like, really estimate, you know, like vary the group size and like estimate the coefficients by groups so that you have some chance of putting numbers in that would come out of some specific. Yes, so that's a study by Bond and Smith that I had before. There we go. They looked at not only the temporal dynamics, but also the group size. So there there is a ton of study on that. There's also a study by Krishna on group size. But yeah, it's it's a little weird because it and Yeah, it's a little weird because at least in this Asian type, the point is to go against some intuition and pick something else. And they often, even though the group size was different, they would often have a case where it was a unanimous majority saying, you know, this line is the shortest or this line is the most similar to this line. And so it's hard to measure these differences of three role models out of six or, you know, things like that. But yeah. But yeah, it's something to delve into more. And definitely group size has been looked at, but it's, yeah, the majorities are sometimes not perfect corresponding to this model. Okay. I'd like to thank Caledo again for its report.
