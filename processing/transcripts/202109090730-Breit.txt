We are very happy to welcome Dominique Bright from Eriat Watt University, who is going to talk about the global basis of regularity for non-linear elliptic problems. Please, Dominique. Thank you very much for this kind introduction. So I'm about to share my screen. I hope you can see it. First of all, let me thank the organizers for inviting me. Organizers for inviting me. It's certainly a pity that we are not in Canada right now, but on the other hand, since my wife is highly pregnant, I would not be permitted to travel to Canada at the moment. So I'm kind of lucky that this is an online workshop. So I'm going to talk about a global base of regularity basically for the Pilar Blaschen problem. This is a joint work with Anna Baiki and Lastining, who are both in the audience. And so the task is we want the base of estimate for the Estimate for the Peter-Plausian system in terms of the right-hand side. So the non-linear flux should have the same regularity like the forcing in divergence form in the Besoff scale. And we want to know what are the minimal assumptions on the boundary such that one can get such a result. So this is based on several other works of us on the P-Laplacian and boundary regularity, about which I will speak briefly. About which I will speak briefly, but let me start with an introduction. I guess the experts among you about for P Laplace will be a bit bored, but let me start with the setup. So, this is the system I'm considering. So, here you see for P larger than two, this is degenerate. For P smaller than two, it's singular, and of course, it's non-linear. And mostly, I'm considering this with right-hand side in divergence form. So, the basic idea is, and I will make this more precise in the following, we would This is more precise in the following. We would like to cancel the divergence out of this equation and saying that this guy has the same regularity than this guy. But let's start at the very beginning. So first of all, when can we expect a solution? What is the solution? So if we have a bounded Lipschitz domain, and this will always be the case, and P is any number larger than one, then you have a weak solution, provided this F lies in the dual. This is very trivial because you get immediately an estimate. You get immediately an estimate, and also you can prove existence by monotone operator or by the direct method in the calculus of variation. So, this is very standard. Also, I have to say, for global results, I will always consider zero boundary conditions. Okay, so whenever I have a global result, in most cases, it's absolutely unclear if you can do this for non-homogeneous boundary conditions. And in a general case, I'm vectorial and also I'm in any dimensions. However, a special case of my result, of our result, My result of our result is only valid in the case of two dimensions and scalar functions. So we have a much better result in this case, and I will mention this at a time. So, as I said, the question is, how does the regularity from the right-hand side transfer to the solution? And I will start by going over some well-known results. Let me start with the classical theory. Of course, you can never be better than the homogeneous system. So, consider the Pilar-Plauschen with The P-Laplacian with right-hand side zero, so looking for p-harmonic functions, and then it's a classical result by Ureitsever that solutions belong to C1α for some alpha. It's also important to know that one cannot prove this for any alpha. So there is some alpha which is between zero and one for which we have this regularity. And there are also results on the optimal values of alpha. And in general, this optimal value for alpha, I mean, the optimal values are only known in the 2D case. Values are only known in the 2D case. The optimal value is strictly below one. And nowadays, it's also known that this nonlinear flux can belong to Z1. Of course, this does not imply necessarily that the gradient of U is in Z1 because there's this guy in between. So Ural Sever only dealt with the case of equations, and this was later generalized to systems by Ulnbeck. And the system so important is that here the nonlinearity is a function on the absolute. As a function on the absolute value of the gradient. And these systems, they are then called Uhenbeck systems. And for these kinds of systems, one can prove zero and alpha regularity also in the vectorial case. And without this so-called Uhenbeck structure, this is wrong. So there are counterexamples. Uhenbeck only did this for the case P larger than 2, but there are some duality arguments which enable one to prove this also for the subquadratic case. And then there are several consequences. And then there are several subsequent results which prove the same result in the subcratitude case by Achabi Fusco, Di Benedetto, Manfredi, and Tokstorff. And as I said, there's then this important paper by Manfredi and Divanic. Actually, it should be Ivanic and Manfredi, but it doesn't matter. Well, they have the two-dimensional case and they have optimal values for alpha. So it's important to know you cannot get the result for any alpha. So in the following, I will speak about estimates in the alpha besides others. Estimates in the alpha besides others. When I speak about estimates in the alpha, in general, you cannot get them for any alpha because, of course, you can never be better than the homogeneous problem. So, let me go now to what we now call maximal regularity theory. So, this is better, local maximal regularity theory. So, the idea is we want to transfer the regularity from the right-hand side to the non-linear flux. Okay. And typically, when you have an information over the Information over the right-hand side, remember right-hand side in divergence form over the ball 2B, then you get an information about the nonlinear flux in a smaller ball. It doesn't have to be a 2B and a B. It could also be a B and 3 over 2B. It doesn't matter. But for the local estimates, the domain here has to be larger than this one. And if you go with this domain to this domain, the constant will blow up. So you can actually make precise how these constants depend on the rate. How these constants depend on the radius. So, this is the local theory. And the starting point for this nonlinear Kalduron sequence theory in the local case was a paper by Ivaniech, and he could solve this problem in the LQ scale. So, such an estimate if X is LQ, but this is only possible if Q is larger than P prime. Dominic, can I say something? Yes, please. Actually, the first result is by Luc Tartar that incorporates the Vaniet's result. That incorporates Devanget's result because in 71 looked at Arrest a paper on linear interpolation where he proves various estimates, including the one in LP by interpolation. And he's able to catch the Pilaplacian case, not in the parabolic case, but in the elliptic case. And then this paper was largely overlooked by many people, including Divanians. Including us, yes. So thank you, Verbach. So, thank you, Verbachi. You're absolutely right. I was not aware of this result. Yeah, thank you. I mean, never underrate what Luktart can do. I mean, okay, yes. Thank you, Rosario. I was really not aware of this. So, because usually people saying the starting point was Ivanić. Yes, I was saying that too, and then I realized that at least globally, not globally. At least globally, not locally, globally, you can get that globally. Yeah, because you can localize and you, in some of your papers, you certainly claim that it's my, it's my, yeah, because I was, I was, uh, I mean, I was referring to the local theory, and then you can localize easily what Tibang does. But then you're right, it's also partially my fault. Okay, so there are further results by. Okay, so there are further results by the Benedetto and Manfredi, and also by Kino and Zu. They have now also some coefficients in the system. So, this is the Q case. And I mean, there are many, many results in this direction. And I'm not mentioning all of them. I'm only mentioning them, which are exactly in this framework, because as Rosario said, there are for instance parabolic results. So, an important result by Ajabi and Mincione is something in the spirit for parabolic pilaplation. But let me continue with the scalar function spaces for the elliptic problem. So, an interesting space is, of course, BMO. Why is this interesting? Because, well, you can do this for a q, but you can certainly not do this for L infinity, right? Because we know singular integral operators are not continuous in L infinity. So one is thinking, is there anything you can do in L infinity? No, you cannot, but there is a nice space which is, in a sense, in between a Q space and. A Q space and infinity, and this is BMO. And also, BMO is measuring oscillations. And many things which I'm doing today are based on oscillations. So, BMO is an important space. This was done by the Benedetto and Manfredi, and they proved this estimate in the case of BMO. But they are not doing this really this comparison here. So they are comparing the gradient and F, and due to this, they are unable to handle the case P is smaller than 2. And then later on, there's a paper by Dean Kaplitsky and Schwarz. There's a paper by Deani Kaplitsky and Schwarzscher where they can do the full range of P and they have the estimate in this form. And since BMO deals with oscillations, they notice that when you deal with oscillations, you can also put a weight on your oscillations. And when you put the weight on your oscillations, there's hardly a difference between BMO and Campanato spaces. So within the same proof, they get an estimate for the alpha. Okay. So of course, this alpha, as I already said, you can. This alpha, as I already said, you can, of course, not be better than the homogeneous problem. So, this is some alpha. So, I mean, or let's say this is there, there's an upper bound for this alpha, which is strictly below zero and one. And we do not precisely know this value. Okay. But you can, of course, think that this alpha is already some kind of differentiability. So, what I'm going to speak about are basal spaces, so I'm interested in fractional differentiability. And another point in fractional differentiability is a result by Is a result by Avalonkusi and Mincione, and they can get fractional differentiability for the P-Laplacian for any s which is smaller than one, but not exactly in this spirit, because of course you cannot get such an estimate in W11. This is obvious, right? W11 is a bad space. So what they are doing is they're having a right-hand side not in divergence form, they're having a right-hand side as a Radon measure. So of course, this is very similar to saying that F is in W11, but not exactly. That f is in w11, but not exactly the same, and then there's, of course, some loss, but nevertheless, they get any differentiability which is smaller than one. So, this is a starting point for fractional differentiability. So, let me continue with fractional differentiability and then with Bayes of spaces. So, the first result on Bayes of spaces is by Dali, Darket, Diemen Dealing, Hartmann-Scharf, and Weimer. And they can have such an estimate for the Base of scale provided the differentiability. Provided the differentiability. So, this S is the differentiability of the Base of space. Later on, I will come up with a definition of Base of spaces, but let me just start with this. So, important is this S is the fractional differentiability. And of course, this fractional differentiability has to be limited because it's kind of limited from the homogeneous case because of the C alpha C. Otherwise, for rho and Q, there are not many restrictions. So, rho and Q, they need to be chosen in a way that the base of space components. way that the base of space compactly embeds into l prime lp prime and then you can check from embeddings what what you need on these uh on these uh exponents okay so otherwise uh rho and q they are they are very arbitrary and another interesting step is so what i what i said here this is for systems any dimension in system and then there's a very special case in two dimensions the scalar problem uh then there's a paper by uh bulky delinging and weimer and Bulky Dealing and Weimer, and they get the full range of differentiability exponents. So they can get any S which is smaller than one, and the same pairs of rho and Q such that you have this embedding. And this is actually what I'm going to build up. This is the result which we can now prove globally. Another result in terms of differentiability is by Gianke and Marcia, and they can get estimates in W12. But W12, in a sense, is special, so they cannot. In a sense, it is special, so they cannot move away from the power two here. So, this only works for W12, it does not work for W1Q with a different power here. And they even have it globally, but unfortunately, I forgot to mention the assumptions on the boundary here. So this result is even globally, and they have optimal assumptions on the boundary, but they do not have the full range of exponents P. And in the subsequent paper, they have some improvement regarding the conditions on P. The conditions on P. And this is more or less the end of my survey for the local theory. As I said, I'm aware that there are many, many local results which I did not mention, mainly because I wanted to have results in this framework where I have a function space X and I compare capital F with the nonlinear flux. Let me now move. So you see, there's already a wide range of function spaces in which you can get such an estimate. So we are now moving to the global case. I would say, I mean, there are, of course, results on a global case, but I think the global regularity is not as good as understood as the local one. So one thing is, of course, clear. What you expect is if you have a smooth domain, then you expect that the local estimates extend to global estimates. By a global estimate, I mean I have the problem posed on a bounded domain with respect to zero boundary conditions, and I have here and here exactly the same. Have here and here exactly the same space. And as I said, philosophically, you expect for smooth domains, local estimates extend to global estimates, but I'm more interested in finding the optimal assumptions on the boundary. So I think one of the first results for the global regularity is by Kinwen and Su, and they can get a Q estimates if you have a C1 beta boundary. I will explain later. beta boundary. I will explain later on what a C1 beta boundary exactly means. And I think what Bjorn and Wang did later, this is already going more or less optimal. They have a Reifenberg flat domain. So in a sense, they have the Lipschitz boundary with a locally small Lipschitz constant. And then they have the global IQ estimate. There are also results in C alpha. So I would say these are actually classical results by Lieberman and Chen and D. Benedict. Lieberman and Shenandi Benedetto. So they get some kind of global C alpha estimates, but they were at the time not interested in an optimal result regarding the boundary. So they have the alpha estimate and the boundary is in Z1 beta, but they do not have a relation between alpha and beta. And also they have everything in non-divergence form. So it's certainly an important starting point, but it's not the same spirit we have. And then in a recent And then in a recent paper with Andrea, Las and Sebastian, so I just got the official acceptance letter, so I expect it to be published in 2022. So we can get a Z alpha estimate provided the boundary belongs in Z1 alpha. And this is certainly the optimal result. What we can also do, I mean, we have such an estimate in a scale of function spaces. So we have Cambanato estimates. Here I'm cheating a little. It should actually be the corresponding Cambanato space, which is not. corresponding Cambanato space, which is not exactly the same. So for Z alpha, it was of course clear what you need to require from the boundary, but it was not clear what you need for BMO. If you want to have a global BMO estimate, when we started, we didn't know what we need to assume for the boundary. But at the end of the story, after a couple of years, we had a sharp result. So we know we need a boundary such that the modulus of continuity of the gradient of the boundary coordinates decays faster than logarithmic. Than logarithmic, and this faster sharp. So, if this assumption is violated, the estimate is not true. Okay, so here we have optimal results for C alpha and for BMO. And in the next step, I'm going to speak about the Base of case. So I want to have global Base of estimates. I want to have here and here the same Base of space. And I want to know what I need to assume about the boundary, okay, to get such an estimate. Boundary, okay, to get such an estimate. As I said, it's clear if I have a smooth boundary, it should be fine. But what are the minimal assumptions? This is what we are after. And before I go into more details, I should give you a definition of the base of space. So I told you oscillations are very important in several things I already mentioned. So what is the oscillation? You take a function, you subtract the mean value. And since we want estimates at a boundary, I always intersect my boards with a boundary. Always intersect my balls with a boundary, and then there's a power w. And this w is not so important for my definition, it's usually usually this definition is equivalent for different values of w as long as everything is well defined. So if you look here at the Base of norm, obviously S is the differentiability and Q is kind of the integrability, rho is defined scale. Then you have here the norm of the function, which is scaled in our definition, and then you integrate. And then you integrate the oscillation. So, you want, of course, know how the oscillation behaves in time and space. And as I said, this Q is important. In particular, if you choose rho to be Q, you get the standard fractural Zobolev spaces, the Zobolev Zopoterki spaces. And this actually gives a characterization of Baseov spaces. This is basically due to Schwarzmann and Tribel. So they can prove if you have a function for which this quantity is finite, then you execute. For which this quantity is finite, then you can extend it to a global Bayoff function. Of course, in many standard definitions for Base of spaces, they're always defined on the whole space. And then here I speak about R omega. Of course, it's clear what this means if our domain is a ball, but if it's not a ball, and we are always speaking about Lipschitz domains, because otherwise the estimates are not true, then this is usually something like the diameter of the domain. Good. So this is about Besoff spaces. About Bezov spaces. Another technicality I should explain you is, of course, the boundary, because I'm interested in optimal results with respect to the regularity of the boundary. So let me show you on this slide how you can describe the boundary. So first of all, when we describe the boundary in a certain point, of course, I can always assume that this point is the origin, and I can, of course, also rotate my system such that the system is not a system. rotate my system such that the normal in uh at the normal inmind point is looking down right so this is the normal vector of my domain and then i can locally describe my boundary with using a function phi okay and my boundary is described such that the ends variable is larger than the graph of phi and this depends then well if you are in 2d you have only two variables so you would say that x2 is larger than phi of x1 right and then you actually have a graph so you're you're above a graph Actually, you have a graph. So, you're above a graph. And the point of interest is the original. So, and this function phi, and then you have to do this locally, right? So, you need many, many coordinate systems to cover the complete boundary. And on each of them, locally, we will provide an estimate. And once you sum over them, you will have a global estimate. This function is now only defined. This function is now only. This function is now only defined on the flat boundary. We need to kind of extend it in order to transform our system. So, eventually, we need to describe our system in terms of a flat boundary. And for this, we need a coordinate transform. And we need to extend my function phi to the whole space. And this has to be done in a way that, first of all, the regularity preserves in the right way. And also, this extension needs to be one-to-one. So, first of all, one can So, first of all, one can define this extension operator t. This is due to Masya and Chaposhnikova in the book on Zubolev multipliers. So, if you have the function phi, you can extend it to the whole space from Rn minus one. And then, of course, you gain some differentiability. You gain exactly one over Q, right? On the other hand, the trace space of this space is exactly the space, right? Space right, so this means this space is the extension space of this one. So the regularity is preserved in the right way, and then one has to do a little little shift of this function to make it one-to-one. So we have a slightly different version than what Mastya and Shakosnikova do. We do it like this because when you now take the Jacobian and you know that the Lipschitz constant of phi is small, then you will know the Lipschitz constant of. you will know the Lipschitz constant of Tφ is small, which means the gradient of this part is small, and the gradient of this part is the identity matrix. So the gradient of capital Phi will be close to the identity matrix. This will be important. And how close it is, this will depend on the regularity of phi. Okay? So this is how I characterize my boundary. And I think then I can already move to the main result. I can already move to the main result while I do so. Can I check the time because I don't have a watch next to me? Yes, it's 52, so 11.52 at London time. So we started at 30, so it's 22 minutes. It remains 13 minutes. 13 minutes. Yeah, this is fine. This is fine. Okay, thank you. So this is the result. So as I said, This is the result. So, as I said, we wanted to transfer the regularity from capital F to the nonlinear flux in the same space, so in the same bit of space. And the question is, so this was already known locally, the question is, what do you need to know about the boundary? And this is the result. So, the boundary, the differentiability of the boundary is one more than the trace space of this. Okay, so you add here one, you go to the trace space, and then you're here. Gray space, and then you're here. Okay, this is the idea. Why is it one more? Because you take the function which you have here and you have to differentiate it. You have to differentiate this function phi. And then, well, you should be in this space. So again, you take this differentiability, you add one, and you take the trace space. The trace space loses one over Q in differentiability. And this result is sharp. Why is this? And this result is sharp. Why is this result sharp? Because it's known in the linear case to be sharp. Okay? So, in the book by Mashti and Shaposhtikova and Sobolev multipliers, they have an extensive study on this for the Laplacian. And they also have counter-examples. And in the linear case, of course, they can do this for any value of differentiability. We cannot do this for any value of differentiability. If you want to argue in the general case, in the general case, you're always limited by the regularity of the Limited by the regularity of the homogeneous problem. So we can only do this for any S which is below the exponent which you get in the homogeneous case. Okay. Unless we're talking about the 2D case. The 2D case is better because this is what I already said before, the base of estimates in the 2D case, they can be done for any s and I will tell you in a minute why. So in the 2D case, if p is larger than 2, we have this estimate. This estimate for any value of differentiability which is between zero and one. Or I should say, I don't think we need this restriction p larger or equal than two. Here we do need it, but I think for the general case, we don't. But we recently had an argument about the proof. So I thought I rather write it like this because everything will be recorded, just to be on the safe side. Actually, I thought when I announced that I'm going to speak about I'm going to speak about this paper. I will push Lars a little bit that we can finish the paper. Unfortunately, it didn't work. And then Lars told me that on the contra side, he expects me to be very familiar with everything, so I can now finish the paper very soon. Okay, so let me see who wins. Good. So this is the main result. It seems I have around 10 minutes left, so I can speak a little bit about the proof. When you want to prove such an estimate, Want to prove such an estimate? So, first of all, you need two ingredients. So, you always need to know what's happening with the homogeneous problem, and you need to know how you can compare the homogeneous problem to the non-homogeneous problem. So, you need a homogeneous decay and you need a comparison. This is the decay. So these kind of decays, they are, of course, very classical. Not in this form, but the idea is, of course, that you have mean value integrals over a small ball compared. Small ball compared with average integrals over a large ball, and then here you see a power of the radius. Okay, this is, of course, very standard. What's maybe not that standard here is that you have the power one here and you have the nonlinear flux. You would probably expect that you have either just the gradient in the power two or that you have this nonlinear tensor, which we usually call v in the power two. This is more or less what was done before. This is more or less what was done before, and in this form, this was done by Gini-Kablitzki and Schwarzacher. And they can do this for any beta, which is for any beta, which is smaller than beta naught. So there's an upper limit for the beta. And this is exactly what gives us the upper limit for the differentiability in the Base of estimate. On the other hand, if P is larger than 2 and N is 2 and we are speaking about equations, then this can be done for any beta. And this was proved in this recent paper by Proved in this recent paper by Gediling and Weimar. And because, in the two-dimensional case, this can be done for any beta. This is the reason why we can do also the Besoff estimate for any beta. Because these kind of oscillations, they translate very nicely to the Besoff norm in the way I just showed you the definition of the Besoff norm. And then we have a comparison. This is our pointwise estimate. So this is now the version for the whole. This is now the version for the whole space. So, this is the sharp maximal function. So, this is the oscillation, and then you take the supreme over the radius. And we can bound the sharp maximal function of the nonlinear flux by the sharp maximal function of the right-hand side. This is a joint work with Andrea, Lars, Tomo, and Sebastian. And this is the version for the Pilar plushen on the whole space. If you're not on the whole space, there's some kind of lower order term, which I neglected here, which does not really influence. Here, which does not really influence the result. What's so nice about this pointwise estimate is, first of all, you now get a local, you now get a maximal regularity estimate whenever the sharp maximal function is continuous. And the sharp maximal function is continuous in many spaces, in particular on acute spaces, on BMO. And one can also do this with some weights. And if you put it a right weight, you immediately get Campanado spaces. And of course, you can also do this for Lorentz and all its space. This is for Lorentz and all its spaces. If you now put this together, the decay for the homogeneous problem and the comparison, these are of course now still local things. So the question is now, how do you do this globally? And this is now where you need to change your coordinates. And remember the way I defined my coordinates. So I started with this function little phi. And this function little phi is then defined. Little phi is then defined on a flat boundary, and we extend it from the flat boundary to the whole space. And then we have new coordinates, and with respect to the new coordinates, we get a perturbed system. So instead of the P-Laplacian, we actually get this operator, which we do not like very much. So I write it as the P-Laplacian and the perturbation. And then remember, this gradient phi is close to the identity. And because this gradient phi is close to the identity, this term is some. Identity, this term is somehow close to this term. And how close it is is described by the regularity of gradient capital phi, which is basically the regularity of gradient little phi. So the error here will be controlled in terms of the boundary regularity. And if you do that, you get some kind of boundary decay estimate. So you take a small ball. So this is now the oscillation over a small ball. oscillation over a small ball with radius theta t in a point x. And I'm intersecting my balls with omega because I want to have boundary estimates and here is the power in my oscillation. As you remember the power in the oscillation in my base of definition is not that important. So it's not important that here you get a slightly larger power. So this Q can be any number larger than one. So what's of course already nice, you control now the Already nice, you control now the oscillation in a small ball by the oscillation of the right-hand side in a larger ball. And here, here, here's a term which can eventually be absorbed because here, this is coming from my decay, right? So this is exactly coming from my decay. So if my theta is small, then this is small. And this beta, this is the number from the decay estimate, okay? So if you now take this quantity, remember I defined the base of norms with respect to... I define the Bays of norms with respect to oscillations. If I now integrate this in time and space, I get my Bayoff norm. And if I do an easy coordinate transform, because of the smallness here, I can absorb this term into the left-hand side. And then I have the right Bayoff norm on the left-hand side. And here I will have the Bayes of norm of my forcing term. Okay, it doesn't matter that the power here is slightly larger. Base of norms are equivalent. That okay, so then there's one problem, and now this is of course where the boundary comes into play. This is what I get to, okay, and this is where you can see the regularity of the boundary, okay? So here you have an integral over the large domain with radius t, gradient 2 to the power p minus 1, and here you have the oscillation of gradient capital phi. So this is what we still need to control. Okay, so now I So now I show you how to estimate this. So the point is, I take this integral and I want to bound this integral by some kind of oscillation in the lower order term. Okay. And this is what I'm going to show you on the next slide. So here's my oscillation. So this is some kind of auxiliary lemma. I hope you believe me. The proof is not very difficult. Okay. So you can bound this by some kind of oscillation and the lower. Oscillation and the lower order term. Okay. The lower order term is fine because the lower order term can always be controlled by the L P prime norm of the nonlinear flux. And by the standard estimate, this A P prime norm is, of course, the L P norm of gradient U, which can be controlled by the L P prime norm of capital F. This is trivial. But then we have again the oscillation here. And when I integrate this oscillation here, I get the create this oscillation here i get the base of norm of gradient capital phi and the base of norm of gradient capital phi remember this is the extension of my little phi okay and i can bound this by the base of norm of my little phi but my little phi has less differentiability than my capital phi right because it only belongs to the trace space okay and this is where you need where you need the base of regularity of the boundary there's of course another term so here you have again the oscillation So, here you have again the oscillation of my function. So, you have the oscillation of this guy. And so, the oscillation of my function has, of course, be put to the left-hand side of my inequality shape. So, this means I have here a term which I want to absorb. And then I noticed that the oscillation of gradient capital phi, remember, the oscillation, my gradient capital phi is the identity matrix plus a perturbation. The identity matrix doesn't oscillate, okay? So, I Oscillate. Okay. So I only need to consider the oscillation of my perturbation, and the oscillation of my perturbation is the extension of little phi. So everything can be bounded by the gradient of little phi. And I'm arguing locally. So locally, I have a small Lipschitz constant. This is one of my assumptions. I need the right base of regularity, and I need a small Lipschitz constant. And because of the small Lipschitz constant, I can eventually absorb this guy as well. And then I absorb this. And then I absorb this term. This term is either absorbed or lower order, and this is the one I want. And then we are done. Okay, so this is it. I hope I'm kind of in time. So thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Dominique, for this very interesting talk. Is there any question from the audience? Yes, I have a question. Yes. Um hi Dominique, thanks for your talk. Hi. I think that you made mention of the difficulty that arise when you have a non-homogeneous boundary data. Yes, yes. So my question is: I mean, like, since in the proof, you somehow use the knowledge of the system in the whole space. Somehow, if you put the boundary, the question is, I mean, of course. Put the boundary, the question is: I mean, of course, if you want to prove such a result, you need to do localization. Is the difficulty coming from the localization or some what we are doing? What we are doing is we are flattening the boundary and then we reflect the equation at the flat boundary. And to do this, we need zero boundary values. So, you simply reflect it. So, you have a system at the flat boundary, then you reflect it over the boundary, and then you get a low. Over the boundary, and then you get a local estimate for the reflected problem. Yeah, but then, okay, if you put non-zero data, I mean, if you have a non-zero data, so like, I guess that, like, if you know what happens in the whole space, maybe there is a way to do the actual. Yes, but I don't know how to reflect it then. That's the problem. Of course, well, it's not a problem about the whole space. The problem is if you have basically the problem in a half ball. Basically, the problem in a half ball, how do you get a problem in the full ball? And this we don't know in this case, and this doesn't seem to be so trivial because, well, many, so I mean, many, many questions here with non-zero boundary data are absolutely open. Okay. That's good. But thank you. Actually, this was an interesting question. I should have mentioned on this slide that we're doing a reflection. And yeah, this is the method, or at least where I found it first is the paper by... Where I found it first is the paper by Cheni Benedetto, which is actually dealing with a parabolic case. Okay, thank you. I have a question. Yes, a great talk. Thank you. What happens if you add a coefficient? And how does special interact with the flattening and to be honest? I didn't try yet. So you would see the coefficients here. And well, I can certainly tell you if your coefficients are smooth, it should work. Okay. But of course, we want to know how smooth they have to be to do this thing. And this I don't know. To be honest, I'm not even sure if there's a local result. So first of all, I would try to prove a local result based on estimates with coefficients. I don't even think that this is known. And then I would move to the boundary. Yeah. Yeah. So, as I said, for smooth coefficients, definitely yes. What is the right assumption, the optimal assumption on the coefficients, this I don't know. But there are probably results in a linear case where one would, I don't know. One could even check if I'm not even sure if it's known in a linear case. Okay, thank you. Is there any other questions? Other questions? If not, let me thank again very much Dominique. I will stop the recording.
