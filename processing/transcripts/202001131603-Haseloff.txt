Um so I started off by trying to find find out when ice streams were first mentioned as ice dreams. And it seems that it goes back to so it's definitely Swissenbank in 1954 termed ice streams as what we understand them to be now, namely regions of fast-flowing ice bordered by slowly moving ice. Also a characteristic is that major ice stream trunks are normally fed by smaller tributaries. Normally not many. By smaller tributaries. Commonly not mentioned, but that is an essential aspect of ice streams. And they might or might not be topographically controlled. The literature does a little bit of, tries to distinguish between topographically controlled and uncontrolled ice streams, but I will argue that that is maybe a little bit of an artificial distinction that doesn't always apply. And so I put on this reference too because it was claimed by Susan Beck that it was. Claimed by Susan Beck that it was Harry Rink in Danish Greenland, its people and its products in 1877 who first mentioned ice streams. I read the chapter, I could not find the word ice streams, but it is actually really interesting. He determines the velocity of that outlet glacier from the calving rate, or he tries to do at least, which was pretty impressive. But the magnitude was a bit off. Okay, so why do we care about ice creams? Well, I think everybody. Well, I think everybody will agree that faster flow can lead to more mass loss. And if everything else is constant, then more mass loss can lead to shrinking of the ice sheet. And normally we talk about Antarctic ice streams. It has been claimed that they might account for as much as 90% of the Antarctic ice loss. I put a question mark there because the paper that's commonly cited doesn't actually calculate this number. Calculate this number. So it's a little bit, we don't actually know how much is discharged by ice streams. So if somebody has a model to calculate that, that would be interesting. And so we normally, we are often focusing on the Cybercoast ice streams, particularly because they show temporal variations and patterning. So this is the Cyprus Coast down here. This is the snap velocity map of Antarctica. And this is a blow-up. And so And so, just to highlight some of those temporal variations, this used to be an ice stream, Kama Ice Stream, or an active ice stream, we still call it an ice stream. It shut down about 180 years ago, for a relatively short period of time. There used to be an ice stream flowing somewhat perpendicular across Cyprus here, it was called Cyprus Ice Stream. It's not there right now, but that was about 350 years ago. There are other examples for ice flow rearrangement. Examples for ice flow rearrangements, mostly in fact for paleo data. For instance, that villain's ice cream shut off and reactivated. The other thing is this patterning. So if you imagine this to be orange, you could imagine this being like fingers coming out of the ice sheet with somewhat even, like the widths of these ice streams approximately similar, as is the distance between them. And so this is. Them and so this is reminiscent of a fingering instability. And one question people have asked is how can that actually form out of especially a flat ice sheet without any perturbations. Okay, so that's why we focus often on these ice streams. However, there are also non-Antarctic ice streams which I think we should not forget. One example is a North East Greenland ice stream, which has received most attention, at least from this crowd, as far as I can tell. And there are also paleo ice uh streams. Higher ice streams. For instance, the Lowntide ice sheet has had at least 117 different ice streams, which have been mapped from all kinds of different pyro data. Some of these ice streams are, so the ice streams are these darker colored regions. Some of these are land terminating, some of these are marine terminating. There is evidence that some of them are topographically confined and some of them are unconfined. And there's also evidence for repeated and sudden changes. Also, evidence for repeated and sudden change of flow pattern. So it's actually also quite interesting, just as a background. Okay, so I said there is this, in the literature often they do this distinction between topographically constrained ice streams and unconstrained ice streams. And that is a part because we think we understand why topographically constrained ice streams should be flowing very fast. If that if you have a deep bedrock trough, the ice is thicker and thicker ice should be moving fast. Thicker and thicker ice should be moving faster without any kind of internal feedback because we can have more shearing across the ice column. This is the driving stress. DUDZ is a vertical strain rate. So use the velocity eta is a viscosity. Also, we expect a warmer bed. The conductive cooling at the bed scales with one over the nice sigma. So we expect it to be warmer and therefore they form faster. And then this is constant. And then this is contrasted with typographically unconstrained ice streams. And again, the cybercoast ice streams are often cited as a prime example. And the key here is that the ice thickness alone cannot explain the fast flow, because ice streams are often thinner than the surrounding ice widgets, or at least they are not thicker. That means we need, instead, a thermomechanical feedback that explains this fast flow. So, which is the second part of the session title. Title. And so I just want to say topographically unconstrained does not necessarily mean there is no topographic control at all. Of course, there is evidence for dynamic history, which means that the topographic control does not determine everything, but that doesn't mean that the bed is necessarily flat. You can take cross-sections across different ice streams, but you often find quite variable topography. So here, for instance, you have a rather nice trough, a cosmic. Ice trough across Michaela ice stream. Here, this is more complex across Willen's ice stream. But so I think most ice streams actually fall somewhere in between, and we shouldn't forget that. And I will come back to the role of topography in a little bit. Yes, so but we still nevertheless we need a somewhere mechanical feedback to explain the fast flow. So what are these feedbacks? We could distinguish two feedbacks. Distinguish two feedbacks. One would be the thermo-viscous feedback. So the viscosity depends on the temperature. So if we increase the flow speed, we increase the heat dissipation. This can warm up the bed, warm up the ice. Below the welting point, this can lead to weakening of the viscosity. This can lead to enhanced information. It leads to faster flow. That is positive feedback. This is the temperature dependence of the viscosity or the weight factor is given here. This also applies. Is given here. This also applies to tepid ice because the viscosity of tepid ice also changes with meltwater content, with higher meltwater content actually making the ice softer. So we can actually take that into account for tepid ice as well. And then I think I took this distinction from the Duck Brigerhof paper, which I'm going to talk a bit more. There, we can also turn something else, a term of frictional feedback, where we look at the feedback between Feedback between heat dissipation at the bed and fast flow. So, fast flow speed goes up where we have sliding, we can dissipate more heat at the bed again. This produces milk water at the bed, this can lubricate the flow more, and we can again get faster flow speeds. So this is conceptually the these are the feed positive thermomechanical feedbacks that explain the fast flow. Now I want to talk about some models, a small selection. I mostly selected the models based on. Small selection. I mostly selected the models based on, well, I like them, and people in the audience have contributed to them. So I thought it would be interesting. But I went back first to the famous or infamous Iceman experiment from 2000. This is a, for those who don't know it, this is a regularly symmetric land terminating ice sheet. We have the shallow ice approximation for the ice flow. We have a temperature-dependent viscosity. And as the accumulation and surface temperature depend on radius, Accumulation and surface temperature depend on radius, which means if you don't have that, the I sheet would never end. So you need that so that the I sheet is actually finite. And there were several different modes where you could do this in the comparison. F was without basis sliding. So you have basically just shearing through the ice column. And these are the results from 10 different models. They all evolve into a steady state. And plotted here is the basal temperature as contours. Contours. And so you see, every model produces something different. They do all produce ice streams as fingers. If there is a temperature-dependent sliding law, then ice streams form as well, and those are time-dependent, so they change over time. So that was great. So the strong physics feedback can produce ice streams. However, as Ed Buller pointed out, these instabilities were literally a numerical error. So that was actually. So that was actually not correct. Also, Richard Teimmas pointed out that membrane stresses are actually really important to produce consistent ice streams. So these are two examples. So membrane stresses, I think, were introduced earlier. These are where we include the horizontal stress gradients, which you neglect in the shallow ice approximation. And so these are outputs without membrane stresses for different resolutions. Membrane stresses for different resolutions: 50 km grid, 25 km grid, 12.5 kilometer grid. So you see this, you get more I streams the finer the grid. And these two are actually at the same resolution, but with different initial conditions. So they all both evolve to steady state but different stresses. On the other hand, if you include the membrane stresses, you see how 50 kilometers, 25 kilometers, 12.5 kilometers, 5 kilometers, you get a consistent pattern. And so it was recognized: this is, you need This is, you need at least a certain amount of model to actually get that consistent. Okay, so jump up to 2015, where a model was implemented by Doug Prinkoff, which actually included the numerical necessities to produce consistent ice streams. So it's again a basically version of the Iceman 2H experiments. So this is the one which produced time-dependent ice streams. You have the splatter path. Ice streams, you have the splitter-putting equations, so they're sometimes called higher-order equations. You have again temperature-dependent viscosity, you have temperature-dependent basal sliding, which is basically the, you have a low basal shear stress if the, well, that's more like a viscosity, but when the temperature is at the melting point and while the temperature is below the melting point, you have a high basal resistance. All right, I think. I should say there's no subglacial drainage model. There's no subnational drainage model, but there is. So we solve for temperature, or not, we solve for temperature and velocity, and yeah. Okay, and so this is what happens if you run a model. With the colour. Yeah, so the colours is this is a speed. The colour red is fast, blue is zero. And so after an initial spin-up period, what you start to see is like these ice beams. Like these ice streams forming, it's quite mesmerizing, which look somewhat consistent with what you expect. They are able to migrate, they can shrink, they can, like two ice streams can merge together. Is that in the audience? Yeah, anything else you want to add to that? Just to. I'm going to explain why that's happening, but. There's statistically consistent patterns. Consistent patterns. Right. Yeah, they're consistently consistent with our observations of ice cream. Yes, let me explain what happens with the ice surface? Yes, let me explain what happens. So here I'm plotting at one, or plotted, at one point within this ice sheet, the velocity, just focus on the purple line, for instance, and the velocity anomaly, and the temperature anomaly. Anomaly and the temperature anomaly. And if I don't know if you can see the yellow line, but this is the one which has the highest amplitude. And so what happens is the temperature goes up as the ice becomes thicker and you get more deformation. This flow speed goes up in terms, and then it goes up really fast because you have this coupling between places sliding at temperature where you have a switch. And then you discharge a lot of ice. This eventually leads to a reduction in ice thickness that leads. Reduction ice thickness that needs to more conduct the cooling, and that is why then the ice stream shuts down. And then you can see that the temperature here goes down again. And this is basically how we think these spatial, these temporal oscillations of ice streams actually happen. This is kind of feedback that you can understand that you have a fast surge or fast streaming and then you have discharge too much ice and then you have to shut down and rebuild that ice. Anything you want to add? Uh anything you want to add? Uh you could do it. I'm super curious to uh still super curious to try and put this in the context of uh Elisa Mentelli's work, which I think we'll hear about. Yeah. Is that right? I think she'll talk about that after me at some point. Yes. Well actually ask a good question because you put in a discontinuous sliding level, which makes me very nervous, and then you have a discontinuous sliding. Be very narrow, so then you have discontinuous stresses. Chalk it up to numerical error and hope that the sliding mode is from low friction to high friction. Yes. The velocity is going to be continuous. The velocity is continuous because it's not stresses, but you're sort of like differentiated for the stresses. Is beta a continuous function of temperature across as a two-valued thing. No, it's two-valued. Yeah, so I I think the weak form, isn't it okay to have discontinuous coefficients? That's what we saw. Well, it doesn't matter how you solve it, because the numerical are the same. If you can pose the question in the function, it's different. So it's the weak function. If the numerics are the same equations, it doesn't actually matter if you have the finish. So if you have a discontinuity where you're strong to weak, isn't that going to generate a stress singularity? Essentially, a crack fall at that point, right? Yes. But it's discontinuous. It's the stress, not the velocity. Right, it's in the pressure field, the stress field. I think it's just basal stress that's basal stress that's continuous. This is the way your tire works. I think Elisa is going to talk about that problem quite a bit more afterwards, so I don't want to put it. Afterwards, so I don't want to interrupt the discussion, but I think we keep it in mind that having a jump in Bayes US versus is something to discuss. So you're showing these ones where they're constantly going on and off. Does this model ever produce a steady streaming state? I don't actually know. So they're always turning on and off, yes. Is that also true if you have a temperature? Have an non-temperature dependent if you have just those look? Well, there is no streaming behavior that occurs if there's only a single basal traction coefficient, if there's no temperature dependence. Okay, so thanks. So I just wanted to, so we can see that there are these thermal oscillations of this induct model that are. This index model that are coming from the thermoviscous feedback. And I just want to point out this is indeed also important for marine ice sheets. I took this from Alex Bell's paper, but Doug McGee already pointed out there's a pitch perch model, which he made up for hydrogen events, where you have these thermal oscillations of surges of the long-term ice sheet. So this is actually also important to marine ice sheet dynamics. Dynamics and I was a flow line model that Alex run, which solved both velocity and temperature. And I want me to add anything else? Where is he? Okay. Yes. And so here's just a snapshot of observations to illustrate that this is actually something we see in observations, or not in direct observations, but in reconstructed data sets. This is from Catania at Alpha. Data set. This is from Catania Delphin 2012. This would be, it's like a sketch of the present-day flow in this area down here. I marked the things in orange, which are actually supposed to be fast-flowing, and this is a grounding line. She reconstructed that about in the year 1000, this should have been the flow pattern. So you see, there were quite a bit more active ice streams. You have here the cycle ice stream that I referred to earlier. What I referred to earlier. And the grounding line was actually in a different position, so quite a bit further downstream. And then if you go to the year 1160 or 50, then this ice stream here has shut off and the gaunting line has retreated. And I'm not going to go through all the explanations what's happening. Just see that the gaunting line is advancing and retreating and the flow is shutting off and down and rearranging. So it's actually obviously something that's important beyond just Beyond just ice streams in isolation. Okay, so we can get these oscillations in large-scale ice sheet models. And at the same time, people started looking, or actually early already, at cross-sectional models, which I think with really Eckenmeyer in 1994 might have been the first one to really start that for ice streams. And he started by looking at these observations. Started by looking at these observations across the tributary of Willand Ice Stream, back then Ice Stream B. This is the velocity here. Dots is the observed speed across the half width of the ice stream. And the dashed lines are a model that you ran. It's just a very simple cross-sectional model. They didn't solve for temperature or anything. They introduced the so-called enhancement factor, which takes care of whatever you can't match. And they determined strain rates, which I marked here in red. Terminal strain rates, which I marked here in red. And so you can see there are very high strain rates in the margins where the flow flows to zero. And it did not take long to realize that high strain in the margin leads to higher heat dissipation in the margins. And that can lead to temperate ice. And so more recent models by all these people realized that you can get temperate ice in the ice stream margin. So here I'm plotting a cross-section. So here I'm plotting a cross-section through half an ice stream. This is a temperate region. This is a temperature. This is a bed. It's an idealized model. Here, this is a velocity. And this is here both the basal melt rate and the glacial heat contribution. So both turned together. If you include weakening due to thermoviscous coupling, this focuses the temperate region and also increases the amount of melt that is actually ejected into the subglacial system, as Jenny pointed out. Glacial system, as Jenny pointed out, in 2014. And you even get further weakening if you take into account that and glacial meltwater and temperate ice can actually further weaken ice metrics. And so you can actually get significant amounts of meltwater that enter the subglacial drainage system here at the margin. The exact amount is actually uncertain because we don't know the hydraulic permeability and the viscosity dependence on the melt water content well. Dependence on the meltwater content well enough to constrain it. Okay, so we know there's a lot of meltwater coming into the ice-stream margin. But if we go back to larger scale models, no, not large-scale models, then most extended models, or actually all extended models I'm aware of, that resolve two horizontal dimensions and which investigate the interaction between ice flow and subplatial hydrology, for instance, normally like T dissipation in the ice stream margin. Here I'm showing Margin. Here I'm showing a plot by Christophersen et al. 2014. He took the observed surface speeds from the ice streams, of the ice streams in the Cyprus Coast and determined what the basal melt rates should be. I guess it's hard to see in detail, but in some parts the melting is actually lowest in the margin and higher in the center, which makes sense intuitively because the flow is faster. Faster. On the other hand, if you have a cross-sectional model, you cannot actually resolve the water flux in two directions. But subglacial drainage is actually important. And I want to just, Andrew has done a lot of work, Theresa Kirk-Smith did quite a bit of work on this, looking at the emergence of ice streams due to hydraulic runaway. So this is a different class of bottles where ice streams emerge spontaneously on the stream. Ice streams emerge spontaneously on a flatbed due to an instability in the subglacious drainage system. So I'm just going to explain this plot. This is a surface speed with red fast and blue slow. And these are snapshots of time, 82 years, 105 years and 300 years. This is the water content of the bed with dark brown being a low water content and blue being a high water content. Blue being a high water content, and this is the ice thickness. So, red is a lower ice thickness, and this is a higher ice thickness in between. And so, you see these ice streams emerging over time. They evolve into basically a steady state, and the ice streams coincide with more water at the bed and thinner ice, as you would expect. And so, clearly, subglacial drainage is important, and it is a part, of course, determined by the location. A part, of course, determined by the location of malt water production. So, this is basically one way how you can formulate the mass balance of water at the bed. This is the water content in the till layer, for instance, with the void ratio and the thickness of that layer. This would be the water flux, and at the recess model, you reduce heat dissipation at the bed. This model does not actually include the thermoviscous feedback. So, she the viscosity is actually constant and then. Because it's actually constant in that model. I mean, she takes into account the change for the basal melt rates that you need to change the melting at the bed, but otherwise, that's not in it. Okay, so I hope you see that circulation drainage is important. And if you, this has actually led to these triple valued sliding law. I don't know whether you've encountered those, but those basically if you integrated over the circulation drainage system, you would find that the sliding law you know has like a slow mode and a fast mode. Has like a slow mode and a fast mode. And that is basically the same as the Duck's model, where you have slow sliding when the temperature is low, and fast sliding when the temperature is fast. Christian has a comment? Yeah, I'll do the answer. Sorry, you're seeing the former supervisor, supervisor relationship here. No, I was going to ask the further. The thermomechanical feedback and the hydraulic feedback at their heart do they share something here? So you go faster, you dissipate more heat. You make the ice weaker or you make the bed warmer, it slides. You slide faster, you make more heat, that makes water. And if your drainage system is such that more water throughput means a less More water throughput means a lower effective pressure means faster sliding. It goes faster. So, in essence, there's just how the extra dissipation translates into faster motion gets a different label almost. But it's not that the drain system by itself does something without the whole dissipation feedback actually still being there. Yeah, that's what I was pointing at. I mean, there are different ways to create these instabilities. I tend to think it's sort of one instability. I tend to think it's the one instability with one particular component switched out, but it always does the same thing, in the sense that it has to generate faster flow for more dissipation. And there are drainage models for which this isn't the case, so once you have channels, you kill that feedback. Another version is the undrained till. Yeah, so that's saying that it's... But this, Theresa's model, that doesn't have the aspect of thickening ice insulates the bed. Insulates the bed leads to melting. I mean, it's not well, no, so no, she does actually size thickness, if I'm not completely mistaken, features on the beta-ltrate. So that actually, you can't, you need that in there. Well, there isn't a distinction here between the same feedback can potentially explain oscillatory motion and it can also explain patterning, because the feedback can give you a spatial runaway, or it can give you a temporal runway. Or we can give you a temporal runway and combining the two parts. Quite. So, yes. Thanks, Christian. So, I just thought I included one more study here, which is by Hiset Ail, and Auger was on that paper, which looked at the role of small, bad, or relatively large amplitude, well, like wavelengths. I think they are about. Wavelengths, I think they are about like 10 kilometers wide or so, but only 50 kilometers high, so relatively small amplitude, large wavelengths, I would say. Bedrock on ice stream flow. So it's a coupled ice stream model with a simple subglacial hydrology model and a vertically integrated temperature. And so what she found, or what they found, not she, Justin, was that Was that there's a lot of variability that, even with this very simple model, that you couple with the topography and subfacial drainage together that actually evolves. I think there were even like little lakes forming that then would drain, etc. And so I think the point that I want to make is that we have insights from small-scale models, but we don't necessarily always think about how these insights actually translate to the large-scale dynamics of a model. Like we have these cross-sectional models. Like we have these cross-sectional models, but how does the insights about significant heat dissipation in the margins actually translate to a large-scale model like DACS or like a model for all of Antarctica? And is that important? Should we include that? And does that change the dynamics? Especially how does marginal meltwater affect ice-tree flow? Of course, I think that the world of sub-glacial hydrology, topography, and the thermal response of the bat, and the interaction between those two are actually. And the interaction between those two are actually not fully investigated yet. I think hydrology and topography is clear what I mean by that. Thermal response of the bed, some of these models have a thermally activated sliding, that means bed is frozen. So do we actually have to consider a little bit more detail what the bed is doing? Then I think we don't really understand fully now how internal ice stream dynamics affect grounding line dynamics. And the good old searches are The good old searches are the different manifestations of the same feedbacks. And I think it seems to have seen a bit of a renaissance with Doug Ben's work recently. But I think there's still also open questions about those. I think I'm out of time. So I... Yeah, Ian said I should talk about my own work. We talk to talk about our own work. I did that with this guy over there. We try to come up with a parameterization of small scale physics for large scale models. Scale physics for large-scale models by considering an even smaller boundary layer model and deriving a migration rate that could be put in large-scale models. So that's one way you could think about taking these insights from small models into large models. And then I was going to talk about future work, but I think I leave that for EGU next year. Well, this year. Okay. More questions? So we have like 10 minutes or so for the next talk. First of all, drainage always layer at the sub-base, not in glacial. I think both is important. N-glacial would be most intempered ice, right? And that is something where I think we also are just starting to recognize. So we are just starting to recognize the importance of it and how that affects it. I would say, probably in the end, somehow the water has to go down the direction of gravity. But yes, that's also an aspect. And the follow-up question of that is, there are very few measurements of the change in viscosity in glacial water. And I'm just wondering, from playing with stream margins, can you want to speculate what the next great experimentalists should. Experimentalists should, how high should they go in water content? Do you understand what I'm asking? Yes. 1% water content, I think we probably, I don't know, believe in or something. Yeah, so I mean, the data goes up to maximum 3%, maybe only 1%. I should remember that. In the Duval paper. In the Duval 1977. 3%, I think. I'm not sure. But my question is whether how productive are those places and how much are they able to track? To to to produce produ how how how productive in energy uh in in dissipation are the the s uh uh uh ice cream margins in terms of generating high water content as well? Well, that depends a lot on the hydraulic permeability of the separate ice, which basically tells you how much water you can retain. And there is there are basically no reliable measurements of that. And so we looked at that actually in a recent paper and found that if you have Paper and found that if you have a very low permeability, as used by other people in models, you get up to like 10% of the meltwater content. If you have a very high permeability, basically everything just drains out and it doesn't matter. So I and actually, so the project, my last, my postdoc at Princess was co-founded at Oxford. Neil Iverson was on that project as well, and he is actually trying to. Actually, trying to get measurements of the permeability and also the viscosity. And I think the permeability is probably coming first. It seems to be easier, but not easy. And I think that will give a good answer to that question. But so I don't feel confident yet because we don't know. Yeah. Since you mentioned the past, so what would you consider to be looked at complete picture thermodynamic thing? picture thermodynamically I guess, but maybe also mechanically on the bedrock or uh sediment layer underneath the ice sheet or the stream. Well so I think and that goes partly back to PhD, partly back to the work Lisa has been doing that if the bed is completely frozen you can't you wouldn't expect water to be flowing through it, right? So that's the subject that you actually might want to keep track of. And also And also, you actually have to melt the bed if you want to bring it to the melting point. So, I think it would be interesting to actually include a thermally active finite bed layer. And Maya Bugemont and Paul Christopherson have done some work on that. Ellen Rappel has done some more theoretical work on that. I think Colin might have worked on that recently. I don't know where he is. I might be talking about that later too. So I think that is one interesting question, like, I think that would be interesting. Then there is this question of top temperate slip that some people are quite fond of, including myself. And so that is also, I think, something that needs to be further investigated. So there's, yeah, I think partly, I don't want to say I know how exactly to do it. I just think it's something to think about, maybe, to start thinking about good product. About good water. So something like a gravest model, basically. Maybe, yes. I do not want to commit. Yeah, yeah. So my understanding is that large-scale models at the moment can reproduce ice streams in the sense that uh if you fit a slipperiness parameter of some sort, then you get low slip low basalt stress underneath the ice streams and th you get And that you therefore get fast velocities than the most stream. And I'm wondering to what extent you think those models ought to be going in the direction of including the types of physics that you're seeing here giving rise to ice streams forming naturally, or whether ice streams are something that we should just accept we're going to get by fitting and therefore not get them turning on and off, or whether we should be trying to parameterize their effect. Be trying to parameterize their effect somehow through some other type of parameterization? I think that depends on the questions we want to answer with our model to some extent, right? So, for example, in Steve's governing predicting what's going to happen in the next 100 years in terms of sea level rise. Yeah, I mean some ice creams shut off quite quickly, right? And so if you want to be able to or reactivate relatively quickly, so if you think this is a process that's important. Think this is a process that's important, then having the physics in there that can actually reproduce that, I think, is essential. So, I think one of your papers there with Marian, Paul on there, it doesn't matter, but we did a cycle coast catchment and initialized the ice streams to pretty realistic looking initial velocities and then ran it for a couple hundred years. And I think ice stream B stopped. Ice stream B stopped and ice stream C started up again. And the conclusion was not that that was a realization or a simulation that was a prediction, but just that if you looked at the time scales and based when you see started up again, you now turn cyclopost from a sea level rise sink into a sea level rise source. So it is important over the time scales we're interested in. Over the time scales we're interested in. And I think we would like to have that behavior in the models and stop prescribing where ice creams are. And that's the whole goal of the first step, I think, is having subglacial hydrology in there. And you could do that and just run your model from scratch, but you're not going to get ice streams that look necessarily like today. So there's kind of a trade-off between what you're interested in. What you're interested in, right? Exactly what you said. Yeah, and we want both. My understanding is there's a class of models that's been turning off and on and off ice streams forever without describing their locations, which I think that applies to FISM and your model and Saga isn't every lot of models. I think have very few param have a handful of parameters, period. I guess the one question though is whether the oscillations you're seeing are You're seeing whether the model physics that leads to these oscillations are sufficient. I think. And that is, I think. They're sufficient to have oscillations. Yeah, but are they sufficient to have correct oscillations? We won't really know until we look at the more detailed, like insights on more detailed models, I would argue. But yes, I mean, that's, I mean, Duck's model can reproduce ice streams, right? They oscillate beautifully and they have the right wavelengths. Have the right wavelengths. So that's why it shows us. It's just a question: is it doing the right thing for the right reasons? But I mean, that was with a sliding door, which was quite particular and different from something that's keeping the beta fit. So the important property that gave you those streams on the off was the fact that you change beta when the temperature reaches freezing or not. But that's not similar to models that Ed's talking about, where there is a jump condition between the two. I mean it's simply the thermal the only thing in the standard PISM model since 2009, the only thing that changes at the base that really changes strength is temperature. All of the parameters in this, there is no hard switch in beta with temperature, but there's a removal, you know, you freeze the water, and then your subglacial model, which is undrained plastic till, freezes. And now it's strong. So spaghet is, so I guess, I mean, you're talking about the class of models, which I think has. And you're talking about a class of models which I think has a sliding law which is a bit more complicated than one which is just simply fixing the meter parameters of the C. And I guess that's my question: should we be doing that? And if so, what sliding order should we be using? Because it sounds like you can do all sorts of different things if you get ice streams, so how do we know which one is right? Yeah. I mean, to that point, the the only thing that's required in order to get the oscillations To get the oscillations is simply for there to be a monotonically increasing, like the switch is not the only thing that produces the oscillations, right? So you can do the formal stability analysis, which shows that just as long as the sense of change in basal friction goes with the change in water content at the bed, if it goes in one direction, then it will produce oscillations. Yeah. So we're five-ish minutes into Eliza's time. Do we want to keep going or do we want to? I don't want to keep going. I think Elisa's talk might actually answer some questions. So I think it'll shut up automatically now. Not necessarily. Oh, recording in progress. Oh, that'll be an interesting one.
