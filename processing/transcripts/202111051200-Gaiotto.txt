Applications of carol algebras, questions which I don't know how to answer, but which seem interesting and for which in some situations I could do some very toy calculations which convince me that the questions might be meaningful. So a lot of them are about the pairing. The pairing of interesting charl algebras into non-charal CFTs or things that behave like a 2D CFT. Carl algebras which are not rational, but are instead the charlatans which have emerged, which have been discussed in many of the talks in this workshop. So let me start with a very, very quick review of how this Carol Advas emerged from today's context gauge theory. I mean, we already I mean, we already heard it multiple times, so to talk in the discussion on the last couple of days. So I just want to refresh the terminology a moment. So this Karlachva emerge in the context of twists of three-dimensional equals four-digit theories. So these theories have a lot of supersymmetry and admit a variety of twists. These twists simplify this physical theory. simplify these physical theories to something that might be completely topological or that might in which the operators might depend on the positions only holomorphically and only on the position in a plane inside only on two coordinates out of three the space-time so these are called the a and b twists which are topological and then there is olomorphic topological twist now if you want Now, if you want to get the Kiral algebra at first sight, dolomorphic topological twist is the most natural thing to look at, precisely because it has operators which depend holomorphically in two directions of space-time. But this theory in this holomorphic topological twist gives you something which is quite different from vertex algebra. It's more like any one algebra of vertex algebras. And something really derived does not have a specific. Something very derived does not have a stress tensor in the usual sense, and the operations look quite different. You can look at an allomorphic boundary condition for an allomorphic topological theory. That's a little bit better. Those are operators which really live in two dimensions and depend holomorphic on those dimensions. But it's still a bit problematic because some of the operators can be sort of pulled away from the boundary and into the bulk. And there are degrees of freedom in the bulk, and this precludes the existence of things like a boundary stress tense, like a stress tensor for the Kerala algebra. And typically, you get a very large center of operators which come from the bulk. The trick to make things work is to sort of make the bulk topological so that you kill all the local operators in the bulk, or almost all, while keeping the bundle holomorphic. And this can be done. And this can be done in some situations. So there are situations where you start with certain boundary conditions in the tradier confirm theory, you did the zomorphic topological twist, and then you deform the bulk to an A or B model. And the deformation sometimes kills the boundary condition completely, but sometimes doesn't. And when it doesn't, you're left with an actual correlal algebra. Which kind of correlates? Which kind of caravanlas do you get? A pretty large variety. In a particular class of examples, which I will focus on in this talk, are examples which are actually borrowed from four-dimensional equal true gauge theories. So another topic you have heard about a lot is that you can get Karal algebra out of four-binequal true supersymmetric gauge theories using maybe take by. Using maybe by taking the code hormones of some superconformal charges, or perhaps by doing some, again, an olomorphic topological twist together with the anonymous formation. But these four-dimensional constructions, in particular the latter one, can be recast conveniently in a way that makes the gauge theory three-dimensional. Essentially, by taking this omega form plane and making it. In this omega form plane and make it into a cigar. So, as a result, you have a trinical for theory, which is just the result of putting the Fourier theory in a circle. And this Tridinical Fur theory has a boundary condition, which is compatible with these sort of deformations and manipulations that I described before, and which supports the same Kiral algebra as one would have found in a photonic voltage theory. So, in particular, So, in particular, if you starting point with a class S theory, you get Arakawa's vertex algebras living at the boundary of a three-dimensional topological twisted gauge theory. Why do we care? Why is it useful to have them at the boundary of a three-dimensional theory? Well, there are various reasons. One is that it puts them inside this general. That it puts them inside this general framework that has been discussed in the last couple of days, where you have a derived version of the usual relationship between model tensor categories and rational conformity theories. And I'll come back to it in a moment. And the other is that sometimes moving the problem to the world of three-dimensional theories gives you connections that are not available otherwise. For example, these three-dimensional theories can be themselves used. Dimensional theories can be themselves used as boundaries of something else, such as four-dimensional phosphor muzzle. And this brings the Karalajas into the world of, for example, geometric languages. And so you can get interesting statements about the geometric language program starting from these VAs. And I don't know how much I will be able to sketch of that, probably not very much. That probably, not very much. But it's just to say that you can produce interesting results using these vertex algebra, which can be brought over to different realms of mathematics by using this sort of intermediate connection to physics. So, right, so this is the picture that you should have in mind. You have a three-dimensional topological field theory. This is a topological field theory of the cohomological type. Of the cohomological type, so everything is derived. There are spaces of local operators there, but they are not just vector spaces, they are chain complexes. You have categories of line defects, but these are perhaps infinity categories of various sorts. The whole bulk theory is described by some complicated E3 algebra. If you want to put all the pieces together, together with E1 categories of line defects. One categories of line defects, each two categories of surface defects, and so on. Now, this three-dimensional topological filter of the right type can have these boundary conditions which are allomorphic and still being topological, so support a vertex algebra. And then the sort of pictures you can draw are the usual ones. For example, you might have a line ending at the boundary, and at the endpoint of the line, you will find the vertex operator for this Carl algebra. The space of The space to conformal blocks for the Kerala algebra should be related to the space of states of the dimensional theory. The endomorphisms of modules, the radio physical modules in the Carla-Doiner, in some sense, should be related to local operators in the three-dimensional counterfeit theory. And so on. And yes, we would like to understand as much as possible if this picture can. Possible how if this picture can give new insights on these very large classes of Karel algebras. Now, the place where this sort of 3-DTFT interpretation of rational conformity theories was born was the study of actual judicial CFTs. Meaning, if there was this basic problem, if you are given a Carl algebra, rational Carl algebra, what can you say about the conformity theories? You say about the conformative theories, which have this Karal algebra as a symmetry, as a subset of the local operators. And there is the general picture where a full true safety is built from a cargo and half glued together. And the gluing in the topological factory language is described by essentially considering a slab where you take the Riemann surface times a segment, you place Segment, you place the 3D topological filter in the bulk, you place a chiral algebra at one boundary, an anti-chiral algebra at the other boundary, and perhaps in the middle, you put a topological interface which controls which model environment you're talking about, which specific to this CFD you're talking about. And we heard a lot of interesting statements about this construction and its generalizations to the derived case or to various classes of. Or to various classes of non-rational Kerala algebras. And this 3D H2L setup should give a, you know, this twisted 3D HTTL setup should give precise examples of this phenomenon. In particular, it should allow us to build non-chiral versions of these vertex algebra. So there should be, presumably, H2D CFD, which has Arakawa's. Aracawas vertex algebra as holomorphic and antelomorphic as a substitute local operator and combines them in some modular invariant collection of partition functions and correlation functions. So this is the general expectation which I would like to see realized in practice. Now what There are clearly a lot of messages. So, what I want to stress is that all the ingredients in this picture can be given a physical construction. So, there are boundary conditions which give rise to the Kerala algebra. The same boundary conditions performed in a different way will give rise to the anti-Kiral algebra. There are other There are other boundary conditions which start with Chukoma-Chusuku's symmetry in three dimensions, which after the topological twist become topological interfaces and can play the role of these modular environments. So all the ingredients are there in the physical theory and the challenge is to sort of follow what happens after these twists and deformations. Examples of questions which one would like to understand are Which one would like to understand are, for example, what's the space of states for the 2D CFT? What collection of non-CARA vertex operators am I allowed to use in the CFT? And so, and of course, what is the actual partition function? And there are There are, we see there are situations where the algebra has some symmetries, which have a very natural geo interpretation. And then, one of the predictions of these sort of pictures is that if you can, if those symmetries are also a symmetry of the physical setup, then they should remain a symmetry of the Don Cargo theory. And it's actually somewhat non-trivial. Sorry. Sorry, I think there is a slide that was surviving from some other version of the talk. Okay, so what is the simplest example of this picture is the theory of symplectic bosons. So the starting point is a three-dimensional nickel four theory of hyper-free hydromultic. It's a theory of which includes a bunch of scalar fields which transform in A which can groups of four. They live in a particular version of four. And some thermodynamic partners. After the twist, the Turing debulk is really simple. There are really not many, many local operators left. If you use the simplest possible boundary condition, at the boundary, you find a theory of synthetic bosons. Theory of sympathetic bosons, which are essentially the bosonic version of free fermions. So they are bosonic fields with an action of the form z del b z. Now, when you look at this theorem long enough, you see that it has some peculiar features. So the theory of 2D fermions is a true two-dimensional theory. I don't need a 3D bulk to talk about the theory of refermons. Talk about the theory of refergance. But if I try to make sense of the theory of bosons, it's not enough to give the action. I need to decide how do I do it, but integral for this action. And there are some ambiguities on how to do so. Essentially, the point is that when I look at chiral fermions, I can do the path integral just in a formal way. Do the path integral just in a formal way. There are Grassmann variables, you know, a Gaussian integral for Gassman variables, it's something pretty elementary. A Gaussian integral for bosonic variables requires to choose some integration contour, you know, such that your action does not blow up at infinity. So even if you're studying a finite dimensional version of a Bauchampon integral for bosonic fields, you'd like to think just for a second. You have to think just for a second to understand where the contour of integration lies. And as you change the parameters of your theory, the contour integration for a Gaussian is unique, but is not uniquely oriented. So it's possible that you get sign ambiguities as you change the parameters of your theory. So this, I mean, a sign ambiguity is not a very big deal. I mean, a sign ambulity is not a very big deal, but it means that this theory is not a true theory, it's slightly anomalous, and it requires a bulk, a three-dimensional, it has to live at the boundary of a three-dimensional bulk to really make sense. And actually, if you start introducing interesting modules for these theory sympathetic bosons, you can get more complicated situations where you actually have conformal blocks which are multivalued. And so Vietnam has given us at some point years ago a general framework to think about how to do, how to choose integration contours in these sort of theories, which makes sense only in an analytically continuous sense, where the fields are complex valued and you don't have a natural real contour of integration. And it precisely involves putting the theory the bundle of a topological field theory. Topological field theory, and in this situation, the topological field theory is precisely the twisted atom multiples. Now, this theory, so for this very simple example, one can try to figure out what the analog of the picture on the right would be. And as far as I understand, it looks like this: you have a chiral and an antichiral cock of the sympathetic bosons, and we call them Z and C box. We call them Z and C barc. Once you have both of them, you can try to take the path integral of a recontour where the anti-chiral bosons are complex conjugate to the chiral bosons. And as long as you adjust the relative coefficient between the actions properly, you can have the exponent, the path integral being purely imaginary. I invite you to do the simple exercise to do the same thing for. To do the same thing for finite dimensional Gaussian integral, it is a natural way to produce something which is potentially, whose partition function is well defined. For example, if I do this, the integral, the Carroll integral, the partition function on the Riemann surface will be something like one over the square root of the determinant of the del Bar operator. It would have this sign ambiguity. Every sign ambiguity. If you do the same calculation in the non-carrot, you will get something like one over the absolute value of the determinant of the del Bar operator, which has no ambiguity anymore. So, okay, so here the non-Chiral version of the theory is rather simple. It still has some perhaps a bit unexpected features. Perhaps a bit unexpected features. So once you're talking about the non-Carol theory, an actual TB theory, you should be able to talk about things like vector spaces of states, which are not necessarily available when you talk about the character theory. For example, suppose that you're looking at the Ramon sector for the theory of sympletic bosons. So a sector where the symphetic bosons have integral moding. In that sector, the vertex algebra has. In that sector, the vertex algebra has zero modes, C0, A, which form a while algebra. And so to talk about the space of states of the theory synthetic bosons in the Raman sector, you would have to give me a specific module for the Val algebra. But Val algebra does not have just one canonical module, it has a variety of different modules. So the Carroll theory does not have enough. So, the chiral theory does not have a natural answer to the question: what is the space of states in the Ramon sector? On the other hand, in the non-Carral theory, I now have two copies of the Weyl algebra. Imagine having something like position and momentum, holomorphic position and momentum, and anti-holomorphic position and momentum. I can build a canonical Huber space for that, a canonical space of space for that. I can take the L-shoe-normalizable functions on C. Functions on C. I chose my functions of C with the action of two copies of the while algebra, holomorphic and antelomorphic. And that gives me a good action on the zero mode, and then I can build an action of all the other modes by building a while model and using a model for the whole sympathetic Boson algebra. So in the non-Caryot theory, I get an untrivial and rather interesting answer to the question: what is the space of states in the Ramon sector? Is it canonical? Is it canonical? And can I compute well-defined single-value correlation functions of Raman vertex operators, say, on a first theory? Okay. And in this sort of work in the geometric planet program, I found myself computing these sort of things, and that's what led me to sort of ask these questions. So there are some. So, there are some interesting functions that appear in the analytic geometric Langman program, which can be written as correlation of functions of non-carosymptic bosons on a four-sphere, on a sphere with a certain collection of functions. I might be able to come back to it at the end of the talk, but it's really important to get actual functions, actual numbers, rather than Conformal blocks. The next example in order of complexity is a gauge theory, is the twist of a gauge theory. So now you have a choice of gauge group G, and you have some multiples in the representation of the group, which is actually a syntactic representation. Actually, I should have just done this, I guess. Just done this, I guess. A synthetic representation. So, in that case, the vertex algebra associated to that data is a BRST reduction of the sympathetic bosons. So, it takes sympathetic bosons value in the trap presentation. The theory in 4B was superconformal, only the Casimir of the synthetic boson, so just right. Which pretty much means that the G-cosmodic programs in the theory have a level which is twice the critical level. In that situation, you can add a set of ghosts, essentially VC system value with the Liage of the Hook, and you can define a BRST charge and take the commodity BRST charge. The BRST charge is set up in such a way that the BRST variation of the B ghost is the current, so that essentially So, that essentially you are removing the casmodic current for G from the period synthetic bosons. Now, the first, the most basic question one can ask is how good is this description? So, it's clearly very good for computing correlation functions. Correlation functions of the vertex algebra. Well, okay. Sorry, let me say better. When I say that you take the BRST reduction, it means that you're looking for vertex algebra, vertex operators in the homology of the BRST charge, which means that if you want to do calculations with these vertex operators, you can always embed, try to embed them into the original theory. Original theory and do calculations there when everything is free. This will give you a very specific sort of conformal block. But the basic important question is, can you get all conformal blocks somehow from this description? So, if I obtain a vertex algebra as the BST reduction of something else, can I get all the conformable blocks and correlation functions of this new vertex algebra in New vertex algebra in terms of the original synthetic bosons and ghosts. And that's a bit of a tricky question. Asking around how to answer this question, I got answers which involve the modules on the space of bundles and global sections of these modules. It looks mathematically interesting. It looks mathematically interesting. What I have found in the work on the analytic geometric plugins is that there seems to be an actual non-caral version of this construction, which potentially gives you single-valued correlation functions called a 2D theory, which currently is this PLST reduction on sympletic posons. Or actually, of other things. So there seems to be a non-carvel version. is there seems to be a non-carvel version of the steel reduction such that if you if you feed a a two 2d cft to it you get it you get another 2d cft out of that and um i don't know how well known is this construction in the mathematical literature and i would i would love to know more about under which conditions this construction works the idea is The idea is relatively straightforward. So, and it's actually borrowed from string theory. So, in string theory 101, we learn how to do how to strip off the stress tensor from a two-dimensional conformal field theory by doing a BRST reduction. And we get correlation functions in string theory by integrating the correlation functions. By integrating the correlation functions of the regional CFT on the space of compact structures of the Riemann surface. Now, there is a similar construction where you take a CFT like the theoretic bosons, the non-caro one, and you couple it to a bundle on the Riemann surface. So instead of getting just a partition function, you get a feminine partition functions, which is a section of some line over the space of bundles. Line over the space of bundles. What you can do is to use the ghosts to get an actual measure on the space of bundles and then integrate this partition function over the space of bundles. This is a definite operation which has subtleties. The partition functions tend to have singularities at various places in the space of bundles. The singularities appear to be integrable, but not And I'm not an expert of analytic issues. What I did was to do some simple calculations in this context, and these integrals seemed to be meaningful in those contexts. And so, right, the basic question is which sort of modular invariant of the BRST reduced VUA's do I get by doing this integration over the space of bundles of the bundles. Of the partition function or correlation functions of the theory before the reduction. So let me apply this circle of thoughts to Arakawa's vertex algebras, in particular for the case of S2. So as you remember, vertex algebras are associated to topological surfaces. So there are sort of two surfaces in the game. There is the surface on which the Caravaldra lives, which is holomorphic. And then there is another auxiliary surface, which is just something which labels the choice of Caraval Algebra. If the topological surface is a sphere with n points, you get this vertex algebra V of N G, which has the characteristic property that it has n copies of critical transmuting for G. For G, and that the centers of these catsmudis coincide, the image of the centers of the catsmudis coincide in V. These algebra have a nice sort of relations with each other, which reproduce the topological manipulations you can do on the associated surfaces. So, for example, if you take a sphere with n plus n points, A sphere with n plus n points, you can pull it apart into two sub-spheres joined by a thin neck, which you can cut. Correspondingly, if you take two copies of this vertex algebra, one for n plus one points and the other for n plus one points, and you do a BRST reduction of the G-symmetry at the shoulder punctures, you can assemble. You can assemble the result of the BRST reduction will be again one of these vertex algebra for n plus n points. So essentially, you are taking a pair of points, joining together, and transforming into a tube in this topological surface. This is useful because although we have an abstract construction as V and G as a semi-infinite VST reduction, I found it challenging to use that. Be challenging to use that for calculations, especially in the non-Carl case. I'll come back to that. On the other hand, if you happen to know V of NG for small n, say 3, then you can reconstruct all the V of NGs just by repeated BST reduction by the group G. So for example, for the case of SL2, the vertex algebra for three punctures, for the three punctures here for the tiny, Functional sphere for the tiny is an algebra sympletic bosons. It's symplectic bosons for C8. We realize C8 as the tensor product of three copies of the fundamental representation of SL2. So this is a vertex algebra which has three copies of SL2 Casmool inside, and these copies happen to have critical level. So most of these vertex algebra, you know, very, very. You know, very, very intricate and have a lot of generators of various dimensions, but this particular simple example has generators of dimension one half, which have three fields. So by repeated gluing, you can get view of n SHU as N SHU to the N minus. To the n minus 3 gauge theory, coupled to various copies of this hypermultiplus value value in C8. And remarkably, the same vertex algebra can be realized in many different ways. For example, V4 SL2, as you see in the picture at the bottom of the slide, should have four SL2 casmodi subalginas. If I realize it as the If I realize it as the BRST reduction of two copies of V3 by gauging a diagonal SL2, as you can see, two of the four G's would belong to one of the V3 blocks, and the other two would belong to the other one. So I can realize the algebra in three different ways, depending on which pairs of SL shoes am I pairing up. Am I pairing up? And the claim is that the three realizations give me the same algebra, which is actually SO8, a simple quotient of SO8 at 11 minus 2. In that context, the statement is that SO8 at 11 minus 2 is triality invariant, but these realizations are not. So this is a material constraint on the whole construction. If you look at larger n, If you look at larger n, you get even more complicated varieties of possible ways of assembling the vertex algorithms simple blocks. So if I'm looking at V6 SH2, I can realize it in this very nice symmetric way on the right-hand side of the slide, but I could also realize it in many other ways. Essentially, just think about various binary trees with six leaves. Sorry, are there any questions? Sorry, are there any questions? I was not looking at the sorry, my mouse tends to disappear when I play the slides. Are there any questions? What I said until now? Okay. So let's try to do non-carol version. So let's try to do a non-caral version of this construction. I gave a proposal for the non-caral version of V3, which is this non-caral version of sympathetic bosons, this sort of non-caral path integral at the bottom of the slide. Which has nice single-valued partition functions on Deeman surfaces and which can be coupled to three SHU bundles. Three SHU bundles. Now I can try to assemble the more general non-carol versions of the Carol algebra by non-Carol BRST reductions. So recursively, if I want to get the partition function of V K plus K prime minus 2, S 2 or G as a function of this K plus K prime. Of this k plus k prime minus two SU2 bundles. I will take the Parisian function for the two simpler theories. I will take, I will set, and I will integrate, I will set one of the bundles to be C here, to be the same in the two in the two factors, and I will integrate over the choice of bundle, of a set of bundles. Of bundle of essential bundles. And now, so this gives me an answer. And I can ask, does it have good properties? For example, if I do the three different integrals corresponding to different, three different ways of producing a partition function for T4, SL2, do I get the same answer? Or the same for larger n? Larger n. It's not obvious at all. We know that the vectors algebra have this symmetry. So this means that this partition function will satisfy worked identities, which treat the various factors symmetrically. But it's not obvious that the modular invariant combination of them will have this symmetry. It's not an easy thing to check because you would need to write down the partition function on a Riemann surface of some genus greater than one, perhaps, and do integrals of the space of bundles in genus greater than one, which is really painful. The check becomes simpler, perhaps, if we are allowed to add vertex operators to the mix. So that, you know, if I have vertex operators which behave well under these operations. Under these operations, then I can check if perhaps the four-point functions on the sphere of all of these TNs glue well. Right, so in order to test these sort of ideas, I need to enrich a little bit the set of tools available in the discussion of the vertex agulus themselves. But right, so this is the sort of conjectures that I would like to put forward and I would like to verify. So I would like this non-Caral version of Arakawa's algebra to exist to the well-defined partition function, at least for a generic choice of bundles on the Riemann surface. I suspect a singularity, this partition function has singularities for special bundles. And as was mentioned. And as was mentioned in discussion a couple of days ago, I think the singularities might be controlled by maps on the Riemann surface to the associated variety. And I would like to have nice classes of vertex operators, possibly with a natural Gauge theory interpretation. So if I go all the way back, I can try to engineer special line defects in the gauge theory, which have good. Gauge theory, which have good properties, and try to find the corresponding vertex operators for the vertex algebra. And this will give interesting modules for the VUAs. In the 4D inequal true setup, this will be surface defects in the 4D theory, which again can be related to material modules. In particular, well, here I was discussing. Here, I was discussing a model space of bundles. If you start inserting local operators on your Riemann surface, it's natural to encounter modifications of the space of bundle, such as the space of bundles with parabolic points, regular singularities, if you want. And so, and these are things that occur a lot in the general program, at least in the rabbified genetic line dam program. It would have been five geometric lambda problem. And so, one of the kind of modules I would like to see are modules which behave as wild modules for the true for the G-casmoodies and sub-algebras. So I would like to see modules which somehow glued together, a product of one modules for each Casmoody subalgebra, and which behave well as the vertex algebras are glued. Texalgebras are glued this way. So I've checked the existence of such models in the case of SL2, and I'm going to describe them briefly in the rest of the talk. But this is the sort of general thing I would like to generalize and I would like to see. And I can imagine that these models could be produced almost automatically by Arakawa's Bluing construction using semi-infinite commodity. Construction using semi-infinite homology, if one understands well enough. But I leave that as an open question. Another observation which came up in the analytical geometric planner work was that the partitional function of these non-carol theories appear to intertwine the action of Feck operators. The action of ec-operators. Now, this will require a lot more explanation than I'm going to give. But so ec-operators are certain integral operators over the space of L2 sections, L-chronomizable sections on 1, on 1G. But they have a very transparent Karalja interpretation. So whenever you have a Kasmudi Sabaljua. You can talk about spectral flow operators. The spectral flow, spectral flow modules, sorry. Spectral flow modules are sort of parametrized by a point in a fine Grassmanium for the group. So you can define sort of spectral flow vertex operators, they go by a point in a fine Grace Mannium. And you can, if the level is critical, you can average. Average, it turns out these vertex operators behave like a density on the fine-trace money. You can average them over some orbits in the fine-tash man. And these new vertex operators are central, but they're different from the center. So there is a way to build central elements, which is more general than the one of taking the center of the universal ordering algebra of the Ketical Kathmuri. And these central, you know, inserting the central operators in the correlation function is the same as acting with an echo operator on the correlation function itself. And there are some interesting, and it appears that if I build these operators out of either of the n cat-smoody sub-algebras in the vertex algebra, you get the same answer, which sort of generalizes a state. Which sort of generalize this statement that the center so the cuts models coincide. And again, I think this is something that could be proven with vertical techniques, and it would be nice. Finally, another thing that emerges from this analytic geometric lana setup is that probably there is a non-carved version of the gluing construction itself. So here I don't understand it very well, but it looks like the partition functions for these non-caral theories can be written as sort of sum of products of simpler things. The simpler things are labeled by classical opers. So somehow there are solar partition functions, holomorphic partition functions labeled. And antelomorphic partition functions labeled by an opera and biological anti-oper, respectively. And the whole partition function is written as a sum of a products where the pair open where the sum runs over opers, which happen to be also an anti-oper. And I would like to understand this better in a vertex algebra language. Okay, so this is more or less the list of conjectures that I want. I would like to understand better mathematically. Now, perhaps for the rest of the talk, I can give a few details on the vertex operators in the case of SL2. But are there any questions before that? Okay. So So, I want to produce interesting vertex operators for the theory of asynthetic bosons. If, you know, writing down the theory in great detail, I had these fields, Z, alpha, beta, gamma. Each of these indices runs from one to two. Alpha is rotated by one SU2, beta by another SH2, gamma by a third SU2, and a theory which has three SH2 casmoid subalgebras. To customize subalgeogras. There is a very simple OPE, a free-field OPE, with a synthetic form which combines the three synthetic forms on SL2, for C2. The mode algebra is what you could expect. It has these three cases modi subalgebras, which are essentially generated by mobile maps, by quadratic expressions in disease. Disease and the center of these cases, the algebra coincide. Now, how do I build vertex of interesting vertex operators in the serial synthetic bosons? A simple way is to change the condition that some so that the vacuum model is defined by the requirement that all the positive modes kill the vacuum, all the negative modes act freely. Feeling. And one natural way to build other modules is to sort of change the condition for a pair of modes to say that one particular positive mode acts freely and one particular dual negative mode annihilates the acyclic vector. Sometimes these kind of vertex operators are described as a delta function. I mean, the simplest example of a synthetic bosons is the beta gamma system, and you can have vertex. beta gamma system and you can have vector substitutors like delta beta or delta of gamma which set you know imposes zero to beta and give a pole to gamma or impose a zero to gamma or give a pole to beta here i can do the same now it's actually for calculations it's very useful to recruit transform these delta functions into formal integrals of exponentials as i do here so here this v is representing a a delta z plus plus A delta Z plus plus plus times that times the non-Carl version. It's the non-Carl version of that. So it's a vertex operator for which the Z plus plus plus component vanishes at the vertex operator and the Z minus minus minus has a hole. I can generalize the vertex operator by applying a generic SU2 rotation for each of the three SL2s. So more generally, I could say that certainly in a combination That certain linear combination of the Z's vanishes a B, and the dual linear combination has a pole. And so, this will depend on these three directions, you know, A alpha, B beta, C gamma. And so how does this behave when I act with a as a vertex operator for the Casmodi subalgebras? It's easy to check that this actually generates a wild module. This actually generates a wild module. That the positive modes of the vertex of the Casmodi algebra kill V, the negative modes act freely, and the zero modes act by rotations of this A, alpha, B beta, or C gamma. So they act as differential operators on these parameters. So if you want, it turns out to be a wild module induced by the action of SL2 on sections. On sections of O1 or minus 1, I forget on CP1. Anyway, the details are not really very important now. What matters is that although as a modulus synthetic bosons, it was not highest weight, it's the highest weight module for the transmodel subalgebras. And it's generated by this vector, which looks like the tensor product, which You know, the tensor product, which behave like the tensor product of wild vectors or wild modules for the three casmodi subalgebras. Now, what I've checked is that this seemed to behave well under gluing, meaning that if I take now two copies of the synthetic bosons and I do a bureaucratic reduction for a diagonal SL2, I get a module for V4N, which has four. Which has four copies, which behaves like the sensor code of four copies of the wild module, and which seems to treat to be triality invariant, even though the construction of the module is not triality invariant. So it treats the four casmodi algebras on a symmetric footing, even if the construction doesn't. Furthermore, now that I have a relative separator, I can compute correlation functions on a sphere. I can compute a four-point function. I can compute a four-point function. The four-point function of four of these v's is something pretty simple. It's something like it's like one of the square root of a certain complicated polynomial that depends on the positions and on these ABC parameters. And I can take the product of these two partition functions and integrate over the space of bundles, which now is the space of possible A's, because it's the space of parabolic bundles. Because it's a species of parabolic bundles. Anyway, it's a calculation, it's painful, but it's doable. And it again gives an answer which is reality invariant, even if it intermediate steps are not. So it looks like this defines a nice class of vertex operators in all of the Tn SN shoes. The Tn S and shoes, which are the non-canal versions of the Cavas algebras. And I would love to understand better how to characterize this vertex operator and its properties. And I would love to know if it has sort of an alternative blue construction in terms of the semi-infinite cohomology. So, right, so this is a Right, so this is a uh sorry, I think I got the end of my slides. There are two slides that uh were left hanging. So I think I might have uh finished a bit earlier than I thought. Other questions well, you actually finished exactly in time. So let's make maybe everybody thank Davida for his very nice talk. Davida for his very nice talk. Thank you, David. Please, everybody, ask questions. Segu? Second? Thank you so much for a very nice talk. So I have a question about this singularities that appear. Singularities that appear in non-tyrol BRST reduction. So isn't it a little puzzling that if you're considering particular twists, then usually in 3D theory, either Coulomb branch or Higgs branch are not visible to particular choice. So why would we conceptually expect some information like the metric on another branch to help with the singularities? And maybe the second part of the question is how much Maybe the second part of the question is: how much is known on the analytic side of things when we integrate over Bungie or bundles with similarities? So, for the first question, I think the answer for the moment is I don't know. I can make observations of where singularities appear in the examples I've computed. So, for the symplectic bosons, singularities appear when there are zero. Singularities appear when there are zero modes in the action. So, and the zero mode means that there is an actual field, a classical web, which satisfied all bar equal to zero. That looks like an holomorphic map into the Higgs branch of the hypermultiples. In the case of T, right, of the case with four punctures. Of the case with four functions, T4. It also looked like the singularity appears in a place where there is a V for the synthetic bosons, which sort of is an satisfies the moment-map constraint, which looks like a map from the surface into the synthetic. From the surface into the synthetic reduction of the Hagger multiplex, which is again the Hitch branch of the gauge theory. But I don't have a clear-cut argument of why this should be the case. As for the analytic statements, right, so I think Goff, Frankl, Kafdan, have Have definitely been improving our understanding of the singularities of various quantities. I mean, on Bungee. So in that setup, typically there is a patch of Bungee where the wave functions are well behaved, like the very stable bundles, and then there is a wobbly locus where intricate singularities happen. Intricate singularities happen. They can get some analytic control there. I think something similar can be done when you study the partition functions of these theories. In particular, I think the partition functions do give you a true normalizable. Well, I should not say that. I should not say that. Again, I think the integrals are well defined. I cannot immediately prove it. So the simplest type of singularity seems to be sort of one over absolute value of distance on the singularity, which is integrable. But I cannot say what happens when the convention where. I've got convention where when a single locus intersects itself in complicated ways, that's beyond my skills. So, but yeah, the fact that these integrals are well defined is not a given. The fact that these non-caral partition functions make sense is not a given. It deserves to be explored, I think. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I mean, in string theory, the singularities of this sort of integrals or the space of complex structures are very interesting. And they've, you know, they require thinking, right, to make sure that we can actually do these integrals, that there are singularities and they can be interpreted properly. I don't tell it. I don't have a similar picture of BAM in my head. What are the good compatifications that make this integers make sense? Were you also inspired in any way by four dimensions by compactifying from 6D? Because I used to think of that story as totally holomorphic on a curve C. And the way you presented it today, you even used. You presented it today. You even used pictures from Plasa's papers. So, can we think about this in 6D going to 4D instead of three-dimensional interpretation? I'm really confused by that. So, in principle, putting the trigger in a segment should be the same as putting the for the theory in a sphere. So, I've been wondering if there is some kind of supersymmetric compatrification of the forbidden S2 times C, S2 times R2. Yeah, perhaps should be added to the conjectures. There is a supersymmetric compatibility on S2 times R2 of 14 theories, which gives you a open to DCFT. Yeah, I don't wanna. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say more. It should be, it cannot be exactly the same as the natural thing you could do is you say, okay, fine, I take my homomorphic topological twist and I just take the topolog of for the Fouliniculture theory and I put the topological, take the topological directions to be a sphere. That's not going to work, I think. This is more like a TT star sort of thing. Star sort of thing. Perhaps it is literally some kind of a TT star construction. Somehow you want the topological twist in one hemisphere and the anti-topological one in the other hemisphere. Well, I guess I also wonder in a sense if in 6D reduction where in previous work you guys embedded it in T star C. So it looks like C. So it looks like here it's not really embedded in T star C, so it's just complexification on C, which keeps both holomorphic and anti-fallomorphic. Yeah, no, that's right. There is something. I think there might be a sort of supersymmetric background on a sphere which generalizes that it is star background. Target dimension. And then, if you apply it to the 6D theory, maybe it will give you. To the 60 theory, which will give you a phobiolomorphic topological theory, which put on a topological surface gives you this DNG. Do we have another question? I ask a question, perhaps. You mentioned on the way the relation to these analytic languages in the sense of eating off Frankl Kashdan. Well, anyway, that is not the point. Maybe I missed something, but sort of can you describe more precisely? Can can you describe more precisely how it came about in what you were telling us today? I mean, what the exact link is? Because there it's about producing some interesting functions on Bungie.
