Approximation in spiral, post-Newtonian, or effective one body, and then in our simulation in the merger ringdown motion. And then you use parametric fits in between that are categorical in our waveforms. The family of waveforms that I will talk about today particularly is phenomen, which is the frequency domain waveform. And so we have waveforms that are able to detect fifteen or fourteen. Then why are we still talking about modelling or including more teams in our models? More things in Fenon models. Clearly, because we don't have enough Fenon waveforms. So, this is a chart of most of the, pretty much all the Fenon waveforms that we currently have, as in up until O3. Just to point out something, I'll not go into the details of any of these waveforms because that will confirm. The main thing to note over here is that the waveforms that you see on the left-hand side of this black box are all for non-processing systems, and the waveforms you see on the right. Systems and the waveforms you see on the right-hand side are all precession systems. The differentiation that is made between these two is that if you rotate to a non-inertial frame that tracks precession, then the waveform basically mimics that of an aligned spring or non-processing waveform. Now, there is some approximations in that. This has worked so far very well, where you assume that the waveform, the non-processing version, can just be simply twisted up by these all ranges. Twisted up by these Euler angles which track the rotation of the fringe at every instant, and that gives you a very good estimate of the full processing version of the waveform. But in reality, there have been some approximations that have remained thus far. For instance, for binaries which spins in arbitrary direction, the motion is no longer confined in an orbital plane, which is a precessive binary, as I mentioned before. And we assume that the waveform that you get in this copy. That you get in this coprocessing frame, which is the frame that you rotate through by tracking the precession or the non-inertial frame, you assume that you have exactly a non-processing waveform in that frame. But that's not entirely true. Processing waveforms have an asymmetry in the 2,2 and 2-2 mode, which non-processing waveforms do not have. All waveforms, all phenomenal waveforms, and EOB waveforms up until now always assumed this symmetry. So therefore, the 2,2 and 2. So therefore the 2,2 and the 2-2 are not separately moduled. You only make a module of the 2,2 mode and we just generate the 2-2 mode following a symmetry relation that looks like this. But for non-processing, sorry, sorry, for precessing system, this symmetry no longer holds. That's why I put the not equal sign. Now, this asymmetry is born entirely out of spin misalignment. So it's natural to assume that if you model this small effect, your KiP measurements will improve. The other reason why this The other reason why this asymmetry is interesting is because this asymmetry is solely responsible for the out-of-plane kick velocities that you would see in a wiring module. And as some of you may know, that specific configurations can actually lead to really large kick velocities of 4,000 kilometers per second or so. And those are very important because that can actually eject a remnant of the merger outside of a globular cluster or something, and then that will have implications. Cluster or something, and then that will have implications on the rates, etc., and so on, and so forth. The reason why we are interested in Ki B measurement is because off-axis spin or spin misalignments inform us about the binary formation channel, as is commonly believed right now, that if you have isolated binaries, then you typically expect them to be aligned with the orbital angle and momentum. If you have binaries coming from a dynamical channel, then the spins should be isotropically distributed. So, you might ask that why is So, you might ask that why is it then that this was not modelled so far? People did not know? No, of course, people knew it. The reason why this was not modelled so far is because the anti-symmetric part of the waveform is two to three orders of magnitude suppressed compared to the symmetry part of the waveform. So, from the SNR perspective, it did not make any sense to try and model this. Higher modes were far more interesting, and that's why they were targeted first. But now we have higher modes model, and they're very accurate. Now we have processing higher modes model. Now we have processing higher modes model which are also very accurate. And now we see that the asymmetry between the dominant multiples of 222 minus 2 is actually comparable to some of the higher modes. So now it does not remain a good choice to not have this asymmetry included in our processing models. That is that, as I mentioned, since this is an effect entirely borne out of NPN spin component, so we wanted to understand if it actually has a significant impact on Kai P measurements. Impact on Kai-P measurements. The way we go about it is that currently, as I said, all phenomen models model this quantity, which is the symmetry combination of the 2,2 and 2-2 model. So we wanted to preserve the modular nature of phenomen models, which is a great strength, where you have the co-processing waveform, the angle model separately. And so all of these individual parts can evolve separately, and you can continue to improve one part without needing to touch the other. Needing to touch the other. So that's why we produced a model of the anti-symmetric waveform, which is just amplitude and phase, as is the case with the symmetric waveform as well. To give you an idea how this shows up in our simulations, the blue line is the 2 minus 2 root and the red line is the 2, 2 root. And as you can see, the quantity that is modeled in all phenomenals up until XPHM is basically something that goes between these two without any. Between these two without any of these oscillations. Our model of the amplitude and the phase together tries to capture these oscillations as well as the overall amplitude scaling of it. So this is something that we have modeled and we have also included in the latest version of the Phenom model called Phenom XO4A. Terrible name, but I'm not going to get into that. So what Phenom XO4A does is that it includes this asymmetry. This is the first Phenom model to include the asymmetry. In fact, this is the first In fact, this is the first phenomenological approximant, if you consider both phenomena and EOB families, to include the asymmetry. This also includes numerical relativity simulations calibration to the angles for the precession and also some further tweaks or calibration to the co-processing part of the waveform. So, before I show the matches plot, let me explain what's on the axis. On the y-axis, it's typical in waveform performances to show the mismatch, which is 1 minus Show the mismatch, which is 1 minus the match between the NR waveform and the model that is used to generate the waveform, the approximate. On the x-axis, I show the case index. We used 80 NR simulations that we generated with the blank code, and these are publicly available now. And the mass ratios that we passed is one to eight. So for each mass ratio, we have twenty simulations that span across different spin diameters. These are all single spin simulations. These are all single spin simulations and also different spin angles. So 30, 16, 90, and so on and so forth. So moving on to the matches now, the matches that I show over here, the red inverted triangles that you see, is the aligned spin or the coprocessing version of the model that is now included within XPHM. Now as I mentioned, the coprocessing version of XO4A is also improved compared to XPHM. Also improved compared to HPHM. So let's look at that first, which is these blue squares. So the blue squares is the exo4ay co-processing waveform without asymmetries. And if you look at the blue squares across the board, they are better than the red inverted triangles. I should probably mention in this plot on the y-axis, the lower down you are, the better it is, because one minus the match. So that means the less than this match, the better it is. So yeah, as I said, all the blue squares pretty much are lower than the red. Squares pretty much are lower than the red triangles. Now we go on to the green triangles, which are XO4As coprocessing waveform plus the asymmetries. So the matches that we are doing is against the full NR waveform. So the blue squares are coprocessing waveform to 2 with full NR waveform and of course there's no asymmetry. So if you notice the green triangles across all the 80 simulations the green triangles are better than the Better than the blue squares. So, in the corpus asynchronous, we were able to see a significant improvement going from the symmetrized, just symmetric waveform, to adding the asymmetries, and this effects show that. So, in general, whenever you are modeling something extra, you expect it to look better and you expect the masses to get better. But how does it actually translate in terms of observation or data analysis? So, as I said, that the out-of-plane kick is entirely. The out-of-plane kick is entirely because of asymmetries in these multiples. The inclined kick that you get is because of a different mass ratio. So, if you have a mass ratio other than one or if you have differences in spin magnitudes that are aligned components, then you could have an inclined kick in the orbital plane. But if you have an out-of-plane kick, that is almost, that's not almost, that is always because of spin misalignment or in the plane spin. And that is entirely because of the And that is entirely because of the asymmetries in the multiple. So, with that in mind, what we did was, as I said, NR surrogate is a model that is based on the NR simulations. So, of course, it has everything. It has all the features, all the physics, everything. So, that's why we used NR surrogate as our control, so to speak. And we generated the different kick velocities that are attainable if you crank up the asymmetry for a certain configuration. The configuration we are looking over here is EquoMass, so say mass. is equal mass, so same mass for both the black holes. Chi2 is zero, so only the primary is spinning. And the spin magnitude is held fixed at 0.8. And then you let the spin vector basically, you sample over theta and phi, you let the spin vector vary in both theta as well as phi. And then what we see is this range of velocities that you get and also a range of asymmetry amplitude maxima. So the anti-symmetric waveform. The anti-symmetric waveform has an amplitude, as I said, and that we plot just the maximum value of it and the corresponding kick velocities that you get for that. A few things to note over here would be that if you look at this part or any particular vertical line on this, for the same asymmetry, you can have a range of kick velocities. So that means while the asymmetry is the deciding factor for the kicks that you can have, it doesn't determine the highest kick velocity level. So for the same amplitude, So, for the same amplitude, just because the phase of the anti-symmetric waveform shifts a little bit compared to the symmetric waveform phase, that can have a huge impact on the kick velocity that you can attain in this. To compare with this, we generated the kick velocity versus asymmetries with exophore and we found remarkable alignment. The reason why I said remarkable is because, as I said, in our surrogate, it includes the asymmetries in all modes, but exophore includes asymmetries only in the includes asymmetries only in the dominant multiple. So just the total 2 minus 2. You don't have the 3, 1, 3 minus 1 and 3, 3, 3 minus 2. We do not have those. So this completely tells us that the dominant multiple asymmetry is the strongest influence in kicks. And based on just this, this doesn't provide enough motivation to go on to model the next subdominant multipole asymmetry. But of course, more studies we need, there are more studies that we need to do to find out. There are more studies that we need to do to find out, and those are ongoing studies right now. Yeah, the other thing I'd like to point out is that all of the phenomena waveforms, as I mentioned before, would essentially give you case that would lie within these small little back heaps. So if you don't have this asymmetry, you would not be able to generate this plot at all. This is, I'll not be able to show this plot for too long anymore because the EOB people have also modeled the asymmetry in their V5PHM, which is the model that discovered. V5PHM, which is the model that's currently being used, and it's currently under review, and it should be available for me. The next thing is, as I mentioned, that we expect this to improve KI-P measurements because it is borne entirely out of intense film. So, this is a plot where we look at KI-P recovery. We inject with a particular waveform and we recover with the same waveform. The purpose of doing The same waveform. The purpose of doing it that way is to avoid any kind of waveform systematics. So, for the XPHM plots, which is shown in these light and darker blue, for both cases you see that the injected value was somewhere over here, this green cross, green X right here, but the recovered chi P was pretty poor. And this is because, as I said, XPHM does not have the asymmetry. Now, this is a very particular specific configuration for which we Particular specific configuration for which we see this happening. We do not see this happening for all mass ratios and all spins. This is an equal mass binary that is face on to us, so zero integration. And this is a very challenging part to explore for processing waveforms. And the reason is, if you have an equal mouse binary, the spins are processing at the same rate. So precession is anyway quite suppressed. On top of that, if it is at zero inclination to you, it's facing from. At zero inclination to you, it's facing completely towards you. In that case, even in the orbital plane processes, you basically just see it as the amplitude varying in time, and you kind of interpret that as maybe that there's degeneracy in distance, or you're not being able to interpret the distance correctly. But for this particular case, equals binaries, asymmetries are really strong. And on top of that, for zero inclination, asymmetries are the best because you have 2,2. You have 2,2 pointing directly towards you, and 2-2 pointing exactly away from you. So the difference between those are kind of heightened. And that's exactly why, for this particular conservation, we found this to be really interesting. The reason why this is interesting also is because equal mass events are events we see periodically. Most of the times, most of the events that we see in our detectors are equal mass events. And it's kind of problematic that it's difficult to. It's difficult to recover chi P with the current waveforms that we have if we do not have asymmetries in that. Moving on to the next marker. So the previous slide that I showed was of course with SNRs of around 25. But if you crank up the SNRs much higher, so for instance this plot, this is particularly from a systematic study that was done with NR surrogate where they used a symmetrized Used a symmetrized version of NR surrogate, so they removed the asymmetries in the dominant multiple from the NR surrogate. And if you remove the asymmetries, the recovery of the spins that you get is what is shown in red. And if you have the asymmetries, what you get is what is shown in blue. And as you can see, there's this small black cross right here, which is the injected thalum. And the recovered spin posteriors are completely far away from where the injected thalumes are. Values are. And this is for the primary spin magnitude and angle. So this is an SNR 100, but this is for mass ratio 2. And similar things we're seeing for higher mass ratios than this. So for future detectors, this would actually be a significantly higher problem, which is something that we need to focus on. Now, you might wonder that, okay, so if you have a surrogate model that has asymmetries, why do you still need to do it for other models? One reason is that the surrogate model is a model. Models. One reason is that the target model still doesn't generate beyond 65 or 62 solar answers, and we still see events that are way below that. So we need other models that can take care of this problem. The other reason is that, and I think this is something that was talked about quite a bit in the sessions this morning and yesterday in Aminabha's talk, that if we want to claim deviations from GR, we need to make sure that our waveforms have all the physics that we are aware of. And in that regard, there's a Regard, there's a small bit of thing that I want to spend a little bit of time in terms of claiming deviations from the binary hypothesis in GR paradigms. So, a lot of work in this regard has been done by several people in this room already, and Aaron actually talked about this yesterday. What people have normally done is looking at tidal deformations or tidal deviations, sorry, tidal deformabilities, including that in the PN part of the waveform, and trying to see if there. See if they're able to recover that and if searches can be made based on these different kinds of hypotheses that what if what we are detecting are compact objects of more exotic nature and not actually running black hole. Now the biggest challenge in this regard is we don't know what the underlying theory is for these compact objects that we are trying to detect. We don't know what they look like, we don't know what they're made of, and if we are They're made of, and if we are using a mass filtering search where we are only doing slight variations compared to the tidal different mobilities that I mean by just adding tides, then we are assuming that whatever these exotic compact objects are, they are very similar to black holes, but different enough that our mass filtering search will pick them up. So instead of trying to go with a particular theory, what we have done over here is assumed that if it's a compact object, that's not. If it's a compact object that's not a black hole, so it has a compactness lower than that of a black hole, then it has to be bigger than a black hole, which means that it has to merge earlier or establish contact earlier than what would happen for a binary black hole system. So just based on that, what we did was we parametrized the esco, which is typically what we assume to be when the plunge starts. We parameterize that by the compactness, biocompactness parameter as defined over there. And then we taper the amplitude. And when we taper the amplitude to fall off to zero, exactly at that frequency based on Kempurso, we don't know what the Merger remnant could be. It could be a black hole or it could be another exotic object. And that would bring down differently. And that's why this is a completely post-contact agnostic model where if you just change the compactness, then your amplitude falls off earlier than that. The phase of the waveform is exactly the same as the binary backform. Form is exactly the same as the binary back on phase, which would not be the case in reality. But since we don't know, and since a lot of the studies that have been done by people show that those deviations can be really small, so based on that, we are only looking at just cutting of the amplitude earlier than what we see for PDH. So based on that, what we found quite surprising was that we would have expected that if you have an object whose compactness is half of that of a black hole, we would have thought that, oh, there's no. We would have thought that, oh, there's no chance that they're going to detect this. But that's not what we find. Because if you look at this Levong Greenland, which is for a compactness of 0.25, which is half of that of a black hole, you still recover pretty high matches, like 0.95 or so. So you still don't ex I we would not have expected that the matches would be that high even when the amplitude is cut off that earlier. So this was quite interesting and we wanted to push this further to see that how far can we go this way. So the next thing we tried was instead of just tapping thing we tried was instead of just tapering off the amplitude using a using a window function or something, we actually modified phenom D and we introduced compactness as a parameter to phenom D so that we can parameterize the compactness and just crank it up going from whatever value up until 0.5 such that 0.5, thanks, such that 0.5 generates exactly the black hole amplitude that you see over here. So this allows us to smoothly transition. So, this allows us to smoothly transition from some kind of an exotic object, whose theory we are completely agnostic about, all the way up to the binary back home of it. And the reason why I put the names in quotes is because we're not floating this as a wafer model, because there are many caveats to this. And secondly, also, even in order to use this as a sort of a generalized framework, because now that we have introduced compactness as a parameter, which means we should be able to recover compactness, but in order to do that, we definitely need to somehow. Do that, you definitely need to somehow find a way to consistently add that to the phase of the waveform. But it was nice to see that just by this simple modification, it doesn't change things to the likelihood is still sampled well enough so that the compactness that as we inject it is recovered very well. Not just for the black hole value, which is 0.5. If you inject a compactness of 0.25, which is very different from that of a black hole, you're still able to recover that very well. You're still able to recover that very well. So, I'll just like to end with this: that the reason why we continue to model phenomenological models, we continue on that, is because we still need to improve our spin measurements. Our chi-effective, chi-effective is still much better constrained, chi-p is really not well-constrained. And in that regard, adding this model of mode asymmetries is taking us one step closer to making a more accurate model of precession. This model is currently only available in Exo4A, but it has been made in. Available in XO4A, but it has been made in such a way that it can be coded into any frequency domain model, and it's currently being done for Phenomen's VNR, which is supposed to be the model that will be coded in for B. That aside, it is also important to have all these effects included in phenomenological models because NR surrogate is not going to allow us to consider deviations from GR because it's not practical to produce a new NR surrogate for all kinds of different theories of GR or different paradigm other than. Paradigm other than whether it's a vacuum or whether it's some kind of exotic object. Mainly because it takes a decade worth of effort to produce a waveform like that. In that regard, you can see phenomenological models have great flexibility to admit parameters that can explore these deviations. I completely agree that data-driven modeling or model-agnostic searches will replace phenomenological models in the future, but not today. Questions? Sorry. Nice talk. So you said that you only model the leading order due to mode, the asymmetry there. So of course, I would assume that it's difficult to also model the subdominant mode asymmetry. Why did you not do that? Because it is difficult or you just wanted to try the mode first? No, it's not that it's difficult necessarily, it's the same. Difficult necessarily, it's the same thing repeated again. But we had the understanding that the 2,2 model is the most stronger one. So, if you look at the next one, two minus one asymmetry, that's much smaller, that's close to 5,5. So, most of the symmetric models don't work 5.5 anymore. So, it wasn't it's it was the same logic while uh the dominant multipolar symmetry was not modelled in the previous iterations. Yeah, but it's kind of straightforward extension to what you have done also. Extension to what you have done to also include the asymmetry side. Yeah, it's the same, essentially. Good talk. I was wondering when you were showing that injection and recovery had those four years. And I think you made that point that this is for 80 core mass library. So I think a previous slide, a couple of slides back, you have to move, but I was just saying that you'll actually use the You actually use the to compare your results with NR SRB using some DT simulations and the massage show by Tapu Gate, right? Yeah. No, that wasn't NR SRB, that was the NRV font. Actually, NR SRB. So in here, do you actually need all of that mass ratio or higher mass ratios? Or if you only see the deviation or asymmetry in these low or most equal mass binaries? No, it's not that you don't see the asymmetries in the higher mass ratio binaries, it's just that So, there are challenges in the higher mass ratio part of the parameter space, anyway, even with the symmetric waveform. So, we did not see significant improvement in Kai P measurement for the higher mass cases, but that may also be because for the high mass cases, the angle model and the coprocessing model, once those uh are significantly more uh accurate, then adding the asymmetry or not adding the asymmetry might provide a little more support to it. Might provide a little more support to it. But yeah, it's definitely important to model in that case as well. I didn't quite understand the mismatch plot comparing to the BAM simulations across XAS and then LA. So the BAM simulations are processing, right? So XAS is non-processing. So how is the comparison being done? The reason why we look at the coprocessing frame is because At the coprocessing frames, because the asymmetry model is produced in the coprocessing frame. And if I do processing matches, then it's difficult to isolate the error that is introduced by the angle model as well. So that was the main purpose of it. But yeah, if you look at the paper, there are processing matches of the utone remote, so we can also see the. So are you moving the NR waveform into the colon? Into the code, okay? Got it, thank you. We used it, Aladdin. So these the worst madness matches are at the higher mark. Mismatches are at higher mass ratios? What is causing this periodicity in the oh, you mean this? Yeah, this is some index like what is the ordering of this index? Oh, sorry, the spins, yeah. So every score, the first 20 is Q1, then next 20 is Q2 and Q4 and Q8. And within this first 20, the first 5 is spin point 2, next 5 is spin point 4, spin point 6, and spin point 8. 6 and spin 0.8. So higher spins are harder. I just had a couple of things. I was just staring down this plot for a while and then I noticed that there are two points where the blue square is actually below the green triangle. Do you have any comments on those? Right. This one and the other one over there. Anyway, I mean, yeah. Not specifically, because so Because, so, okay, so I did not have time to go into that details. One of the biggest challenges for modeling the asymmetry so far has been, and also one reason why we haven't looked at paramultiples, is that NR data starts getting very noisy. So, for the most part, for the anti-symmetric waveform phase, most of the times it's difficult to tell what we are seeing, whether that's feature or that's actually noise. So, we also need more accurate in our simulations in order to capture those. Because of that, we chose to prioritize our intuition of the physics. Prioritize our intuition of the physics of the asymmetric particles and did not necessarily over-tune the model to work with those specific cases. So that particular case might just be a case where our data is really bad. I think we should stop there. Thanks very much.
