I'm going to be talking about this system that I've been studying for most of my PhD and it's a very rich system that Francesca and I actually had to decide how to split up the talk and to do different things. So she talked about the lensing aspect of these things I study. And I'm going to be talking about the reversibility of this. Of this. And this is one of the videos that Francesca does not have possession of. She had a lot of them, but this is. So this is this colosteric next one. Starting in colosteric and went to symectic. Yeah, colosteric to symectic. So these are now in Brightfield. We have in this space. So we have the symectic phase and we have the colosteric phase and we have Phase and we have reversibility and then memory. Reversibility is kind of an intuitive concept. You can go back and forth between them, but you don't always recover the exact same structure and it's not the same in both directions. And like one of the first reasons we even started thinking about this is because we noticed like, oh, they're both circles. So that's like the one-dimensional way of thinking about it, but it was also like two-dimensional is like, oh, they also occur at the same location. So, this is a microchannel. This is what I use to study these. A microchannel, and this is viewed from above. The focal conics are those circles. And I can heat this up. Now it's in the colosteric phase. I can cool it down, and the focal conics are gone or they're like very much destroyed. Very much destroyed. So I can repeat this. This is the exact same sample taken at the exact same location, taken, I don't know, like 20 minutes later. I have these focal conics in a lot of these locations. I heat it up slightly less. And you can see it kind of looks more smectick-y. Like you can actually see these round features. Actually, see these round features where there's still, like, there was a bucconic there, and I pull it back, a lot of them are back at the original spot. So, what looks cholesteropy? Why wouldn't I think that were symptomic anyhow? If I hadn't seen the picture. Oh, if you hadn't seen the first one, the last one. Yeah, yeah. If I looked at that, it would be simple. Would you say that you don't get these sharp domains everywhere? Domains everywhere, and then you also like right here, you get this sort of point where there's a lot of in a focal conic, you get like more sharp scattering around these edges. You're getting a more smooth one right around this line that goes through. You also don't get lines and it's more of like a feature that the center of these two foboconics kind of melted and. Kind of melted and something is now connecting that, which we've seen before in the simulation. But also right here, actually, right over here it's been chiral. And that's kind of a giveaway also. How is it chiral? These two features kind of curl in one way and then back the other. Curl in one way and then back the other way. It's very slight, but they do this consistently through the entire sample. So it's very obvious you can tell something is completely right-handed or left-handed. Which is my previous one? This is 50K? 50K, yes. This is um 8 CB. You have a door media. Yeah, I'll get yeah, there's 8 CB with uh C D fifteen. Doesn't it pick them only on the Mm. Kyle will submit the question like that. I'll discuss that later. And also I can discuss that more after because this is beyond the focus of this talk. But yes, it does. So the key point here is there's a very small difference that heat up to. Difference that I heated up to in the colosteric phase, like 0.03 degrees difference. And I see a massive difference in the recoverability of these focal conic domains. And we even, the reason I even started thinking about this, so this is an image taken from a paper that Dan Beller was an author of, where my system was looking at colosterics and microchannels. Colosterics and microchannels. These are pneumatics in a thin film. And what I showed in the previous one was heating up and cooling. This is the opposite. This is cooling and then heating up. And these circles are the locations of these defects in the pneumatic phase. And when you cool towards a synecdo, but you don't quite go through an entire phase transition, if you don't go deeply into the synecic phase, you can recover. You can recover what Dan Beller, at least where I first saw the term, the geometric memory, like the positions of these defects. So the idea is that we have this memory, and at some point it gets lost to some severity. This is just what we see anecdotally. So, you know, to answer that question, at what point does this happen? We have to start asking, how do we? Asking, how do we quantify memory at all in a system? And more broadly, under what conditions is memory retained, like specific to one system, or even like what other types of systems do we have memory at. So my specific experimental system, we have these microchannels. They're filled with HCB, and we add a small amount of chiral dopant to it. These microchannels are, this is a cross-section of a The cross-section of a mold I made with them. So they're relatively wide as far as the aspect ratio is concerned. So they're not super flat, but they're also not like cubic or rectangular. And the SU8, which is the epoxy that we use to make the channels, imposes degenerate point anchoring, and there's air above, so we have homeotropic anchoring, so we have the exact conditions we need to form. Have the exact conditions we need to form these human conic arrays. So, could you just talk us through your filling protocol? Yeah, so I put a droplet at one end. So the microchannel array extends over one or two centimeters, and I just put it at one end, and it just, through capillary action, it kind of draws through. In the isotropic. In the isotropic. In the isotropic. Yes. And then you cool into the smack to. Yeah, so before we. Yeah, so before we even start doing servants, we let it equilibriate for whatever hours. And do you quench it or do you cool it some? I will also get to this. Okay, sorry. This matters a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Sorry. But can you just tell me 8 CB in the pneumatic phase with this much CB15 added gives you what pitch? Boomerage. Measured, it's 10. Measured, it's 10 microns. My measurement is 10 microns. So it's on the scale of not only the channels itself, but the radius of the photoconics as well, which is, yeah, so also relates to your question earlier, which I'll get to. So we, yeah, so we have the conditions we need to form these mobile conics. And this on this whole image right here is one channel going, like a time-lapse of a channel as I heat it up to the colosteric phase. And I just put these boxes around. Not all local contics turn into these defects, but the three of them here do. And these, so what these are, they're these domains in the colosteric phase. Phase that are, we say they're topologically equivalent because if you pretend that the focal conic is like two-dimensional and there's this point defect in the middle, you know, there's, we think there's like a half boogem sitting at the bottom of these, at least when they were first created. And you can see there's a circular symmetry around them. So the fact that they occur at the same place is more convincing of this. So, or yeah. Fritesca talked about the lensing ability of these. One of the things everyone wants to be the first person to do is make a tunable microlens array. So you have to ask the question first, how do you get a controllable array of these? These focal conics are at the middle of this channel, but right here we don't have any. And the problem here. And the problem here from the question of how to make an array, which is you want to be able to have control over the positions of it, because you can't do that, you can't really do anything with it from at least an engineering perspective. So we created these indentations along the wall of the channel. So you can just like a corrugated surface. And you can get this nice array of these bubble conics. Nice array of these mobile conics. If you took a picture of this and figured out what the dimensions of this are and then try to make it in the lab, however, you might not see this array at all. In fact, Francesca and I were both, we designed this with other ideas of what we would get in mind. We both had different ideas, and it turns out that not only did neither of them really consistently happen, but this other thing. Really consistently happened, but this other thing, which neither of us thought would happen, was a thing that happened. And to get this, it's kind of a secret recipe I'll just talk about. So if you just cool this from the isotropic towards the colosteric and into the synectic, you'll get some awful thing that looks like if you ask artificial intelligence to make an image of focal conics. It looks kind of disturbing. So I was messing around with this for a while, and most of my experiments are just me in the lab heating things and cooling them up and seeing what happens. So bring this to the colosteric and brought it back. Most of what you see here are like these two vocal clonics that are kind of aside from each other. But the top left, there's this nice, what looks like. Nice, what looks like it one large fobal conic trying to form and this defect in the middle. I thought this was interesting. And actually, I was looking at the time stamps when I took these bit, these photographs, and they were actually like 250-something, 254, 255. I'm like heating these up more, and it starts to look a little bit nicer, but it's like it's all approaching 3 o'clock, and then I stop at 3 o'clock, and I like. And then I stop at 3 o'clock and I thought back what happened. At 3 o'clock in our department, we have this department tea and cookies, where the department just pays to have tea and cookies and the grass students go eat it. It's like a ritual. It's every single day. And I was like, I was actually the person in charge of running it, or making sure that the younger grass students actually do the job. And I was getting really impatient because I was seeing really interesting things. You know, I'm heating this up more. It's like very gradually turning. More, it's like very gradually turning into some interesting thing, but like I just got like a no, like I have to go. And you know, Francesca always talks about how you know you have to let the system relax, you know, very slowly, and then you see the interesting stuff. But it's like three o'clock, and I'm like, okay, whatever. I just walked away and came back like 50 minutes later. And then we have these nice defects in the middle of all these spots. So, yeah, the first interesting thing is that. So yeah, the first interesting thing is that they're mostly at the center of its corresponding pocket in each of these. And the other interesting thing is that this was like 50 minutes later, which means I was like eating tea and cookies for 50 minutes. But the other thing is that this was happening right at the phase transition. And I actually left the lid of the heating chamber off. Of the heating chamber off. So it was going through these small fluctuations in temperature where there's like air flowing around. And one of the things I was thinking is that later on is that these small fluctuations, right, the transition help the system kind of explore its space and then these defects kind of simplify. And then I can cool these down and have the large focal conics, at least in some locations. So this is the image that Francesca showed, which I made three days later. Show wedge, which I made three days later, and it's a much nicer array. And now I can kind of go back to what do you mean it was at the transition? Too slight back. You have a heated stage, it was just sitting there at the transition table. It was sitting like yeah, this is Nicolasteric. It this is half a degree above where you can visibly see it starts to transition. Visibly see it starts to transition. Is there a wave plate in there? No, this is just. Oh, wait, maybe this one was with a wave plate. Just polarizing? No, no, this is just a polarizer. This is a very... I do have images where I used to have wave plate. So it was going through small fluctuations across this like half a degree between where it starts to transition at your symptomic phase and like right above that. And so. And so, what it seems so far is that this transition point is like the perfect point in temperature where this system actually forms these. But Francesca showed in her presentation, if you heat these up, well, you heat these up and you get, like, they're still at their same location. And it's not surprising because I'm going to the same sort of temperature range where this form in the first place. Place. And if I cool it back down, I recover the whole array. But if I heat this up more, and particularly in the top right of the image, right over here, there's this sort of rearrangement. I can play this again because it's the last video I have. Not all of these points in the middle go away, but a couple of them do. And if I just pause at the last frame of this video, If I just pause at the last frame of this video, if I cool back from here, I'm not going to get the whole array of fobal conics. And it seems like these points right here are the sort of facilitators for forming the focal conics in the first place. That's what it seems like anecdotally, at least. And, you know, if I just, if I don't go through these careful steps, I'll just get like this image has these red boxes. The red boxes are the large. The red boxes are the large mobile conics. The rest of these channels don't have these large vocal conics. They're a lot smaller, they're broken in half, or whatever. And so the phase transition doesn't seem like it's the culprit of the memory loss. It seems like it's at some temperature above when the phase transition is completed, perhaps. Which means that the colosteric phase has its own plans, what it's going to do when you go to the colosteric phase, and the colosteric phase is trying to. And the coloceric phase is trying to hide evidence that there were focal codings. So we expect that at some temperature, either this is happening very suddenly, or maybe it's happening gradually over a long temperature range. There's a sort of quest to figure out at what temperature and to what severity is this actually happening. So we have to design an experiment to measure this more carefully. Should I ask an embarrassing question? What's the order of the sweat decay of stats? But the spectrum fade on step is supposed to be order of the phase transition. Oh, it's second order. Wait, the spectric. But often very weak for the. Yeah, it's weakly for labor. It's it's almost like an honor. Almost like an honor. Well no, no, I mean there's there's a challenge, which is a challenge. I also believe that it is like just to the magic it has a there's a specific heat you can measure from the leaf heat that you measure from it very small Right, it's a lay of heat because of that heat is supposed to. Okay, wait. Do you see phase coexistence? Yeah. You have experiments all the time. Between symectic and I mean if you see phase coexistence it should be first. I'll show a picture. It looks like baseball is yeah. Okay. There's a front spair. Yeah. Of course, temperature gradients are. But it's going to be temperature too. You're right, you're right. Yeah, I see fronts that move through and they're always because of those temperature gradients. It doesn't look like there's a solid, like, like a disotropic transition where you see this like, you know, sharp front that moves through. It's more like it kind of gradually transitions this grain across. Transitions that are creating across it. So, whenever I've studied those data, I'm surprised about the first order. Like Dan said, it's weakly first order. I mean, that's to say, if you don't get close enough to the transition, you won't tell. I'll be afraid you can't. How's it going to your question, Carl? Were you expecting if it were second order that you'd get? Expecting if you expect an order that you'd get and it would all organize all at once? That's not what I was expecting, but yeah, I was wondering about correlation lengths directly. I don't know what happens to correlation points in something that's almost second order. It grows, it grows, it grows, and then it jumps. It doesn't divert, right? Sort of natural break, anyways. This is the sort of experiment that we proceed with, just like on a quest to find how this behaves with temperature. This is really simple. We just do these temperature ramps. We heat it to isotropic to sort of wipe any sort of memory. We cool it to just We cool it to just before the Snekti transition right here, and then we cool it very slowly because we want this thing to relax. And then we heat it up to some temperature in the cholesteric phase, which has this red dashed line I indicated, and we cool it back to the smectic again, and then we repeat this. And we record the positions of the focal conics at both these two points of the smectic in between this sort of temperature that we expose. This sort of temperature that we expose it to. What's the length of the x-axis here? How many cookies are you eating per tick? This, so this is on the maybe something between like, I don't know, like more hours, but not quite hours. Not like every tick was an hour. It's more like maybe from here to here is like one hour. So this is um most of these I just run um overnight. I just run overnight. I just tell my camera to take pictures of it. So, and we can, you know, in a quest to find this temperature, every time we do this, we change the temperature we heat this up to. And we see, you know, how is this affecting the reversibility of these focal conics in their positions? So basically, every feed and cooling cycle, we record which ones. Every repeating cooling cycle, we record which ones return the initial position, and then the value we extract or we calculate is conditional probability. So, this is the probability that given that there is a focal conic at time t, given that there was one at time t minus one at any given position. And we measure this for We measure this for these different values of temperature. So the first thing to ask is does this behave differently for different channel geometries? Because the formation rate of these photonics actually does. And there's two different parameters that kind of varied in mass. There is the width of this indentation, which means is this a very sharp triangle or is it a more shallow one? And then there's the spacing between them. And then there's the spacing between them. Are they very far apart, or are they very close together? And for each of them, we can get different values of this conditional probability for different widths and different spacings. And the colored bars are three different temperatures we heat up to. So the red is the lowest temperature we heat it the least. We expect that will. We heated the least, we expect that one to be the greatest, and 35 is heating it much more. This is this magnet transition is around like 29 or 30, so it's a difference of heating it one or two degrees versus heating at like six or seven degrees. And if I heat it all the way to 38 degrees, the isotropic, that's the shortest bars. So we see this potential probability mostly goes away to some small background value where we're wiping the memory completely. And so then I kind of approached the first real issue, which was I wanted to have, I was, so this value of 31, I was trying to find why is this so close to this value of 35? What about values above, or closer to this mental transition? Why can't I get a value closer to 1 instead of 0.7? So this relies on me making a binary choice, like yi. A binary choice, like by I, is this a large focal conic domain? Is it not? And just like typing it all into a document that gets analyzed. And like I got to, I got suspicious, so I started giving myself the exact same images twice in a row, counting them on different days. And I realized that my human precision is like 78%. So I can't distinguish between any values that are around that value of 0.7. So then the obvious thing is that we need someone that doesn't wake up. We need someone that doesn't wake up in a bad mood to categorize these more harshly. We need a more systematic way to measure this. So then I just, the story is also that I started messing around with things like Hoff transformations and edge detection. It wasn't really working great. Francesca said, Hey, Sean, there are astronomers in the building that you work in. They do this for a living. There's probably some in the hallway down where you work. Probably some in the hallway down the way to work. And astronomers do this. They have not only hundreds, but they have hundreds of thousands of these galaxies and these images. They have to, you know, no grad student can sort these by eye. They have to have segmentation that breaks up the image and can run on a grad student's laptop. So I was at Happy Hour. I was talking to my friend Alex, who has defended his thesis now, and I posed this question. And I posed this question to him. I showed him a picture of these humble conics. And he's like, I don't really know what this is, but this seems like he thought it would be easy. He's like, they're perfectly circular. That should be trivial. So I gave him a week or two, and he was using this package, Fogiotils, which is written by someone who works at Space Telescope, which is across the street from the physics department I work at. And it's just an astro eye package. Package. So he came back with this, and this is the microchannel on the left. And these focal conics, you know, a lot of them get detected. And you can see a circle or some sort of blob right where focalconic was, which is really nice. And like right here, this is very obviously focal conic right here. And there's some, you know, like right over here, this is a gap where there's nothing. A gap where there's nothing, and that gets detected as an object. But that's not the worst because it's not an ellipse. So you could just write some software that says, you know, anything that's not kind of elliptical, just discard that. So we're in a really good place to do any image analysis with this. What about the focal concepts that look like a cookie with a mic taken out of it? So the ones that are Okay, the ones that are, I don't, so by bite out of it, you mean like they're against like a hard surface or those. Or against another one. You have some pictures of incomplete focal products, but they're not just a whole bunch of dislocations. The ones that are like if there's a second one sort of intruding on another one's space, these get detected as two different ones with two different sizes. The one that's kind of a cookie or a bite, I think. One that's kind of a cookie or a bite I've taken out of it is actually the most difficult situation. The focal conics that are against the wall, so they're semicircular, we have a way of interpolating the edge beyond the wall. So with this image, now you have segmented every object into, or every photo quantity into a different object. We go through this treatment where actually step zero is to apply this flat field image. This is the same image where they play. This flat field image. This is the same image with contrast, you know, extremely high. You can see it's non-uniform, but your eye can't see it. So we apply a blank image taken with the exact same setting right before I load my sample to normalize this. And then we do the segmentation that I just showed you. And the last step is now that we have these objects, this may be hard to see, but we find the, this is not the exact same image also, but we get the edge. Image also. We get the edge of every single one of these objects. And now we have the edge. This is, we're going to, you know, we just fit ellipses to the edge of every single one of these. And so this is the output from one of my experiments that I was analyzing. And the colors correspond to different rules that I apply because I'm trying to systematically sort them by position and size to find the large ones at the center of the pockets. So the red. So the red ones are oconics that are intersecting with the center of any pockets, which cuts down on computational time because I don't care about the ones that are far away. The green ones pass through this sort of test where they're not too small and they're not too elliptical. And then these bright blue ones pass through a secondary filter where which checks for a combination of their size and their Of their size and their position relative to the center of their pocket, because we're trying to find ones that are mostly in the center, and they're sort of the dominant focal conic in their pocket. And this channel you can see does a pretty good job. Like, even this one that has like this bite, it kind of detects. It's a bit smaller because it kind of gets disrupted, or it gets distracted by the bite. But at this point, I also had to. At this point, I also had to check how precise this, and this giving it an image of oval contics that I very carefully measured and categorized based on like I think this counts or not, this has an accuracy of between like 85 and 90 percent. So it's better than anything I could do. So eventually we started making this data, and this is very preliminary. This is the conditional probability. Probability at multiple different temperatures as you go from the smectic phase to heating up to the colosteric and heating all the way to isotropic. And at least what the plot story that's telling is that at some point past transition, which is the hardest area to resolve what's going on, this condition probability source, it seems to decrease sort of uniformly. So it's not like a sharp, it all disappears. So it's not like a sharp, it all disappears at one point. The more that you, the deeper into the colosteric phase, the more maybe there's this rearrangement, and the more it erases the memory of this little conics before you bring it back. And then it decreases to the sudden background value, isotropic phase. So in summary, we designed an experiment to actually measure this memory effect because we didn't really see anyone that had done something like this before. See anyone that had done something like this before. We used conditional probability as a measure of this memory. And we developed this automatic procedure with this image segmentation for looking at this. And the preliminary data on the last plot suggests that at least it doesn't seem like this memory loss is discontinuous if there's a sharp drop anywhere. But this is something we want to more carefully measure for values really close to the transition where I had. Where I had the largest error bars. I'd like to acknowledge Alex, who did the segmentation, Bia, former student who started this project, and the entire lab. And thank you all for inviting me. Great questions for Sean? Great talk. Great talk. Could you play for us again because the TIC2 colour scar transition video in the undulated channel? It was somewhere around the middle of the call. Around here. This one? I'll just play it. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, there's some detail we can so. Determine recombination. So there's clearly some plus one and minus ones, and some of the plus and minus ones recombine into zeros, but then what's left is an alternation of plus one, minus one, plus one, minus one. Left. What remains in the colosteric phase, these are the oojas you mentioned. Yes. So do the minus ones because those don't come directly from focal product domain. They come in between. They come in between. So do they? They come in between. So, do they help to reconstruct the photo comics when you go back? Yeah, so you gotta go back here. We think that also the counting is tricky to us. We think these are the plus ones. And then it looks like those are, it's hard to tell, those are the, well, actually. And they alternate. So, I mean, we think that having those at the sort of boundary between the focal clonic, because you're going to get that actually defect right in between. But I believe it's a half defect in between the focal conics, or is it? What do you mean by a half? Minus half. Maybe it is a minus one. You have four brushes. Yeah, you have four brushes here. I have four brushes here. I still can't remember when it becomes an actual smectic iconic. I'd have to draw it out and convince myself. But yeah, here it's a minus one. Okay. Also, so I this was Mohammed's question about the Answer it now. Some more of the extra slides. So, this is the question about the does the presence of the chiral dopant affect the prospectic phase? This is two images, more high magnification right before it becomes fococrotic. You can see this like very sharp spiral that forms at the Sharp spiral that forms at the center. I don't actually know if this is the structure itself is some spiral armor. To some extent it is, but I don't know exactly what it looks like through the sample. And then you transition, and I mean it looks like the focal conic is like, you know, broken off from the center where it should be. And we actually see this a lot depending on the height of the channel. The height of the channel and also the exact geometry. This is one, this is the most extreme case, so I just put it on the slide to sort of demonstrate. And the bright field, we also see these cracks that form. Okay, any other questions? Thanks, Sean. And we be back for the next session at half-past.
