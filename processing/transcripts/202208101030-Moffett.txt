So, it's a great pleasure to have Alex Moffin here from North State University, and he's going to talk about cheater suppression and stochastic clearance and spite through forums. Thank you. So, yeah. So, normally when we think about bacterial populations, bacteria exist in very The bacteria exist in very large populations, as indicated by the classic growth curve of bacteria with a lag phase, an exponential growth phase, a stationary phase where the births and deaths balance out on average, and then death once nutrients are used up. But there's been some recent work on the relevance of small Of small population sizes for bacteria. So, for example, clustered growth like Pseudomonas arabinosa grows in aggregates, small aggregates of less than a thousand individuals in lung infections. And also, the initiation of bacterial colonies is usually a small, or can be a small inoculum size, so a small number of individuals that actually initiate a colony. So, this included in this work is trying to understand this phenomenon of stochastic clearance. So, in general, bacterial populations are faced with deaths in the population, whether that's due to lack of nutrients, the action of the immune system if they're within a host. System, if they're within a host or antibiotics or other factors, of course. So stochastic clearance is this term that's been used to describe extinctions of small populations due to fluctuations in the population, usually with sort of outside help, so with the action of an antibiotic or other things helping them go extinct, I guess. Helping them go extinct, I guess. So, this is a really interesting experimental paper where they start with a very small inoculum size and then let the colonies grow in the presence of sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Basically, that just means not enough antibiotic to completely wipe them out deterministically. And yeah, they see random extinction. They see random extinctions of some of the populations, and some of the populations actually escape and they go on to initiate a proper column, a large column. And they can look at the death rate due to antibiotics. So these are special antibiotics that actually kill bacteria. They're always individual growth. And they've related that to the probability of extinction. So, if extinction is actually something that bacteria in certain situations have to deal with, it would make some sense to be able to regulate gene expression according to the population density or size. And so, one mechanism through which bacteria do this, which you might have heard of, is quorum sensing. Basically, bacteria Basically, bacteria produce small molecules called auto inhibitors. Autoinducers, please. That's a narrative slide. Anyway, autoinducers. And they export them outside. Yeah, they export them. And these auto-inducers can diffuse back. They can enter back into the cells that produce them. There we go. Yeah, so they can enter back in the cells that produce them and other bacterial cells and they can induce expression of the enzymes that actually produce them. So it's a positive feedback loop. Lu. And also, that expression is often coupled with, or is coupled with, expression of other genes. And so when the bacteria are at a large enough density, the auto-inducer concentration can accumulate to a large enough size, or you know, it can accumulate so that basically these genes are induced. And so that's a way that they can actually control gene expression. That they can actually control gene expression through the population density or size. So, there's been a lot of work on understanding why bacteria do quorum sensing. And there are really no simple answers. There are a lot of factors that quorum sensing is sensitive to and probably can base give some fitness advantage to bacteria. I I found two sort of interesting and interesting and pervasive explanations are, well, one of them, sorry, is optimal growth. So basically, the genes that are coupled to quorum sensing are often public goods. So what this means is that bacteria export these proteins. These proteins and that can convey a fitness advantage to basically any bacteria nearby. So, one example of this is proteases that break down polypeptides into metabolically useful oligopathy, ones that can actually be imported into cells. And producing these public goods is costly to the bacteria. It can reduce the growth rate, reduce their fitness. Conduce their fitness. So, well, at the same time, the benefits of public goods are actually often density dependent, like the population density. So, by controlling when in the population growth these public goods are produced, bacteria can balance the costs and the benefits in a more or less optimal way to maximize. To maximize their growth rate and their population size with time. And that you can imagine that might reduce the risk of extinction in a small population if some external stressors are introduced, for example, that can start killing them off at a faster rate. And then the second explanation that's been explored a lot in the past, over recent years, is the role of corn. Years is the role of quorum sensing in reducing the risk of cheaters taking over a population. So when bacteria produce these public goods, any bacteria nearby can potentially benefit from them, while only the bacteria that actually produce them have to shoulder the costs. So you might think, so basically, if there's a mutation that prevents some bacteria from Mutation that prevents some bacteria from producing public goods, they can benefit from them, from other cells producing them, but they don't have to pay the cost. So there's a fitness advantage there. And if producers actually regulate the production of public goods depending on the population size, or actually the population size of nearby fellow producers, then they can actually. They can actually basically produce only when they're surrounded by other cooperating bacteria. So, this is a plot just showing that the red plots here are a cheater mutant and the blue are wild-type producers. And these solid lines are fit to experimental data and show the growth rate, the log growth rate, with the initial frequency. Rate with the initial frequency of wild type producers in the population. And basically, you can see that at some points there actually is a higher growth rate for the wild type. Whereas the dashed lines show what would happen if there's production just unconditionally, if producers produce no matter what. And in that case, there's always a fitness advantage for the cheetahs as opposed to the wild-type producers. So, what we are interested in looking at is trade-offs between this, the optimal growth function or potential function of quorum sensing and the role of quorum sensing in suppressing cheaters. So, how does altering quorum sensing like the threshold of quorum sensing, meaning how large the population has to be? The population has to be for public goods to be produced. How does that affect both of these things simultaneously? And are there trade-offs between them in a small population? So in order to do this, we developed a stochastic birth-death model. And in the birth rates, we can actually tune the production strategy. So Strategy. So the bacteria that produce can either, well, the producer strain we call it, can actually not produce at all. It can produce public goods at some intermediate population size. Or it can produce public goods no matter what the population size is, unconditionally. And we used pseudomotors or renamosa as an inspiration for the model. As an inspiration for the model, where proteases are produced and increased through the growth rate, birth rate, I should say. So just to show you how we've included quorum sensing into this kind of model, basically we have done that in the birth rates. So this is the birth rate of The birth rate of producers when there are N producers and M cheaters in the population. So this first term is birth rate is a per capita birth rate without public goods present. So you can imagine that's an alternate source of nutrients not dependent on public goods. The second term is the net birth rate due to public good production. So this is basically So this is basically the gain in the maximum gain in growth or birth rate due to public goods. G A is, I'm not really going to talk about it much, but that can account for basically privileged access to public goods by producers if there's slow diffusion. So if they produce these proteins and they diffuse away very slowly, basically there's an advantage to be close and being a producer because it sticks close to you. Close to you. This term is a Hill function, so n again is the number of producers in the population. And this is describing the population size dependent benefits of the public goods. And C here, it was subtracted here, and that's the cost of public good production. And then finally, this part is describing the activation of public goods. And so Ka here is basically the quantum sensing threshold. So if it's very small, sorry, if it's very large, then this threshold will never be crossed and this term will be very close to zero. If it's intermediate, then there's a certain population size at which public goods will be produced. And if it's very close to zero, then basically this is close to one. Basically, this is close to one, and public goods are produced no matter what. So I'm going to be focusing on. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. I would have this question by saying that I'm more and online power states. So I might just want to be interested in some things. But is this more an optimal growth rate that we should be thinking about, or is it more like a biophysically reasonable? Yeah, it's more just phenomenological, trying to describe the. Phenomenological trying to describe the the file plus the biology. Yeah, it's not it's definitely not all optimal in this way. I mean we can optimize over with the results we get we can optimize over some parameters but in general the form it isn't. Yeah. Yeah sure. So we're going to focus on these two how these two parameters affect our results and Our results, uh, and that will hopefully make more sense later. What exactly results I'm talking about? Well, it's going to be the optimal growth and the cheater suppression. So, a lot of my results look like this, lots of triangles. So, I just wanted to briefly go over what these mean because it might be Because it might be, yeah, I don't know, it might not be not clear what it was. So on the left-hand side here, this is the cheater fixation probability. So if we start with n producers and n cheaters, like 20 and 20 maybe, then the heat map here basically is telling us what is the probability that cheaters will fix in the population. Cheaters will fix in the population. So you can imagine if there's dynamics going on, population dynamics, actually probably would be over here. What's the probability that you hit the x-axis before you hit the y-axis? We've also calculated, although I haven't talked about it, I'll talk about it that much later on, but the mean time to cheater fixation. So that's just the mean first passage time. Given that cheater's fix, basically given that you hit the x-axis, the y-axis, how long does it take on average? How long does it take on average? And then finally, the mean extinction time, which is the mean time starting at an initial composition of the population, how long does it take to reach the extinct state? 0-0. And the white lines here, which hopefully you can see, are the zero-net mean growth contours. So if you start here, then on average, there's no growth. Of course, there are fluctuations because it's a stochastic model. There are fluctuations because it's a stochastic model, but yeah, it's on average. So, if we first look at a situation where there's a moderate cost to public good production, but there is no alternate resource. Bacteria can only grow if a public good is being produced. Then, basically, we find Basically, we find if we go from a case where producers don't produce, they're not really producers then, but yeah, it's compared with the cheater strain. And we have quorum sensing, where the Ka, the quorum sensing threshold is moderate, and then always on, where basically they produce no matter what. We can see that the We can see that the chance of cheaters fixing the population increases actually as we go from no production to always on. So, in this case, quorum sensing is a better option in that sense than always on. Of course, if you don't produce anything at all, then there's no business advantage for cheapers. But at the same time, if producers don't produce anything, there's no source of food, all the bacteria die out pretty quickly. So that's shown by. So that's shown by this meat extinction time here. But as you go to more permissive conditions for production, the meat extinction time increases, which makes sense. Again, in this case, the bacteria need the public good to survive. So this case fits with the fact that quorum sensing actually decreases the likelihood of cheater figures. Decreases the likelihood of cheater fixation is consistent with previous work, which is always nice. If we look at the case instead where there is a moderate, I call it constitutive growth rate, but basically there's some other nutrient available other than that produced by, or given by the public goods. We still see an increase in cheater fixation probability as we go from. As we go from no production to quorum sensing to always on. But in this case, there's a non-monotonic relationship between the mean extinction time and the permissiveness of production. So basically quorum sensing actually leads to a higher mean extinction time than the always-on strange does. So these are just two points on this space of parameters. And so we also looked at a wider range of these two parameters, the cost and the source, basically growth due to alternate nutrients. And so these numbers here are the fraction of initial conditions where the cheater fixation probability is less with quorum sensing than with the horizontal strategy. So it's just a way to try to capture this whole, you know, in a simple way, capture, be able to compare, right, these whole triangles. And basically we found that quorum sensing always Found that quorum sensing always does better than always on in almost all initial conditions, except down here where it's all but a handful of initial conditions. So again, this is consistent with previous work that quorum sensing can actually prevent cheaters from taking over the population. On the other hand, if we look at the mean extinction times, there's a lot more interesting. There's a lot more interesting behavior here in this phase diagram. So basically, when costs are very low for public good production, quorum sensing is actually decreasing the main extinction time for population. So in that sense, we've called it destructive, just to give it a name, basically. But so while it does decrease the likelihood of cheaters fixing, Decrease the likelihood of cheetahs fixing, it also makes the population more at risk for extinction. As the cost increases, we get into up here, and with low constitutive growth rates, sorry, with low alternate nutrients, basically, there is a strong dependence on the initial population composition. Composition. These numbers are between, are somewhere in here, which means that there are some initial conditions where quorum sensing decreases mean extension time, some initial conditions where it increases mean extension time. While when both of these parameters are large, basically across the board, quorum sensing increases the meat extinction time, decreases the risk of extinction essentially in the population. And just to further illustrate this trade-off between sort of optimal growth and cheater fixation, so I should say this is all with a fixed quorum sensing threshold. But if we look at how, right, if we vary the quorum sensing threshold, which is Ka, how does that change the cheater fixation product? Does that change the cheater fixation product? It'll be first. So, this is for a single point on those triangles. So, this is basically a more or less stable population of producers and then a single cheater in the population, which mimics the case where a single mutant arises within a population of producers. And with non-zero costs to public good production, basically, if all these producers If all these producers cared about, to anthropomorphize them, which, you know, but if they cared, all they cared about was cheetah fixation probability, then they would delay public good production as long as possible. Essentially, this is just not producing at all. Because any public goods that they produce basically gives a fitness advantage to cheaters. Because cheaters benefit, but they don't pay the cost. On the other hand, On the other hand, if we look at a situation where there's a single producer in the population and zero cheaters in the population, which you've imagined like initiation of a bacterial colony. And we calculate the mean extinction time of this population as we increase the cost of public good production. There's a, or there are multiple, I guess, but roughly one optimal corner. Optimal quorum sensing threshold for each of these costs, which is increasing with cost. And it's moderate. It's not zero. It's not huge. It's not at a population size that's unattainable. So clearly there's a tension here between these two factors in quorum sensing. So, yeah. So, yeah, just in conclusion, oh, yeah, and I should mention we got some criticism for calling this spite because it has a very, very strict definition in evolutionary biology. But I think it could be a useful way to think about this, where producing bacteria increase their relative fitness by doing quorums. Fitness by doing quorum sensing as opposed to compared with the cheaters, but they could actually make the whole population more likely to crash. So you could call it spite. That's questionable how technically accurate that is, but it makes sense in a less technical sense. So yeah, so in conclusion. So, yeah, so in conclusion, we built this model and found that quorum sensing only decreases extinction probability when or sorry, mean time to extinction when public good costs are high and there's another resource available. In a future work, we'd like to use parameters from experiments and actually compare with experimental data. Actually, compare with experimental data. We'd also like to build a meta-population model, incorporate this into that, including mutation in migration between sites. And also, we're interested in looking at the evolution of quorum sensing thresholds in this kind of metapopulation model, which could tell us something about the evolution of quorum sensing in public good production, which is often called quad. Good production, which is often called cooperation in situations like lung infections. And with that, I'd like to thank my co-authors and mentors in this project, Andrew, Peter, and Mike. And I'd like to thank funding sources. Yeah, thank you for listening. Okay, we have time for a couple of questions. We have time for a couple of questions before Mike Stark. Go ahead. Thanks very much for the mic's not. I'm wondering whether you have any idea about how this team calculation will work if you have something like your products called signaling. I'm sorry, say it again if you have one. Know how much DSS reference you can work to go better, I think, but no, I don't know actually. That would be interesting to look into. Yeah, I'm not sure I haven't really thought about that, but yeah. So my question has to do with the initial conditions that you set. When you do experiments, for example, with bacteria or yeast in the lab, Bacteria are used in your lab. You can grow them in rich media or you can grow them in minimal media. And it seems to me that having an alternative source only matters when you're working with minimal media. And is that a really realistic situation? Well, first of all, is my question correct? Is it only relevant, this whole quorum sentenced Turner, only relevant when you're working in minimal media? So, I mean, it's meant to model. I guess if you were doing this in, like, yeah, in vitro, it would, I mean, this alternate resource, the lambda zero, right, that would be not really relevant if you just have any directly usable nutrients in the flask or whatever you're using. I mean, people do experiments without, like, basically even without that, or with everything that bacteria need except for like polypeptides, which can be broken down by proteases. So, is that what you mean? I'm not sure. Well, so you're describing a situation where you've got a bacterial sprain with a mutation and it's called an oxytroph, and it needs that one. But there's also the circumstance. Right, but there's also the circumstance where you're dealing with a wild type population or combination of cheaters and non-cheaters, but they're growing under starvation conditions, which are enough to survive, but not enough to thrive. And so the initial conditions seem to me, you know, whether you're starting with an oxytrope where you're working in rich media missing a particular component, finally, or whether you're working in a situation where you're trying to. Situation where you're trying to simulate evolution, sort of like in most of the data that you present. Yeah, so okay, that sounds exactly like what we mean, I think. So then the people who are working with oxytrops that are missing one gene, that's really not pertinent, as pertinent to what you described as those who are starting in a minimal media competitive. Minimal media competitive environment? I guess if you, if you, right, if you set that lambda sub-zero to zero, if you set the alternate nutrient source to zero, then I think that would mimic the case where there's one thing that you miss, right? Like, not going to be missing. I mean, this is how I think you bridge the work to the experimentalists by kind of explaining that. Okay, I see. Yeah, that's a good idea. But that's good. Okay, so hits record. I always don't forget to put the button on.
