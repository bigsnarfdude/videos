And my field F is going to be a field of characteristic prime to D. And I want it to contain a primitive d through of unity. And so, what the Mercurial source length theorem says is the following and it says that we have an isomorphism from the second K group. So in this case, if my face of this form into the d torsion of the Bar group of the field, and what this isomorphism does is it takes a symbol, alpha, a cub, and maps it to the symbol algebra, which we already saw in David Saltman's talk, a cub. So this is symbol. It's a symbol cyclic algebra in this case. And what this algebra is, is it's just going to be an algebra with two generators x and y such that x to the d is a, y to the d is b, and xy is omega yx, where omega is my throughdup unity in the base rule. And so one of the And so one of the consequences of this is that, of course, everything inside of the second Mullener group can be written as a product of these symbols, which means in return also that everything inside of my borrow group can be written as a product of symbolologies. So, the first question, the first natural question coming up from this is: okay, so if I start with Okay, so if I start with the central simple algebra A, I look at its Brouwer class inside of the Brouwer group, how many symbols do I need? So, for central symbol algebra. And so this is called the the symbol length of A, and I'll write this as length of A. I'll write this as length of k. And so we can ask this question for just one particular algebra. And in that case, this is always going to be a finite number. Now, a harder question arises if you ask, well, okay, I'm not fixing my algebra, but I want to know what's the minimal number so that I can actually describe every single sentence. So the symbol length. So, the symbol length of a field F, I'll write L d F as the smallest number. So that this is an upper bound for the length of A, where A is any element, well A is any central symbol algebra of period D, meaning it's an element inside of that graph. So that's one of the numbers. So the question, suppose I've heard a question, so the question is now, what is this number? So what is or L O. Now a little bit of warning here that that length, this symbol length here for a general field, that can actually be infinite, it doesn't have to be a finite number. So let me give you an example for that. Give you an example for that. So, what would be an example? You could look, for example, at the V's of prime, and my field F is I look at Q adjoint omega, where omega is my primitive P through of unity, and then I make it a really And then I make it a really big field. Usually I have to make my field really big to make these things misbehave. So it's going to be a function field of x1, y1, x2, y2, and so on. Infinitely many variables. And then I look at the algebra that is the tensor product x1y1. So this is just the symbol algebra, x1, y1. Just dropping the subscript to not have. Just dropping the subscriber to not have to write the right time. And so if I write just n of these, the Young actually proved in 2004 that this actually is a division algebra. Which in particular means that its length, or its symbol length, not putting n, is actually going to be n. You can write it with any number of less symbols here. Which of course means also that if I look at f and I just look at infinitely many of these together, I'm going to get that the l, right, lf, lp. In this case, because all of these here, these are all the p symbols p come up. Which of course means that if I look at the tensor product of this p times, all of these are going to cancel out. I'm going to get a triple element instead of probably. So, one of the things that we have to do is Things that might be useful, then what many people do is: so instead of looking at this general symbol length, you kind of sort your central symbol algebras not just by the period, but also by the index. So the index of a central simple algebra is just the degree of the division algebra representing that central simple algebra. And in fact, it turns out that, so in that case, you can define the L D M F. D M F, which is same length, you just look at, so this is going to be the smallest number. So it's an up about the length of A where now A is essential to blow. When A is the central symbol algebra of period D. Again, period is the ordinance of our root. And index M, where the index has the degree of associated divisional degree. So one of the benefits of now looking at this is that this is actually always going to be finite. Because what you can look at is you can describe generic division algebra of period D and index M and then And that has final length, and so that's going to give you about another symbol length there. So, this is how we'll find it. And so the symbol length problem asks for what is this number. So, that's known as the symbol length problem. L E L. Okay. And in fact, they coupled, well there's one very famous conjecture associated with it, and that's the simplicity conjecture. So the simplicity conjecture, which is Jalbert. Which says that every division algebra of prime degree is actually cyclic. And so in this language, what this means is that L P P S is 1 of all prime degrees. So that just has a little little background symbol here. Little background symbolic. Let me tell you now what we know, at least for kind of small fields. And I'll get to, so the work I've done has been on whatever's the function field, but a little bit curved, but there's been a little bit, well, quite a bit more work on other fields as well. So what's now? So p equals 2 and 3, there's actually classical for quaternion algebra, so p equals to 2. And so for that, we actually know that's a procedure control chart. So p equals to 2, 3 equals 1. And now Albert's theorem actually gives you slightly more than this. So Albert's theorem. Um so I'll just the um um I press L to four and then L24F there is two and L2H plus four F not characters are two, which I have anyways. Okay, so those are kind of the general results that we know for any field. Starting from there, it's kind of we have to restrict ourselves a lot more for what kind of field we're looking at. So for example, if we look at just the global field, the Brouwer has an error here, I'm serviced for F, a local, a global field. Then our birds might make a piece of chocolate. And the album brow has nuda theorem. Um actually, every every division algebra so this gives you that in that case it's someone who's gonna be L D of F is one yeah in that case Yeah, in that case you don't even have to look at index, you can just look at the correct. Excuse me that there's the root of unity. Right, right, right. Yeah, I mean I didn't write that down, but yes, I always need my root of unity because otherwise you can do this entire theory over fields that don't have a root of unity as well, but you have to, instead of just looking at these simple algebras that I described with the x and y, those two generators, you have to look at the cyclic algebras, which I'm not going to do today. So let's look at the function field keys. So that's kind of the next step from these local and global fields. Earth. Okay. So first off, if you make your field, if you make your base field really large, so if you make k equal to k bar, this is not going to be an interesting problem because sense theorem actually tells you that in that case bar will just vanishes. There's just nothing interesting there. So sense theorem. Trivial, and so again, nothing really to work with. If you make QK p-adic numbers, so QP, then Solzman actually proved that every divisional algebra Pervet that every divisional algebra prime index co-prime DP Okay, so slight restriction, we can't look at the um those with the legs. Those with the x equal to p. And then later on, so this was 1997. And then later on, it was proved that actually L Q F is actually equal to 2 for Q prime even equal to P. So this is solve then. In 2007, and then there was some more work in other characteristic cases aggressive in 2016 and then also by Sir Rush in 2010. Yeah, so that's kind of Yeah. So that's kind of the general type. We can look at any kind of curve over KMP. We know what the symbolic would be there. So what I've been working on is I don't restrict my field K, but what I do restrict is I restrict my curve to be an elliptic curve. So for E, I'm elliptic curve. And my base field, K, I still want all those kind of nice assumptions. I still want it to be, by characteristic, to be co-prime to what order of gravel group I'm looking at. And I still want it to contain that particular root of unity here. And what I can prove is that the symbol length in Q towards the variable E. So I look at it inside of this quotient Q towards not variable E mod the Q towards variable K because these are really not the interesting classes for me, right? This is usually going to be either global or local fields, so I can use Medger's theorem to describe that. So I just look at That. So I just look at this symbol like the misfortune instead. And so this is what I proved in 2019: that this is bounded by 2 times Q minus 1 times Q plus 1. But that's the unidentified part, right? Correct is not key. Yes, yes. I'm not actually looking at the graphic of the function code, but I'm looking at the ungrammified part of the function code. Yeah, whereas I believe that these these results over QP are actually for Actually, for the entire work. And then in a recent paper that I mentored at NRU, a couple of students working on trying to get this bound down. And so we were able to improve it quite a bit. So for B, and I'll look the curve. Let's say with complex multiplication, but just quite a restriction on the elliptic curve. And I'll give you more bounds later, but let's just say for a starter that this is going to be over Q. And let's say K is my Q adjoining omega, where omega is my My Q sort of unity. Then, together with my students, Atanasio, Choy, Mandersham, and myself in 2021, we showed that then that graph of this thing, so similar. thing, so some length. We just give that a name. We just call this thing here S, so I don't have to write it anymore. S bone of the box by Q plus one for QAnia. Okay, so quite a restriction on what kind of elliptic curves I'm looking at, but again, I will relax this restriction on the base field a little bit once I get a little bit more into the results later. Now, I should mention that there also has been quite a bit of work on symbol length of function builds of surfaces as well. So there's been a lot of work on that as well, for example, by Artinor, Nieblich, and other people. And then, so let me just write this. So a function of surfaces. And then there's a very nice paper as well in Montserrat on simple length of CM fields as well. So just kind of extending this to even larger fields. Okay. Alright, so in the last 20 minutes, let me tell you a little bit about the idea of how would we get to a bound like this. Or first, how would we get... Do you expect this to be optimal? So you could expect this to be independent of Q? I expect it to be independent of Q. I expect this to actually be pretty far from optimal. It's unfortunately kind of the best I can do at this point. It's unfortunately kind of the best I can do at this point. Now, the nice part, however, is that the way that I get these bounds is actually very constructive. So it's actually, it's not just a bound, but I actually, I can write down every single element inside of the brow group explicitly as a tensor parallel to symbols. And we even have a computer program to write down the tensor prize, which takes rabbit to compute through. It's not definitely not optimally programmed, but Programmed, but it works for kind of small pieces. But no, I don't expect this to be optimal. And in fact, probably something more like the result of Soltman of the, that the symbol length is bonded by two, probably something closer than that is actually correct. Alright, so in my basement, K characteristic of K, not 2 and 3, or Q, Q is a prime, and E is still the curve. Oh, okay. Okay. So, first off, let's use. Let me breathe in the chalk again. Okay. I suppose that's the bad part about being back to chalkboards. Okay, so first off, so if we have our, and if the easy case is the following is true, so if in fact So if, in fact, the Q torsion of the elliptic curve lies inside of actually k rational defined over the base field, then in fact the symbol length is just 2. So then s, or s is bounded above, by 2, I should say. Let me describe to you how we would get that. So the thing to use for this is the following. So just need a diagram. Diagram. They look at the following exact sequence. This one comes from spectral sequence. So zero inside of the Q torsion for every group K into Q torsion of forever E into Q torsion of H1 K E K R. So I want to get, again, I want to get information on this guy. Again, I want to get information on this guy. So, the way I do it is I put another sequence up here, and so this is the sequence induced by multiplication by Q on the elliptic curve, and then I take Gauer cohomology of that exact sequence, I'm giving it 0 into PK mod Q into H1K DQ to the And now the key is that, well, if I have this assumption that my EQ is actually inside of my EK, then this guy here actually is a very nice description. This is just going to be K cross mod K cross EQ cross point cross mod K cross 3Q because my EQ here splits, right? It's just C mod QZ cross C mod QZ. And then I can explicitly describe a map. And I can explicitly describe a map. And what this map does is it just takes an element A B here and maps it down here to just a tensor pair of two symbols and one quite telling you what exactly they are. But the point that I want to make is that it's just two of them. So just two symbols. Where my TP and my TQ are just very specific elements inside of the function to the latest. And this, this kind of construction, so this was actually described by Skroborgatov in 2001 and then also later in a paper by Chenosev Rapinchuk and Rapinchuk in 2016. In 26. Okay, so if we have this assumption, then we kind of know what a bond in the symbol length is. If we don't have this assumption, things become a little bit harder. And so what we have to do is we have to kind of, well, I want to exploit this. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the Galois representation of my elliptic curve. Elliptic curve, and I'm going to see what's the field extent that I need to get this assumption. They want the Galler representation from the Galler group Q of K into the morphism group, which is just GLTQ. And L is now the field, the fixed field. The fixed field. So the field defined by the kernel of this. And so, in fact, what you can show is that because my base field actually contains omega, the image of this caliber couldn't. The image of this Galver representation actually lies inside of SL2Q, not just DL2Q. And so what you get is that the field extension here, so the field extension L over K, the degree of that, has to divide the order of SL2Q. Yeah, which actually I should thank David for letting me know about that. So this divides the order of SL2Q, which is just... Which is just q times q minus 1. Okay? So we already know this. And so now what we can do is we look at kind of this diagram here, both for K and once for L, and then we look at the morphisms connecting those, which are usually co-restructures and research maps. Alright, so kind of case A. And this is why we looked at elliptic curves with complex multiplication. So if Q does not divide the order of L over K, then we're kind of in the nice case, because what happens now is I have these core restriction maps in between my Grower groups and inside up between my H1 here. Up between my H1 here. And in this case, core section is actually subjective, and so I can just look at what does the core search map my kind of two elements here, down to over my of E over K. So the chorus direction F goes from the Q towards the row B over F. And so in this case, we can just look at, well, we just compute what, yeah, what does this kind of tensor prior two symbols map to down here? And in fact, there's an algorithm where I raise a tate. Q does not divide or Q does divide. Oh, Q does not divide. Excuse me. Oh, he does not divide it. Excuse me. Yes, thank you. Is non-verse very rascitate on how to actually explicitly compute this. How to speak. Yeah, so in general, like we have an algorithm in this case if Q does not divide the order there. And this is again why I wanted to why I restricted myself to those CM elliptic curve or why we restricted ourselves to those. Because in that case, we always have this satisfied, this assumption. So let's stay in this case for now, and let me state a couple things that we'll be able to prove there. So this, in this case, if Q does not divide the order of L over K, Order of L over K, then in fact, it's actually bounded above. So the symbol length. So again, remember, I've erased it now, but S was the symbol length of Q torsion of paragraph E modulo Q torsion of paragraph Q. So in this case, that S is actually bounded above. By L of a K minus one. Okay, so how do we do this? So what we do is we looked at not just at the corestriction, but we actually looked at, well, we described what the image of the corestriction possibly could be. And we also looked at kind of what we can do is we can do, we can start here. We can do, we can start here, we can go down to here, and then oh, actually, let me let me write it up here. So, basically, what we can do is following. So, first I go down with my restriction, with my restriction out to page one. Okay, um and then I can go up my instruction map And so basically the main idea was that we would look at we would look at the image of this composition, which is some kind of norm. Of this composition, which is some kind of norm. And then we look at: well, what is the image and how could we now describe? So now this year maps down into, sorry, these are the L's. Call me L's. This maps now down into Grago E L. And now we just look at the image of this into with another co-restriction, the Q to original E. And this is E, and this is where the algorithm or Russian take comes in. So that's just the general idea that we're using. But this is really the main reason that we had to restrict ourselves to CM curves, because there we can kind of exploit this very nice result that the corresponding is just subjective. Okay. And then finally with some very nice linear algebra. Some very nice linear algebra, what we were able to show as well was that if, in addition, L of K actually is greater than two. And the yellow group contains a subgroup. Off order d greater than 1, then actually S is bounded above by 1 minus 1 over D times L over K. So we can get it even smaller than this, then at L over K minus 1 by finding some subgroups in there. And of course, the best case is if we have. And of course the best case is if we have separate of one and two, so best case bringing equals two, we get S is bound above by one time. And here the idea is kind of to use. Of to use that subgroup to kind of factor through a smaller field and just look at what the color structure could be. So in the last little bit, let me tell you about kind of what this explicitly means. So what we can do now is since all of this is actually constructive, all of this is actually constructive we can actually go and we can give an elliptic curve theoretically the algorithm is still like it's still a lot to compute but theoretically we can actually compute what the elements inside of the graph are with at most this number of signals so for example there is some very nice computation by Lonzo Loblano and by Paula And by Palladino as well, on what kind of splitting fields are necessary, or what kind of bower groups do you get for LLK? So for example, if I look at E, which is, let's say, I have my elliptic curve, well, let's see, what do I want my curve to be? Let's say I want K to just be Q omega. We have omega 2. My omega, that's the different E. And let's say my E, then look the curve y squared equals to x squared. And so k, sorry, e, which is my l, is an extension of degree four. Which in this case isn't that hard to compute, but for general numbers there, it's a lot more work. And as I said, there's some very nice results out there that will give you those Galileo groups. But so in this case, what our bounds give us is that the symbol length here should be less than or equal to 2. And if you want to see what the actual symbol is, we have computed that. Symbolis, we half computed that and put it in the paper that we wrote up. But fair warning: the symbolist is like it's very, very long to write down because the algorithm and the way it computes co-restriction is just not very nice to kind of parse in a compute algorithm, unfortunately. So this can be explicitly described, but again, warning that it's not pretty. All right. Oh, that's where I want to start. So, thank you very much. So, question? I was wondering if there have been attempts to do the symbol ranks on the entire parallel group, but on the clarified part. So, do some base change using solutments in order to. Some base change during sort months in order to put your ramification on what maybe a mean. So I haven't seen anything. The problem is that when you get rid of the ramification, the genus soars. And you can't control the size of the genus because the genus is dependent on the amount of ramification you have to kill. So it's a very difficult problem, I think, to do that. Do this, yeah. I wondered whether you'd thought about abelian varieties instead of elliptic curves. So, yeah, so I have a little bit. The diagram that I had over here with that Q-toys bar K and everything, that still works exactly the same way. The only, yeah, so starting from there, it should all work. Co-certain should still work. Now, I didn't really talk about this here, but kind of I didn't really talk about this here, but kind of the really bad case is the one where Q divides by order of the field extension, right? And so in that case, in my thesis, I had to look at inflation restrictions and sequences and look at how could we, like, what's the image of that basically, and how could we split that. And that becomes just infinitely more complicated for the varieties, unfortunately. Yeah, of course. So I haven't yet, but it's a very interesting question, so just to. So just to be clear, the the algebra you start with is unramified, but the symbols, the cyclic algebras, they're allowed to be ramified. No, no, they're all unramified. They're also unramified. They're also unramified, yeah. Allow them to be ramified, then. Oh, I'm not sure what happens then if I allow them to be ramified. I mean, the simple Yeah, but if I mean the symbol x would only drop then but I don't know so it's it's this is a complete problem at the beginning yeah yeah definitely ramifications a lot harder questions whether the unramified bar of an elliptic curve Over an elementary curve, you know, modulo constant classes finite, say over a number field. But the ground itself is finite? Moduloconst. The unramified parameter, modulo constant classes. But there is this whole term of the Jacobian, of the word of Jacobia. I don't think it can ever be torsion. Yeah, that that's that constant function is you can really sh she she denoted like A and B. These are from the base field, right? And this could be taken any elements mod cubes q powers, really. I mean there are some relations though that I didn't. So the thing is that But they're not the so the thing is that that yeah mod mods constant process well so the only thing that I'm kind of I'm the only place where my relations are coming from my relations are really coming from here in my sequence but this goes into H1 AQ this part here is usually finite I get infinitely many things here I only have finitely many relationships not gonna But if you also require that they be identified at constant places, then of course. Sure, yeah. But if you do only geometric places, I don't think you will ever require those. Okay, maybe it's time to thank everybody for the today's sessions, for the day. Sessions hope of the day tomorrow.
