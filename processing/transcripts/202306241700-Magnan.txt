Did you do I had nothing to do with that I think? No, I had nothing to do with that I really No I think it did. No no I don't think so. No no I remember a psyche can't know anything about computers. I've had an argument on USALBAL panel. Ah, there we go. I think I know that. I see, I think I know now. Okay. Uh okay, well maybe figure this out again. There we go. Okay. Easy. That was a test. That was a test. All right, cool. Hello, everyone. My name is Van. I hope everybody's doing okay. So I know we've been here for a while, and I think you guys are probably laser-focused. But I feel privileged to stand right now. So if you want to stand up and take a moment, feel free to. I also welcome interruption at any point. In fact, I want to be interrupting this talk. And I have a few keyed up right here. So I have four things right here. These are four, I guess we'll call them schematics, because they're not exact pictures. Because they're not exact pictures. And if you at any point feel like one of these is relevant, please shout out or respond to the letter. We'll talk about later. Can I interrupt right away? You absolutely may. Are you missing a line in C by any chance? Yes. That would be best. Okay, thank you. All right, so this talk is about flower power or a generalization of diversity for intersectional families. Thank you. This is, I think, more fun title. This is the thing you can find out very much about this book. I also want to thank the organizers for organizing this conference. It's my first time at BERS. It's awesome. I feel very privileged to be here. Very cool. Cool. All right, let me get these buttons. There we go. Okay. I don't know why this is what's happening. That. Is it not full screen, maybe? Yeah, that could be the case. What is. Sorry, I don't really know. Oh boy. Oh yeah, it looks like, yeah, maybe it's just you're in scroll mode rather than page mode, so you scroll down instead of page mode. Yeah, that's what's happening. Yeah, people. What's going on? I guess we're going to scroll a little bit. Just going to pretend that, yeah. All right. This is joint work with Ryan and Corey. Of course, you're in the audience. Ryan is not here today. He's running a marathon tomorrow. So hopefully it goes hopefully. We'll do some preliminaries. We'll keep moving. We'll keep moving. Okay, so this is going to be a talk review through some stuff in streamlined set theory. So we'll talk about some set stuff. Hopefully, everyone's heard of a set. I'm not going to define that necessarily. A family F of sets, or script F, is a collection of subsets of some ground set N for some positive. This is the standard N element set. We know of sets, we have some operations on set, we know two sets, you know, we think about intersections of sets. We'll say a family of sets F is intersecting if for any pair. Intersecting if for any pair of these subsets of the ground set, their intersection is not equal. We say a family is F sets is R uniform if they're all of the same size, some fixed feature R. This is actually, this is quite common in triple set theory because they're sort of nice to deal with. You can already think of a two-uniform family of sets is a graph. It is indeed. Thank you. That was not an interruption. Thank you. That was not an interruption, but I still appreciate it. Okay, so a transversal of F is a subset S of the ground set N that non-trivially intersects all members of the family. We'll be working with transversals a bit today, so we'll talk about those a little later on. And then the max degree, again, we can think of there's a connection between these sorts of set systems, as they're called, or families of sets and graphs. And this idea of the max degree is the same as what you'd expect from graphs, right? You just look at all the members of the family and that container of that element. And that contain an element, and these are the biggest of those. Well, these same max degree of a graph, number of these sub cells in the family, 50 taken. Then, what would be a trivial intersect? To the empty intersection. So, I guess if you had two sets, maybe we'll, I don't want to say trivial, but they intersect and then So intersection is very small. Trivial almost okay. Thank you for the question. Yeah, there we go. Here we go. So I'm sure you thought you were off the hook. I think a wise man once said it was actually marketing. Almost every math talk should have a joke and a proof. And here are the jokes that are making you prove it. Okay, the middle of channel. Okay, the minimum transversal size, tau of f, is the size of the smallest transversal of a family f. And so this remark is what we want someone to prove for me. An intersecting R uniform family, F, satisfies tau of F is less than or equal to R. We'll take a moment. And someone tell me why this is a proof. Yeah, everything non-trivially intersects, you know, has positive intersection with everything else. So this is sort of its basic idea. But this is something we can think about here. So there's sort of this connection between intersecting families and then transversal somehow are quite small relative. You can think about if you have every possible member of every possible subset of the ground set, transversal will probably have to be everything. But here, for these intersecting and uniform families, transversal doesn't have to mean quite well. I thank you for interruption. All right. So here's a proof, or not a proof, here's a foundational result in this area of extreme step theory. This is Eric Porato. It says that if F is an intersecting R uniform family on the standard analytic non set, n is greater than 2r, then the size of the family is less than or equal to n minus 1 choosing r minus 1. And families achieving this bound have a transversal. Bound, have a transversal, that's just a single element for some action like ground state. I'll actually, I'm high-something, I think this is true when n is equal to 2r as well, but there's a different construction that happens there. Ultimate is an exercise to the listener. If you have a napkin, you can think about what that might be. I do want to talk about something. I think this is well known, but I want to talk about something how this relates to our talk right here. The interesting thing about this is this says, like, how do you know that if you have this universal element, some x in every Universal element, some x in every single set, the family will be intersecting because everything contains this x. And I think one thing that is sort of special about this result that sort of says why we can ask more intersecting problems, is that the way that you can come up with an extreme little example is to sort of play this little design problem on a small substance. Like, hey, how do I make a low uniform family of maybe a few vertices that satisfies the property I want? Here, I'm saying, okay, I need all my things to intersect. Okay, I need all my things to intersect. Does there exist a one uniform family that is intersecting? Maybe. There does. This right here, if you think about just a singleton, is one uniform and is intersecting. So this quick. Thank you. Well done, yes. Pretty much, thank you. Okay, yeah. So this is one uniform and intersecting. So this is one uniform and intersecting. And the idea is, so this sort of controls the family, and then you end up with something that's n to the, like, as n is large, this is about order n to the r minus one. That's the uniformity of this small little design problem I've sort of solved here. So I've resolved my intersecting problem here, and I sort of blow it up. It's like everything that plays nicely with my design problem. And this is going to be an important idea for the rest of the time. Okay. One again, there we go. Okay, so three directions of generalization to be clear. I'm just going to scroll all the way through to show them all because I don't have an advanced. I guess I don't know. I'm holding it still. Just for fun, it's like a comfort thing. Okay, so three generalizations of three directions of generalization. So suppose you have an intersecting family that is not a subfamily of the optimal family. Here, this is the idea. Of the optimal family. Here, this is the idea: you take a single element and you blow it up, and everyone can take a step. So, you asked the question: which is the largest your family can be? This was first asked by Hilton-Miller in 1967. Hanakohayakawa then asked, okay, I don't want to be a subfamily of this sort of EKR construction or the Hilton-Miller construction. What's the biggest that can be? And you can think of generalizations like that. You're forbidden this sort of set of previously extreme examples. How could you? Next, you might ask, you'll notice in the previous case. Ask, you'll notice in the previous case, right? The EKR construction, you had a transversal of size one, a single element. What if you don't want to have a transversal of size one? You say, I don't have a transversal of size. No transversal of size is less than or equal to maybe three or four or five. Bronkel addressed this in 1977, 1980, 80. It's actually open for transversal four and bigger. So if you want to prove that on a napkin and then talk to me after class, it was very fun. Next will be: suppose you have an intersecting family of maximum size and mid two. An intersecting family of maximum size limits to the max degree is less than or equal to some constant times the size of the family. So, in the Erdős-Corouta construction, the max degree is equal to the size of the family because the degree of this universal vertex x is the size of the family. So you fix some constant little c, and then you see how big your family can be. And as you might expect, as c gets smaller, the size of the family will get smaller, as well here. So this is the study for some sum values of c here. This is infinite. Some values you see here, but this is an infinite family, but it's these are some past generalizations. Now we'll talk about some diversity, which I think first talked about unbalanced, but is now called diversity. Maybe I can nod or not. So the diversity D of F of the family is given by the size of F minus the max degree. That is, the difference between the size of the family and the max degree. Family in the max degree. And I want to say why this is happening. What do we mean by slightly different year? So, this is some statistic of the family that we're maximizing that's small for the Air Discover construction, right? The diversity of the Air Discarrado construction, which is size of the family is equal to the max degree, is zero. So here we're not maximizing the size of the family. It's a parameter that is small for Aris Corrado and seeks to relate to edges as well. Right here, and this says if F is an intersecting R uniform. If f is an intersecting R-uniform family on ground set N and N is large enough, then the diversity is quick less than or equal to n minus 3 to R minus 2, with the maximum uniquely achieved by a 2 out of 3 family. I'm going to move my mouse because I'm paranoid about the screen going dark again. I want to ask, okay, I would like to come up with a one uniform family that is intersecting and has positive diversity. If I want to come up with a one uniform family that's intersecting, I claim I can only That's intersecting, I claim I can only just have a single thing. And this has diversity. Okay, so if I want to play a design problem where I want to see the lowest uniformity, I can satisfy my condition of having positive uniformity and be intersecting. I can't do it on a one-uniform family. So the next I'm going to try to do it on is maybe a two-uniform family. So, okay, maybe I have some sort of two-edge, graph-edge. I need to make a graph that's intersecting. One edge isn't going to cut it, so maybe I have. One edge isn't going to cut it, so maybe I have another edge. Here? Thank you. I want to spoil it for anything. Yeah. So here, if I want to, there's only two flavors of intersecting graphs. I can make a star, but if you notice I make a star here, this has a universal vertex, so this will still have a transversal. The diversity will be zero. But if you want to make an intersecting two uniform, But if you want to make an intersecting two-uniform family, there's a unique way to do that. There's a triangle. Okay, so this right here. And this two out of three family I'm talking about is sort of controlled by a triangle is the idea. You look at, you have some big ground set N, you set aside three special vertices, and then you take every edge that contains at least two of them. And the idea is here, you end up with diversity. Here, the diversity is one, and then Here the diversity is one, and then correspondingly, you have one times the corresponding binomial coefficient. And notice here, this is a two-uniform family, and the order here, as n is really large, is n to the r minus r minus to the sort of finite case. Exactly. Okay. The generalization we provide, our contribution, is so to generalize diversity, as we saw, thinking this is most akin to this sort of the degree version of Erdős Corrado. The degree version of Erdős Corrado. This generalizes and recovers for a capital C now to show that it's very different. So we're looking at the size of the family minus a weighting of the maximum. So C is some positive constant here. First, we have a version of a stability argument, which I'm not going to talk about too much because we have been here for a long time. But this just says, what's the best you can do for any wave in here? It ends up being 3 minus 2c times 10 minus 3 2 square minus 2. times 10 minus 3 2 spawn minus 2 and the best you can do is this case right here so this sort of says that in general like you know if you want to be close to the optimum value you should be like a sub hand sort of the idea we have right here although this was i think proven originally we just sort of recovered this result in the 2008 paper next will be a new contribution is if you have c be a little bit larger and i will and i will note that while this doesn't seem like it is very big um this is still an interesting uh result this sort of forbids a previous family and sees with the This sort of forbids a previous family and sees what the next one is. So, even though this doesn't seem like a big range, this is encoding some information. So, please don't be too weak with me. All right. So, what does this say? If f is an intersecting r uniform family on this ground set, and n is large enough, then the diversity is bounded by this right here. So, this is some quantity right here. We can return to this later. This is some n choose r minus 3, approximately for n large. And then this is a lower order term, which is known, but sort of what is. Term which is known, but sort of what is. The maximum is uniquely achieved by the families whose members contain edges of a phanyl plane. So you would notice. Thank you very much. Okay, this phanyl plane right here. So you notice this lower edge of the range right here, this C equals 3 halves, it's not a coincidence. When C is equal to 3 halves, the diversity of a triangle is zero. You know, every edge, so this is, there's three vertices and three edges. Each vertex is contained. Each vertex is contained in two of those. So when you set 3c equals to 3 halves, the diversity here goes to 0. So this is the next range that you might expect to get some traction out of that. I just have a question. If you thought I wanted to play a game where I had a three-uniform family and it had the maximum diversity of all those things, what do you think that might mean? Anyone want to interrupt me again? Bannon planning. Vanyalphony. Yeah, absolutely. That's a thing. Yeah, absolutely. That's a mean sort of thing. Yes. So this does the best. The best right here. 4C in this range. There's another little connection, but this is again this sort of idea of this design problem of playing by finding the smallest uniformity that satisfies some conditions that. So this is the key insight. And so we end up to prove this result right here, which I'll sort of sketch through. We take this and we sort of figure out how do we connect our family to some sort of small design problem. Design problem. So the proof idea is we consider the flower base, which I'm not going to go into too much, but it's a variant of the delta system method. It's constructed as a new, if we want to talk about offline, or maybe if we have a couple of minutes at the very end, I can talk about it too. Basically, what happens with the flower base is it is a set of special transversals such that every member of the family contains one. And then, moreover, they end. So they just and then moreover they end up inheriting some these transversals inherit some behavior of the uh of the of the construction. So I wanted to say D at this point. Yes, you do. Thank you so much, Dave. Appreciate it. You can call me psych. The flower base helps define the structure of a family, so every member of the family contains a member of a flower base. The size of the flower base, The size of the flower base of an intersecting family is bounded above by a constant depending only on the uniformity of R. These are some technical things. These come from stuff I won't get into too much. And the flower base is often simpler to work with, and it can inherit key properties of the family. And so what do I mean by this idea simpler to work with? These sort of small design problems are something we could get our hands on. But something for maybe, you know, very, very large ahead and large uniformity, those are harder to deal with. The idea is this sort of key insight of Erdős Corrado. Insight of Erdos Corrado, where I could solve the intersecting family problem on a small piece and then think about things that intersect that. This is sort of our connection to that idea. We can bound the size of the family using the flower base. Every member of the family contains some member of the flower base. So we can think about this thing right here says, well, if I know what the flower base looked like, I know what these special transversals do and how they behave. I can think about everything that might contain one of those. That might contain one of those, and it tells me something about them. And similarly, when n is very large and we have no members in the flower base of size less than k, we know that the size of the family is bounded above by like big O of n to the R, to the R minus K, right. So we know that small members of the flower base let the family be very big, and if there are no small members of the flower base, we get a good pound of the size. So this is just what's going on right here. And the same sort of design problem. This is why you want to solve your sort of, you know, design. This is why you want to solve your sort of design problem with small uniformity, because it lets you make your size your hammock jump up by some order. So I'm going to, normally I would have skipped through this nicely, but I'm going to put them all up on the screen at once. So how do we work with the flower base? This is also a sketch of our proof, but this should be at a highly digestible level. So for large values of n, if the size of the family is on the order of n to the r minus On the order of n to the r minus 3, we must have a member of the flower base of size 3 or smaller. This is from work on the previous slide. So we first show that if C is at least 3 half, families with positive diversity do not have transversals of size 1 or 2. This basically means they're not a subfamily of in this A or B case. We compare to our construction, which is you think about give a fannel plane and look at all possible members of N choose R. Of n, choose R, you know, that contain some three set given here. We see that a family with maximal diversity must have a flower-based member of size three. It has to have a member of size three or smaller. Can't be one or two, so it has to have some member of size three. Maybe it has to have one. So we then understand the structure of these size three members using the inherited properties. This is sort of the technical part. This is maybe the bulk of the proof. This is sort of the work that's done. And then we show that, okay, if we want to. Show that, okay, if we want to solve this small design problem with these size three transversals, that's basically figuring out that the fanal plane does this the best. We say, actually, based off of reason that the fanal plane is sort of edge maximal, you can't add anything else to this. It's also satisfying transversal size 3. And you transverse size 2 with violate 1. That has to be the whole family. And the proof ends right there. So this is sort of this idea. Yeah, not so bad. Yeah, not so bad on the face, and very fun to do. For future work in usings, it should be possible to understand generalized diversity for C in this next range. Maybe the interruption, if anyone knows what this number is right here, that would be cool. It's not so bad. The fanal plane is a finite projective plane of order 2. There are 13 edges in a There are 13 edges in a finite predictive plane of order 3, and the uniformity is 4, so there's a relationship between here. Our conjecture is that the next best thing you could do is a finite predictive plane of order 3. And in general, all of our channel constructions have been finite predictive planes, but those end up being hard to find in general. So as we keep doing this, as we increase C, we're sort of forbidding previous families and asking what else is viable, sort of in the vein of Hiltmilner, Concohere, Cala, Shabbat Muba. But we end up getting into this idea of kind of projective planes programs. I'll also note that other natural generalizations of diversity exist and are studied are also interesting in their own right. So instead of looking at max degree, you can look at like maybe max degree of a pair, the number of edges that intersect a pair. And that is studied. If you look at triples, it is still open. Okay, with that, I'd like to say thank you. And I have Thank you. And I have some references that may be fit on the slide. There you go. All right. Any questions? Back to the Palmer London result, and then you don't have to put the slide up. Okay. And then I think you have. I think you have your group has for large enough N. Are the problems of N smaller than that large enough N? Are they of any interest, or are they just like a full case analysis? Those are of interest, and they are studied, and they are, yeah, they so that is like lowering the bound on N, like an issue with this proofreading. Like an issue with this proofreading, getting an issue, is that it works for large n, which means actually ends up being like superexponential in R. I think the best known bounds with the original problem are polynomial in R. I think it's like six times r to the third. Is that true? That's our original. That's the original one. Okay, so I think, and it's trying to get down to linear in R, right? 48 times R, yes. It was conjectured that it would be, if N is at least 3 times R, and that was disproven 3 times. That was disproven three times, one for each multiple of R. So, yeah, so yeah, so yeah, so those are things that people care about, and so improving those bounds on end, like that is like there is work done there. But I think so the issue with this proof technique is that it does not give what we expect to be best possible bounds on end. This is an open area as well, although this proof technique wouldn't scale to that for reasons that end up being we sort of invoke the sun of flower level if we're familiar with that. Sunflower level, if we're familiar with that in here, and so you need sunflower level balance to do so. Anna? So you mentioned, I think, at the end, that people thought about this, or you could think about this for co-degree type things instead of vertex degree. Are the constructions in that case, is it what you would expect that you do a similar thing, but instead of basing on something like that? But instead of basing on something where you have a high diversity or high diversity, you figure out what you can do. I believe so. I'm having trouble thinking on my feet right now. That sounds like an interesting way to do this. I think you could do that. I don't know if we do that. Maybe Corey has a better answer for that sort of thing. Yes. The construction is actually very similar to these. So sorry, is this the double diversity? Is that the question or yeah? Is that the question? Okay, so forward. Yes, absolutely, yeah. So, yeah, if you look at the code degree of, so the question is: the idea is: do you look at, instead of looking at a single vertex and you look at how many edges contain that, you look at maybe a set of vertices right here, and you looked at how many edges maybe contain all four of these. The link of these four vertices, if people are familiar with that. The question is, like, what do you do with this? In fact, our proof technique extends to that very, very well. You look at similar sorts of things. And also, when you do this for the known values, which are You do this for the known values, which are the small values of the size of this, the finite projective plane constructions are also valid. Thank you for trying to look at it. That was a good question. Yes. Anyone else? All right. Let's thank our speakers then. So, are we done or is it not
