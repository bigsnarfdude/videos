Now it's the model defined by this uh action functional, which is L2 norm of so-called curvature of this field A. And the curvature is a two-form and the ij component is given by this linear part plus a nonlinear part which is the Lie bracket of Aij. So because of this nonlinear part, the uh action is not quadratic. It has uh cubic and quartic terms. As cubic and quartic terms. Okay. So-called quantum Yamios study functional integrals with respect to this formal measure, and this measure is e to this action functional. So this measure is completely formal. What's important here is a gate symmetry, which says that for any lead group valued function g, do this gate transformation, then the then the action functional is invariant. Then the action functional is invariant. Okay, so action functional is invariant under this infinite-dimensional symmetry. It's infinite-dimensional because the g is a function, is an arbitrary function. So what's important? Why do we care about the model? First of all, it's crucial in theoretical physics. In fact, there are four fundamental interactions in nature, and except for gravity, the other three is just unified in the same framework of Yamiel's model. Okay, so Of Yamiel's model. Okay, so by choosing the group to be this group, the model the three interactions. The famous standard model is basically built on the Yamios model. And also this Yamiels model and also related other related gauge theories such as Trans-Simon, Saber-Witten and so on, has made a very deep impact in different geometry and topology by studying the logarithm equation or the gradient. Euler Lagrangian equation or the gradient flow equation for the Yamiel section. And uh and then there's a um so-called Milan problem which asks how to make sense of this quantum Yamius measure e to the Yamius section over four-dimensional space and also prove how to prove a mass gap which means correlation decay. So and now of course this is open, okay. Now, of course, this is open. So there are actually two special cases, easier cases. The first case is when this group is abelian. In that case, there's no nonlinear term in the definition of the F because the bracket of A with A, so it's abelian group, the bracket is zero. In that case, the action is quadratic, so that formal measure is just a Gaussian measure. Gaussian measure. Another case is in 2D for arbitrary Lie group. In 2D, there's a special, okay, maybe depending on the underlying topology, but basically there's a special gate transformation which turns, now in 2D, you have two components, A1 and 2, and that special gate transformation turns to turn, so that the first component, you can make that to be 0. And if you can make the first component, And if you can make the first component to be 0, then the, so okay, so in 2D there's only f of 1, 2. And in that case, the bracket between the two is also 0. So again, f is linear. So essentially, the measure is Gaussian. Okay, so of course, it would be very interesting to make a little bit of progress to the millennium problem. So here are the possible ways. So here is a possible way to make some progress. So this calls the casconization. Recall this just means that we look at this dynamic, which is the gradient of the action plus the space-time Y noise, which is also a formal dynamic at this stage. But formally speaking, the measure you want to make sense is the environment measure for the dynamic. In other words, formally, the long In other words, formally the long times asymptotic of the law will be given by the measure. So how would one sort of solve the millennium problem, right? So here would some steps. The first step is to give a rigorous meaning to this dynamic, at least for a short time. So that's a local well-posedness question. Even so, in 4D, right? So the problem is in 4D. So even finite. Problem is in 4D, so even finite volume, how to give a small time solution. And then the second step is to extend the solution to long time and also prove sort of the law of the solution is independent of time so that you can send time to infinity as a limiting measure. And all this, no, maybe this sort of problem is usually easier in finite volume, but then how to extend to the entire R4. And then, suppose you can extend the measure to the entire R4, you also need to prove some properties, like basic symmetries, like a gauging invariance, and so on. And finally, the question also includes a mass gap. So after we have a measure on R4, how to show that the correlation between the X and Y, so when X when distance X and Y goes to infinity, the correlation should decay like exponential. Correlation should decay like exponential. This is the so-called mass gap. Okay, so this is would be nice to do all these steps, but unfortunately none of these steps has been carried out. So in 4D, when the group is non-abelian, none of the is known. In my talk, I want to discuss some progress in low dimension. So here, So here we look at the arbitrary Lie group, compile group, on the torus, where a dimension is smaller than 4. Okay. In 2D and 3D, we can, two papers, we can construct local solutions. And then in more recent paper, we can use the Borgans environment measure argument to construct global solution in 2D. Okay. Just a small remark. Just a small remark. So, since I mentioned that in 2D, by the XL gate transformation, essentially the measure becomes Gaussian. So, natural question: why do you still want to do this? So, there are many reasons that we still want to look at stochasticization in 2D. For instance, under that special gauge where the 2D Yamils measure is Gaussian, in that gauge, somehow the regularity of the field. Somehow, the regularity of the field is very far from being optimal. So, the optimal regularity in 2D expected to be slightly below zero. And in fact, in these papers, we do not work with in the XO gauge. We actually work for the non-linear dynamic, and then we can obtain this sharp regularity. Another motivation that we do this in 2D is eventually. Eventually, in this paper, we could characterize the 2D Yamios measure as the unique environment measure for the stochastic dynamic. And such a categorization is very useful in many ways. For example, we heard from previous talks that by using the dynamic, we know the measure can be decomposed into Gaussian part and much more regular. And a much more regular part. And also, in the same paper, we prove that many different discrete Yamios models, so-called lattice Yamio theories, converge to the same continuum limit in 2D. The so-called universality results. Similar in flavor of the particle system and other talks. So such universality results, so the difficulty is. So, the difficulty is how to show that they convert to the same limit. But now we have a nice characterization of this 2D YAMUS. So, basically, just need to show all the discrete YAMIOS models will convert to the invariant measure of our dynamic, and invariant measure is unique. Okay, so let's describe our main results. So, this So, this, if you explicitly write down this dynamic, is this nonlinear SPD. So, here is Lie algebra valued Y noise. And then Lie brackets, so here you have nonlinearities A D A and A cube. Just a small remark, actually, if you just look at a gradient of action, then it's sort of degenerate. It's not a full Laplacian somehow. Flushen somehow. This is due to the fact that there's a gauging environment and this typical situation in geometric equations. So the idea is actually we're allowed to add another drift, which is parallel with the directional gate transformation to make the, so combine them, you have a parabolic equation. So this is a well-known trick in geometry. I think originally from the study of Ricci flow. Okay. Flow. Okay, in any case, we have this parabolic nonlinear singular status PDE, and that's our main object. Okay, so in the previous two talks of this series, we discussed the part of the Bush trick, which work for 5,42. But this trick does not work for this equation. Although you also have a cubic term, which looks like 5,4, we have Phi 4. We have an ADA term, so we have another derivative here which makes the nonlinearity more singular. Okay, so that's why we need to, even in 2D, we need regularity structure theory for local solution. But let me quickly mention, emphasize that in fact for this Yang-Meuz model, the question is more complicated. It's more complicated or more interesting in the sense that besides the local well-posedness question, there are many other questions to be addressed. For example, symmetry. So remember, there is an infinite-dimensional gauge symmetry. So this means eventually our solution, so our solution, you might think. So, our solution, you might think we want to solve this equation for A. So, you have a space of A, some sort of space of A, but actually, what we care about is the quotient space, namely the space of all the fields modulo out of the gauge invariance, the gauge symmetry. Okay, so the gauge transformation is a highly non-linear transformation. So, the structure of this quotient space is very non-trivial. But eventually, what we need is But eventually what we need is a measure or a dynamic on this in this quotient space. Okay, so this is about the symmetry. Another question to be addressed is observable. So actually, for Yam-You's model, the interesting object, or at least for physicists, is not a field A itself. It's some sort of gauging environment observable. So here the field A is not a gauging environment because if you have Invariant because if you have A, then after gate transformation becomes some other field. So you want some sort of function now of A, which is invariant analytics gate transformation. And this is something called a Wilson loop observable. Okay, I'm not going to define precisely what is that, but everyone knows that in calculus, right, so in calculus, you can define integral of a vector field along a loop. Along a loop. And this loop integral of a vector field is actually invariant if you shift the vector field by a gradient of a function. So this is the basic factor in calculus. And you can think of this shifting by gradient function as an abelian sort of gate transformation. So the loop integral vector field is a baby version of a Wilson loop observable, and this Wilson loop observable is just a non-abelian generalization. The non-abelian generalization of that. Okay. So these questions are very hard because now remember our A is very singular. So in the singular setting, how to make sense of quotient and how to make sense of other, right? So A eventually will be a generalized function, distribution. And how do you sort of integrate the distribution along a loop? Along a loop. So, in general, there's no notion of integrating distribution along a loop. So, in these papers, we give a solution theory of the SCASPD, and we also address the problem of observables and symmetries and coordinate space and so on. So, more precisely, our results. So more precisely, our results consist of two parts. There is a deterministic part and a stochastic part. So in the deterministic part, we obtain a new space. Okay, so usually when you solve a schizophren, you solve it in singular scats PD, you solve it in some sort of sublet space or best of space with a with a negative index because singular. Negative index because singular. But here such sub-left space with negative index is not so useful for us because as I said, for example, if you want to define a Wilson-loop observable, in general, there's no notion of integral of a distribution over a curve. So that's why we actually construct a new space of singular one-forms. And this new space, well, And this new space, well, actually it can be embedded into the standard space with negative index, but it's different from those standard spaces. And what's important here is on this new space, we do have a notion of gauge equivalence. So we have a quotient space. And we do have a notion of gauge environmental observables. Okay, so that's the first part. So here, as I already said, the challenge. So here, as I already said, the challenge is that Wilson loop observables are defined via something called holonomies. Basically, they're like an integral over curves. And so in this space, we have a notion of holonomies. So the second part in the stochastic construction, we not only construct the local solution of the stochastic PD, but we also show that the solution of the SCASPD That the solution of SCASBD has a gauge covariant property, which means if two initial conditions are gauge equivalent, then after time t, they are still gauge equivalent in law. So this is the so-called gauge covariant property. And this property allows us to project the solution to the quotient space. Okay, so that quotient space is the space we construct in part one. Okay, of course, the challenge. Okay. Of course the challenge here is formally speaking the status PD indeed has that gauge covariant property because after all you derive you write down that equation from this formally gauge invariant model. But the non-trivial thing to prove the gauge covariant property is that remember from the first two talks, we first regularize a y-noise, right? You get a smooth noise, and then you want to remove the modification. The modification, and in this process, you need to add counter terms or renormalization terms. And this regularization and renormalization will break the gauge symmetry. So it's non-trivial to restore the gauge symmetry in the limit. So here is a picture for the construction. So this whole thing is our space, this new space, and we have a gauge equivalence relation. So basically, each Relation. So basically, each horizontal curve is a gauge equivalent class. And as I said, if you start from gauge equivalent initial conditions, then after time t, we can show they're still gauge equivalence. And so-called gauge environment observable here just means some sort of observable which take constant value, constant value over each gauge equivalent class. That's what I mean by gauge environment observable. Okay. So Okay, so before I okay, so before I make this statement more precise and illustrate the proof idea, let me this sort of some, you know, so in these questions we need to, there are many questions entangled, right? So somehow we need to define those observables, we need to make sense of gauge equivalence, and we need to solve the SCASPDE in this. Scats PDE in this sort of new space. But there's a common philosophy in solving all these deterministic or stochastic problems. So usually you solve a problem in some sort of standard space. But here, instead of working with a classical standard space, like a Sobolev space or something, we actually, based on the particular Um based on the particular problem, we uh uh create our uh Owen space, a new space. And this new space we create for this concrete for this particular problem will be slightly smaller uh than the classical space. And smaller in the sense that we actually encode actual information or encode actual answers to the problem. Um and and our problem. And our problem usually you can sort of divide into a deterministic part and success part, dismissive part or probability part. So this space, we don't want the space to be too bad. We don't want the space to be too large. Otherwise, we cannot solve the deterministic question in this space. So we want to to be small enough to solve the deterministic part of the problem. And uh um but we we don't want the space to be too small. Uh Space to be too small. So we want the space to be large enough so that the probability part of the problem we can verify the actual condition we impose. So that's how we close the problem in the space. So maybe this sort of philosophy goes back to maybe rough paths or something. So actually the part of the bush trick we discussed earlier is also baby version of this philosophy. You know, baby version of this philosophy because instead of solving the 542 in space of distributions, we actually solve the 542 equation in the space of distributions, in space of those distributions, which can be decomposed into a singular Gaussian plus a nicer remainder. So this is the kind of actual condition we impose. Okay. So let's first discuss the deterministic construction. First, discuss the deterministic construction in 2D. So, in 2D, we expect the solution to the SPD to be in this space, so basically slightly below zero. And let me just repeat that in this space we don't have a notion of integral over curve, right, observable, and that's why we want to construct a new space. And this new space is strictly between continuous. Continuous one forms and C minus kappa. Okay? So that in this space omega, every element in the space omega, there's a notion of holonomy, line integral. So how do you construct such a new space? It's just a usual way. We start with smooth skies and impose a norm and take completion. That's that's always how you construct a new space. That's always how you construct new space. So we start with uh with uh continuous function, continuous uh one forms. Okay, so uh continuous one forms we have a notion of a line integral. So here L is a small line segment and uh since eventually we want to we want a space omega which is distributions, right? So elements should be distributions, this means that This means that if you do this line integral over a short line segment, then divided by the length of the line, as the length of the line, as the line shrinks to a point, this average will go to just a pointwise value of A. But since we anticipate the A should be distribution, it shouldn't have a pointwise value. So this guy. So this guy should blow up as the line shrinks to a point. And that's why we actually impose this norm, which tell you how which tell you the rate at which this blows up. So here the kappa is basically the rate. So basically this guy should blow up at other, you know, L to the power kappa, minus kappa. Okay, so that we impose this norm. And then we take completion of the continuous functions. Completion of the continuous functions under this norm. And that's called omega. And then we show that this completion can be indeed embedded into the classical C minus kappa space. Okay, actually there's another, this would allow us to integrate along straight line, but there's another part of the norm which allow you to integrate along curves. But let me skip that. And then we need to add some extra work to allow To allow us to define gauge transformations on this space. Okay. Okay, so this is a new space in 2D. So we make the distribution space a little bit smaller by imposing some actual condition. But of course, eventually you still want to solve the stochastic PD. You want the solution to the stochastic PD to live in this space. So you cannot make the space arbitrary. So, you cannot make the space arbitrary small. You can say, oh, you just make that to be C infinity, but then eventually your solution is not in that space. So, you need to make sure the solution to the stochastic PDE will eventually in this space. In the first lecture, remember that for such stochastic PDE, the solution can be decomposed into a singular Gaussian part and a more regular part. Part. In 2D, the more regular part is going to be continuous. So the more regular part will automatically be in omega. The question is whether the singular Gaussian part will be in omega. So the Gaussian free field, whether that's in omega. And this is similar with the question of Komograph 100 years ago, whether Brownian motion is in C one half minus. In C one half minus. So how did the Kromogoroff? So Kromogoroff has this theorem which says if you can verify some moment condition for the Brownie motion, then you can prove that seems in the Holder space, Brownie motion in the Holder space. And you can indeed verify the Kommen-Gorf moment condition because the Browning is Gaussian. So you can compute the moments. And here we need a similar theorem. So basically, We need a similar theorem. So basically we build a Komograph theorem in this new space omega, right? So Kommogoroff condition with respect to this sort of norm. And then we can verify that Gaussian part of the solution indeed satisfy the moment condition. So that's the story in two D. In three D, the solution is expected to be more singular. So it's below minus one half. So it's below minus one half. Now, even the Gaussian part of the solution, it's impossible to integrate along a curve because so in 3D, the Gaussian free field has a covariance, which is the Grand function of Laplacian. So Grand function of Laplacian in 3D is 1 over x minus y. And this is not integrable along a one-dimensional object. It just has a borderline, actually. Line actually. So the idea is we still want to define some gauging environmental observable, even a regularized version of a gauge environment observable. So now what we do is we regularize our field. So how do we regularize? So eventually we want the Wilson loop or whatever, or observable to be kg environment. Environment, if you just do some arbitrary regularization of A and then put that into definition of holonomy or Wilson loop, that will not be gauge invariant. So we want to preserve the gauge invariance. So what we actually do is starting from element in that space, minus one half minus, we look at A delta, which is the solution to the deterministic Yang-Meo's heat flow. Yam-you's heat flow at time delta, starting from this singular initial condition. This heat flow has a smoothing effect, that's why A delta is smooth. And it's a Yangios heat flow, and that's why actually it preserves the gauge symmetry. So actually, the holonomy of this regularized guy indeed gave us a good notion of gauge environmental. Okay. And then we also want to define gauge equivalence. So how do we define A and A bar to be gauge equivalence in this very singular setting? Oh, we just say if after this regularization by the deterministic Yang Yeo's heat flow, so the two smooth guys are gauge equivalent in the class. Are gauge equivalent in the classical in the smooth sense, then we say the original two guys are gauge equivalent. Okay, we can prove that it doesn't depend on the choice of the delta. So this might be similar with in the other talk there was a caloric gauge by Terrace Tao and O Tataro and so on. So where you use you first use heat flow Use a heat flow, right? So here we first use a heat flow and then you study whatever wave equation or stack SPD or whatever. So maybe it's not directly related but similar. Okay, so that's what we want to do, but actually even to do this, even to just define a regular version of environmental observable, is highly non-trivial for the following reasons. We want to regularize this very singular object by this heat flow. So this heat flow has a following form. So now you think of delta as time, but delta is actually not really time, it's a regularization scale. Has a following form where you have an ADA term here. And such a PD, a deterministic PD, just kind of PD just cannot start from that initial condition. Okay, you cannot start a nonlinear PD from arbitrary singular initial condition. And you can see this because suppose x is minus one half, then you look at the heat the free evolution of x, right? So it's like a heat semi-group of x. And then you just substitute that into the A. The A. Then the L infinity norm of this guy is going to be bound. Okay, I use L infinity because now you can bound the two factors separately. And then from here, you would, so since x scale like a minus one over two, here you would get a minus one over four, and here you get something like a three, minus three over four, so eventually you get a minus one. And uh of course you want to write the equation in the integral form, right? So integrated Integral form, right? So integral over time, Duhamel form, whatever, and this is not integrable. So that's exactly the borderline of not being able to start with the initial condition. Okay, so how do we address this problem? The idea is again, we introduce a new space, a new space which is subspace of minus one half, minus, but with uh we encode actual information here. We encode the actual information here. So, what's the actual information? So, it says that, so now the problem is the L2 norm of this guy is bounded by 1 over S, which is not integrable. So, what we do here is that we sacrifice a little bit of spatial regularity, but again, some time integrability. So, here we do minus one-third instead of C0, but then we get a better power, which is integrable. Okay. Now, if you um Now, if you so that's the space. So, if you take X in this space, you can indeed run the Yamio's heat flow. So, the problem is solved. But of course, the question is, again, you cannot just make the just impose arbitrary conditions you want. So, eventually, you still want to solve the stochastic on your equation in such a space. But the question is, so the solution is again, the solution to the Scassy-Yamios equation has a Gaussian part plus a nicer remainder, and NASA remainder you can just, it's okay. And then for the Gaussian part, we can check the moment condition for the Gaussian. Basically, if x is a Gaussian free field, we can bound the moments of that guy in this sort of norm. Okay, so. So that's how we define the space in 3D. Okay, so let's talk about the stochastic PD now. So now we have this sort of space in which we want to solve a stochastic PD. And this space is defined in those sort of completely interesting way. As we said, we solved this TESPD using regular structures. Structures. It will take another half day to explain what is regular structure, but maybe just tell you the main idea and the main result. So the main idea of Martin Haire is that instead of, again, same sort of philosophy, right? Instead of solving the equation in base of space or sobless space, solve in the following space, space of A. Space of A, which is which has some local information. So the A is locally approximated by a finite collection of perturbative objects. And these objects are, you find these objects from the structure of the equation. For example, these objects can be Gaussian or some sort of square of Gaussian or some multilinear function Gaussian, some sort of explicit objects. Objects and use them to approximate the solution. So you make this onsatz and you need to solve a fixed point argument, fixed-point problem in the space of A, which has this onsatz. And the main result of marking hire was that, you know, this finite collection of perturbable objects or explicit objects, once you know the convergence of them, then you have a solution. Because the map from this object to the solution is Uh the map from this object to the solution of the SCAD D is continuous map. And the continuity is crucial because once you show the the convergence of them, then you get a limiting solution, at least local solution. So specifically to the Stokasi-Yamius model, um okay, so when we when we uh prove the convergence of this uh the finite collection of objects, we need to do some renormalization, right? To do some renormalization. Just like on Monday, when we do the weak powers, so the weak powers of the Gaussian part give us a renormalization term in the SPD. So this is a renormalization term. So maybe let me just mention that in 2D, such perturbative objects, there are maybe five of them, and in 3D, there are hundreds of them. Right, so um but uh fortunately, you know, Martin Hayer and his uh postdocs and his group uh spent many years to prove a so-called uh black box theorem, which allows you to systematically bound these uh these terms, these perturbative objects. Um uh so in other words, whether there are hundreds of them or millions of them uh does not affect the length of the paper. So you have systematic argument or inductive argument anyway. But here's the non-trivial part for the Young Meals is that it turns out although you have hundreds of these renormalizations, after sort of cancellation and the combination, eventually on a level equation, there's only one term. Okay, there's only one renormalization C. This requires some work. So what's the problem in 4D? Remember the Millennium problem was in 40, but in 4D there are infinitely many. Uh but uh in 4D there are infinitely many of uh such uh perturbative objects. So at this moment we cannot do anything. And uh uh this problem at 4D is okay there's a deeper uh explanation. Right so here of course if you have infinite money you don't know how to do it, but there's a deeper reason. The deeper reason is a so-called subcriticality. So let me explain this. So basically now regular structure theory is very robust and systematic for subcriticality And systematic for subcritical equations, but not clear for critical equations. So, what does this mean? So, let's illustrate using the Yam-You's model. So, formally speaking, you just have a linear equation and some nonlinear terms like this. Basically, the scaling of the linear terms are like minus d. Are like minus d plus 2 over 2. Basically, that's the regularity of these terms. That's the regularity of space-time y-noise. And if the Laplacian A has this regularity, then A would have a regularity which is this plus 2. So basically, the sort of scaling dimension or something for A is minus D minus 2 over 2. And once you know the scaling dimension of A, you can figure out the scaling dimension of A. you can figure out the scaling dimension of A D A and A cube. So this would be twice of that minus one, which is a derivative. So that's one minus D. And that's basically the three times that. Now what's special in 4D? In 4D, all the three numbers are equal. Okay, so this is what I mean by critical. And if D is below 4, then we say it's stubbornly. Then we say it's stability in the sense that the scaling dimensions of the nonlinear parts of the nonlinear parts will be larger than the linear part. In other words, the small sigma singularity, which is the whole point here, is dominated by the linear part or by the Gaussian part. And that's the crucial reason that Red R. Regular structure work. So that's how we solve this CASPD. And as we said in the beginning, there's also a problem of the question of symmetry. So we want to show the solution of this equation has this gauge covariant property. This property will allow us to project the solution to the To project the solution to the quotient space. So, what's the idea here? So, here we have this renormalization constant C. In fact, if you do a finite shift of this C, C plus 5 or C plus 7, you also get a solution. So, in other words, this is essentially In other words, this is essentially you have a one-parameter family of solutions. It's a similar situation as Ito-Stranovich, right? So like in SD, in SD we also have one parameter solutions. And you want to find maybe a canonical one, which is Ito, for example. Here, the question is: among this one-parameter family of solutions parametrized by the finite shift, actually there is a special one. There is a special one such that the solution is a gauge covariant. This is what we show. So, gauge covariant again means that initial condition is gauge equivalent, and after time t is still gauge equivalent. The idea to prove this is that we actually were able to write down a time-dependent gate transformation G, actually turns out to be this PDE, such that we apply this gate transformation on A. We apply this gate transformation on A, we get a new, right? So A solved the other equation, and then we get a new equation for B. And B solves similar equation as A, right? So if B solves the same equation as A, essentially, you're done. But the problem is, as maybe I mentioned in the beginning, that the renormalization and the regularization of noise break the gauging environments. And here you do see that, right? So you see that from this. So these terms actually are defined. These terms actually are different from the original terms. So we need to actually couple the A, the G, the B equation, and study a whole complicated renormalization problem for this whole system and analyze what's going on for these discrepancies and so on. So, in the more recent paper with Ilya Chaverev, we prove a stronger result, which says that the finite shift of Says that the finite shift of this C, which leads out to the gauge covariance dynamic, is unique. So among this one-parameter family of solutions, there is a unique one which has this gauge covariant property. How do we show that? So it's quite subtle to show. Basically, you want to show that if you take a different choice of this finite shift, then the solution. Finite shift, then the solution is not going to be gauge covariant. So you want to show that maybe with a different choice of the C, the AT and BT are not gauge covariant, but how do we show two things are not gauge covariant? Maybe you're not able to find a gauge transformation, but that doesn't mean that they're not just because you're not able to find the gauge transformation, right? And that's where we use the That's where we use the gauging environment observables. So we can show that for a different choice of that finite shift, then we can find a Wilson loop of gauge environment observable such that the two solutions AT and BT have a non-identical gauge environment observable. Since the observable gauge environment, right, so if ATBT are gauge equivalent, they must have the same gauge environment observable. And if the gauge their observable And if the gauging observables are non-identical, then they must be not gauging equivalent. So we'll prove the uniqueness in this way using the observable. And we can use observable because in the first part of the talk, we already made sense of the observable, right? Deterministic construction. So that's the basically most of the talk. Maybe the last slides. Talk, maybe the last slides is this again. This new result is Ilya Tavarev. So in the works I just described, it's just the local solution. But in this new paper, using Borguin's environment measure argument, we prove that in 2D the dynamic actually exists for all time. And also the 2D Yamios measure is a unique environment measure. A unique environment measure for the global dynamic. Okay, so essentially, this complete stochastic colonization program, but in 2D. So, in some sense, we can think of this result as the parabolic analog of high-tense result yesterday for wave equation. But in high-tens result, as I understand the environment measure, of course, the equation is wave is more complicated. Wave is more complicated, but the invariant measure is 5.4. So here the invariant measure is Yamyo's measure. And this actually imposed extra challenge for us to use the Burgundian's argument. Okay, so the first reason is that a key step, key idea of Burgundian is to use Markov inequality. Markov inequality says that you can bound the probability that the solution You can bound the probability that the solution becomes large by the moments of the solution. And the moment solution, because of the invariance, the moment of solution is just a moment of measure. For FIFO, it's easy to bound the moment of measure, but for Yang-Meos, bounding the moments of Yang-Meos measure is much, much harder. So in fact, we need to use, so this is something very famous in geometry. It's called the Ullenbeck compactness. Uhlenbeck compactness fundamental in the other geometric Yamio works. But then we actually prove a rough version. Actually, this goes back to another paper of Ilia, but in this paper we make it more sharp. So it's prove a rough version of this Wullenbeck theorem. And another key ingredient in Borghan's environment is Environment measure argument is you need to start with a finite dimensional system. For example, wavy equation or some Schrodinger equation, usually you start with Fourier truncation. You only look at finitely many Fourier modes. And in finite dimension, you can explicit check the measures invariant. Then you pass to the limit. Here, we cannot just take a free truncation or some naive finite dimensional approach. Or some naive finite-dimensional approximation, because that would break the gauge symmetry, and then the problem would be pointless. So, in this finite-dimensional approximation, we need to preserve the gauging environment, gauge symmetry. And that's why we start from so-called lattice gauge theory. So, lattice gauge theory costs us a lot of extra work because in this theory, the field In this theory, the field takes value in the Lie group. So the Lie group is a curved space, right? So we need to work with the fields taking value in the curved space. But eventually we are able to prove the limit, the continuum limit, as a lattice spacing go to zero. Okay, I think this is a good point to stop. Thank you.
