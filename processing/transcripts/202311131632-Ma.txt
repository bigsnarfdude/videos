Really glad to be here. Thanks for the invitation. A lot of great talks. I'm going to talk about another control matter, especially at the early stage of the epidemic. Compact tracing. So I'm going to skip the one. It's just half our talk. So for contact tracing, everyone knows what a contact tracing is. If one of the cases, for example, I use diagnosed, then Diagonals, and we come in and look at at least part of their contacts. We identify some of them and then we try to isolate them for those or quarantine them if they don't show symptom. And because of that, many of these contacts would be stopped transmitting from quarantine or isolation. But we can't catch every one of the contacts, so there are still cases that could spread. Cases that could spread with compact tracing. And I was quite interested in contact tracing because when I was looking at the data, for example, in early Chinese outbreak, what's very interesting is a lot of places didn't really implement city lockdowns. It's really Wuhan that did the lockdown, while the other places actually implemented a crazy complex treason process. Actually, it curtailed the whole epidemic. But in Canada, we did contact tracing, but it wasn't as successful. So the question is: can we actually estimate the effect of contact tracing? In Canada, how well should we do in order to curve it a little bit as soon as we can? And of course, it's a challenging process because contact tracing is really capacity limited. You can't, when there are thousands of patients out there, you can't really contact trace every one of them. You can't really contact with every one of them. So it's really going to work at the very beginning of the epidemic. But at that stage, the epidemic curve is growing exponentially. And all we measure is exponential growth curve. We have other control measures like social distancing, school closure, everything comes in. They all affect the epidemic. They all affect the growth rate. Can we actually disentangle the effects of different The effects of different cultural matters on the growth of the academic. So there are a few different approaches to deal with town-type tracing. The first one that I know of is from Mark Lipsich in 2003 Nature paper. He talked about quarantine isolation, but quarantine isolation mostly comes from contact tracing. Mostly come from contact tracing. And then in COVID-19, Jian Hong's group have a few papers on that, for example. All of these are basically the standard SIR model with a few assumptions. For example, we're going to assume that a constant fraction of the infections are going to be contact traced, then they're going to move to a special different latent class. And then, but it's difficult to track. But it's difficult to track what proper time that these individuals are actually contact traits and leave the isolated or quarantine. And another thing is eventually we're going to find out, we have found out, but I'm probably not going to present in this talk, is that the fraction of the patients that are contact traced is actually a dynamic variable that changes, for example, with your. That changes, for example, with your transmission rate and testing rate, for example. So, different control mirrors would change that number, so it makes it hard for us to disentangle the effect of different control mirrors. Here's this network model, which is a great approach because network models, unlike the random mixing models, they track contacts, and so we know who the contacts are. So, it's really easy to model contact treating using network. Model contact tracing using network models. The unfortunate fact is that for most populations, we don't know the contact information, especially when COVID was there. Even for now, we probably don't know a lot of the mixing patterns in the population. So it's really difficult to apply network models to real data. We have branching process models. Branching process models, that's a great approach for actually study the effect of compact tracing on ROT, but it's a stochastic model. It's going to be really difficult to calibrate it to data. So we actually developed a COI model just to see whether we can use simple ODE models to model contact tracing. It's an SIR model. Model and it seems that it's gonna work well. It agrees with stochastic simulations, so we think it's a good starting point. We're gonna adapt this model to COVID. So that model that we talked about is also assuming a random mixing model because we don't have mixing patterns in the population. So, how do we actually keep track of contacts in a random mixing model? Random mixing model. The idea is, for example, if we just look at a toy illustration of the transmission process, we have an index case from the beginning, then the index case transmits to a few other cases, then the secondary infections make further infections. So eventually, what we get is a tree of transmission. And that's actually the network. And if you think about it, And if you think about it, the contact tracing is really just an operation following the edges along this contact tree. So that's the idea. So we start with the SEIR model. What we really want to do is to include asymptomatic cases. We'll look at both SEIR and SEAIR model just to understand the effect of asymptomatic transmissions. But most people. But most people, especially including me, or so, intended to use that EIR model because at the beginning we didn't know whether asymptometric transmission was important and we didn't know how much of the asymptotic transmission it was. So people really just started with as simple a model as we could use, and especially as AIR model would introduce a lot more parameters at the exponential stage. Parameters at the exponential stage. It's just, there's almost no hope to identify all of these parameters. So we start with this, it's an extension for our SIR model, which is an extension to the standard SEIR model, where we keep track of quarantine, we keep track of the testing process and diagnosis, and the testing process would, we would Process would we would track the contacts. So, what's a fraction of individuals who has an infector or infectee who were diagnosed? And those guys will trigger contact tracing, and they're going to be moved to a different class so that contact tracing wouldn't be applied again to these diagnosing videos. So, the key thing is to keep track of contacts. How do we keep track of contacts? How do we keep track of context? We label, for example, contacts in this way. We keep track of who infected who. For example, the S contacting with the I would give us an infection of exposed class with an infector who's infectious. And these pairs would be labeled in the E infected by I pair, and then each individual in the pair. And each individual in the pair would progress in disease. For example, the eye could be diagnosed or could recover, the E could become infectious, etc., etc. So we keep track of the possible flows of this. I don't want to go into too much details of this, but this is all we need to track for the SBIR model. But imagine so, this is the full model, which is a little bit daunting. Bunting. Oh, by the way, to keep track of the pairs, we need to know the three-node interactions or three-person interactions. And to know these guys, you need to know four-person interactions. It's going to be a chin. Somewhere we need to close or approximate the three-node interactions using the pairs, which what we call a pair approximation, which is a standard practice in network models. Models. We can add the asymptomatic transformation class in, and then the exposed class. When there are compact traits, they put into the quarantine class as before. But the quarantine class, individuals could become asymptomatic, could become symptomatic and get diagnosed. The asymptomatic cases at the beginning, I think almost all provinces were not really testing for asymptomatic, in symptomatic cases. So many of them would. So many of them would just leak and become recovered. Some of them would go to, very few of them would go to test it, like the Ontario eventually allow asymptomatic cases, probably in April, May, capture number. So there could be a flow from quarantine asymptotic cases to diagnose cases. I don't want to show the flow charts of Don't want to show the flow charts of the pair dynamics, you just have to be patient to write down all these pairs. It's actually not too horrible, but it makes me feel like I'm an accountant. My wife is an accountant. She was worried about where my $500 disappear. I'm worrying about why I have 10 individuals I didn't account for. So it's the same thing. You just have to really look for all. Really look for all the possible change of states in the pairs. So we looked at our SEAIR model. We just wrote an agent-based simulation for the contact tracing process, assuming asymptomatic transmissions, etc. But without worrying about our model, we just modeled the contact tracing process. We run 100 simulations of the agent-based simulation. That's the 95%. Confidence interval of the simulations is given in the dashed line. The solid blue curve is the average of the 100 grams of stochastic simulations. The red curve is our volume model. As you can see, it reads pretty well. And this is in a population of 50,000 individuals. If we increase the population size larger, the fit the errors actually get. The fit at the errors actually gets even smaller. And we start with a pretty small initial condition. If we increase the initial condition, the spread in the stochastic runs would get smaller. So these two curves would agree even better. But that just basically means that our model is a good approximation to what really happened in the stochastic simulations. But keep in mind that just to compare. But keep in mind that just to compare with RODE, you would assume exponential waiting times for stage transitions, but that's not realistic. We didn't really compare what happens if we have realistic distributions. It's going to change a little bit. But the key thing I want to point out is that the exponential growth rates here are actually the same, which is what's most important in the early stage of the admin. Now, these are the Now, these are the parameters we use in our model. These are the disease-specific parameters. We can't adjust that. But these are the transmission rates, testing rates. Those are affected by other control measures for public health policies. And these are the contact tracing parameters. This is the probability that when I undiagnosed, what's a fraction of my I'm diagnosed with a fraction of my contacts are traced or plot in the contact tracing. And one over theta is the delay from I'm being diagnosed to the contact, I initiate contact tracing process. So these are the two key parameters. For contact tracing, so we want to disentangle these effects from these effects in the early exponential growing stage, which seems impossible if we really just have. Impossible if we really just have the case counts data because we really just have exponential growth rates with a lot of parameters to adjust. So the question is: what kind of data do we need? With this data, can we estimate the change in the parameters? So to answer this question, we again go back to our agent-based simulations. We generate some simulation data. We want to see whether we can, what data we need. What data do we need to collect, and whether we can estimate or recover our parameters used in agent-based simulations. So, one thing we clearly need is the case counts. But the case counts would include those who just show symptoms and they just go to testing. And also, it includes those who were diagnosed through contact tracing. And for those who were diagnosed through contact tracing, some of them would be asymptomatic and were current. Be asymptomatic and were quarantined and eventually diagnosed. Some of them were symptomatic, and then they, when they're contact traced, because they show symptoms, we assume they are isolated and diagnosed. Another set of data that we can collect is symptom onset data, which turns out to be quite useful data. So, we're going to just look at four sample data sets. We're going to use new cases, case counts for sure. Case counts for sure, we're going to use some information about contact tracing. What's the fraction of these new cases are caught because of contact tracing? Otherwise, we just don't have any information in the data. Of course, these two are complementary. If you know this, you would know what's a fraction when to testing because they just show symptoms. And then we also tend. We also can't select what's a fraction of them actually isolated, what's the other fraction were quarantined when the contact tracing happens. So that's the quarantine set and then symptom offset. So this is the combination of the four data sets that we try to look for, but we want to generate some simulation data, and we fit our model to these data sets. And this is one example of this. And this is one example of this generated data where we actually used three periods in the there was an initial growth period that was uncontrolled. There was a control period here, which caused the curve to go down. And then there was a relaxation after a while where the curve starts to increase again, which try to mimic what happened in the beginning of COVID-19. Oh, COVID-19. So some of the parameters, like the transmission rate, latent period, were taken from the literature, for example. And here's a basic idea. If we don't include symptom outside data, what happened is that we can't decide any parameter at all. It's just the model is unidentified because you can just. Fine because you can adjust the transmission rate or the testing rate or the contact tracing to give you the same thing. So, of course, in that case, if we don't have the symptomatic on-site data, we would need the testing rate once we have a voluntary testing rate. Once we have that, we can identify the parameters with reasonably narrow confidence intervals. But with symptomatic But with symptomatic onset data, we don't really need the Tau and we can recover them for sure. And the parameter values are actually quite close to the real values, at least it's all in the confidence interval. If we have the quarantine data, the fraction of cases who are diagnosed were quarantined before, we get even better estimations. So it seems that we So it seems we would definitely need symptom outside or the testing rate. It would be great to have this fraction of cases who were previously quarantined, but it's okay if we don't have them. Another thing is we see that the SEIR model and SIR model give you similar estimates for the contact tracing parameters. They give you slightly different estimates. Slightly different estimates, but sometimes quite different estimates in the transmission rate. So that's from our study. So if we look at what happens in Ontario, I was saying that we were using Toronto data. I was wrong. We were actually using everything in Toronto, everything in Ontario. So we have symptom onset data, that's great. We have new cases. We have something called close contacts. Something called close contacts, which we use as the approximate for the contact tracing, which is not everything about contact tracing, but we don't really have good contact tracing data. There's also things like outbreaks, I think it's related to contact tracing. We don't know how it's related, so we didn't use it. So these are the three data sets. And this is the estimated parameter values. We can have reasonably good confidence intervals for all. Good confidence intervals for all parameters. We also actually allow the testing rate to vary in each of the three periods. Without control meritor, the testing rate was pretty low. The strong control merrier increased it, but then the second relaxation in the second period, these two are actually similar. We can't really distinguish them. And about 30% of the Well, 30% of the contacts were closed contacts, or we think were contact traced. The delay between diagnosis and contact tracing is roughly about one day. What turns out confusing is we used the latent period, which is about one over sigma. Which is about one over sigma. From the literature, it didn't give us as good fit as this. We actually just fitted the sigma from the data, and it was much higher. So, which suggests that it's probably because this was serial interval or incubation period. And there was a synthetic transmission in the later stage of this. And so, part of this period should be in the transmission. In the transmission infectious stage, not in the latent stage. So here's our parameter estimates. And this is the fit. And this change, the sudden increase, is from the change in the testing rate. I think it fits reasonably well. And what's more interesting is we can explore the alternative parameter values. So P, like the contact. P, like the contact tracing coverage, probability that we can catch a neighbor through contact tracing, a contact through contact tracing, without contact tracing. So we set the P coverage probability to zero, that the RC, the control reproductive number is in the uncontrolled stage, this is R0. Then it dropped to a strong control mirror, then it it wasn't strong enough, so the control mirror was lowered. So, the control mirror was lowered. But actually, without contact tracing, this sorry, the control marriage was strengthened. So, the RC without contact tracing would have been greater than one. So, the academic curve would have to grow like that. The red curve is what we think it should have happened in Ontario. As you can see, the RC is actually a dynamic process because the contact tracing takes effect through time. It doesn't immediately It doesn't immediately reach the fraction, sorry, it doesn't immediately reach the fraction of patients who will be identified through contact tracing. So you see a gradual change then the remaining part actually is quite the transient dynamics actually finishes roughly here and then they settle down to much lower. A much lower RC, roughly greater than one, but then a further strengthening of the control mirrors made it below one. But then if we increase the probability of coverage to double or triple, we could see that actually if we double the effort, we would have leveled the epidemic curve in the second stage. The SEIR model actually gives you roughly the same RC estimate, but it underestimated the prevalence, especially it didn't count for the asymptomatic cases. So that's basically what we think. The P, the coverage probability, is going to have this effect. And the delay, it actually doesn't have much effect. Doesn't have much effect because the delay was already one day. If we double it, or if we just make it like a delay for two hours, the change in the epidemic curves and RC are just minimal. So it really doesn't make sense to devote all your money to make the contact tracing as soon as possible. Actually, making it two days wouldn't make a huge difference. So, what's more important is the coverage probability. That means for many. For many provinces, like in BC, we were not contact tracing to random mixing, like going to a grocery store. We were really only contact tracing to close contacts. But things like going to a restaurant, going to a grocery store, could, if we contact traced there, we could have greatly increased the p-value, which is probably what's happened in China because they were reporting. China, because they were reporting, it's probably not realistic in Canada, but they were reporting like some cases went to this supermarket. So any people visited this supermarket on this specific day, you should isolate yourself, things like that. It wasn't done in Canada, so I think that made a big difference for the initial Chinese control and what happened in Russia. Actually, yeah, so we need new cases. We need the number of people who are contact traced or who are diagnosed through contact tracing or the fraction of people who were diagnosed through voluntary testing. Those two are complementary. If you know one, you know the other. They would, together with either the simple Monset case or the voluntary testing rate, one of these would be. Testing rate, one of these would give you good estimates of what happens to evaluate the effect of contact tracing. The SEIR model gives you a slightly underestimated transmission rate, contact tracing coverage, volumetric testing rate, and it actually significantly underestimated prevalence. And it would be much harder for us to control or to level the epidemic without contact tracing, even though it only covers thirty percent. Even though it only covers 30% of the cases that you can't hear. That's all I want to talk about today. Thank you very much. I think just in the interest of time, Jess, if you want to just get set up, if anyone has questions, you can start. Wonderful work. Quick question. I thought early in your opening few slides, you had mentioned something about. You had mentioned something about longer delays associated with contact tracing, sort of being dynamic. But I think, if I understood correctly, you estimated that as a constant parameter of the survey. And would it be desirable, and secondly, would it be feasible to think about essentially having a compartment that doesn't represent That doesn't represent yet another state a person could be in, or a pair could be in, but instead, like a queue of people to be traced, and you could actually simulate the working through that queue in the meantime, and so treating those people based on a number of tracers or what have you. Yeah, exactly. That's actually the key class, which would be those who have been contact tracing. So there is the key is the queuing class in us. Queuing class in us. And actually, we can also model, for example, a saturated contact tracing rate just because of acidic. So we could put that in the model. We have that in the toy IR model, which just didn't put it in there. So pretty cool.
