to answer questions that before we were not available to ask ourselves. So I was wondering which organisms are present in crops rhizosphere. So I know the samples are multivariate, they come from different sources, so maybe it's difficult to compare between them, but maybe some tendencies But maybe some tendencies are possible to be observed if we have a lot of data available. So I started to ask myself what does these organisms, rhizos here has in common? Why these ones? Because these are crops that are from relevant economical relevant here in Mexico. For example, corn, potato, wheat, tomato, pepper, and strawberry. Peeper and strawberry. And I also wonder how some genera are related to the crop's health, like strawberry or tomato. Today I'm going to talk to you about these two stories, strawberry and tomato. In tomato, there is a species called Claribacter michiganensis that causes tomato bacterial cancer. And when a crop is infected Crop is infected with CMM, clavibacter michiganensis, all the house green has to be destroyed because it's very aggressive and it causes millionaire losses to the agriculture. So at a genus level, several species of clavibacter are present in all these crops. For example, clavibacter michiganensis michiganensis is the one that infects tomato. Is the one that infects tomatoes, but Michiganensis subspecies Nebraskensis, it's the pathogen of corn. And as we see, there are several species that are part of the microbiome of these other plants. So at a genus, at least there is a species that is present in all these crops. But what is the proportion that at what this genus is present in? Genus is present in this rhizosphere? Well, when we look in world public data in 2001, for example, for pepper, potato, but we also look for corn and tomato, the reeds map to clavibacter, but to all of the species, Californiensis, capces, chilensis. These are taxonomic assignations by kraken. By kraken. But when you really look at the reads by what is the difference between to decide if there is assigned to Capsici or Californiensis or Mechiganensis, to which species is going to be assigned one read, the difference are really small. Sometimes it's exactly the same, the map for those species. Those species. So, I don't really feel comfortable with saying that these are the real species, you know. So, the level of assignation of species is very hard. So, we wonder if maybe we only are certain about the genus. So, the genus is present at 0.01%, sometimes at 2% in the Sometimes at 2% in the samples. So it's a really low-abundance genome. But we really want to know these questions. Where those clavibacter michiganensis live when it is not in an infection in a greenhouse? Because we want to know how the tomatoes in the greenhouses are infected. So because of that, we want to send. That we want to sense to make a census about where the genus or the species lives. So, we already know for this last observation that it is a low abundance genus in the rhizosphere of the crops, but we don't know if at the level of species it is present, clavibactor, michiganensis, michiganensis, at the soil or at the water, or where does it live? Species level assignation, as I just said, is not high. Designation, as I just said, is not highly reliable for rare autus. For example, if we have two genomes, one from species A and another for species B, well, they share a lot of the genomic sequence and the reads can map to the two of organisms. In fact, we have tried to use what Lashmi told us before. So we couldn't implement it, but we are really interested in trying. Really interested in trying topological data analysis to solve this problem. Okay, but if the rich map to the same, to the two organisms, then it's very, it would be helpful to find all the family marker regions. And what do I mean for a family marker is those genes that only belong to one genome. That if you find that this read map to this family marker, To this family marker, then you are going to be sure that that read belongs to that particular species. And for that idea, we give ourselves the work to find many genomes for claviubacter michiganensis species. We have clavubactery chiganensis I, claviubacter michiganensis II, several genomes of the same species. And with all those. Species. And with all those genomes, we construct a pan genome in order to localize the marker gene families. We wanted those families that belong to the clavioacter-michiganensis intersection. So all michiganensis has that genes, but they do not belong to the union of the other clavioacter species. So it's going, if we really find one of these, we are going to be certain that. Going to be certain that we have Claudiobacter michiganesis, michiganesis. With this idea, we compare 84 genomes from the Claudiobacter genus, and we now have some gene family markers. Here, each row is a gene family, each column is a genome, and all the orange colors are Glavubacter michiganesis. Are Clavubacter, Michiganensis, Michiganensis. The other colors are other species from the genus Clavubacter. And as we can see, there are some families that only belong to Clavubacter michiganensis and some families that, well, not only to Clavubacter michiganensis michiganensis, but they are rare in the other species. So maybe we can also use it as markers. As a sidewalk with these family markers, we construct a cladibacter phylogenetic tree. And we know now that the grass species are related, more closely related to Claudiobacter michiganensis than the other species that colonize the other crops. So maybe Claudiobacter michiganensis leaves Michiganensis lives in grasses, in soils of grasses. So, this could be another idea of where to look for its existence. Well, we wanted to complement our data, so we added thirty seven Latin American rhizosphere metagenomic data from chili, corn and tomato from September twenty twenty one to january twenty twenty two. To January 2022 from Mexico and Peru. And we also find again the clavivacter genus in all the samples. So this is new because we didn't know before that clavibacter was going to be present so ubiquitously in so many samples. But again, the taxonomic assignations varies between Varies between the several species of the genome, and some of the reeds align to plasmids. So, our first idea was that they were not really clavivacter reeds, but maybe they belong to plasmids that were horizontally transferred to other species. But then we gather all the clavibacter reads from all the samples and we align them against the genomes of several species. The genomes of several species. And here, as you can see, this is one genome, and these are the reads that map to the genome. And well, they distribute evenly about all the genome. And sometimes the marker genes occurs, but this is not the most frequently case. So maybe with this kind of data that we have, that they are not. Data that we have that they are not very deep, not a lot of depth. We are not going to be able to use gene markers idea to distinguish between one species or the other, if one species or the other is present in the sample. So the next idea that we have is to go deep and consider some single nucleotide polymorphism variation, and we are on And we are starting to explore that idea. After that, some extra work that we put on our platform is the interaction networks. We calculate the correlation. If cladivacter was present, then which other genus also increased their presence in that sample related to the other. Related to the other genus. So we calculate all these interaction networks, but we focus on the clarivactor neighborhood soup network. And we did that for chili, corn, and tomato. And here, as we can see in red, we have Actinomyetia. That is the, well, Actinobacteria is the film that Clavibacter belongs to. So, with all this information, So, with all this information, we discovered that there was a positive correlation between Bifidobacterium and Curtobacterium with clavibacter and some negative correlated genera. At the end, this turned to be true because when we look for in the literature, there has been observed experimentally that curtobacterium used to coexist with clavibacter, and this could be because curtobacterium. And this could be because curtobacterium can eat dead plants. So, maybe if you want to know if some plants are sick, well, you can look also for curtobacterium. It could be a good marker. So, this is the same idea. Curtobacterium co-occurs with clavibacter in chili, tomato, and corn. Here, all the time that you see clavibacter, you can observe curtobacterium and bifidobacterium in all the samples. In all the samples. Well, this has been a story about low abundance genus, but we have another story where maybe the census of low abundance genus is not the important part. Here I'm going to talk a little bit about the strawberry. We wanted to know how we can differentiate between healthy strawberry crops and will. Strawberry crops and wilted strawberries. As you can see, here I showed you a beta diversity plot. All the samples are mixed. If you start with all the OTUs and before any normalization or any treatment of the data, everything is just mixed, and we cannot decide which is healthy and which is wilted because we are interested in the classification problem in order to predict which ones are going. To predict which ones are going to be healthy and which ones are going to be damaged. But then we thought that maybe if it was not the beta diversity, but maybe the alpha diversity, the diversity of each of the samples could tell us something about the health of the sample. So first we gather all the data instead of looking The data, instead of looking for small, low-abundance genera, we look for the most abundance in eukaryotic genus. And we observed that maybe Fusarium, it's a little bit bigger in the ones that are sick. This with the black shape is these ones are the sick ones, and the other ones are the healthy. From here on my right. From here on my right. So maybe this small change was reflected in some of the alpha diversity index. And this is what we did. We calculate several indexes, but the Shannon is the one that also considers the abundance and the presence of the different genus in a sample. So So after a hypothesis test between the average alpha Shannon index, here we have the different Shannon index. And here are the healthy and here are the wilted. Here you can see the average of the healthy and here you can see the average of the wilted. It's a small difference, but it is a consistent one and well. Consistent one and all the hypothesis test gave us a significant difference between these two. Well, these two examples, one in tomato where we look for where does a bacteria live and one in strawberry where we look what is the difference between healthy and wilted samples. We want to put all the work. We want to put all the work, all the code that we have developed in a small bioinformatic platform called Micro AgroBiome, where we concentrate this knowledge for Mexican crops. What is the real job? Well, it's true that there are a lot of fruits available, but in order to start working with them, we need the abundance table. What we find on What we find on NCBI, well, these are the reads and they are available. What we need to get onto the abundance table, and this is what we do. We use Kratin and our own data clean scripts. We have research for all these crops: maize, tomato, chili, wheat, potato, alfalfa, and now strawberry. And we convert this into abundant. Convert this into abundance tables. After that, we use several normalizations. And the idea is that also we want to use some metadata, for example, wilted or healthy, temperature, origin. And after that, we are trying to describe these microbiomes of the rhizosphere using we also. We also want to identify pathogenic and beneficial bacteria using networks of cocurrence in taxa. And we use this information to provide the agriculture with some idea of what would be a healthy microbiome and what would be something that is changed and that could give them some information. So, the take-home message is that. The take-home message is that we are trying to do a census of low-abundance genus. In this case, we are focusing on clavibacter, but this is just an example. The important thing is what is a good method to distinguish low-abundance genomes in samples. So, our results, our biological results, is that Clavibacter is more abundant and distributed than previously thought. Than previously thought. We even found gladiobacter in water in quadrocenegas metagenomic data. So it's really ubiquitous, an ubiquitous genera. The reads map to the plasmids and also to the genome, not just to the plasmids, so they should belong to one clavivacter species at least. The gene mark Do not map frequently. And finally, in strawberry, alpha diversity differs in healthy and wilted populations. So my main message is that if comparative genomics has taken us so far, why not think about comparative metagenomics? About comparative metagenomics and comparative pangenomics. And I think between these two disciplines, there is a lot that we can learn. I want to finish this talk also saying that we do care about education, so that's why we develop a metagenomics lesson for the carpentries. If someone wants to learn metagenomics, there is a server ready to use, so you don't have to install. To use, so you don't have to install anything, and you can read about our scripts and general scripts just to start practicing with metagenomics. I love collaborations, I like teamwork, and well finally, I just want to thank all the team that work in the lab. This is a hackathon, this is not the lab, we are a very small lab, but all these people have been. All these people have been collaborating at least once. Well, thank you very much. I don't know. Anybody has a question or something? Thank you so much. Thank you, Nelly. So questions for our speaker in the room? Robert has a question here, Dr. Robert Gentleman. Hi. Hi, really interesting talk. I mean, part of the problem might be, you know, that there are really major differences between sort of bacterial genomes and genomes in mammals and sort of other species. And the two pieces that might be important to think about are horizontal gene transfer, right? So you have genes or sets of genes that just move from one. Or sets of genes that just move from one cell to another as a unit. And that probably plays a fairly important role. It certainly does in sort of bacteria that invade humans in terms of drug resistance and things like that. And I imagine that similar features are important in agriculture. And then even if you didn't have horizontal gene transfer, the genomes are really. The genomes are really incomplete often in various ways. So, if you look, you know, again, mostly I know about ones that infect humans, like if you look at H. pylori, two different infections can have genomes that are not all that similar, right? They differ by a fairly large number of genes, and yet both of them are actually quite virulent. And so, I worry a little bit if you focus too much on I have a reference genome. much on i have a reference genome for this species that somehow that's that's part of your problem is to try to think about what is what what do you need to have instead of just like a notion of a single reference and then are there particularly pathogenic genes or particularly genes that would help evade any sort of treatment that you use to try to kill them. You use to try to kill them? Well, that's why I talk about the pangenome because, yes, in bacteria, two genomes of the same species may differ a lot. But if you don't consider only a reference genome, but all the genomes that you can find about that species, and with that you construct some marker families that belong to all those genomes that you are interested in. Genomes that you are interested in, but not to the closest relatives, that could be a marker, but you have to consider the pangenome, not just the genome. And yes, horizontal transfer is a really interesting phenomenon. And that's why I told that it was horizontal gene transfer genes. And we did that control to map the genes to a genome. And well, the point of that control is not that we have a reference genome, but that. Have a reference genome, but that the genes really map to evenly. If they were like overrepresented in some region, well, maybe they could be horizontal gene transfer or they could be in plasmids, but seems like they cover roughly all the genome. Okay, good, thank you. Other questions? Okay, we think Okay, we thank Nelly again. Thank you so much, Nelly, for joining. And we pass to our next.
