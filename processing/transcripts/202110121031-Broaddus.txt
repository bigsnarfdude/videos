surfaces for mapping class groups for this. So I'll define them well the surface of genus G with n mark points. So we have the surface of genus G, it's the topological Space of dimension two. And the genus, here's the genus, here are the mark points. And we'll call the set of mark points P here. And whenever there are no mark points, we'll just call the surface sigma g, otherwise sigma gn okay. So So we have moduli space, which I'll think of as the set of complete fixed area hyperbolic structures on the complement of the marked points in the surface. Just for the convenience of having a nice hyperbolic metric whenever we think about a Poisson point in type in moduli space. This moduli. This moduli space isn't a real orbifold of dimension 6g minus 6 plus 2n. I mean, also has a complex structure. And its fundamental orbifold orbifold fundamental group is the mapping class group. And then we have the universal cover of Of moduli space, which is Teichmueller space, which is a contract or is topologically r to the 6g minus 6 plus 2n. So it's contractible. So in other words, the mapping class group has a, well, has a well as a all the homology and cohomology of moduli space translates to homology and cohomology of the mapping glass group at least rationally okay um oh yeah sorry and then i guess i moved slides around so yeah so what um quickly the the mapping class group um for the surface of gene is g with For the surface of genus G with n marked points is going to be diffeomorphisms of the surface, which are required to, in our case, we're going to fix these marked points in P pointwise. Modulo diffeomorphisms rel these marked points homotopic to the or homotopic to the or diffeomorphic or uh isotopic to the identity okay so mapping class group is going to be as you just discrete group a lot like um there are a lot of analogies um say with sln z or something like that um and now uh the conventions for this talk are going to be a little bit unusual unusual in that Usual in that we're going to insist that P, the mark points get fixed pointwise. Normally they're allowed to be sort of shuffled around. But so this, so our mapping class group is going to be index and have a short exact sequence. This is the pure mapping class group to the standard mapping class group to the symmetric group. Group to the symmetric group. And so, yeah, today our mapping classes are going to just be what are called pure and they fix P point wise. So, why study the cohomology of the mapping class group? Well, it's nice to be at a conference where I don't have to tell you why, but Benson Farb is a. Benson Farb has always made me say that it's the fundamental group of the classifying space for diffeomorphisms of the surface. So that gives us, so it's the cohomology of the mapping class gives us characteristic classes for surface bundles. And so I'll just throw that in. But the reason I The reason I look at it is because the combinatorics are fun. So, yeah, anyway, that's and yeah, so anyway, so the cohomology of the mapping class group, at least rationally, and is the cohomology of moduli space. And also, if we have high enough n, then the Mapping class group becomes torn. The mapping class group becomes torsion free. So, yeah, if we fix G and put N high enough, you can get a mapping, the mapping class group becomes torsion free, in which case these become identical, these homology groups become identical for Z coefficients as well. Okay, so we have a theorem of hair. A theorem of hair, which says that the Mapping glass group is a is a well has cohomological dimension depending on, well, there are kind of two separate case edge cases. The G equals zero cases, where you're basically, well, Mapping glass groups of spheres with marked points or no marked points. And then there's all, then there's sort of the like you can think of these as sort of the line, the axes, and then filling in the quadrant, upper quadrant of the plane, it is all the other surfaces with higher genus and marked points. And so, well, today we're going to focus on surfaces with marked points. Surfaces with marked points. And I like this project partially just because in mapping less groups of surfaces, there are a lot of situations. Well, induction doesn't often work so well in a lot of the arguments on genus, but today we're going to be able to do that. There today, we're going to see a lot sort of an inductive structure that works well for marked points. Okay, so yeah, so as I was saying, so if we're interested in the cohomology of moduli space, Space. We have the stable cohomology, what's left over after the genus has been what's left over after the genus is large, sorry, sorry, or well, if relative to the Relative to the if the genus if the genus is large relative to the to the dimension of cohomology, then this we get this stable classes. So we have the Miller-Mumfrey Merida classes in dimension Ki and dimension 2i and Mentioned 2i and for marked points, we also have these Euler classes that come from tangent directions of moving the jth marked point. Okay, so these are all dimension two classes. Okay, so that's what's left over after the genus is very large. Very large. So then, as far as unstable cohomology, the Euler characteristic arguments for moduli space by Herr and Zagier and Beani-Herrer show that the Euler characteristic itself grows superexponentially in both. In both G and N. So that tells us that there has to be lots of unstable cohomology because the stable classes would give you like a polynomial Euler characteristic in GNN. So there is a lot of unstable cohomology, and you'd like to say something about what's going on there. What's going on there? A few results in the unstable region. I guess whether or not a particular group is stable or not isn't necessarily obvious to me. But yeah, so basically for any coefficient here. For any coefficient here, here we have four, anything greater than two-thirds, say, is might is a candidate for being in the unstable region. And yeah, so first of all, the top, this is the, for the surface, the closed surface of genus G, the top cohomology. The top cohomodule, the cohomodule dimension, as I said, was 4G minus 5. So a result of Church Var Putnam and Marita Sakase-Suzuki, these top cohomology groups, at least if we look in with rational coefficients, these are all zero. But then if we just move Then, if we just move one dimension down and have genus at least Z, then we do find non-trivial rational homology. So, yeah, so that so the other thing that we could do so. So, besides changing the genus, is look at finite index subgroups of the mapping class group. So, we define the level L subgroup of the mapping class group to be the kernel of the action. So, the level L subgroup is the kernel of the action of the mapping class group on the first homology of the surface. The first homology of the surface with coefficients in Z mod L. And we're gonna take for, well, for empty or non-empty set of marked points, we take co-homology, sorry, first homology, rel, the marked points. Okay. Okay, so Okay, so there's a corresponding moduli space for surfaces with level L structures. So it's the surface bundles where we have sort of a basis for the mod L homology of the surface. And we can take say We can take cohomology of that for this moduli space, will end up giving us characteristic classes for service bundles with a level L structure. Okay, so if we stick, if we stick with the mapping class group with no market, Mapping class group with no marked points, then a nice result of Fullerton and Putman says that the Q dimension of the top cohomology group, well, dimension, the cohomological dimension for the mapping class group with the level L mapping class group. This dimension grows super exponentially with G. So remember when we stuck with the regular mapping glass group, I guess, well, the pure mapping glass group, Mod G, we saw that this by the Church Fire Putnam, Putnam, this group was zero, but it becomes non-zero if you start taking finite index subgroups, such as the level L subgroup. And just to say a little bit about the really nice argument behind this result is that That the basic approach here is looking at the images of like this, what I'll talk more about in a minute, but the Steinberg modules for the mapping class group, looking at the image of the Steinberg modules and the mapping less group in Steinberg modules for, say, SLNZ. And then further. Then further modding out, say, by say a prime or something like that to get a Steinberg, well, an image in a Steinberg module for SLPZ, SLNZ mod P. Okay, so anyway, you can get non-trivial images, well, you can get non-trivial homology for non-trivial homology for finite index subgroups, the map, the standard mapping class group. And so we do something similar then for, or we extend that approach to the, is for mapping class groups with marked points. Okay, so here what we're So, here, what we're so if Î½ is the virtual co-homological dimension of the mapping class group of genus G with n mark points, then we show that the dimension, the q dimension of this top cohomology group is at least the q dimension for the Q dimension for the once the for the mapping class group with one puncture in its top dimension um which then you can use those sort of you can if you want you can use the um the um the fullerton um putman bound for this portion here. Portion here to show that this is non is large and already exponential in g and then you get that and then um you know today we sort of are going to look at how we extend extend that result to show that um um that that increasing it um oh sorry this should not have been Sorry, this should not have been. Yeah, sorry, this should be N. Where's my oh that should be N there so now is so so we then show that the increasing the dimension Increasing the dimension of the cohomology, the top cohomology for the level L sub mapping class group is exponential in both G and exponential in the number of marked points, or super exponential, I should say, in both. So, yeah, I mean, notice, you know, if this were, if this is something. You know, if this were, this is something, this would be, you know, we have L to the 2G here, but if without that factor, this would be something without this would just be something like n factorial. And with, you know, with this L to the 2G factor, you can see that it grows really super exponentially in L as well. Sure. Okay. Okay. Or perhaps just exponentially an L. Okay, so yeah, so let's work towards the Steinberg module for the mapping class group. And so first we have to start with a curve on the surface of genus G. It's So, a curve is an embedded circle which doesn't bound a disk or with a single marked point or a no marked point. So, yeah, maybe we can add neither of these are curves here, and neither of these red embeddings of the circle are curves. Embeddings of the circle are curves. And it's a the curve should be an isotopy class of such an embedding. Sort of the here is here's a curve, another possible curve might whatever. As long as neither side, if it's one-sided, then as long, then it's definitely, it is a curve. If it separates the surface, then it's a curve. Then it's a curve as long as one side is not a disk, once punctured disk, or a disk with a single mark point, or an empty disk, or a disk with no mark points. Okay. And I should say, sort of the standard way to get the best representative of a curve or the best representative of a curve. Or a set of the best representatives, simultaneous best representatives, the lots of curves is to take the geodesic representatives. And remember, the hyperbolic structure that we are looking at is supposed to be complete on the complement of the mark, on the complement of the mark points. So you can think of their. Marked points. So you can think of there being sort of these cusps at each of the marked points. And so a curve which only, supposedly, which only encircled a single marked point would not have a geodesic representative. So curves, you can, a quick way to remember the convention for curves is that they're exactly the isotopy classes that have geodesic representatives on. On your surface. And then a curve system is just a disjoint set of curves. Okay. So then we construct the curve complex by, it's the flag complex with vertex set curves. I mean, each curve is a vertex of, there is, the set of curves forms. Is the set of curves form the zero skeleton of the curve complex, and then you connect curves whenever they're disjoint. So, for example, this curve here and this curve here are disjoint. So they're represented in the curve complex by these two marked points that these two points with an edge. These two are both also disjoint from this. Joint from this third curve. So, in fact, we get a filled-in triangle here. And then the orange curve intersects both the blue, well, the orange curve, sorry, this curve intersects both of these, so they don't get connected by an edge. But this curve here is disjoint from this one, so in this portion of the complex, they are connected with an edge. Edge. So here's just a, you know, four vertices of an infinite complex with infinite diameter called the for this surface of genus three with three marked points. Okay. And another like fundamental result of Hair is that the curve complex has the homotopy. The curve complex has the homotopy type of an infinite wedge sum of spheres of a particular dimension. It's roughly 2g plus n with a few corrections in the two cases. It's sort of the sort of the axes, the situations with the G-axis and the n-axis have a slightly different formula. But within the upper quadrant, we get. Within the upper quadrant, we get the 2g plus n minus 3 as the dimension of these spheres. Okay, so the curve complex is going to have has the homotopy type of wedge sum of spheres and hair is borderfies Teichmuller space to get borderfi techmuller space and the boundary is Boundary has the same homotopy type as the curve complex, which Hare also showed is an infinite wedge sum of spheres of this sort of 2g minus n plus 3 dimension, the plus n minus 3 dimension. And so that then gives you that the well, this, I mean, this. Well, this, I mean, this forification, of course, was sort of meant to mirror the Borel sort border Borel Serbification of symmetric spaces. So we get sort of the same analogous results from the mapping class group as those for Borel SARE for, well, say like ethylene. Say, like SLNZ, say. So, yeah, so we get then this is how Hare is able to show that the mapping class group is actually a virtual duality group with, as I said, cohomological dimension, something like 4G plus n and dualizing module, which we Which he defines to be the Steinberg module for the mapping class group. So, and that's going to be the one. Remember, the curve complex is a wedge sum of spheres, so it has one non-trivial reduced homology group. And that reduced homology, I mean, that's the dimension for the Steinberg module. Okay, so this is the Steinberg module for the mapping class groups. Glass groups. And just a few facts about these Steinberg modules. I mean, this really kind of comes straight out of Hare's work. Maybe it shouldn't have attributed it to us. Anyway, sorry. Yeah, but we get of A virtually free mapping class group module resolution of the Steinberg modules for the surface of genus G with one marked point and the Steinberg modules of genus zero. So yes, genus zero and genus G with one marked point both have nice free mapping class. Free mapping class group module resolutions. And then, so you can just use the last two terms of that resolution to give a nice presentation for the map for the Steinberg modules in those cases. And sort of these little, you know, kind of fun little combinatorial arguments, and you can use. Can use on, say, chord diagrams here, or sort of analogous things called arc systems. In this case, you can show that this mapping class, this module is cyclic. In other words, it has a single generator as a mapping class group module. And one thing I've been trying to work towards. Trying to work towards is getting a nice turning that singleton generator into seeing it as a as turning that into a full presentation for the Steinberg module in these cases. And yeah, that's still work in progress. And okay, yeah, so just And okay, yeah, so just more fun pictures. Here's a non-trivial sphere in the Steinberg module for the surface of genus 2 with no marked points. And you can really notice edge vertices connected by an edge have to be disjoint and so on. And faces. And faces are all disjoint and so on. So the fact that this is an embedding of a sphere in this curve complex is just straightforward. It's non-triviality then. It comes from the fact, basically comes from the fact that it's a generator for this Steinberg module for the mapping class group. And so, well, if it were. And so, well, if it were trivial, then that dualizing module would be trivial. Means the group would be trivial. Okay, okay, so back to the Steinberg module. Now, for the rest of this talk, we're going to We're gonna um so uh sorry we're gonna go back to the mapping class group with uh n mark points. No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, the we're going to take homology with q coefficients. Um often the sort of more standard definition of the Seinberg module is with z coefficients here, but Is with z coefficients here, but um, since we're only interested in computations of rational homology, this works as the dualizing module there. And because this is the dualizing module on the nose, at least for rational homology for the mapping class group, this will be the dualizing module for any finite index subgroup of the mapping class. Of the mapping class group. And then, so if you're interested in the top cohomology of some finite index subgroup, you just need to compute the Steinberg module co-invariance for that subgroup with the restricted subgroup. Okay, so if we're interested in the top cohomology of the level L. Of the level L subgroup of the mapping class group, we want Steinberg module co-invariance for that subgroup. So we have the forgetful map. Oh yeah, so now this is the sort of inductive argument that allows us to add marked points for the surface. And yeah, and Yeah, and yeah, just wanted to read it. I mean, this is kind of, this is a nice, this is a nice situation where inductive arguments work a lot of, I mean, not so many inductive arguments work for genus, increasing genus. But yeah, so we have, we almost have a forgetful map from the curve complex for genus G to the, with n marked points to n minus one marked points. Marked points. The only problem is it doesn't always make sense to delete a marked point because you might have a curve which encircles those two marked points in this, but then when you delete one marked, but when you delete a marked point, That curve becomes a non-curve. So that's the one sort of sticking point. And so we're going to let the points A sub G N, it'd be those curves in the surface of genus G that bound a disk containing the nth marked point and one other marked point. So those are exactly the curves that Curves that we won't have a forgetful map from. So, yeah, so and then once we sort of identify those points, we can we get a nice sort of inductive description of the homotopy type of the curve complex, inducting on the number of marked points. So, exclusive. So, excluding sort of surfaces with too little topology, there's a mapping glass through equivariant homotopy equivalence between the curve complex with one more marked point and the simplicial join of. Of this discrete set with the curve complex with one fewer marked point. And yeah, so this is this kind of this argument is comes a lot, a lot of this argument comes out of hat. A lot of this argument comes out of Hatcher, that and we've kind of just sort of reworded it and put it in sort of a more modern, sort of mathematical point of view, or at least this portion of the argument. And the idea now is to use what we call a hatcher flow. And oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. This okay, so uh just yeah, so yeah, maybe before I explain the hatcher flow, I'll just point out. So what what is what does this inductive argument allow us to do? Well, so here's the structure. This is a discrete set, and then we have this curve complex with one fewer marked points. Complex with one fewer marked points. So if you think of the curve complex with one fewer marked points, sort of as the equator. Then we have a sort of a bunch of spheres there, and then we take the join of that complex with the discrete set. The discrete set, say maybe choosing one particular arc. So remember, each of these blue points, each of these points in AGN, these are all supposed to correspond to curves that bound a disc, the bound a disc containing exactly two marked points, one, the new marked point, and one, the, the, one. One old mark point from our n minus one mark points. So when we take the join, if you choose one sort of to be the north pole and then a lot more to be the like sort of alternate south poles, then you get you can see these new spheres are suspension, these new spheres are all suspensions of the old spheres. Of the old spheres. And if you want, I mean, you can almost, I mean, this description, if you have a nice enumeration of the equatorial spheres, then you get a nice, and an enumeration of these points A G N, then you get a nice enumeration of the new spheres for in your high curve complex with one higher. A curve complex with one higher number of mark points. Okay, so okay, so if we let the set X let this complex X G N just be all the sub complex not in the In the well, so basically, for all the curves that remain curves after dropping your new marked point, we end up getting that subcomplex is actually homotopy equivalent to, or can be moved until it's disjoint from. disjoint from a particular from any particular curve, C bounding your new mark point and one of your old mark points. And the basic argument there, which we just call, we describe this as Hatcher flow, is, I mean, suppose you have other curves. Other curves curves curves for the one higher marked point. And you want to figure out, or you want to move them sort of ignoring this new marked point so that they're disjoint from the curve C, which is sort of Which is surrounding this arc here. So, what you do is you just move these curves past this new marked point. One by one, you sort of flow in this direction until all the curves have been moved off this arc. And that gives you a deformation retraction of all these curves away from the new curve or from this. From the new curve or from this new arc new mark point. And that then gives us that other that the remaining curves or the equatorial spheres are the old curve compotopi equivalent to the old curve complex. And then, um, okay, so yeah. Um. Okay, so what this then gives us that the Steinberg module is the reduced H0 of our set of new arcs tensored with the old Steinberg module. So yeah. Oh yeah, okay, right. So yeah, so in other words, if we let Q tilde Q tilde S mean just the kernel of the augmentation map, then we get this inductive description of the Steinberg module. Okay. So yeah, so it's yeah. And yeah, right. As I was saying, this can you can use this if you know, if you have an enumeration of the spheres here, you can use this to have an enumeration of the spheres here. But unfortunately, we don't have that for genus zero. So, okay. Okay, yeah, so maybe I'll just say that what are the ingredients for our bound on the dimension of the homology? We'll use the action of the level L mapping class group. So, what we want to do is compute co-invariance of the style. Variance of the Steinberg module for the level L subgroup. So we compute co-invariance in the set A and we see that this action has basically adding things up, we end up seeing that the The um the cohen variant the action of the the mapping class group here on this that uh well, sorry, uh has or sorry, this should just be a it has um uh this many this number of orbits and so then um um yeah sorry the so Yeah, sorry. So that ends up giving us the bound on the dimension of getting the bound that you get from our theorem on the dimension of the top cohomology of the level L subgroup. Subgroup. So, yeah, I will stop there, I guess. Let's thank our speaker. Thank you. Do we have questions for Nate? And I think folks are welcome to either raise their hand in Zoom or pipe up. Raise their hand in Zoom or pipe up in Zoom, or I think we can also hear people in the classroom, so I think everyone can just speak or use the chat. We have one question, which is what is on the next slide. Oh, all right. So, yeah, so then the next one was just so these, I mean, you can use this, these non-triviality results. Results for cohomology for the level L subgroup to end up getting bounds on the coherent cohomological dimensions of different moduli spaces. So for example, the non-triviality of the level L subgroup for the unpunctured mapping class group ends up giving you a lower bound. Giving you a lower bound on the coherent co-module dimension of moduli space of G minus 2, which kind of fits nicely with this conjecture of Louie Ange that this coherent cohomological dimension is less than g minus 2. By the way, I guess you can think of this as some sort of measure of where Where this algebraic, sorry, where this falls between being affine and projective as a variety. And so does this imply, like for your result, that Mgn cannot be covered by fewer than G minus. not be covered by fewer than g minus one affine varieties is that right right right exactly yeah yes yes it kind of yeah says maybe yes something about like the the uh right it's like an abstract lower bound for yeah yeah right right yes yeah so yeah this um yeah so for example the projective n space can't be covered by fewer than n Can't be covered by fewer than n affine sets. So, and the coherent colloquial dimension of projective n space is n. So, yeah, so this says something about moduli space being, it's so, yeah, so if the Luyanga conjecture is true, then that would tell you that the colomodule dimension of Colloom module dimension of Mgn is G minus one, and the colomodule will tell you this is this is G minus two, and hence this has to be G minus one. And yeah, and notice that that doesn't depend at all on N. It's adding mark points doesn't really, once you get one mark point, going high, adding more doesn't make any difference. Doesn't make any difference is for the coherent coholimation. Or, well, sorry, that's conjectural. But the basic point there is that if you have a projective curve and you remove a point, you remove some points, it becomes outline. Can you guys hear us now? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think someone turned off our microphone and then I turned it back on. Then I turned it back on. Are there other questions? Oh, yeah. I guess I had asked you, you had an offhand remark that you're working on a presentation of Steinberg modules for mapping class groups. Do you have a candidate? And is this like in the spirit of Boykovsky? Your resolution gives a presentation, right? But it's not. Yes, yeah. Yes, yes, yeah. It's like a Charbley versus Boykovsky type thing. Is that what you're saying? Yes, exactly. It's yeah, yeah, yeah, right. It's just that you know, you have two finitely generated, whatever, the generators and the relations. And but yeah, turning that into an actual presentation based on this single singleton generator is so I'm working with a group. Well, yeah, anyway. Well, yeah, anyway, we're looking at the braid group and just trying to do it in that case. But yeah, that's very much still in progress. But yeah. Oh, yeah, I should say, like, yeah, like basically, what boundary components. Basically, boundary components work the same way as marked points, at least as far as the Steinberg module. So when I, yeah, everything that you do for the braid group is this basically the same module as for the sort of n plus one punctured sphere. They have the same curve complex basically. They have the same curve complex basically. Do you think you can give an overly complicated proof that the like the version of the Churchford-Putman conjectures for the brain group should be true? I mean, we know it only has homology and degree one and the VCD grows linearly. Can you like come up with a resolution to show all those groups are zero? Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, that. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that sounds, I mean, like, yeah, that's true. That should write that down. That sounds very likely with what we know now. Yeah. Yeah. Any other questions in person or on Zoom? Or on Zoom. If not, let's thank Nate again. This time, hopefully, you've heard the clapping from the room. Thank you. And the next talk is.
