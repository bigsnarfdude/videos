Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the organisers for having me to come and talk. I'm excited to meet with you all. I think this is a really exciting meeting, and I'm excited about the society as well. I'm not the person who's come the furthest. There's one person who came slightly further than me, and you will hear from him later. But if you're not sure where I'm from, I'm from right down in the south of New Zealand, which is the bottom of the world. What I want to do today is to actually What I want to do today is to actually to pick up on something that Caroline is talking about, is the focus that many mathematical modellers have on equilibria. And what I want to argue is that we spend too much of our time looking at equilibria. It's not that there's anything wrong with looking at equilibria and finding out about the equilibrium. It's something that's useful to do in models if we're able to do that. But it seems to me that we can do something a whole lot more. Sometimes we A whole lot more. Sometimes we're even, you know, solving a model means, in fact, finding the equilibrium. And I think that's something we really have to get away from. And so I have this picture of this wonderful, if you haven't read it, wonderful history of population modelling, mostly theoretical ecology. Sharon Kingsman wrote this book and went through a couple of editions. And in it, she makes the argument that mathematical ecologists in the 1960s and 1970s were very anti-history in their modelling because they argued. In their modeling, because they argue that history lacks generality, it's contingent. We've heard that word before, contingency, that's a bad thing because it makes everything unpredictable. I'm going to argue that we can actually do a whole lot better than that. But even in population genetics, and these are some quotations from Lewington's fantastic book from 1974, and you can read them all here. But the thing that really matters is that last bit. Evolutionary geneticists are anxious to purge historical elements from their explanation, right? So again, you know, just as a theory of color colour. Again, you know, just as a few of the collegologists, the population of colleges were also anti-history, and they concentrated, therefore, on equilibria, because that annihilates the history. So, my argument in brief, if you get one thing from this talk, is that we need to look quite beyond the equilibria. And my argument is that history can be actually systematically incorporated into ecological and evolutionary modelling. And I'll give you some examples from my own work in just a moment. And in particular, what's useful is, in fact, to differentiate between different ways. Differentiate between different ways in which history can impact our models. And that's what I mean by flavours. So the flavours of history are different ways in which history can impact models. And I'm going to talk about at least two, three of those. If you want a short version of it, this is my COVID project. During COVID lockdown, I wrote this paper while all our family was stuck at home. Thank goodness our internet connection has a really good one. So I want to talk about first about history as contingency. So what I mean by contingency. So, what I mean by contingency, and maybe it's just a subset of what you mean, is the outcome of contingent events depends on what's already happened. So, my argument is that we can systematically study it. And I want to give you an example, actually from foraging theory. So, Mark talked about foraging theory before. This is a slightly different aspect of it. But many of you will have heard of the ideal free distribution. If you haven't, it tells you something that's kind of obvious, which is that these fish are consumers of the plant. Of the plant in the middle there. And the ratio, if you have a two-patch system, the ratio of the numbers on the left should match the resources ratio. So that's kind of obvious that what everyone should think would happen. But actually, what you find when you go out and look in the real world is that you often get undermatching. So there's actually too many fish at the poor side and not enough at the good side. And so some theorists have been interested in trying to come up with explanations for. Been interested in trying to come up with explanations for why we find that. So, one of those explanations is that we relax what's called the free assumption, which doesn't just mean the fish are free to go anywhere, it means the fish are free to go anywhere on an equal basis. And so, one thing you can do is to say, let's suppose we had different classes of competitors. So, we've got the big fish and the little fish, and the big fish eat twice as much as the little fish. And if you look at this particular example here, where you have six big fish and six little fish, there are actually four possible solutions that lead you to. Solutions that lead you to the ratio of the competitive abilities matching the resources. So it's a kind of variation of the ideal for your solution. So one of the questions that might come up is which of those solutions is the one that you're likely to see. So one way to do that is to do some combinatorics, right? To say, well, how many ways can you organise the fish that you've got so that you've got that number on the left and that number on the right of the two different kinds? And it's just a simple matter of this combination, which should be some interesting one. Should be something interesting. I'll use my hand. That's just a simple combinatoric exercise, and you discover that there are 90 ways that you can do that. So, if you do that for all four solutions, what you find is there are 336 altogether, one of which is the one at the top, and the most frequent one you can see is this one down here, and that's an ideal free matching distribution. So, if you didn't know about the computers of So, if you didn't know about the computer differences, you would think of that as matching the ideal free distribution. So, obviously, this isn't going to work too well, right? But this is a very equilibrium-centered view. There's no history going on here. So, what happens when you put some history in? This is pretty naive history, but let's suppose that the fish come along one at a time, and they choose a site, and then another fish comes along, and it chooses a site, right? And that site is contingent on what has happened before. So, and you can have some swapping there. So, what happens is here, you've got your two. There. So, what happens is here you've got your two sites. A fish comes along, it goes to that site, another fish comes along, it goes to that site, and eventually all the fish come along, and then there's a bit of swapping goes on, and you go and do that lots of times. Well, you could do that using a Markov chain system, but I'm a simulation kind of person, so I get some simulation, it doesn't matter, you'll get the same answer. And what you discover this time is that if you put some history in, then the most frequent outcome is this one here. Is this one here? And that one looks like underneath you. So you've got too many fish at the poor side and not enough at the good side. So that doesn't mean that that's the solution. That doesn't tell us that that's why we see undermatching. But it certainly makes it plausible that one of the reasons that we might see undermatching is to do with competitive differences. But you only see that if you incorporate some history into your approach. Okay, so I want to talk now about. So, I wanted to talk now about a different flavour of history. That was very equilibrium-focused, right? I really only looked at the equilibria, the distribution of equilibria, and used contingency to argue which of the equilibrium we're going to come out at. So, this system here has a different kind of flavour for history. And it's where a system can be constructed over time. And those constructed systems have parameters that have been selected, and they might be rather unusual. And they might be rather unusual parameters. So let's have a look at an example from population genetics. And this is my great-grandfather in academic terms. And he asked the question that we're still kind of answering as population geneticism, which is why do we see so much variation, genetic variation in natural populations? And Dubzansky's answer, of course, was that it was maintained by balancing selection. And his favourite kind of balancing selection, as you all know, was Hibizygot Advantage. So that argument. So that argument was done some damage by his academic son, Dick Lewington, in a paper in 1974 on Genetics. And he asked a relatively simple question. If you take a single locus model that has n alleles, and you just use the bold standard constant viability selection model, what proportion of parameter space leads to all of those alleles being maintained? And that's what I'm going to call the potential for selectively maintained polymorphism. Polymorphism. And so we know what the answer is for n equals 2. For n equals 2, you have to have heterozygote advantage. And you have three thicknesses, so the chance that the heterozygote is the biggest one of 1 and 3. If you go and look at more than three alleles, there's no easy heuristic for what's going on. And so what you do, you do, as Lunton did, you do some simulation, and this is this result. So this is the number of alleles in your system along the x-axis there, and this is the proportion of the 100,000 fitness sets that. Of the 100,000 fitness sets that maintained that number of lengths. So this answer here is a third, this answer here turns out to be about 4%. And you can see, because we've got a log scale on the y-axis here, that that proportion declines precipitously as the number of alleles goes up. And in fact, in 100,000 fitness sets with six alleles, you couldn't find a single one that maintained all six of those alleles. So people interpreted that result in a number of interesting ways. In particular, that selection cannot maintain. Selection cannot maintain the observed standard variation, and there's lots of people who could make that claim. That claim is a logical fallacy, of course, because the proportion, the magnitude of a particular fraction of parameter space, what I'm calling the potential, those probabilities that are going to count here, doesn't tell you anything about the likelihood that real parameters are pushing. It just tells you that those parameters are particularly special parameters. And those particularly special parameters might have been arrived at. Might have been arrived at through a process that involves history. And so the question that I ask is: can you construct selectively maintained polymorphisms easily? I apologise, I'm slightly jet-led. So I ran some simulations where I started with one allele. I ran them for 10,000 generations. In each generation, I introduced a mutation that had random viabilities, not very realistic ones, and iterated. ones and iterated what was going on and most of the time of course that new mutation drops out, goes to extinction and what happens? Well here's a typical run. This is time along the x-axis here and this is the number of alleles. We started down at one. My graphing program isn't all the best but pretty rapidly you increase to somewhere between I don't know three and nine alleles there. And over time you can see that occasionally things go extinct. There's an invasion here. There's an invasion here, a veal gets in, and you end up with about, well, in this particular case, of 10,000 generations, you end up with five alleles. If you do this lots of times, you can generate a bar chart. Here's a bar chart with the number of alleles from 1,000 simulations. And what you can see here is that the mean of this distribution is bigger than any number that Lewington ever found in his simulations. He couldn't find any with six alleles. With six alleles, six allele systems that maintained all six alleles, and yet we found more than a fifth of our simulations ended up with six alleles. So clearly, this historical process is very good at constructing polymorphisms, even under this highly unrealistic system of generating mutations. So, yes, that easily constructed. It turns out this conclusion is pretty robust. If you look at frequency-dependent selection, if you change the mutation. Selection: If you change the mutational distribution of the fitnesses, you discover you can make them more realistic. You can change that. You can introduce structured populations, so some separation of populations with migration. You can put some genetic drift in. Basically, yeah, there's some differences, but they're quantitative, not qualitative. Basically, over time you maintain or you generate these polymorphisms. So, what we've got here are two questions. The first is about the Questions. The first is about the proportion of fitness sets that maintain polymorphism. That's an ahistorical, what I call a parameter space approach. And that gives you an interesting answer. The potential is really small for large numbers of wheels. It's actually an interesting answer. I don't want to knock it. But it doesn't tell us anything about what might actually be seen. If you get this constructionist approach, you can discover that the realization of potential might be much higher than you would have thought. Okay, these models are not particularly realistic, and they don't actually give us, I mean, they give us more numbers of alleles, right? That solves that problem a little bit, but it didn't solve all the problems to do with the patterns of genetic variation that we see in natural populations. For example, they generate far too much heterozygote advantage, and one of the things we all teach about heterozygote advantage in our population genetics courses, and then we're kind of embarrassed that we have to still talk about sick cell anemia. I know there are some more examples now, and maybe we talk about one class, but the fact Now, and maybe we talk about one class, but the fact is, there are not thousands of cases, which is what you would expect in all of these simulations in the case. They also fail to construct monomorphisms, which you know happen out there, right? Sometimes there's not much variation in the locus, and sometimes also they don't construct enough highly polymorphic systems. So, I just want to tell you about some recent work that I've done that looks at this last assumption here, because there's a lot of really basic assumptions here, and that is that the environment And that is that the environment hasn't changed over time. So that's in those 10,000 durations, there's no environmental change. So that's not really that realistic. What happens if you have, well, we were talking, I was talking with somebody this morning about the Red Queen. The original version of the Red Queen, if you go and read that paper, Joanna, it's rather different from the view that population geneticists have today, which is to do with feedback and the frequency dependence. The Red Queen was originally about biological. About biotic deterioration and biotic adjustments, doesn't really matter. What we did was instead of just having our constant viabilities, we decremented them by some small amount of degeneration so that the environment was slowly deteriorating. So older genetic types, on average, were going to have lower fitnesses. And that leads, in fact, to a further flavor of fitness because you're never going to be in equilibrium. We've moved away from anything that would pretend to be an equilibrium because the That would pretend to be an equilibrium because the environment is always changing. So the parameters in the system are always changing. So, what did we find? So, from the top to the bottom here, we've got the kind of graph that we saw before for increasing rates of environmental deterioration. So, the one at the top there looks a little bit like what we had before. The dark pink line is the total number of alleles. The pale pink line that you probably can't see is the number of common alleles. So, those are alleles at frequency more. Alleles, so those are alleles at frequency more than 1%, and that's probably what we see when we go out and survey our original populations. And the blue line at the top there is the mean fitness of the population. So the top graph is the standard single locus viability selection model. And you can see that the mean fitness goes up each generation as we know that it should. And we end up in that particular case there with about six or seven alleles, all of which are popular. But as you can see, when we introduce even a tenuity When we introduce even a tenuini amount of deterioration, so that's 1% of 1% of degeneration, right? It would be imperceptible in any kind of experimental system. We get a really different answer, right? First of all, we see that the mean fitness behaves in a very interesting kind of ratcheted way, where the recoveries in mean fitness are quite sudden, right? And the deterioration takes a long time. And we can see that there's much greater variation in the frequencies of the areoles and the Of the alleles and the numbers of the alleles as well. And so, if you put in drift, what you see, so here's some drift examples on the right compared with the infinite population ones on the left, and you can see that drift basically depresses the numbers of alleles, which is what you'd expect, and that's true whether you're talking about a common or total alleles. So, this graph here, I apologise for it being in lots and lots of pictures, all of which show me. Being lots and lots of pictures, all of which show pretty much the same thing. These are some bar charts that show the numbers of anels at generation 10,000. So it's analogous to that one that I showed you before about just a single loaf. So we've got increasing rates of deterioration as we go down the page here. And the red bars are the total numbers of alleles in the population, and the blue bars are the numbers of common alleles. And I said to you before, one of the failures of the models to date has been that. Failures of the models to date has been that they don't generate monomorphisms as well as highly polymorphic systems. And what you can see here, as we increase the amount of deterioration, is that we are getting some monomorphisms. And we're also, we can't read that number there, but that says 40. So we're getting large numbers of alleles as well in different simulations. But these are different simulations that all have the same parameters. They only differ in their random number seeds and the sequence of random numbers. So, environmental Random numbers. So environmental deterioration might turn out to be really important, even if we can't really measure it on a scale, on the sort of scale that seems to make the difference. So, oh, that's pretty much just what I've said. There's still an issue. There's still too much heterozygotic advantage. So the next thing that we want to do is to go and tweak yet again the way in which mutational fitnesses arise. So just to finish up, how much time do I have here? Oh, wow, that's great. Just to finish up, so contingency, which was what we saw in the foraging fish example, allows us to ask why we end up at certain equilibria rather than others, right? And that's because the equilibria we end up at are contingent on what's already happening. Construction is not really concerned so much about equilibria. It was the long-term behaviour that was the focus, right? So it's not like the equilibrium on those models aren't important, but actually. Models aren't important, but actually, if you ask me the question: of those polymorphisms at generation 10,000, how many of them were at a stable equilibrium? I don't actually think that's the right question. It might be interesting from a mathematical point of view, but it's not immediately obvious to me as interesting from a biological point of view. And then the last bit where we saw the constant deterioration in the fitnesses is a flavor that I call turnover, where there is no equilibrium. The system keeps changing. We're quite happy with this. Change. We're quite happy with systems like that. The neutral theory is a model of turnover, right? There's a constant replacement of the neutral alleles over time. So we're quite happy with that kind of model, and it doesn't focus on equal. If you want to know about Furious other favours, you can go and have a look at that paper there. So my conclusion is that looking beyond the equilibrium improves our understanding of population biology and all sorts of ways. And those different flavours of history actually. Flavours of history actually illuminate different things. And so we have to ask ourselves different kinds of questions about the history of our system in order to work out which of the flavours of history is going to make a difference to the models. I had a whole host of students and postdocs. Their names are listed up there. I should point out Sir Walter down the bottom here, whose paper just got accepted in G three and I'm now some coming through some terrible negotiations about how not to pay for the page charge. And not to pay for the page charges. My university has a great agreement not to pay the page charges. It's an agreement with Oxford, but the G three people don't seem to know about that. And we've had funding both from the Royal Society of New Zealand and from the Division of Sciences at the New Zealand. Thank you. I really enjoyed that. I'm sort of thinking, I'm sort of reminded of the puzzle that Mark gave us before lunch. In the deterioration model, every allele deteriorates by a factor of D every generation. Yeah, well, every fitness does. Every one of the, because it's a diploid system. Okay, yeah. So, but the allele, what happens in other What happens, another kind of contingency is here's a new allele that enters the population with some fitness. Now selection has a voice in the matter. Is that captured in that deterioration model? In other words, is it possible that the alleles we see in natural populations are somehow, and it's obviously true, that they're enriched by their selection. So that the statistics that we see in nature somehow reflect that kind of contingency, that haven't treated that. How you treated that? Not sure that I understand the question, absolutely, but the system just behaves each generation with those new deteriorated fitnesses as the W's in the Bog standard model. And it is true that an allele that's been in the population for some time, if it has high heterozygote fitnesses with a newly arising mutation, that would be drawn from that uniform 0-1 distribution. 0, 1 distribution. We did some other distributions as well, but the answer turns out to be remarkably robust to the distribution you draw them from. Does that answer your question? I don't know if I understand my question, so maybe I won't take it over. You're using evolutionary dynamics in your simulations, those are log standard selection among the alleles that are present. Every new allele is not hurt by this determination. No, the new allele. The new allele. The new alleles are just drawn from the uniform 0-1 distribution. But as I say, we did do some other distributions where we assume that each allele has a primary effect, and there's an interaction effect that means that that's how you get the dipole thing. And if the primary effect, so the fitness is a weighted sum of the two primary effects and the interaction effect, right? And if you weight the primary effects enough, you don't get any head result in advance. Enough, you don't get any heterosizing advantage, right? Because every fitness is simply the average of the, well, twice the average of the two primary things. So maybe I misunderstood this, but I was expecting you to talk about history in a slightly different way. I mean, when people use the word equilibrium, they often mean at least one of two things. One of them is sort of a fixed point, which I think is how you're using it, but the other is as an asymptotic calculation. Calculation. And if I understood you right, everything you did was asymptotic in the end. So if you look at the deterioration case, it settles down to some long-term behavior, asymptotic behavior. So there's a sense in which the history is now washed out there as well. I wonder if you could say something about that. And maybe the role of a what you might call transience actually, which is really a history, that's why So that's why I talked about that last model as being history's turnover. Model as being his views of turnover, which is what I also think the neutral view is. So, the genetic constitution of the population is forever changing. So, you don't reach an equilibrium where the alleles are there at some point, as you do an heterocyte at a vantage, for there in a day. So, there is a kind of equilibrium, but it's to do with the level of variation. It's not to do with the genetic constitution of the product. So, if you focused on that, yes, there's a kind of equilibrium or there's a distribution. Kind of equilibrium, or there's a distribution of values that'll have a meaning and so on. And so, to that extent, you're right. I suppose I use equilibrium in the terms of the population isn't changing anymore as it doesn't, say, in the models that you can't. So, Lewington said, Okay, I got four alleles, draw the business randomly, ask what's the probability that all four are maintained. And then you had a cool. And then you had a pool of 10,000 alleles for the whole thing. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. So, do you know what if Lewington had just done exactly what he had done? But say, I'm going to start 10,000 alleles, and I make a histogram of how many are maintained. So, what you could do is take 10,000 alleles and then eliminate them one at a time according to some law. No elimination. Wicked did exactly what he did. And that's what fraction can you read? And I look at the print, I draw the. And I look at the parents, I draw the parents, draw all the details randomly, and ask, and then I ask how many of those are maintained. Not the fault, you could do that. You could do that. And the answer will be a much bigger number than he thought. And that has been done, but I can never remember who did it. Yeah, somebody did do that. People talked back at Stanford and me. Sorry, LSP cut us off, but we are feeding on our discussion time. So, our first question from our fellows. Our first in question from Mark Feldman. If, as Lewinson said, 85% of selection is not viability, what can you infer about the relevance of your viability results toward nature? That's a great question, Mark. Thank you. I mean, that's right. I mean, you could look at other models of selection. We want to look at fertility selection. My guess is that the answer will be the same. I mean, I was really amazed that essentially we get the same kind of result in a We get the same kind of result no matter what kind of selection model we use and no matter what kind of mutational distributions we use. It doesn't matter whether you put genetic drift in. So I don't know the answer for sure, but my guess is that other kinds of searching are going to give you qualitatively the same kind of answer. So that is our break. After the break, we have a bigger picture of the screen that you can use. Bigger pictures. Do you want to come back and hear? Yeah, we'll start it here for the 3:30. So thank you to everyone for all of you. I want to add one thing, which is that I am ashamed not to have gone to my thank you slide, and I really want to thank my fantastic student and friend who made all of those wonderful cartoons. Her name is Jennifer McNichol, and I wanted to publicly thank her for that. Okay, and then also just thanks to the Zoom audience for sticking with us today. And we'll see you again tomorrow. I think there have been about 25 to 30 people who've been in the Zoom at one point or another today, and at least 10 or 15 for most of the talks. So thank you again.
