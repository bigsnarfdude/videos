We consider a holomorphic vector field in the complex plane. And there is, for each point P in the complex plane, we have a vector BP and the complex line. The complex line induced by this vector, and in this way, we have for each point a vector and a complex line generated by this vector. When we consider the differential equation induced by the vector field B, We want a complex curve having these complex lines as its tangent lines. Or more specifically, when we consider a solution curve. We want a curve where each point, if we consider the derivative of the parametrization, is the vector field at the point. Please let me consider an example. Here we have We have two complex, two non-zero complex numbers, and we consider the differential equation induced by this diagonal matrix. Then, if we have a point. A point in the complex plane, then the solution curve passing through this point is this parametrization given by the complex exponential math. Here we have Here we have T in C. In the talk in general, I am going to draw real pictures, something like this, for example. But if we see picture, we could imagine that the behavior of the solution curves around the singular point is. Point is very easy, but really could be very complicated. For example, a solution curve could turn around the axis an infinite number of times, for example. Well, actually, we're going to be able to do that. Actually, we will work with holomorphic vector fields defined around the origin in the complex plane. And we assume that the origin is a singular point of the vector field. And for example, in this case, if we have a holomorphic vector field around the origin, Around the origin, we can consider its power series. Here is its linear part, and here we have the higher order terms. If we assume that we have non-zero linear part, then Poncare proved that under generic Proved that under generic assumptions on the linear part, this vector field is linearizable around the origin. There exists a change of coordinates, there is a biologism defined around the origin. Defined around the origin H, which sends the solutions of the regional vector field to the solutions of its linear part. Then, in this case, we can say that the geometry of The geometry of this linear vector field determines the geometry of the original vector field. But what happens if we don't have linear parts? This is the question. If we don't have linear parts, Linear parts. Then we want to understand the invariance to determine the geometry of the solution curves around the origin. Then we want the invariance to determine. Determine the geometry of the solution curves around the origin except for changes of coordinates, right? To address this problem, please let me introduce. Please let me introduce two different classes of vector fields. One of them is a class of non-decritical vector fields. To introduce them, please let me consider a vector field having a linear part equal to zero. Then, if we Then, if we consider its power series around the origin, here we have the homogeneous decomposition of this power series. Then we consider the first non-zero homogeneous terms of degree n, and here n will be greater or equal to 2. or equal to two. Then using these homogeneous polynomials, we define a new homogeneous polynomial of degree m plus one and we require that this homogeneous polynomial splits into pairwise different lines. Your Pi is different to PL if I and L are different. And we consider additional generic assumptions. And please let me talk about the geometry of these vector fields. And for that purpose, I need to introduce the blow-up of the origin in the complex plane. Of the origin in the complex plane. That is, we have the complex plane, we have the origin, and we remove the origin. And in its place, we put a sphere which represents all the directions of the complex plane. If we consider the vector field in this space, we have. Field in this space, we have the blow-up of the vector field, and then in this case, the sphere is a solution curved except for a finite number of points. These points are determined by these linear factors. They are singular points of the blow. Points of the blow-up of P and the rest of the points of the sphere are regular points for this blow-up. Then I will denote as BBP this class of vector fields, of non-ecural vector fields. Fields of non-equitable vector fields, and here P is the collection of singularities of singular points after the blow-up, right? Now, please let me introduce a geometrical object related with these background fields, namely the holonomy group. Holonomy group. Here we have B in this class. We consider the blow-up of B and then we have the sphere without the singular points. And then we choose a regular point and we consider for each For each singular point, we consider a loop makes turn once in a positive direction and doesn't encircle any other singularity. And then we have a loop for each singular point. Then we consider a transversal to the sphere. A transversal to the sphere passing through the regular point. Here we consider a point and then we consider the analytic continuation of the solution of the blow-up along each loop. Then we have another point in general. Another point in general. This gives us a transformation of the transversal for each singular point. Really, it's a biologomorphism. And we consider these transformations, n plus one transformations, and then Transformations and then we take the generated group for these transformations. This is called the holonomy group of P, but really we can change the transversal or the parameterization of gamma, maybe, then we consider this group except for changes of coordinates. Right? Well, on the other hand, Well, on the other hand, we have a class of the critical vector fields. And again, please let me to introduce them, consider one of them and its power series around the origin. Here, the first non-zero homogeneous polynomial. So, if you change the transversal, you get the change of coordinates, but if you move slightly the path, you don't. Do you refer about the change the loop? Yeah, the part the loop slightly is. And you can move the loop changing by another homotopic. Yeah, and do you get a change in the transformation like this? No, no, no. So the only change comes from moving the transversal, not the representation. Yes. Here we have the first non-zero homogeneous part, half degree n plus one. Half degree m plus one, then since we don't have linear part, m is greater or equal to one in this case. And we in this case, we require that these homogeneous polynomials have a common factor. This factor is A homogeneous polynomial of degree M and we require that this homogeneous polynomial splits into pairwise different lines also and we have Q J different to Q K if J and K are different. And in addition, we want to consider an generic geometrical condition. And to introduce this condition, please let me consider again the blow up of the Blow of the vector field. In this case, we have that the solution curves intersect transversally the sphere, except at a finite number of points. These points are again determined by these linear factors. Linear factors. And we require that the solution curves passing through these points have simple tangency with the sphere. Well, this class of vector fields will be denoted by. Will be the note by Q, where Q is the collection of tangency points. Well, again, please let me introduce a geometrical object associated to each vector field in this class. In this case, given a vector field, we will Vector field, we will have a collection of involutions, m involutions, one for each tangency points. Tangency point here, Ij is defined around in the sphere, but around the tangency point. It is defined in the following way. If we consider a point U close enough to QJ, so M plus 2 is the degree of the homogeneous polynomial. But you wrote the homogeneous polynomial of degree m plus 1. You have here an homogeneous polynomial of degree m. Degree m and you multiply by one, yes, ah, m plus one, m plus one. Thank you. Yes, this is the um the first non-seventh machine's polynomial. Yes, thank you, thank you. Then we have U close enough to Qj in the sphere, and if we consider the solution curve passing through this point, this solution could This solution cuts twice the sphere. And if we call U star the other intersection point, then you send U to U star. Right? Then we have a collection of involution for each vector field. Now we have two different classes of vector fields. I'd like to return. To return to the question about the invariance to determine the geometry of the vector fields in these classes, right? Then we have here. Then we have here the invariance of NLD classification. Well, here we have the class of non-decritical vector fields except for changes of coordinates, and we have the class of decritical fields. Class of the critical vector fields except for changes of coordinates. Here we say that two vector fields are related by a change of coordinates if by definition there exists a biolomorphism defined around the origin in the complex plane, having linear part equal to the identity, and such that. And such that it sends the solution curves of the vector field P to the solution curves of the vector field B tilde. But in this case, it's not necessarily to preserve the parametrization. Right now, this These classes, these spaces of analytic classification were studied by Laura Ortiz, Ernesto Rosales, and Sergei Boronin. And they obtained parametric, a pair of invariants for each class of analytic type. This is given by a parametric invariant and functional variant and functional invariant and for example if we have a vector field as not A vector field, a non-declirtical vector field, then its parametric invariant is an element in an affine space C alpha, where alpha depends only on the number of singular points after the blow-up and the functional invariant, its functional invariant. Invariant, its functional invariant is a holonomic group except for changes of coordinates. On the other hand, if we have a decritical vector field, its parametric invariant is again an element in a defined space and. A SarisQ open subset of an affine space. And here the dimension depends only on the number of tangency points after the blow-up. And the functional invariant here is its collection of involutions. Right? Well. Laura, Ernesto, and Sergei also prove a realization theorem of this analytic invariance. Please let me state a version of this realization theorem. Of non-refilmogens This is a result given by Ortiz, Rosales and Boronin. Even G brackets and I candidates. Candidates for being functional invariance. Then there exists a family of pairs of non-decritical and decritical vector fields such that every pair in the family J realize the The candidates for being functional invariance. In this case, the holonomic group of the non-decritical vector field concise with G brackets and the collection of involutions of the depirical vector field is Is the prescribed collection of involutions. And moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between J, the family, and this complex space. Namely, if we consider a pair of vector fields in the family J, then we consider the irrespective parametric invariance. And this is a one-to-one correspondence. Then we can say that this is the space. Of pairs of parametric invariance of parametric invariance, and then we have identification of this space. Space with the family J using this correspondence. Right? Well, please let me note now that the functional invariance by definition have a geometrical interpretation from. From the vector fields. But on the other hand, the parametric invariants have not a geometrical interpretation in their definition, right? Then our problem was to propose a geometrical interpretation of this invariant. Of this invariance. Please let me talk about this interpretation. Of parametric invariance. Well, I'd like to say that the motivation of this interpretation is given in some constructs. In some constructions obtained by Laura, Ernesto, and Sergei, in order to obtain the analytic classification, the analytic invariance of vector fields. Then please let me talk about this idea. Here we have Here we have, we consider first of all the blow-up of a non-decritical vector field. Here we have the blow-up of a vector field, a non-decritical vector field, and we consider two. To the blow-up of a decritical vector field. We have the tangency points, for example. This is the blow-up of a non-decritical vector field. An on the critical vector fee and we require that the singular points are different from the tangency points. That is, Pi is different to QJ. Right? Then if we consider the If we consider the points where the vector fields are linearly independent, then we have a good coordinate system, for example, like this. But this coordinate system collapses when they are linearly dependent. Linearly dependent, right? Then, in our picture, these points have this form more something like this. For example, but these points are considered. Are considered as a subset of the complex plane, and this set is an energetic curve around passing through the origin. And in the blow-up, we can obtain a picture in this sense. The blow-up of this analytic curve is Is consists of a union of smooth branches intersecting transversally the sphere, one from each singular point and for each tangency point. Then, if we consider this curve in the complex plane, we obtain. Explain: We obtain a curve having pairwise smooth transversal branches, having exactly the singular directions and the tangency directions. As dear tangent, please let me recover this information in a special family of curves. We introduce a family of curved CPQ, which consists of analytic curves around the origin in the complex plane, having smooth branches. Exactly M plus one plus M branches which satisfy that it's their tangent lines. Are the singular directions of the non-liquid vector fields and the tangency directions here? And then we have that if we consider pairs of vector fields. Vector fields, non-decritical and decritical vector fields, then and if the singular points are pairwise different to the tangency points, then the curve, this curve will be called the tangency curve of B and W. This curve belongs. This curve belongs to this class of curves, this family of curves. Well, please let me talk about the analogic classification of this family of curves. In this case, we have this family of curves, except for changes of coordinates. Here, we have two curves. That two curves are related by a change of coordinates. If by definition, again, we have a Have a yolomorphism defined around the origin in the complex plane, having linear part equal to the identity, and it sends the curve C to the curve D. Right? This space was studied by Granger and And we can say that this is a topological space that generically is a Sarisky open subset. Of an affine space of dimension lambda, and here lambda depends on the number of branches of the curves, right? And the word generically means that there exists There exists a dense open subset of the topological space which is homeomorphic to a Zariski open subset. Right? Well, a very important remark for us is the following. In general, lambda is less or equal to Less or equal to the dimension of the pairs of parametric invariance, this space. And if we consider that the number of singular points, this is n plus one, where I am going to write n and the number of tangency points satisfy. Points satisfy one of them relations, then lambda is equal to alpha plus one, alpha plus beta, the dimension of the space of first of parametric invariance. Now, this remark This remark was a very important motivation for us to obtain the following results. Here we have two results: theorem one and theorem two in collaboration. Volume two in collaboration with Laura Orpis. And for these results, we need fix the functional invariance, right? The first result states that under generic conditions. On the collection of involutions, any analytic, any generic analytic type. In the class in the space of an reclassification of curves is realized by the tangency curve of Of a pair in the family J Here, please recall that G is the family which we identify with the space of pairs of parametric invariance. And in this case, we have that. If we consider a pair in this family, then its tangent curve is in this special family of curves. And then we can consider the analytic type of this tangency curve. And the result says that if we Says that if we have any generic analytic type, see a curve under except for changes of coordinates, then we have a description of this analytic type using the tangency curve of a per in the family J. Right? Then we can say that we realize any We realize any analytic type of curve generically using the family J, but really using the parametric pairs, the pairs of parametric invariance. And the second result has this condition. If in addition the number of singular points and the number of tangency points satisfy this of one relations then Then the realization is unique. There is then any generic analytic type type in the class in the space of analytic classification of curves. Classification of curves is realized by a unique pair of vector fields in the family J. And that is, if we have this additional condition, then we can say that we identify the family J. The family J with the analytic types of curves generically. And it's that's the same that to say that we can realize using pairs of parametric invariance, we can realize any analytic type of curve generically. Right now, Now, please let me talk about work related with these results and work in progress. Well, please let me consider again. Again, pairs of non-decritical and decritical vector fields. And again, please pick the functional invariance here. Now we consider changes of coordinates of pairs of vector fields. That is, if we have two pairs. Have two pairs. Then we say that they are related by a change of coordinate if the non-decritical vector fields are related by a change of coordinates. For example, H and The critical vector fields are related by the same change of coordinates, right? And in this case, in collaboration with Laura and Sergei, we obtained the invariance of this space, the analytic classification. This space, the analogy classification of these pairs of vector fields, and they are functional invariants. Then we have an infinite-dimensional space here and we obtain independently of theorem one and theorem two a realization result. Of curves, of types, of analytic types of curves. There is again, if we consider a generic analytic type, this is the tangency curve set for changes of coordinates of a pair, set for changes of coordinates, right? But But the problem is that this space has finite dimensions, and this is realized from an infinite dimensional space. And it's horrible. And then we want to obtain a partition of this. Of this infinite-dimensional space. We suppose this space is here, and we can obtain a partition into finite dimensional spaces. Actually, we want to identify each of them. Each of them with the space of pairs of parametric invariance and in this way from each each Each copy of this space of parametric invariance, we want to realize any analytic type generically of curves in the same way given in theorem one and theorem two. This is a work in progress. And that's all. Thank you for your attention.  Here before considering analytic equivalence, would you consider also topological equivalence? No, but we want to explore this question in the future. Thank you. Another question. So, here you were considered. So here you were considering V and W, two vector fields. So you were like simultaneously putting normal forms for V and W. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, so you were uh parametrized, so you were uh obtaining normal points for V and W simultaneously? Um In the work about the classification, we don't have normal forms. We have the invariance directly, the invariance, which are related with the tangency points, the tangency curves, and some parametrizations of the tangency. Of the tangency curves. But really, to define the family J, we consider the normal forms independently of B and W, the non-decritical and decritical vector fields, but independently. Independently. Yes. Okay. And these tangents. And this tangency curve, the nature of the tangency curve is, do you have some idea? So, so this is the tangency curve between the vector field V and the vector field W. So that's a tangency curve in the blow-up, in the blow-up. And how many components does it have? And is it non-singular? Is it non-singular or yes it's composed its branches are smooth and they are they have transversal intersection with the sphere and they are very very simple really in the global yes you maybe you remember the draw Role about, for example, we have the sphere, and if you have the singular point and the tangency point, then you have a branch passing through each singular point and each tangency point. Singular point and each tendency point and could transversely in the blow-up, yes. And then, when you consider its expression in C in C2, then you have smooth branches intersecting transversally between them, passing through the origin. Okay, thank you. So all invariants that you considered are analytical invariants. So the functional invariants are also analytic invariants. Yes, yes. Only analytic at this moment. Yes. And another remark. So you probably have some universal objects when your blow-up have only Have only second order contact. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it can you relate a situation in which the contact is higher with the sample? Yes, we we yes yes yes okay. It's next next. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any other question? Zoom? No? Ah, Zoom. Okay, so we thank again Jessica and we.
