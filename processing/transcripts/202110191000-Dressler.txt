Okay, so the Zoom is yours. Yeah, thank you, Torsen, and thanks to all the organizers for the invitation to speak here. It's a great pleasure to be at least virtually in Osaka. Yeah, so what's on the agenda for my talk today? So since the audience is really diverse, I spent the first couple of slides. First, couple of slides just setting and recalling some basic context and given some background. After that, I'll really introduce the main actor of today, namely sums of non-negative circuit polynomials and discuss some important properties. And then for this workshop, I'll give an overview about the real zeros of song. Of song polynomials from both the affine and the projective viewpoint. And finally, we draw some interesting consequences from that new knowledge about these real zeros. Okay, so consider you have a real multivariate polynomial and you want to decide if f is non-negative for all x in Rn. So to say, you want to decide. So, to say, you want to decide if f is globally non-negative. This question is a key challenge in real algebraic geometry with a wide range of applications. For instance, in polynomial optimization, in computer vision, control theory, robotics, and so on. But unfortunately, this problem is very hard in general, so if it's multivariate and of degree at least four. Hence, one Hence, one is interested in finding so-called certificates of non-negativity. And these are sufficient conditions that imply non-negativity of a polynomial, but are easier to check than non-negativity itself. And the all-star non-negativity certificate is sums of squares. So a polynomial is called a sum of squares. If there exists other polynomials which I square. Other polynomials which I square and sum up, and then this yields my polynomial. And clearly, if I can write a polynomial as a sum of squares, then I can read off from this representation that my polynomial is non-negative. But it is even better than that because I can check if a given polynomial is such a sums of squares, and I can even find sums of squares decomposition via semi-definite optimization. via semi-definite optimization. So semi-definite programming, you can think of it as a generalization of linear programming, but the most important fact here is that's a convex optimization problem. So this class, or for this class, there are well-known methods where we can solve these problems. But it's a well-known problem that Problem that SDPs, so semi-definite programs, are very expensive. So the corresponding semi-definite programs quickly get very large in size with growing numbers of variables and the degree. And this is often an issue for real-world problems. So in recent years, one tries to overcome this obstacle in various ways. So for instance, one So, for instance, one tries to build better solvents, or one studies the underlying structure like the symmetry or sparsity. But there's also another path, namely to look at other non-negativity certificates. And I mentioned here, for instance, the DSOS and SD source certificates. So, these are, so to say, relaxations of sums of squares. So, one Sums of squares. So one relaxes the sums of squares certificate even further by diagonally dominant sums of squares, so DSOS, and scaled diagonal dominant sums of squares certificates SDSOS. And both of these certificates can be tested by a linear programming and second order programming that is, or that are much cheaper classes. Are much cheaper classes than semi-definite programming itself. But there's also another path which is specifically adapted to sparse settings. That is, when I have a sparse setup, then these certificates really preserve the underlying sparsity of the structure. And this is sums of non-negative circuit polynomials by Illuman and Timo DeWolf and sums of AM. And sums of AMGM exponentials. So the first one is really mainly introduced for polynomials, and the second one was introduced by Chandra Zikaranchon for sums of exponentials, so there are zignomials. But nowadays, we know that we can translate these certificates in each other. And I only want to point out that these certificates, song and sage, Song and sage, these are really independent of sums of squares, whereas the first one is a further relaxation of the sums of squares column. Okay, before now really focusing on sums of non-negative circuit polynomials, I want to set some notations. So usually when we talk about these kinds of polynomials, we want to work over a finite real value. Want to work over a finite real vector space. And in order to do so, we fix the number of variables and the maximal allowed degree of the polynomials. And we introduce the vector space Rx sub n comma 2d as the vector space of real polynomials in n variables of degree at most 2d. And in this vector space, there lives the vector space there lives the set of non-negative polynomials denoted by a pn, 2d. This is the set of all non-negative polynomials and it turns out that geometrically it's a nice convex cone. And inside of this cone there lives the cone of sample squares, sigma n2d. And I already want to point out that non-negativity and being sums of square And being sums of squares is preserved under homogenization. So, if I turn to the projective world, everything behaves nicely, and in fact, many results regarding non-negativity and sums of squares are shown in the projective case. Because later we want to talk about zeros, I also set the notation for a variety of a polynomial. So, a variety is denoted by this. Is denoted by this calligraphic V of F. And this is just the zero set of my polynomial F. And usually I denote the zeros via these small d's. Okay, so now let's talk about sums of non-negative circuit polynomials. And in order to introduce them, I have to start with its building blocks. And these are circuit polynomials. So, what is a circuit polynomial? So, what is a circuit polynomial? A circuit polynomial is a specific sparse polynomial in the sense that if we have n variables, our polynomial only has r plus two terms, where r is at most n. So we can write this polynomial like this, where we have here this separate last term that is a little bit special. And this polynomial has As some specific conditions, which I want to explain via this picture. So, in this picture, there is the support of such a circuit polynomial plotted with these red dots and this blue square. And the first condition is that the Newton polytope of a circuit polynomial, which is just the convex hull of the support, so the alpha j and the beta, this is an R simplex. So, in our example, So, in our example here, it's just a triangle. And you see, the alpha j's are the vertices of this simplex, and this beta lies in the interior. And this lying in the strict interior, we can denote it algebraically via the second condition here, namely, it can be written, so the beta can be written uniquely as a convex combination of the vertices alpha j. Vertices alpha j. And the lambda j here in this expression are the barycentric coordinates relative to the vertices. And then we have the third condition, which has nothing to do with circuit polynomials. This is just a general necessary condition for any polynomial to be non-negative, namely that the coefficients corresponding to the vertices of this Newton polytope have to be strictly positive. strictly positive and the vertices themselves, so the alpha j have to be even. So in short, a circuit polynomial is a polynomial with simplex Newton polytope and one additional interior point. And I already want to point out that the only possible not positive coefficient is the f beta and the only Beta and the only possibly non-even exponent is this beta. That's why this last term is separated because this will really define if the polynomial is non-negative or not. And maybe one word to the term circuit polynomial. So the term is chosen since the support set, so the alpha, j and the beta, this forms a circuit. This is a term. This is a term borrowed from matrix theory, and it means that's a minimally affine dependent set. So this definition seems a little bit abstract, so let me give you an example. In fact, the Motzkin polynomial, which you probably all know to be the first polynomial found to be non-negative but not a sums of squares, this is in fact a circuit polynomial. And I think I could. And I think I convince you rather quickly by just saying this picture here is in fact the support of the Motskin polynomial. So you can easily see that this is indeed a circuit polynomial. So having now these circuit polynomials, we want to decide non-negativity of these polynomials. And the nice thing is that it can be fairly easily done. And for that, we For that, we define for every circuit polynomial a specific invariant, namely the circuit number, as this product. Where you can see in the numerator, we have just the coefficients corresponding to the vertices of this Newton polytope. And in the denominator and the exponent, we have the barycentric coordinates. So, this number can be derived by the initial circuit polynomial immediately. And the crucial fact now is that non-negativity of circuit polynomials can be checked easily via this number. And by easily, I really mean we only have to solve a system of linear equations. And in more detail, the absolute value of the inner coefficient, so the coefficient corresponding to this inner term has to be bounded by the has to be bounded by the circuit number or f is a sum of monomial squares that is also f beta is positive and beta itself is even then we know that such a circuit polynomial is non-negative and this is a result from Zadik Illeman and Timo de Wolf in 2014 in their first sums of non-negative circuit paper and we want to see that now first in action First, in action. So let's pretend we wouldn't know that the Motzkin polynomial is non-negative and we want to test it via the knowledge that's a circuit polynomial. So we now learned we can do this via computing the circuit number and for that we have to determine the barycentric coordinates. Here again, the support picture there we can nicely see that all the barycentric coordinates are one over Barycentric coordinates are one over three, and then we can just plug in everything into the formula for the circuit number and get that the circuit number is three. And then we can use this condition up here, namely the absolute value of the coefficients corresponding to this interior term is three, which agrees with the circuit number. So we can really conclude. So, we can really conclude that our Motzkin polynomial is non-active. Okay, great. And now we can take sums of non-negative circuit polynomials as we also do for sums of squares. And this will give us a certificate of non-negativity. And we abbreviate the sums of non-negative circuit polynomials as song polynomials. And I want to do this a little bit more specific. So we define the set of song polynomials to be C and to D. And the set contains really every polynomial in my finite real vector space, which can be written as a song polynomial. And in fact, this set is again also a convex cone, clearly living inside the cone of non-negative polynomials. Of non-negative polynomials. And if I compare now this cone with the cone of sums of squares, then I can see that these two cones intersect, but they do not contain each other. That is, we have here really a cone which is independent of this sums of squares cone. And a very important result about this song cone is that it is full-dimensional. Cone is that it is full-dimensional in the non-negativity cone, which is really a necessary condition to establish these certificates to be useful in practice. And maybe one last remark, namely, how can I test membership in this cone? Because it better be that I can test membership in this cone more easily than non-negativity. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good for practice uses, right? And I just wanted to say. Uses, right? And I just want to say it can be done by relative entropy programming or, in special cases, via geometric programming. Both are convex optimization problems, so we have methods to solve it. But this is really another story for another day. What we want to do today is we want to know about the real zeros of some polynomials. And specifically, we want to count them. And we also want to look And we also want to look at what happens when we homogenize some polynomials. What additional zeros do we become, etc. Okay, so as a small warm-up, consider again the Motskin polynomial. And the question now is how many real zeros does M have? So this is a polynomial into a very simple. So, this is a polynomial in two variables. It's not very hard to see that the Motzkin polynomial has indeed four real zeros. So, here's a plot, and here you can see that it's nice. They have four affine real zeros. Here's the real zero set. And all zeros only differ in their size, which is the case for circuit polynomials. And And let's first make some small observations. So, by definition, just a monomial square or also the sum of monomial squares are circuit polynomials. But zero-wise, they are rather uninteresting since affinely they only vanish in the origin. So, we call the circuit polynomial proper if it is not a sum of monomial squares. Sum of monomial squares and due to the special structure of a circuit polynomial, we can now determine, given, for instance, a number of variables, from which degree on it is possible to have proper circuit polynomials. And the answer only really depends on beta. So if beta is even or beta is not. So given a circuit polynomial in n variables of polynomial of degree. Of polynomial of degree 2d. We want to say from which degree on it is possible to get such a proper circuit polynomial. And it is like so for beta odd and like so for beta even. And this is rather easily seen since remember that we have this case that beta is inside or lies in the interior of this Newton polytope. Of this Newton polytope. That means all entries of our beta are not zero and they also add up to something strictly smaller than 2d. That is the smallest beta, so to say, such that if maybe a circuit polynomial is in the odd case, that every entry of beta is one. That means it will end up at up to n. So n. Add up to n. So n is strictly smaller than 2d, which leads to this result. And in the even case, now the smallest beta is taking every entry to be 2. So it adds up to 2n, which then gives me this result. So this is, so to say, an observation about the possibility to realize a proper circuit polynomial with a given. Circuit polynomial with a given number of variables in a specific degree. Secondly, I want to point out the difference between constant term versus non-constant term circuit polynomials. So circuit polynomials having a constant term or having not a constant term. And clearly, if we have a circuit polynomial that has not a constant term. As not a constant term, then we have the origin as a zero. But it can also be the case that we have infinitely many zeros. And this is, for instance, the case when we have additional zeros on coordinate hyperplanes. So think about we start with the Motzkin polynomial here and we would multiply the Muttzkin polynomial. We would multiply the Motzkin polynomial by x squared, so to say, geometrically, we would shift the Newton polytope on the coordinate hyperpline. Then clearly we get infinitely many zeros in addition. So this is, so this case appears, so to say, if every outer term of my vertex of my Newton polytope contains the same vertex. Polytope contains the same variable, and since we don't want to really count these types of zeros, we usually restrict ourselves to the real algebraic torus when counting the affine real zeros. And another case that can happen for non-constant terms or polynomials is that we have that the dimension of the newton. That the dimension of the Newton polytope is strictly smaller than the number of variables. And such a circuit polynomial I will call degenerate. So here I brought you an example. So this is a circuit polynomial and this is its support. So the Newton polytope. And clearly here you can see it's a polynomial in two variables, but the Newton polytope is only one dimensional. Dimensional. So, the real issue here is a little bit hidden. So, it's that this polynomial is essentially a polynomial in one variable. And you see here easily that we have also in this case infinitely many zeros. So, we reduce also ourselves to counting the zeros of a non-degenerate circuit polynomial. So, we usually look at So we usually look at circuit polynomials having a full dimensional Newton polytope. Okay, after having made these observations, let's finally count. So we are interested in the affine real zeros of a proper non-degenerate circuit polynomial. So a proper was not a sum of monomial squares, non-degenerate, having full dimension. non-degenerate having full dimensional Newton polytope and we want to count on not on the torus oh we want to count on the torus and then we can see that the real zeros are either two to the n if our inner point is even or two to the n minus one if theta is on. So in particular, you see that this number does not depend on the degree, which is a strong The degree, which is in sharp contrast to previously known results for non-negative polynomials and also for sums of squares polynomials. And here I want to give a little bit of credit. So it was known before that 2 to the n is an upper bound of alpha n real zeros for constant term non-negative circuit polynomials in the original paper by Illiman and Timo de Wolf. But now we have really the actual number. Actual number. And let me briefly show you how one can prove this statement. So, first, you can rather easily convince yourself that for a single circuit polynomial, the boundary of the song cone equals the boundary of the non-negativity cone. Because for a single circuit polynomial, these cones just coincide. Just coincide. Then you can think about that by symmetry, the numbers of zeros really only depends on my inner exponent beta. And every non-negative circuit polynomial has really at most one zero on every orthodox. And the zeros all have the same sign. This can be also deduced by a fact. Deduced by a fact how Iliman and the Wolf showed originally the non-negativity statement for some polynomials since yeah, was there a question? Yeah, just a dumb question. I'm a bit confused. I know I'm missing something. It's an n-variant polynomial. Why are you not having, if it's non-degenerate, why are you not having infinitely many roots? How do you have finitely many roots in R start to the end? If it's not a generator, I would have thought the zero set would be infinite. In fact, yes. This is only the polynomial has only isolated solution. One polynomial over the reals? It's still non-negative. I'm sorry? The polynomial is still non-negative. Yeah. It is non-negative and has only one. Negative and has only one positive positive. And you have a full-dimensional Newton polytope. Okay. I'm sorry, go on. Can I say something? Sure. So in fact, the polynomial, in fact, the curve defined by the polynomial has some singularities which are just isolated point, real point. And some of them, in the first And some of them, in the first case, we have exactly one isolated solution in each order. And in the second case, you have half of the order which contain one, exactly one, each contain one isolated solution. Is this correct? Sorry, Server again. I think I missed something. I mean, your polynomial, which is in the boundary of the cone, in fact, it defines a curve which is a singular curve. which is a singular curve. And in fact, the real part consists only of real isolated points. And in fact, in the first case, you have exactly one real isolated point in each or tenth. Exactly. And in fact, they are symmetric with respect to, you just multiply the coordinates by minus one. And in the second part, the second case, you have exactly half of the ordinance which contain exactly each order. Contain exactly each option contains one isolated point. Exactly. That's exactly the proof outline, so to say. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Nice. My audience takes over my talk. Great. So now we discuss the proof. Other questions, maybe, if we already interrupted? That's not the case. That's not the case. So, with this, we have the number of affine real zeros of a circuit polynomial. And clearly, this also yields results about song polynomials. So, since song polynomials are sums of non-negative circuit polynomials, we can say that if that the sun polynomial is zero, clearly, if every summant of a Of a sums of non-negative circuit polynomial is zero, hence we have to count the common zeros of the appearing non-negative circuits. So we take p to be a sunc polynomial that has a zero and it's or it's a sum of fi's, non-negative circuit polynomials, having the interior point. Having the interior points beta i. And then we know that the number of real zeros of a fun polynomial is exactly 2 to the n if every interior beta is even. And otherwise, it's between 1 and 2 to the n minus 1, whereby this number really divides 2 to the n minus 1. And we can say a little bit more, namely, we know that this number is. Namely, we know that this number is exactly 2 to the n minus 1 if every jth entry of this beta of every beta coincides whether it's even or odd. And this may sound a little bit strange, so I have an example by what I mean by that. So consider a bivariate some polynomial of these with these two summons. Then this is our inner term here. Our inner term here, and the beta, the first entry of these betas is even for both of the circuit polynomials, and the second entry is odd. So we have that the zero set of both of the non-negative circuit polynomials and the song polynomials are equal, and the number of zeros is here too in this case. In this case, a quick question, Marika. So, you assume that all the circuit polynomials share the same singular point, yeah? No, but if you know that, so I assume that f beta, that the polynomial, that the sun polynomial to begin with has at least one. Okay, has a zero. Zero, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Otherwise, it would be not the case. Yeah, and if we take sums of monomial squares into account and all this also degenerate cases, then clearly we can also have either one more zero, namely the origin, or infinitely many zeros in addition. Okay, so that was the affine case. Now let's talk about the production. Let's talk about the projective case, and first of all, we have to make the observation that the property to be song is inherited under homogenization and conversely is preserved when a form is dehomogenized into a polynomial. So, like for non-negative polynomials and also sums of squares, homogenizing behaves nicely with some polynomials. And in what everything that follows, this overline over a polynomial will mean that it's a homogeneous polynomial or a form. And we can say even more, namely the circuit numbers of a polynomial and its homogeneization coincide. Okay, what did we? Okay, what do we do now is we want to count zeros of some forms. And recall that depending on the structure of a polynomial, we may have finitely many or infinitely many additions, additional zeros at infinity, or maybe no additional zeros at infinity. So the task now would be to determine the number of real zeros that additionally appear. Zeros that additionally appear due to homogenizing some polynomials. And I will denote with C bar and plus the n plus 1 comma 2d this cone of song forms in this homogeneous vector space. Okay, so now we want to count projectively. First, again, for a non-negative circuit polynomial. negative circuit polynomial so f is a non-negative circuit polynomial and f bar its homogeneization and then we distinguish between the case n equals 2 and the general case so for bivariate polynomials we have the following so if we have a constant term then the zero set of the form Of the form lies between the zero set of f and the zero set of f plus two. In the non-constant current term case, it's the same, but clearly we can also have this case that we may have infinitely many zeros. And since we did this counting in the affine case, we can even give these bounds explicitly. Explicitly. So, in the constant term case, that means we range between 4 and 6 and 2 and 4, depending if beta is even or up. And for a non-constant term case, we range between 5 and 7 and 3 and 5, again, depending if beta is even or odd. For n larger than 2, we have the following. Here, for a constant term case, Here for a constant term case, the zero set is bounded by lower bounded by the zero set or the number of the zero set of the affine case or and upper bounded by the affine case plus three. And it may also happen that we get infinitely many zeros in addition. And for a non-constant term case, we can only have finitely many up to Finitely many up to two additional real zeros, or then we have infinitely many. So, here in this case, I want to point out that already in the constant term case, we can also have infinitely many zeros. And here in the non-constant term case, we can only have up to two, because if we would have more than two, then we instantly, so to say, bump up to infinitely. Saw the same bump up to infinitely many zeros in addition. Sorry, Marika. And yes, one question. So these additional zeros are zeros of the top homogeneous piece of the polynomial, right? Yeah, yeah. So they're all zeros at infinity. At infinity, right. And so they could appear infinitely many, right? Exactly. This is exactly what happens here. Okay. And you originally allowed this song point or not to. Allowed this song point or not to have negative terms in the boundary of the Newton polytope, right? Where? Negative terms? This beta, these exponents that are somewhat can have negative coefficient in front and can have odd powers, let's say, or not even powers, they can leave on the boundary of the Newton polytope, right? Yeah, sure. No. No. No. No? No. No. So here, because then you can again reduce to the case that it's, so to say, one dimension, lower and a sum of monomial squares. No, no, but I mean what you have sum of circuits and one of them, let's say, has this interior point in the boundary. A point in the boundary of the Newton polytope. Yeah, but that's you can again reduce to a lower dimensional case, right? Okay, let's. I mean, that may happen, but then you can reduce it. So if you would have the beta in a phase, then you can express this phase as your circuit polynomial and the other vertex, so to say. The other vertex, so to say, just as an additional sum of monomial squares. Okay, I see. Okay, Timo also answered in the chat. Yes. Okay, thanks. Yeah, and I just wanted to point out that the proof is done by studying all possible vertex constellations and looking at specific representations of these cases. But I don't want to go into detail. I don't want to go into detail here. And clearly, this number for the non-negative circuits yields also the number of real zeros for some forms. But rather than to show you again these bounds, which not really differ from this case here, I want to show you some examples. So consider the Choilen polynomial. This has this zero set here. As this zero set here, so we have five zeros, and its homogenization has two zeros at infinity. So here I would say that it has two additional zeros. So the zero set or the number of projective zeros is seven. And here's another example. So this is an example in three variables of degree eight. Proper Eight proper non-degenerate, and we have that the number of affine real zeros is eight. And you see that by a homogenization, the form has additionally infinitely many zeros. So the zero set would be infinite. So, may I interrupt you shortly again? There's another question by Frederick Bihan related to the early discussion. So, how can we create a real zero at infinity? Can we create a real zero at infinity? So, can you uh comment on this again now? I understand. In fact, the real zero at infinity, you create them at the at three points, in fact, as you said. There are two points, zero, zero, one and one, zero. Yes, so the reservoir you additional reservoir you create are these two two two two two points with coordinates zero zero one and one zero one. Is this true? No? No, I mean my question is the following. At the infinity, when you restrict your polynomial to the you take the homogeneous part of Heiger degree, you only have monomial of which are square with positive coefficients. No? Because the only monomial with negative coefficients are inside the triangle. So you can get a negative coefficient. You can get a negative coefficient. See this example. Yeah. Sorry? You can get a negative coefficient not at the vertex, as in this example, right? Exactly. So the vertices have to have strictly positive coefficients. Otherwise, it also wouldn't be a circuit polynomial, a non-negative circuit polynomial. Yeah, sure. And so, okay, so yes, I agree. And clearly, by homogenizing, you don't. Clearly, by homogenizing, you don't change this sign, right? So the only negative term you could have belongs to this inner term. I agree. And so you can, yeah, so you cannot add, okay, I see, I see. The only additional zero you get is are these two points, two zeros and infinity, which are zeros one and one zero one. Okay. Okay, sorry. No, no problem. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. Sorry, another question. Either way, so this additional zeros have multiplicities, right? So they are not just zeros of the homogeneous, top-homogeneous power, but they are also somewhat higher derivatives, so it vanish at this point. Is this true? I mean, if you regard them projectively, you basically count lines, right? Yeah, yeah, but like, is there a way like to count this with multiplicities? So this is a singular point of your polynomial, let's say, of your projective hypersurface. And can you maybe somewhat make sense of multiplication? Somewhat makes sense of multiplicity of such a point. Especially in this case, it's basically bivariate form in x1, x2, right? And I wonder if it's or maybe I'm wrong, maybe like one of this point, like yeah, yeah, I think, yes, I missed up. Yeah, so it's it's a simple non-degenerate point, right? Yes. Yeah, because yes, sorry, yes. But maybe you can construct more complicated examples where. Complicated examples where this would be somewhat more degenerate zeros. Like, for example, first derivative, like, I don't know, is non-negative, but second derivative and third derivative are zero at such a point. But I don't know, maybe. Yeah, I'm actually not sure about that. Yeah, we can maybe chat about that later. Okay. Just one second. I think I contradict what I said. So the points with how. What I said. So the points with higher degree are just vertices, right? So the points with higher degree are vertices, and you get just all positive coefficients because they are vertices. I think that Frederic was right. Sorry. So generally, I would now suggest to postpone all non-absolutely necessary questions towards the end of the talk. Go on, Morika. Please. Okay. Okay, yeah, so so much to the numbers of the real zeros in a finite projective case. What do we do with that? So just say why I have to speed up. So finally, I wanted to talk a little bit about these B numbers. So in already before 1980, I think Choi and Lamb, but then 1980 joined by In 1980, joined by Resnick, Choi Lam and Resnick looked at these B numbers: so B n plus 1, 2d and B prime n plus 1, 2d. And this is the supremum of the numbers of real zeros of all forms ranging here in the non-negativity cone and in the sums of squares cone. And I already noticed. And I already noted that the determination of these numbers is quite challenging and still only partial results are known. So for instance, I brought you here the list. So the first two are rather obvious. This number B2, so for binary forms is D, and for quadratic, it's one. But already for But already for ternary forms, they studied them extensively, but also struggled a little bit. But finally, they found out that this number is at least finite for the non-negativity case and can be given explicitly for the sums of square case. But then for quartics, they only gave the number for B44 and B44 and already the case for n plus 1 is greater or equal than 5 is still open. And clearly then for general N and D it's widely open. What happens? So we have this bounding, so we don't really know what happens with, for instance, the B number of non-negativity cone. And inspired by that, I define And inspired by that, I defined the analysis number for song forms. Namely, here I call this now B prime prime in the same way as the supremum of all of the numbers of zeros where this p ranges over the song forms. And the nice effect now is that we can give this number explicitly in all cases. So So here are the binary cases, and this is the case for three variables. And then for everything else, it's basically looking as of which degree on specific cases are realizable. So when can we have proper circuit forms and using the knowledge about the counting of the real zeros. The counting of the real zeros. Okay, by that I want to conclude. So we gave here a complete classification of the number of real zeros of song polynomials and forms and also determined this song number. And in particular, it's always finite and can be given explicitly. What's in sharp tool this non-negativity and the SOS? Non-negativity and the SOS case. And maybe some questions which are now to be tackled is that we, or I would like to use this new knowledge to study the set theoretical difference. So specifically in the SOS case, the knowledge about the zeros is used to study the difference between the non-negativity cone and the sunshine squares cone. And I hope one can somehow use this here too. Here, too. Then, in this paper about the real zeros, I initiated the analysis of the exposed faces of the sun cone, but I only did it in small degrees. So this would be certainly a direction to continue. And yeah, in general, we need definitely new tools to determine these B numbers for the non-negativity cone for the sum of the squared case. Okay, well that thank you for the attention. Well that thank you for the attention. The many, many questions. And here is a short list of the literature. There's many more out there now, two songs. Okay, thank you. Okay, so thank you very much for the talk. So there were already some questions, but now there's a good chance to ask more questions. Maybe a crazy question. Hi, Marika, Maurice. Maybe a crazy question in a slightly different direction. So you very carefully analyzed these sunk polynomials and these combinations of sunk polynomials, but let's go back to circuit polynomials. Suppose you take two circuit polynomials and n variables. Can you say anything about the number of connected components, say? Number of connected components, say. I mean, you spend a lot of time counting roots for certain kinds of song polynomials, but I'm wondering if you can apply the same tricks to looking at a sort of a more fundamental case that's out of reach. I know it's a little bit off the different direction, but it's I don't know if one can maybe, so I don't know if that maybe. I don't know if that maybe relates to amoebas. There is a point of view on this non-negative circuits to amoebas and the components, maybe one can somehow use that to count the components. I mean, the key subtlety is that when you have one circuit polynomial, it's not so bad to determine how many components you're going to have. How many components you're going to have, but then when you have two, then there's a little bit of interaction. And so I thought maybe the interaction could be approached from your song point of view. I don't know. It was just sort of a crazy thought. Definitely an interesting strain of thought. Okay. Thank you, Marika. Very nice talk. Okay. So actually, Kashgari, I'm going to go ahead and Actually, Kashgari also made a comment in the chat on connection of the finiteness of this number as B in some theorem of his, a preview of his. You might have a look at this. So he also sent a link. Are there further questions? Yeah, so maybe regarding Regarding the zeros at infinity, so it would seem to me that the additional zeros that you can get, maybe I'm wrong, but it should always have a very specific form that it involves some extra zeros, basically. I mean, that most of the entries are zeros, is this right? That essentially you need to like add several zero entries. Several zero entries in order to delete terms, as in the examples that you showed. That is correct. Yeah. And but then I was wondering, should you not also there get the possibility to switch signs of remaining entries so that you take a plus or minus one or something like this? Where exactly? Where exactly? I think I don't get. Maybe I got the example wrong. Like in the examples you showed, like the Choi-Lam polynomial. Yeah, let me maybe go there. Yeah, so for example, if I take these first zeros, so can I not just also take an entry zero zero minus one or something like this? Or is this yeah, yeah, sure, sure. But I mean. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. But I mean, um, projectively, that's the same. Oh, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. So you count, okay, okay, yeah, okay, I see, sure, yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, sure. Yeah, I was, I was not sure about like how you exactly counted, but yeah, yeah, okay, I got it.
