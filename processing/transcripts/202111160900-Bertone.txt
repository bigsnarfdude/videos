Thanks a lot for the introduction. Thanks for the invitation. It's too bad I cannot be there in person. Next time, maybe we'll see if that's going to be possible. So my goal today is to tell you about the connections between dark matter, black holes, and gravitational waves. And what I would like to do. And what I would like to do in these 40 minutes is to start with a prologue as a warm-up to discuss what we talk about when we talk about dark matter in general, you know, what we call the dark universe narrative. And then in the first part, I will discuss what we've learned on the nature of dark matter in these 40 years. I'll try to go as quickly as possible on this, but I need to set up the discussion for the second part. Discussion for the second part. Then, the second part, I will move to the connection between dark matter, black holes, and gravitational waves. And I will go back to some of the things that Adam Hoogan mentioned yesterday in his talk. But I will also try to be as complementary as possible to what he said yesterday. So, the first part that I wanted to, the first topic I wanted to touch upon. Topic: I wanted to touch upon briefly as a warm-up, as I said, is this idea, the so-called dark universe narrative. And what I mean with that is that we like to say that 95% of the universe is dark. And that's something you hear at technical conferences and also in public talks and so on. But I feel that this way of phrasing what we know about the universe is About the universe is quite misleading if not properly qualified. And what I mean with that is that this particular cosmic pi, the relative proportion between dark energy, dark matter, and atoms, is really valid only now in the history of the universe and only on very specific scales of distance. And in particular, if you look at a sphere around the Earth, Around the Earth, and you look at the cosmic pi in that sphere, you will see that the contribution of dark matter and dark energy to the matter and energy budget of the universe is actually completely negligible. The universe is essentially 100% made of atoms, you know, if you just draw a sphere around the Earth. If you extend the sphere to include the whole galaxy we live in, then the relative proportion between dark matter And the relative proportion between dark matter and atoms is roughly 72 to 28. And this is actually measured, this is not just a guess, this comes from dynamical measurements of the mass contained in the galaxy and with a variety of tracers around the galaxy and the distribution of variance of stars and gas. Actually, those atoms include both stars and gas. And it's only when you go on very large scales. Very large means larger. Very large means larger than clusters of galaxies, much larger than clusters of galaxies, that you recover these relative proportions 68 and 27 and 5. And so if you're interested in understanding the structure of a galaxy, the fact that the universe is dominated by dark energy on very large scales is essentially completely irrelevant. We live in a viralized system where that dark energy. System where that dark energy doesn't play essentially any role. Similarly, if you look back in the history of the universe, and I think this is what makes it really difficult to insist on this 95% dark universe in general without spacing, without qualifying a bit more this statement. If you look back at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, you know, deep in the radiation-dominated era, the universe was completely the matter, energy budget of the universe. The matter and energy budget of the universe was completely dominated by relativistic species, neutrinos and photons. The later times, every combination, so these are times that we observe directly in the universe as imprinted on the cosmic microwave background. This is just after matter radiation equality. The relative proportion between dark matter, atoms, neutrinos, and photons has changed as relativistic species get diluted very quickly. Muted very quickly, and the relative proportion between dark matter and atoms remains more or less the same, one to five, more or less. The proportion will remain constant throughout the history of the universe. It's only now at this particular moment in the history of the universe that we have this relative proportion when you look on very large scales. And that's just because everything is being diluted by the expansion of the universe, all the matter is being diluted, and you start to pick up this. And you start to pick up this constant energy density, which is associated to dark energy. And if you look far up in the future, eventually everything will be dominated by dark energy. 100% of the universe will be dark energy with traces of dark matter and variants. Now, the reason why I insist on this is that, of course, dark energy. Of course, dark energy is important. We want to understand what is pushing the universe, making it expand ever faster. But if we want to understand the origin of structures and ultimately the origins of ourselves on a planet, on the star, and so on, we need to understand what this dark matter is. It's really a major problem of standard cosmology, the fact that we don't have a clue about what dark matter is. A clue about what dark matter is. So, what is very reassuring about this is that if you take general relativity and just one species of cold collisionless particles, then you can, and if you just put in a supercomputer, like if you just start a simulation of structures in the universe from the initial conditions that we see imprinted on the cosmic microwave background, and it just lets Background, and you just let the universe evolve in the presence of varyings and dark matter, then you recover a universe, this virtual universe that you generate, very much looks like the universe we observe. And this is not just by eye that you see these similarities. All the observables you can think of, correlation paths. Can think of correlation functions when you think about large scales, but also on smaller scales, you know, the shape and type of galaxies, the chemical composition of the universe, it all matches. So I think this, what we get from all this is really that the standard cosmological model really is capturing some fundamental aspect of how the universe came to be. Now, what do we know about dark matter? And I will now. Dark matter, and I will now try to establish the connection between the nature of dark matter and gravitational waves in this talk. But because it's very hard to design as such for something we know nothing about, I will try to sketch some of the properties that we believe that dark matter particles have. And we will talk about the candidates that satisfy these properties. And then we will discuss how gravitational waves can help us probe these different candidates. Now, if you ask the question: can a particle X be the dark matter in the universe? We know that it has to satisfy a number of observation constraints. First and maybe foremost, we have strong constraints on the abundance of these particles in the universe. And we know this abundance on average in the universe with a precision which is of the order of a percent, thanks to cosmic microwave background observations. We know that these particles must be cold. We know that these particles must be cold, and cold can be made very precisely, a very precise statement. It's really a statement about the free streaming length of these particles, so the velocity dispersion of these particles at the epoch of structure formation. It must be neutral, so there should be no charge, no electric charge, no color, nothing that will couple these particles significantly with ordinary matter. It must be consistent with B-Pang nucleosynthesis. With the bank nucleosynthesis, must be consistent with stars. In general, it's very difficult to postulate the existence of particles in the universe that don't do something really bad to the universe, you know, destroy stars, make them cool too fast, or ruin the agreement with big band nuclear synthesis, and so on. And there's a whole another row of constraints that I play here, the constraint, the couplings of these dogmas. The couplings of these dark matter particles with themselves. So, if you study systems like the so-called Bullet cluster, you see that you can set a constraint on the self-interaction of dark matter particles among themselves. You can use a variety of experiments that we call the red detection experiments to constrain the couplings between dark matter and baryons. In particular, what you constrain with these experiments. What you constrain with these experiments is the so-called spin-independent cross-section of dark matter particles of nucleons. And then you have a variety of astrophysical experiments that constrain the possibility that dark matter particles can annihilate to high-energetic particles like photons, antimatter, neutrinos, and so on. There are a variety of probes that can constrain these possibilities. These possibilities. Then there's a 10th requirement in this 10-point test that we devised a few years ago. There is the more of a philosophical point, the fact that it must be at least in principle possible to probe the nature of dark matter, of this particle X, that is the candidate for dark matter. So it should be possible to build a laboratory experiment or at least an IndiVET experiment to test the nature. Experiment to test the nature of these dark matter particles. And as I will argue later on, even if these particles only have gravitational interactions, it might be possible to detect them. Now, you may ask what is left once you add, you put together all these constraints. Well, certainly, none of the particles of the standard model of particle physics is able to satisfy all. Physics is able to satisfy all these constraints. Initially, it was thought that neutrinos, standard modern neutrinos, would be satisfactory, would provide a satisfactory, sorry, would satisfy all these various constraints. But that's not the case. We now know that they are too hot, these neutrinos, to be the same model neutrinos, to be the dark matter in the universe. So they are at most a subdominant component of that matter. And in this Map and in this mind map, a few years ago, we tried to organize all the various ideas that have been proposed to explain the dark matter in the universe in different categories. And I will not go through the whole list of candidates because it would be a bit, it would take too long. It wouldn't be particularly interesting to do this in any detail. But let me just go. In any detail, but let me just go through these major bubbles through these six bubbles that you see around here. The first three are arguably the three classes of candidates that have been most discussed in the literature over the past 40 years. And I refer in particular to the possibility that dark matter is made of light bosons, in particular QCD axins, where very light bosons can go all the way to 10 to the minus 20 electron volts. 20 electron volts, and we come back to this point in the second part of the talk when I connect this with gravitational waves. There is the possibility that a solution to the dark matter might come from the neutrino sector in the standard model of particle physics. We know the standard model of neutrinos cannot be all of the dark matter in the universe, but maybe some sterile neutrinos might explain the dark matter. And then by far, I would say the most discussed. Discussed possibility in the literature is that dark matter has something to do with the so-called weak scale in particle physics. And there are many incarnations of this idea, the possibility that there is new physics in the form of supersymmetry, a TeV scale, or extra dimensions with a pier amount that scale, and so on. And this is the class of candidates that go under the name of WIMPs. We'll come back to this in a second. We'll come back to this in a second. And then it's a bit unfair to do this, but I think, in terms of a number of papers that have been published on these different particles, we can group all other ideas in which dark matter is in the form of a particle, but not in the form of light bosons, neutrinos, or wave scale. Ideas like superfluid dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, wind signals, and so on. Just put them all together here. There is still the possibility that dark matter is made of macroscopic. Possibility that dark matter is made of macroscopic objects, the possibility that dark matter is made of machos or massive compact halo objects, like you know, dwarf stars or planets and things like that, has been ruled out because now we know that dark matter cannot be made of baryons. But maybe dark matter may be in the form of black holes, and in particular of primordial black holes. So this is the we're thinking about the thinking about the uh the the the case where dark matter has been locked the variants that that eventually um would explain the dark matter were locked up inside um inside black holes before big band nucleosynthesis so we can satisfy those constraints by having these black holes collapse very very early in the history of the universe and then there is still the possibility that you know we That a suitable theory of modified gravity might explain away dark matter, so to say, so that we don't need new particles, we just need to be just to play with the gravity sector, understand how gravity behaves on very large scales, and then the dark matter problem will go away. If you ask me, this doesn't sound particularly attractive as a solution for the very simple reason that the universe really That the universe really resembles a universe with, as I mentioned, with GR as a theory of gravity, standard model of particle physics, plus one species of cold collisionless particles. So if it turns out to be an explanation in terms of modified gravity turns out to be successful, it has to be something that really reduces in the limit of the observations that we can. limit of the observations that we can perform to basically GR plus standard model plus cold collisions math. Now, this was a mind map, so there were no physical parameters in it, but something that might be interesting to see is how these different candidates are distributed in terms of their mass. And what I show here is that the range of masses for the various Range of masses for the various dark matter candidates that I've just discussed, they vary over a huge range of masses. They go from 10 to the minus 20 electron volts all the way to 10 to the 70 electron volts. These are 90 orders of magnitude in dark matter candidate mass. I think this is quite striking. And this tells a lot about our ignorance about something so fundamental in the About something so fundamental in the history of the universe. So, you might ask, you know, how do I search, especially with gravitational waves, for something we have no idea of what it is? But the good news is that no matter what dark matter is, gravitational waves can help. And in a white paper that we put together a couple of years ago, we try to organize all the possible searches that we can perform. The possible searches that we can perform over the entire range of masses that I've just discussed from 10 to the minus 20 all the way to 10 to the 70 electron volts. Now, this plot is a bit difficult to digest. I would have to tell you for all of these individual regions what they refer to. So, let me instead show another mind map that hopefully can help understand how. Understand how you know establish connections between these various candidates and gravitational wave searches. And again, in this mind map, I organize the so let's go through only through the major connections, the major hubs. And then if you're interested in the details, you can either take a look at this paper or just ask me questions. Maybe the most obvious connection between gravitational waves and dark matter. Between gravitational waves and dark matter, goes through the possibility that dark matter is made of primordial black holes because we know how to search for black holes. Black hole merges with gravitational waves. Another possibility was discussed yesterday by Adam, environmental effects. So the possibility that dark matter clusters is adiabatically compressed around black holes. And therefore, if we have intermediate or extreme aspiration spiral. Intermediate or extreme mass ratio in spirals that probe the environment of black holes, we can try and test for the signature of this dark matter around black holes. Let me also very quickly mention, we'll not talk about these other full blobs in this scope, but let me just mention that it is possible that through new physics, you will produce exotic compact objects. It can be made of dark matter. Made of dark matter particles or exotic objects in the sense that dark matter can be captured inside of neutron stars. For example, modify the equation of state of these stars and then their signature might be imprinted on the gravitational waveform. Then you can also use these interferometers to perform direct searches for dark matter particles. So you really use the So you really use the interferometers as physics laboratories to see whether these dark matter particles influence the interferometer itself. And then you can test for dark matter also in the form of new physics that will lead to primordial, like a stochastic background of gravitational waves. And there are a number of ideas that centered around non-perturbative dark matter production. Perturbative dark matter production, for example, at reheating after inflation, or in the case of phase transition, cosmological phase transitions. In these two cases, the connection with dark matter would not be very direct and straightforward, but you might find hints of new physics. Then, by studying the new physics, you might learn something about dark matter. I will not talk about these last four blocks at all in this. Or blobs at all in this talk, but if you're interested, feel free to ask. Now, let's go back to what we do in some concrete cases. I want to go back to what Adam was saying yesterday and expand a bit the discussion around environmental effects. You might have heard that for a number of years, for a number of decades actually, we've searched for dark matter in the form of winds, weakened about in massive particles. The reason why we did that The reason why we did that is that, from a theoretical point of view, the mechanism for the production of these particles in the early universe is so simple and elegant that it sounds really very compelling and very theoretically well motivated. The idea is simple. You put a particle in thermal, kinetic, and chemical equilibrium in the early universe through two to two, what? To annihilation process. So, two dark matter particles annihilating the particles of the standard model. And this process can go in both directions. And we will study in cosmology courses how to describe the density evolution of a species which is kept in equilibrium through processes of this type. You write down that the Boltzmann equation tells you how the density evolves with time in presence of an expansion. In presence of an expansion of the universe, in presence of the expansion of the universe, and we learned that the abundance of dark matter is regulated by the so-called self-annihilation cross-section. And we know that there is a freeze-out relative density. So, an amount of dark matter, an abundance of dark matter is left over after this process, this reaction freezes out. And we know that how to connect these red dots. How to connect this rate density with the annihilation cross-section for the self-annihilation cross-section of dark matter particles. Now, for many years, it was been, people considered it to be a striking coincidence, the fact that the cross-sections that are required for this mechanism to produce the dark matter in the universe was precisely indicating new physics at the weak scale, which was exactly the scale at which. Which was exactly the scale at which particle physics physicists, for completely different reasons, were searching for new physics. And this has to do with some of the fundamental problems of the standard model of particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem, the fundamental, the separation in scale between the weak scale and the Planck scale, the corrections, the regulative corrections, the mass of the Higgs, and so on. Now, we've been searching for these particles for a long time. Now we've been searching for these particles for a long time and they were search as head accelerators for new particles at the T V scale. We searched for dark matter particles with underground detectors, so-called direct detection of dark matter. And we searched for dark matter through the products of annihilation or decay of these dark matter particles through the so-called indirect detection strategies. Now, after many Now, after many years, all we have from all these searches are upper limits, or let me put it this way: exclusion plots. So constraints on the parameters of dark matter that take the form of limits in the scattering cross-section versus mass plane in the case of direct detection. So, the fact that we haven't observed events on top of the back. Events on top of the background, of the expected background in these experiments, tell us that for a given mass of the dark matter particle, we cannot have a spin-independent cross-section of nucleons larger than a certain value. In the case of indirect detection, we have constraints in the form of an upper limit on the annihilation cross-section as a function of mass. So, for a given mass, we know that the annihilation cross-section cannot be larger than a certain Cannot be larger than a certain value. Otherwise, we would have seen gamma rays or antimatter or other things on top of the expected astrophysical backgrounds in the various experiments that we used to constrain this parameter space. And this most stringent constraints actually come currently from the Fermi satellite, so from the non-observation of excess photons on top of the astrophysical backbands. And in the case of accelerator strength, And in the case of accelerator searches, we've set lower limits on the mass of these new particles. They haven't shown up in the searches, the precision search experiments that we have performed at the LHC. So, well, this has to be done in the framework of concrete realizations of the WIMP paradigms in the context of supersymmetry, supersymmetric theories, specific models of supersymmetry. Actually, we cannot do this in general. Actually, you cannot do this in general. But for any particular model, you can set lower limits on, for instance, the mass of the neutralino in that particular theory. So I think it's fair to say that there's no convincing evidence for WIMPs, despite many efforts, in any of these experiments. There are a couple of hints here and there that we're not discussing this talk, but if you're interested, we can maybe go back to this in the discussion. Maybe go back to this in the discussion session. So, the question is: Are WIMPs ruled out as dark matter candidates after four decades of searches? And the answer, it is my personal answer to this question, is no. We cannot say that we insert doubts at the order zero. The reason and the argument that I would provide to support this answer. To support this answer, is that the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence, and currently we have absence of evidence, we don't have evidence of absence. We have not ruled out completely the parameter space of winds, not nearly as a matter of fact. From a more technical point of view, I would say that certainly the fact that we haven't seen these particles in accelerators, especially. Accelerators, especially does put pressure on theories like supersymmetry. And in general, these naturalness arguments have been put forward to explain, to connect the dark matter problem with the weak scaling particle physics. However, it's also important to note that still non-fine-tuned scenarios exist, even in the context of simple supersymmetric scenarios. And there are many groups of people who are actually exploring the parameter spaces of these. The parameter spaces of these theories to see what the actual situation is there. The second point I wanted to make is that the WIMP paradigm is not the same as the WIMP miracle. I insisted on the fact that the WIMP, what was referred to as the WIMP miracle, was this funny coincidence or interesting coincidence that the WIMP paradigm, so the type of cross-sections that you needed to explain the dark matter in the universe, turns out to Universe turns out to point precisely at the same type of new physics that people were studying for completely different reasons. But if you abandon the hope of finding the solution to the big problems in particle physics with your dark matter particle, then you can still have these whims freeze out in the early universe with mass scales which are essentially not accessible to the LHC, like tens. HC, like tens of TEVs, for example, and still be perfectly fine as dark matter candidates. So you can have WIMS without having necessarily the WIMP miracle. It breaks a little bit this connection and the fact that they are so theoretically well motivated, but still they're viable dark matter candidates in actions. And in any case, I would argue that even if you don't believe all of this, Believe all of this, and you really think that WIMS are ruled out by these experiments, there's a clear way forward. You know, this still we have a lot of LHC data that will be accumulated over the next 10 years. And the direct attention experiments, I think they deserve to go all the way to the so-called neutrino floor. Some of you might be familiar with this idea. At some point, the sensitivity, once you go a couple of orders of magnitude down in sensitivity, Down in sensitivity, you will start to pick up the contribution that the signal induced in these dark matter experiments induced not by dark matter, but by neutrinos. So neutrino coherent scattering due to neutrinos coming from the sun or diffuse supernova, the diffused supernova flux. So I would argue that it's time to broaden, improve, and diversify searches to exploit astronomical and cosmological observations. And cosmological observations, and because we are here to also exploit gravitational waves as a portal to dark matter. But you see, why I wanted to spend some time discussing this in the first part of my talk, just to convey the message that we really need new probes of dark matter after 30 or 40 years of neural searches. And I think gravitational waves have a huge potential. Sorry, gravitational waves have a huge potential in this case. I want to mention a couple of connections now in the second part of the talk. Now, I mentioned that one possibility is that dark matter is made of black holes, and in particular of primordial black holes. As a matter of fact, this is a suggestion that was made a long time ago, already in the first paper that Hawking wrote on the subject in 1971. There had been already papers about modern black holes earlier by Zeldovich and the American 60. Zeldovich at the end of the 60s, when Hawking was writing about primordial black hooks, he already established a connection with the dark matter problem. And the connection went through an argument on the average density of the universe and an argument about the extra density in galaxy clusters. Okay, so this is the old argument that Speake had made already in the 30s. So I've not spent much time on this, but just wanted to point out that this is an idea that has a very Out that this is an idea that has a very long history really. Also, because of the long history, we had time to explore the parameter space where here on the y-axis, this is the omega primordial black holes. So the relative proportion of dark matter, which is in the form of primordial black holes. So omega primordial black holes over the omega dark matter. So the line corresponding to one in this plot. So, the line corresponding to one in this plot is the case where primordial black holes are all of the dark matter in the universe. And as you can see, this is a plot that was taken by the GitHub repository of Bradley Kavanagh. And what you see is basically that very wide range of masses, ranging from 10 to the minus 18 all the way to 10 to the 3, sort of masses, are basically constraints all over the place. I will not go through these constraints. I will not go through these constraints, but the main takeaway from this is that no matter where you are in this plot, there are very stringent constraints that limit the contribution of primordial black holes to the dark matter to be at most over 10%. In some cases, even below 10 to the minus 2, but certainly below, I would say always below 10% or so. Unless you're in this very small region right above the evaporation constraints. Evaporation constraints, so these are asteroid mass primordial black holes. It is not yet ruled out as a possibility, but it's becoming less and less likely that primordial black holes are all of the dark matter in the universe. And this has important implications for what I'm about to say about the constraints that come from dark matter around black holes, be these black holes primordial or astrophysical in nature. Or astrophysical in nature. So let's talk about dark matter around black holes. Already Adam introduced this topic yesterday. Let me go back and quickly say that we know that black holes live in interesting environments. We certainly know that accretion disks exist around black holes, and we know that because we see these accretion disks now. We can directly observe. Now we can directly observe these accretion disks. And then Adam told you about the possibility that dark matter spikes exist, where dark matter cold collisionless particles accumulate about black holes. Another possibility that is widely discussed in literature is that of gravitational atoms. And I will come back to this in a second. So, in the case of accretion disks, as I say, this is the spectacular image that was created by Image that was created by the Vent Horizon Telescope. This is the black hole in M87 and accretion disk around it. And now, for a long time, people have used that, have made simplified estimates of the type of effects that these accretion disks would have on the gravitational waveform. Now, people are trying to run numerical simulations to capture the rich physics that would appear in these systems. In these systems. This is a paper by Derzhensky and others in 2000 and last year, 2020. And they've argued that they actually studied intermediate mass ratio in spirals in presence of an accretion disk. And they've run a simulation, a two-dimensional, a 2D simulation, and they've argued that you can probe surface densities of order 10 to the 4, 10 to the 6 gram. To the four 10 to the six grams per centimeter square, but that the effect will depend on the details of the accretion disk, it will depend on the mass ratio of the system, on the viscosity on the particular type of accretion disks that you have around these objects, as well as on the Mach number or equivalently the temperature of the gas around the black hole. It really depends on the details of the system, the type of effect that we have. Adam told you about this dark matter. Adam told you about these dark matter spikes around these astrophysical black holes. The idea, as Adam said, is quite simple. You start from a small C black hole at the center of a distribution of dark matter of the type that you get in standard simulations. So it's called Navarro-Frankenwhite cusps, where the density of dark matter goes are like r to the minus one. That seems to be like a generic prediction of these simulations of. These simulations of formation of structures in the universe. And then, if you grow the mass of the central objects on adiabatically, so on very long time scales with respect to the dynamical time scales of dark matter and resistance, then you get another power law for the final profile, which is steeper than the one you started with. And just if you just do conservation of mass and angular momentum, you can directly connect the final slope with the initial. Final slope with the initial one. If you put a one in this formula here, you recover the seven over three index that Adam was discussing yesterday in his presentation. Now, to go a bit beyond what Adam had the time to discuss yesterday, I wanted to ask the question: do we really expect these systems to exist in the universe? Do these spikes really exist? These pikes were initially proposed in the context of. Where we initially propose in the context of the galactics, the black hole at the galactic center, so at Sagittarius A star, our own supermassive black hole has a mass of around 4 million solar masses. And Gondor and Silk argued that because of the adiabatic growth of this black hole, you would go from an initial power-law index of minus one, which is in the outer parts of these plots. The dark matter profile would steepen in presence of the Barcode. In presence of the barco and become this very steep spike that you see up here. However, a number of follow-up studies have shown that these high density of variants around these supermassive black holes, they actually tend to reduce the density of dark matter, they heat up the distribution of dark matter, and the final density after all the interactions with stars and if you also include. And if you also include the self-foundations, tend to reduce dramatically the distribution of the overdensity of dark matter. Intermediate mass black holes seem to be more promising targets for these type of systems, because there are much fewer variants around the systems, and then therefore more clean laboratories for these type of studies. Similarly, you can have, and Adam also mentioned this possibility. And Adam also mentioned this possibility. You can have these overdensities of dark matter around primordial black hole simply because of the formation mechanism of these overdensities. You start from a sea black hole. There will be a turnaround radius. Particles basically will decouple from the Hubble flow. As the universe expands and the universe becomes more diluted, they will start to feel the presence of the black hole. It will turn around. Black hole will turn around and then form bound structures around these primordial black holes. And there are many papers that have explored analytically and also numerically the formation of these overdensities. And the last thing I wanted to mention in terms of growth of overdensities around gravitational atoms, sorry, around black holes is the possibility that if you have ultralight bosons with a quantum wavelength, which is comparable to the size of the black hole. Which is comparable to the size of the black hole. Through super radiance, you can extract mass and angular momentum from the black holes and form large clouds of condensates that are often referred to as gravitational atoms due to their similarity with the electron orbitals around the nucleus. So you can also, this is work that was done by Pippa Cole in Amsterdam, you can compare what kind of densities you get in these different cases. Densities you get in these different cases as around the black hole of a thousand solar masses for specific choices of the parameters of these systems. And here, uh, Pippa has shown the what the density of an accretion disk would look like, what the density of a spike around an astrophysical black hole, the primordial black hole, would look like, and what a density of a gravitational atom may look like again for a particular choice of. Again, for a particular choice of parameters. I can tell you more if you're interested. But the bottom line is that a number of analysis points to the existence of these overdensities around black holes. And I think it's completely obvious and natural that we should search for these environmental effects, as we might learn something about the nature of dark matter in all these cases. Now, what kind of effect, if you want to visualize the effects that these dark matter, Effects that these dark matter has on the mergers. This is the case of one-to-one mass ratio merger, equal mass merger. And what you see is that you start from a highly eccentric orbit. Let me just go back very quickly. You start from a highly eccentric orbit, almost radial orbit, as a matter of fact, for these two dressed black holes. These are black holes surrounded by dark matter particles. Then you see that after a couple of passages, there's a lot. Passages, there's a lot, well, almost an instantaneous transfer of energy from the binary to the distribution of dark matter. This is a case where we sometimes refer to as a dark matter bond. Basically, all the initial, a lot of the initial energy of the binary is transferred to the dark matter clouds, and all these dark matter particles become unbound in these systems. What Adam has shown you yesterday. What Adam has shown you yesterday was a more gentle merger where you have an intermediate or a stream aspiration spiral in a compact object orbiting for millions of cycles around the intermediate mass spirit pole before merging with it. And what he's argued is that the dynamical friction that you get in this case acts as an additional source of energy losses for the binary. Source of energy losses for the binary, and you can search for the trace of this additional energy loss in the waveform. So, this would imprint a characteristic dephasing on the waveform. And this is the work that Adam has presented yesterday. Something equivalent can be done in the case of gravitational atoms. It is well known, there are a number of articles that show that in these clouds, which is essentially equivalent to these electron orbitals. To these electron orbitals around the nucleus, you can have resonances. So, when you have transitions between these bound states, and I see my time is almost up. Is it okay if I take two more minutes and to wrap up? Show me yeah, so John Franco, whoa. Yes, Jean-Franco. Okay, thank you. I'll just take two minutes to wrap up so that there's time for some questions. So in this case, we have a different type of energy losses. So in the case of accretion disks and spikes, collision spikes, this is the standard dynamical friction that you have whenever there is a massive object moving into a Moving into the distribution of matter. This is the old Chander-Sega formula in the case of collisionless matter, and then there is the equivalent formulation in the case of Gans. Here the transfer of energy is a bit more subtle because it's an interaction between a massive object with a quantum object, basically. But you can think in analogy with the so-called photoelectric effect when you have a photon that is interacting with. Photon that is interacting with an atom, and then the electron can jump between different energy levels or be ionized to infinity. And also, in this case, you can compute the probability for the transition between bound states or the transitions to continuum and derive and compute the energy losses. So, instead of energy losses by dynamical friction, you have these energy losses by Have these energy losses by ionization, and this ionization, these additional energy losses, can be dramatic. Really, they can be two orders of magnitude larger than the energy losses by gravitational waves. So, if these objects exist, we should be able to search to find evidence for these systems or to rule out their existence. So, the last thing I want to So, the last thing I want to mention: this is my last point I want to make, is that it is important, and I guess some of you are involved in searches for primordial black holes, with present and future interferometers. It is very important to search for primordial black holes, even they cannot be all of the dark matter in the universe. And there are a number of ideas, for instance, the search for sub-solar, sub-solar mass black holes, or the detection with the Or the detection with the Einstein telescope of 100 solar mass black holes, a very large bedship, you know, bedship of 40 or so, or searches for radio, characteristic radio signature with a square kilometer array. But the point I wanted to make, and again, this is the last point I wanted to make, is that if you can prove that primordial black holes exist in the universe, then we can actually rule out entire classes of dark matter. Classes of dark matter candidates. Even if these objects cannot be all of the dark matter in the universe, and therefore dark matter must be something else, if we observe one of those, then we can rule out the possibility that, for instance, that dark matter is made of WIMPs. And the argument is basically that if you observe a primordial black hole with a gravitational wave experiment, you can have an estimate, especially if you measure a handful of these objects, if you observe a handful of these objects. A handful of these objects. Then you can have an estimate of the average number of these objects in the universe. We can compute how many dark matter particles would accrete around these objects in the universe. And we can use the non-observation of gamma rays, well, an excess photons on top of the background to constrain things like the annihilation cross-section versus mass of dark matter particles. And this is the line that you would get in this plot if you observe. Get in these plots if you observe one event with the Einstein telescope, or if you observe 80 events with the merger of Pimoda-Black and the Redshift, the larger than 40, you can see that you can rule out vast regions of the parameter space with these type of arguments. This is the full plot, which is a bit busy, so I just showed a simplified version of it. But if you're curious, I'll be happy to come back to this. So, conclusions, this is a time of This is a time of profound transformation for dark matter studies in view of absence of evidence, though not evidence of absence, I've insisted on this point, of popular candidates. Gravitational ways offer new opportunities to probe dark matter, and I'm really happy that you're here today to discuss this together. It is clear that we need to bring the communities a bit closer. We realize that some of our predictions are still far, in particular from the level of accuracy. From the level of accuracy and precision which will be required to compare the waveforms with the actual data. And since this is a data science kind of oriented meeting, I wanted to mention that we've been working on speeding up the searches and the statistical inference in these exotic models because due to the higher Because due to the higher dimension of the parameter space, you have all the parameters of standard GR in vacuum, plus on top of it, all the parameters that describe these dark matter systems. Then we need to be smart about how we generate the quake forms. And in particular, I was hoping that we would be able to present some of our latest results on the surrogate models that we have built for the generation of these exotic waveforms. Unfortunately, the PhD student who was supposed to present this is Was supposed to present this is sick this week. So we're gonna have to do this another time. But anyway, thanks a lot for the opportunity to talk. And if there are questions, I'll be happy to answer them. Thank you very much, Jacob. Any questions? In the room or either in the Zoom room? Yeah, we have a question a moment. Okay, thank you for your talk. Is there any kind of effect on a gravitational wave coming from these gravitational atoms, like a binary of gravitational atoms? Atoms? Yes. So let's see. There are a couple of things that one can do. So one is there is a faint gravitational wave emission that comes from the cloud itself, which is a rotating cloud and can emit gravitational waves. The one, the event, the The observables that we focused on more are systems where you have again an intermediate or a stream aspirations pyramid. I went quite quickly on this on this slide, but you can think about the system in analogy with what happens when you have a photoelectric effect. Effects. In that case, you have this electromagnetic perturbation. So you have an incoming photon that causes the ionization of the atom, right? You know, you can basically, the energy of the incoming perturbation is transferred to an electron that can be ionized from the atom. In this case, the origin of the perturbation is the forcing induced by the secondary object. Okay, so this secondary object, which is Okay, so this secondary object which is merging with the central one with these clouds around it is pumping energy in the system, and this energy can be used by the clouds to transition to a more energetic level. Or when the energy and these jumps that you see in the energy losses in this plot correspond precisely to that, you're opening up new channels basically as you continue to pump energy. You increase the frequency, increase the energy of the forcing. At some point, you can. Of the forcing at some point, you can trigger transitions to the continuum, so you can really unbound transitions from bound to unbound states. And what this is showing is the additional energy losses on top of gravitational radiation that are suffered by the binary. So, when you describe the binary, you describe a system which is losing energy through the standard emission of gravitational. The standard emission of gravitational waves. But on top of that, you have these additional energy losses that are very characteristic. They exhibit this large discontinuity, these big jumps, which are due really to the quantum macroscopic quantum structure of the system. And these energy losses can be very large. So, in principle, if you do like a standard template-based search, Search, you might miss completely these systems because the waveforms for these systems have nothing to do with the waveforms of GR in vacuum. The defacing is so extreme that you might completely miss them unless you really search for this particular type of events. Good, thanks. Any other question? No. Okay, Dian Franco, thank you very much again. So let's thank our speaker.
