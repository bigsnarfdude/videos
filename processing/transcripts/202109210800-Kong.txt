Thank you. So, in my first talk, I discussed the application of bird diffusion one categories in the study of two plus one detoplov phases. So, in this talk, I will give an overview of another application. More precisely, I will show the appearance of the braided fusion two category in the so-called three plus one detorical. Previously, it's two plus one d now, three plus one d okay. So, I will show also show the So, I will also show the appearance of enriched fusion one categories in 1 plus 1D gapped and gapped phases, including 1 plus 1D CFT and the semi-street protected topological phases, also called SPD orders, and the semi-street breaking phases. Okay, a lot of things. Hopefully, I can do it. All right, first I want to make a claim is that the topological defect in the 3 plus 1D topological orders form a non-degenerate burial fusion two categories. Okay, that's a prediction in physics. But the notion. Physics and but the notion of birded fusion tool cataloging was introduced only in 2018 by Douglas and the Reuter. They have a wonderful paper on this. So I suppose people are not so familiar with this, but the only thing I need is some very special examples. This example is a non-degenerate bird diffusion tool category come out of a dreamfield center of 2VAC Z2, Z2 created 2VAC. You compute a dream field center, you got a bird diffusion, actually, it's not degenerated body diffusion to category. It looks like a following quiver. It contains four simple objects, one and one T and M and M T. Okay, there are four simple objects corresponding to four defect lines leaving in the three-dimensional space. On each On each object, the amorphism category is given in this quiver. Okay, you can see explicitly there. And the fusion rules are given by m times times m equal one and blah blah blah. Okay, the most important fusion rule is this one. Okay, I'm going to tell you how to recover the fusion rule from the lattice model. So you're going to see this fusion rule again in later slides. Later slides. Okay, so I will show that the non-degenerate per diffusion two categories describe defects of co-dimension two, three, four in the three plus one D tar code. Does not include co-dimension one, okay, only co-dimension two, because co-dimension two defect can be braided. Codimension one cannot be braided. So that's why I start from two, two, three, four. Okay, so the four simple objects are four simple, two co-dimensional defects because this is a three-dimensional space. Because this is a three-dimensional space dimension, a spatial dimension is a three-dimensional so two-dimensional codimension two just means strings, strings in the space. Okay, so therefore, I will also call them one string, which is trivial string, and one T string and M string and M T string, respectively. And the one morphism are three codimensional junctions between two strings. In particular, In particular, the object in the HAM11 are particles because one represents the trivial string. And the junction between two trivial strings is just ordinary particles. And the two morphism are four codimension defects. So these are again instantane in space-time. All right. So let's move on to the 31D Tor Code model. These models It's defined on a QB like this, okay, three-dimensional cubic lattice. And the total herbal space, the total herbal space is a tensor product or local herbal space. But the local herbal space are only associated with one cells. Okay, only associate with one cell. Each one cells, we assign a local herbal space, which is again C2, again C2. Okay, very simple. And the Hamiltonian, what about Hamiltonian? Hamiltonian tells you how the local, the microscope. Tell you how the local microscopic degree of freedom, how they're interacting with each other. Okay. So now it's very similar to the previous case. You also have two terms. Why is AV and BP? AV is defined for each zero cells, and BP is defined for each P is BP is defined for each two cells. It's the same as before. But now BP operator is the same as before because Same as before? Because on each two cells, you also associate with four ages, like this P, two cells. It has four boundaries: five, six, seven, eight. Okay, they associate four local hub space. So the BP operator is same as before. It's a sigma Z, defined by sigma Z. This is again polymatrix. But A V operator have a little, is it slightly different from the previous one because for each vertex zero cell, now you associate it with. zero cell now you associate with six uh six one cell one two four three four five six okay so now uh so it's a similar right so you you define a b as a sigma x one sigma x two is a tensor product okay because each sigma x acting on a different local herbal space okay so it's a tensor product okay again a v operator commute with bp operator okay and they Okay, and they commute with each other as well. Okay, AB commute with E V. Okay. All right. Okay. Looks still similar. All right. So the E particle at the vertex V0 corresponding to the eigen space that all BPAV acts on as plus one, except a single AV0 acting as minus one. So that's the E-particle. It's the same as before, the same as. particle is the same as before the same as huricle model so one single a v have an eigenvalue minus one everything else every other bp and a v operator x and plus one so that's the e particle okay same as before naively as in the 2d case you might also expect that bp x minus 1 on a particular two cell defines the m particle right that's what we have in the in the lower dimension torical model but in three dimension it's there In three dimension, there is a new thing happened. Because the constraint, if you multiply BP operator along the cube, along the cube, there are six faces, right? Six two cells. If you multiply them, they always give you one. This give a constraint. This constraint implies that there must be even number of two cells, P in a cube, such that B P equals minus one. What does this mean? This means that if this, look at the picture. I don't know how. Picture. I don't know how to highlight it. If you have, I highlight one two cell as blue one. Okay, if one of the blue one is BPX as minus one, there must be, there must exist another two cell in the same cube, such that bpx minus one, because because the total bp on a cube is equal to one. So there are only even number of bp equal to minus one. So that means once, so this. So that means once, so this, you that means this thing cannot stop. Okay, so once you have a blue two cell on which BP X minus one, there should be another one on the same cube, X minus one, BPX minus one. Then, as shown in this picture, so this thing cannot stop. You either get an infinite long string or you get a loop. Okay, so that's the correct. Okay, so that's the correct topological excitation is M string. It's not M particle anymore. This is a new thing in three-dimensional. Okay. All right. How about the other two strings? Yeah, I'm going to construct another two strings. So the 1T string is the following. Along the dotted line in the cubic lattice, on the cubic lattice, you have this dotted line. On this doted line, I require. I require the local herbal space to be one dimension on this dotted line. Every one cell living on this dotted line have associated the Hubble space is one dimension. Then there is no AB operator on this line, on this doted line. Okay. And the BP operator, if the BP have some overlap with dotted line as one of these age, like I show in this picture, there Because Dolti line, the local hero is a C, there is no polymatrix that can live in there. Okay, so you only have three polymatrix to define the BP. Oh, I'm missing a Z as a typo. Subscript Z. All right, so this defines a 1T string. And the M string next to the 1T string fills into an M T string. So M T string is nothing but the So, MT string is nothing but the fusion product of M and 1T. Okay, now you got four, four strings. Okay. All right. So for this 1T strings, you can, this is dotted line, right? But now it's free to stop them. Okay. I draw two endpoints of this doted line, label them as X and Y. So X and Y can be viewed as. So X and Y can be viewed as a domain wall from one T string to a trivial string. Trivial string, just one string. Okay, just trivial string. Okay, so Y become a domain wall. Okay, now trivial domain wall. Okay, depends on orientations. And you can show very interestingly in this picture, if you look at it from far away, this X and Y fuse into one particle. If you look at from far away, X and Y become very, very close. Come very, very close and look from far away. They're just a single particle on the trivial strain, but that's just an ordinary particle. And you can show explicitly that this fusion rule, the following fusion rule. And one, one, one, one, one is nothing but a trivial particle in the trivial string. So just trivial particle. And E particle is the particle we defined before. It's this one. Okay. It's the E particle here. Okay. You have this interesting fusion rule. All right. All right. You can have more. For example, on this one T string, on this one T string, you can associate an M loop circled around this one T string. Now you shrink this one loop. It become a particle on the 1T string. It turned out that this particle is not trivial. So I will call this particle Z particles. Okay, this is called the Z particles on the 1T string. On the one t string, okay. I always define the trivial particle on the on the one t string as one one t. Okay, that's that's normal thing, okay? All right, all together, what do we got? We got the following thing, okay? So let me summarize. Let's look at the second, the quiver in the second line first. Okay, you have one triple string, and on the triple string, you have a triple particle, and you have the E particle, okay? And you have another string, one T string, on the one T string, you have a triple particle. On the one T string, you have a triple particle and the Z particle, the Z particle exactly just we defined in previous slides. You also have X and Y, which give the domain wall between the ones a triple string and the one T string, X and Y. The other quiver is similar, just can be obtained by simply by fusion rules. You can get the others. Now you compare with the quiver, which defined the two category. find the two category of of this two category the dream field center of the two back z2 which is given on the top quiver and you can compare them this exactly same because look the e particle exactly is exactly the non-trivial uh z2 representation one-dimensional representation and the z particle is exactly the non-trivial object in the back z2 and x is the only simple object in this fact and and y is the y is a simple object in Is that why it's a simple object in this category of one back and so on, so forth? Okay, so you can see that so in this way we completely recover this two category, this two category, the dream field center of two back z2. Okay, all right, that's the two category level. Now I want to talk about the fusion rule. I'm not going to show you all the fusion rules. The M tensor Amicus. The M tensor M equal to one, that's pretty trivial. You can see that very trivially. Only not trivial one is this one. One T string fused with one T string give you a superposition of two one T string. It can be shown directly from the lattice model. But I feel like maybe I shouldn't say too much about this. Unless some people ask me how to see this fusion, maybe I can answer this in the question sections. In the question sections. This slide just shows you that it can be checked from the Torquo model explicitly to realize this fusion rule. I'm not going to explain the detail here. Okay. All right. So I will not give the complete story, especially the breeding. I haven't talked about the breathing yet, right? But the breathing is a little complicated, which needs perhaps an hour talk to explain. But I think that what we have already explained is enough for the audience to get some rough idea on how the Some rough idea on how the categorical structure appears in a lattice model. So let's jump directly to our conclusion. So the defect of co-dimensional 2, 3, 4 in a 3 plus 1 deterical model form the non-degenerate bird diffusion 2 category, which is exactly the dream field center of 2vax Z2, Z2 gradient to 2 vector space. All right. Okay, this is just one concrete example. There are more you can do. more you can do uh this torque called model realize so-called the z2 topology order uh for more general three plus one d top low order we have the following classification results it says that uh three plus one d top load order with only bosonic particles are all digoral witten series they can be realized by the dream field center of the two vac uh g-gridded two vector space twisted by a forkl cycle um okay uh can i ask a question yes so Yes. So, does this mean that you have some kind of theorem that says that if a fusion two category looks like Z of 2VEC Z2, that it actually is? Like, do you have, can you exclude things that look similar, but are actually not the same? Like, if you have the fusion rules on the braiding, does that mean that you have it exactly? Or, like, how much exactly I have it exactly. The fusion rule and the breeding were corresponding to this exactly. Yes, but is that in is that all the structure that you have in this? I mean, maybe you have some analogues of F matrices, maybe you have like some more stuff. I'm not, I'm just, yeah, fusion, you have a monoidal structure, you have a breeding structure, you have a rigidity, you have all kinds of that kind of things, and you have a non-degeneracy aspect. Kind of things, and you have a non-degeneracy as well, uh, breeding non-gegency as well, yeah. So, for example, in the in the previous state, like here I have an omega in H4. So, in the previous statement, like if you go up one slide, uh, so it means that you have computed this omega in this particular case, and that it's, I see, turned out to be trivial in this case. Omega is trivial, one, I see, yeah, thanks. Thanks. Yeah, I'm just showing the slides that there is something that can be done in the Brady Fusion 2 category, and some of them have physical meanings. That's all. Yeah, so actually, before I move on to the discussion of the Gablis boundaries, I think it's a good time to pause for questions. So any questions? So maybe I can ask one. So here, so in this one dimension up, you get, there seems to be some special thing happens that you can only have. Be some special thing happens that you can only have groups. There is one dimension lower, you could have more complicated, yeah. Is there some you're talking about this results? You're talking about this classification results, right? Yeah, well, you see them there, right? So this theorem is, I say, with only bosonic particle, it just means if the breathing diffusion two category, non-degenerate breathing fusion two category, set of thorny. Saturday throwing property, the harm one one is rapid G. If the HAM11 is rap G, then it has to be Daguerre-Wechen's theorem. It has to be the dream field center of a two-vac G omega, nothing else. That's the mathematical statement of the theorem. Rigorously proved by Johnson-3. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. All right. So let's move on to the GABA. So let's move on to the gavelist boundary of a 2 plus 1D topological order. So the Gablis boundary of 2D plus topology order or 1 plus 1D CFT, it doesn't matter what it is, the following picture always works. The following picture show a 1 plus 1D wordsheet. Either a 1 plus 1D conformal sphere theory or gapless boundary of 2 plus 1D topology order because the boundary is 1 plus 1D. D top out order because the boundary is one plus one d. Okay, so this worksheet. Let's see what's on this wordsheet. On this observable on this wordsheet, uh, contain the following things. The first one is a unitary rational CFT VOA, okay? If the boundary is chiral, if it's non-chiral, it's a full-field algebra if the boundary is non-chiral, okay? The F is V is called a symmetry because I assume the V is transparent on the entire one plus one. Transparent on the entire OnePlus Only worksheet. Okay, V is entirely transparent. Okay, that's one of the data. Another data is called the topological defect lines. So on the worksheet, you can always have this configuration of topological defect line. They are labeled by ABCs in certain set S. And MAB are space of defect fields. They have OPE among themselves. For example, MAA have OPEs. MAA have OPEs and you can also fuse MAB with MBC to get MAC. So that's another OPE type, OOE, okay? And also you can fuse horizontally to defect line, okay? Horizontally. So altogether, all this MAB and the label of topology defect line form a so-called enriched fusion category. It is enriched in the mod B. The reason for that is this. The reason for that is this: because V is completely transparent. So consider V is a VOA. Then you can see that V acts on MAB in a two-dimensional way, right? Independent how you act on MAB. You can let it X on MAB from left, or you can circle around this MAB 100 times, then X on it. Then it makes no difference. So, this is exactly the definition. So, this is exactly the definition of the module BOA. In some sense, the E2 module, in some sense, okay? But that's the Euro definition of model V. So, that means MAB are living in the model V. Not only that, because V is completely transparent, all the OPE are also respect the V actions. So, as a consequence, all the OPEs catch by the data, catch by the morphism living in mod V. In mod V. So, as a consequence, we obtain an enriched fusion category, and S is nothing but the labels, okay? But the labels, so it's also the underlying category is S enriched in mod V. Okay, so the enriched category, just the relation is just given by this MAB, just internal homs, essentially. All right, so this picture always works. Okay, as a consequence, that the way of Okay, as a consequence, we obtain a classification of gapped and gapped boundary of 2 plus 1 d top log order described by a pair. C is the model distance category and small c is the chiral central charge. They're classified by the following pairs. V is called the local quantum symmetry. It is unitary rational VOA of a central charge C for chariot gap distance boundary. It is a unitary rational full-field algebra of that chiral central charge. Um, of that chiral central chart for a non-chiral gap-based boundaries, okay, and uh, moreover, it why I said why I include the gap because you can you can let V equals C, that's the trivial VOA. It turned out that this trivial VOA described the gapped boundary, okay? S is a fusion category, unitary fusion category, equipped with the braided equivalence, okay? Equipped with a braided equivalence, all right, as a consequence, so these. All right, as a consequence, so these enriched category can be obtained from this phi, this birdie equivalence of very so-called canonical construction. But here, I should cite, maybe I should cite Morris Galt's paper with also his collaborative penny. I forgot to cite the reference here. I should, yeah, sorry. Well, one interesting theory I want to say is, I want to mention is that this. I want to mention that this enriched the category also has a dream field center. That dream field center is precisely the unit remote sensor category described by the bulk. So that means that's exactly the mathematical theorem corresponding to the physical results saying that the bulk is always the center of the boundary. Okay, so you can see how this enriched category enter the picture. All right. Now I want to say that this picture works for OnePlus 1D worksheet. Works for one plus 1D worksheet, regardless if the system is gapped or gappless. Because look at this picture, you always have the topological defect lines, and you always have this physical configuration. So if the system is gapped, V is a still so-called some kind of local quantum symmetry, which is very different from a gap in a gapped cases. It's not a VOA anymore, it's something else. I'm not going to mention what it is. Okay, so we will just first ignore it and focus on other data instead. It and the focus on other data instead. So, regardless, the system is gapped or gappless. You always have this MAB defined topological defect lines. You have a bunch of labels, they form an enriched category. Enriched the fusion category, I would denote as the BS. B is just a base category or background category, whatever. And the hum of this enriched category is given by MAD. I will call this enriched category the topological skeleton of the phase. Skeleton of the phase. Okay. When B is nothing but the dream field center of S, then this phase is normally free because the dream field center of this enriched diffusion category is trivial in this case. Okay. That means it does not have a further bulk. So this one plus one D system is already anomaly free. It does not live on the boundary of a non-trivial bar. Bulk non-trivial bulk. Okay, the block is trivial. So it's well defined on the 1 plus 1D. So it's called anomaly free. All right, now I want to give you an example. How this thing really comes from examples. So before I do that, I want to mention that in 2020, my collaborator, Haojiang, and I proposed a description of the topological skeleton by in which the fusion, maybe higher category, work for all quantum phases, including semi-should protected and enriched topological orders, semi-should breaking phases. Orders, semi-sheet breaking phases, and the gappy phases. Okay, so it's a very bold, grand proposal. Okay, but in particular, for concrete cases, for example, a topological skeleton of 1 plus 1D SPD order with unsettled semi-g is given by enriched category of the Reg G in reached in the dream field center of Reg G in a canonical way. Okay. So in the rest of my talk, I will check the validity of this statement. I will check the validity of this statement for G equals Z2 via the so-called one plus one D icing models. You see, after we have the proposal, we want to check all the known physical models. The first one, you don't need to check zero dimension because zero dimension, there is no summon dynamic limit. There's no non-trivial phases. Only thing you can start from the one dimension. Start from one dimension, the simplest one is. Mentioned the simplest one is GQZ2, and that's the famous Ising model. So, let's look at what happened in the Ising models. This is funny thing: in the ICI model, no one checked the observable in the long wavelength limit of 1 plus 1D icing model before. So our proposal is that in the long wavelength limit, observable in these kinds of models always form an enriched fusion category. So that's the proposal. And we want to check it for. Proposal, and we want to check it for icing models, see what's going on. So, let's record this one plus one D icing model. It's just a 1D chain. Okay, it's also called an icing chain. You have a local Hugo space defined on each integer. Okay, on each integer, there is a site. You assign a local Hugo space, which is Z square, a C square. Same as before, C square, two-dimensional complex vector space. Um, compass vector space, and you tensor them together, okay. Now you have a Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian contains two terms, okay. And B and G are copying constants, so they're just constant. I'm going to talk about the B and G later, just numbers, okay. And X, I, and Z are polymetries again, okay, same polymatrix. They anticommute. This is the only thing you need to remember. And this model has a global Z2 onset symmetry, which is defined by tensor product of all Xi on all sites. Xi on all side on all side is called u. It's a it's a it's a symmetry because you commute with Hamitonia, so it's a symmetry. All right. Before I let me take a look at the time. Oh, I still have a lot of time. Okay. Okay. So I can slow down a little bit, maybe. Yeah, so the Z to answer symmetry means it's the commutative Hamitonia. You can see very easily. see very easily uh x i commute with x i that's no problem for this part um this part contains two terms z i and z i plus one uh x i commute with uh x i anti-commute with zi but xi plus one anti-commute with zi plus one so altogether x commute uh this u operator commute with the uh zi times zi plus one okay so so u is the same entry All right, before I analyze, before I analyze the lattice model, I have to introduce a new language. Look at this picture again. Okay, look at this picture again. Remember the topological skeleton of sometime we call a quantum liquid phase because I don't want to include something called a fracton, very strange new quantum phases discovered in physics. I don't want to discard them. I don't want to discard those cases. I only want to. I only want to, so this is called the those phases of fractal are called the non-liquid phase. So I'm only focused on the liquid phases. Let's ignore the detail of the physics. But anyway, so the whole picture still remains the same, but I want to give a different interpretation in order to use the new interpretation in the lattice model. Because in the lattice model, it's hard to see what's a topological defect line, what they are. Okay, so I want to introduce new language. First, the object S. First, the object S, these are topological labels of topological defect line, right? From space-time, this is a space-time point of view. If you look at the spatial point of view, they are just particle-like excitations, okay? Particle-topological excitations. Remember how we define the anion or topological excitations in 2 plus 1 detorical model. If you remember my previous talk, You remember my previous talk, these particles are defined by super selection sector of state. Okay? So the particle defined a super selection sector of state. So now I'm going to use that. Okay, I'm still because in the Latin model, the super selection sector of state is more convenient. Okay, it is defined as an invariant subspace under the action of local operators. If you require a symmetry, then I have to add a symmetry. So the local operator. The symmetry. So the local operator has to be symmetric respect to the symmetry. Okay. Okay. Oh, sorry. The object of B, I also need to translate the object in B to a new language in order to do it in the lattice model. So what is the object in B? Remember, the object in B are those things, are those either field or observable living in MAB, okay? Living in MAB, okay. So, uh, MAB are object in B, right? But what these are, uh, what this MAB? Consider this uh VOA case. In the VOA case, you have a chiral field immediate in V, okay? V is a VOA. That's shipped to the CFT story so that we can gain some intuition. A chiral field living in V is a local field. A defect field living in MAB are not. Leaving in MAB are non-local fuel. Why it is not local? Because it cannot leave alone. It has to associate, it has to be an endpoint of a long string. Okay? It cannot leave alone because they have a branch card, have market values. So it has to associate, it must be an endpoint of a long string. So it's a non-local operator. You can view that as a non-local operator. So all M, A, A, B are non-local operators. As a consequence, I'm a As a consequence, I'm going to introduce new language. An object in B is a topological sector of a symmetric, if there is a symmetry, operators. There's an unconfined. I'm going to tell you what the unconfined is in the later slides. Okay. So it's a symmetric topological sector of a symmetric operator, which is defined by a subspace of the total herbal space, sorry, the subspace of all operators, potentially non-local, okay? Potentially non-local, okay, invariant under the action of local operators. You need to add a symmetry if you require a symmetry. Okay, so now I do the translation. So that means later on, I'm going to looking for the super selection sector of state and topological sector of operators in the lattice model. Okay. All right. What are they? First, I consider the case J equals one, J equals zero. J equals zero. One. J equals zero. J equals zero. Remember that the Hamiltonian contains two parts. Okay. One is associated with coupling constant B, another associated with coupling constant J. Okay. Now consider J equals zero. J equals zero only contain the now only consider the first part. That's just this part. Okay. Well, this part is pretty easy because xi, they all commute. I will call the plus minus one, plus minus as the eigenstate of xi. State of Xi. I is the site. Okay. So I would just denote them as eigenstate of Xi. And then you can see the ground state. Look at this. Look at this. So the ground state must be all Xi as plus one. Okay, so I would denote the ground state as all plus plus plus. Okay, this is the ground state, and this is unique ground state. Okay, if we do not impose any symmetry, the only topological sector is the vacuum sector, denoted by one. There's nothing else. One, there's nothing else, okay. This is the only topological sector, okay. And the only topological sector operator is the trivial one. This needed some explanation, why? Because the notion of quantum gap defaces is stable under the small perturbation of Hamiltonian without closing the gap. Okay, you introduce some kind of perturbation to the Hamiltonian without closing the gap, then they define the same phase. So, everything we discussed here must also stable under the local small perturbations. The local small perturbations of Hamiltonian. So all the non-local operators turn out to be confined by adding proper small perturbations. For example, this operator U, okay? Oh, if we don't impose symmetry, this operator U or this operator Mi. Mi is you multiply Z Xi, Xk on a half infinitely long chain. Okay, smaller than I. Everything smaller than I, you put an Xi, K, X K. Xi K X K. Everything else you put identity. Okay, so this operator is non-local. But this non-local operator can be confined if you add a term KZI. You add a KZI, XK, and ZK anti-commute. They create energy. So this long string of operator will create the infinite large energy. So it's forbidden. So that's called, so you only need to consider unconfined. Need to consider unconfined non-local operator. But if you don't impose any symmetry, any arbitrary perturbation is loaded, then all the non-local operator is confined. So the only topological sector operator is trivial one. Okay, what does this mean? This means that the topological sector of state is trivial, only one trivial one, and the sector of the operator also trivial. So as a consequence, this realized the so-called trivial 1D topological order, which can Trivial 1D topology order, which can be mathematically described by one whack. Okay? Because the underlying category of the enriched category is trivial and the background category, the base category of the enriched category also trivial. So just back enrich in itself. Now something not trivial happened. If we impose use symmetry, the ground state of V preserved the use symmetry. We can call the operator P preserve the U symmetry simply by operator commute. Uh, operator commute p should commute with you. That's called a usymmetric operator. For example, uh, the both identity operator and these are eusymetric, as I already explained, but they are local operators, right? They are local operators. So now, let me give you another operator. This m i we defined is a multiplication of a long string of xi, half infinitely long. Okay, it's a usymmetric operator. Okay, it's a eusymmetric operator because it's commuted with u, right? Because u is just a multiplication of all xk. Okay, so it's a eusy metric, non-local operator, okay. And another interesting operator is the zi. You see, the zi break the eusymetric because zi anti-commute with xi as a local operator, right? It is a local operator because it's defined on a site, okay? It's a local operator, but it can be viewed as a use symmetric. It can be viewed as a eusymmetric non-local operator because the ZI can simply equivalent to a long string of eusymetric. Remember, ZI and ZI plus one are eusymmetric local operators. You multiply them together. You see, everything above I cancel out except something at infinity. Strictly speaking, this is not correct. Okay, strictly speaking, it's not correct because there are all. Speaking, it's not correct because there are always ZG hanging around at infinity. But this abuse of notation is pretty convenient. So I'll ignore the subtlety here. So moreover, Zi and Mi are unconfined by the eusymmetric perturbations. What does this mean? Once you impose the eusymmetry to the system, now the perturbations are required to respect the symmetry. To respect the symmetry, you cannot add a perturbation to the system which breaks the symmetry. Okay, that's the rule. Okay, that's how we play the game. All right, in this case, now there are two sector of states. Why? Because there is a trivial sector associated to the vacuum state that that's same as before. But there is a non-local, non-trivial sector, which you can just achieve it by acting ZI on omega. Omega. So that means just create a minus in the state. Okay, the ground state is everywhere is plus. Now you create a minus. This represents the E-particle located at site I. And the following state, if you look at the following state, you put a ZI and ZTI acting on the ground state. You create a minus sign at site I and a minus sign at the site. sign at the site i and the minus sign at the not minus sign quite a minus at minus state uh at i and the minus state at g the minus state i just mean uh the eigenvalue of x i is minus eigenvalue of x g is minus okay all right so this represents two e particle located at site i and uh site g this immediately implies following fusion rules okay one times e remember 1 times E, remember, 1 is the super selection sector of vacuum, and E is the super selection sector of this sector. So this is fusion rule is obvious. And this E tensor E equal one is given by this identity. And then you can see that this is exactly coincide with those fusion rule in the category of RAPZ2. Okay, so that means the super select. So that means the super selection sector of state form the monoidal category of RAPZ2. Okay. Now let's look at what about the topological sector of the operators. Now you look at the topological sector of operators, you can see that now we require eusymetric operators. So everything has to be eusymetric. Okay. One is eusy metric. Xi is eusymetric. Zga, well, Zga breaks the symmetry, but Break the symmetry, but remember that now I set Z Ta to be this one, Zi to be an infinite long string of eusymmetric local operators. So at the end, it's also a eusymmetric non-local operator. Remember, there is a Zg around infinity, okay? There's a Zg at infinity, so this is a eusymetric. All right, another non-local sector is Mi times Zg. Okay, I will denote. DG. Okay, I will denote four topological sectors associated with these four operators by one MEF. Why I use this notation? Because remember, in Toracle model, I use the same notation. So these four notations simply are the four simple objects in the juncture center of GrepZ2. Not only that, these four operators can also realize not only fusion, fusion just achieved by multiplying these operators, and also can Operators and also can realize breedings. Okay, but that needs some details I want to ignore it. So just trust me that they can realize all the breeding structure in it as well by properly manipulating all these four operators. And as a consequence, you can see all these four sectors of operator acting on the super selection sector of state. Okay, so now let's there. So now let's uh there are only two uh super selection of state, which is one and e. Okay, let's xy be one and e. We denote the space of eusymmetric operators that maps from x to y by half xy. Okay, by home xy. Then we immediately obtain following things. Hum11 equals to 1 plus m. Why is that? Let me explain this. Remember, m is the topological sector associated with mi. Okay, now we see. Okay, now we see. Well, let's check what Mi acts on vacuum. Okay, this is the vacuum. Do I have a vacuum here? Okay, oh, yeah. This is the vacuum. Okay, these are eigenstate of Xi. Okay. All plus are eigenstate of Xi. Now look at what is Mi. Mi is a multiplication. It's a half infinite long chain of XK, but everything is XK. So this XK. Xk. So this XK acting on a vacuum trivially, not trivially, I mean, as a plus one, doesn't change it. Okay, so what does this mean is that M acts on vacuum without changing the vacuum. Okay, M acting on vacuum without changing vacuum. That means these U symmetric operators are leaking. Are living in the HAM11. Okay, this is non-trivial sector living in HAM11. Similarly, you can check all the others, you know, because E is a ZI, right? What does the EI do? EI simply create from vacuum an E particle, right? So remember that Z simply create from vacuum an E particle. So E is inside the Hum 1E, and F is similar. E and F is similar because F is M times M times E. M X tribulate E crate particle, crate E particle. So this also has two sectors. And so on and so forth. Okay. So as a consequence, all of these are objects living in the field-field center of gravity two. What does this mean? So let me draw the conclusion. The conclusion is that the Ising chain in this GA equals zero, only this Hamiltonian, realized the trivial 1D Z2S. Utilize the trivial 1D Z2 SPT order, which can be mathematically described by the enriched category, which is RepZ2 enriched in the dream field center of RepZ2. Okay, so that's icing chain. There's another half. We will not discuss another phase defined by icing model. It's called the semi-tree breaking phase. That's given by when GA equals almost one and B equals. equal almost one and b equals zero. Remember a Hamiltonian continuum two term. First we set G equals zero. Okay, now we set B equals zero. We get another Hamiltonian. Okay, this Hamiltonian. I'm not going to show you the detail, but we give the results. Okay, this acting chain in this condition, it realizes a symmetry breaking phase, which can be described mathematically by enriched diffusion category, which is vaccy to enriched by enriched. Z2 enriched by enriched in the drink field center of RepZ2. Okay, you might ask that the WACZ2 is the same as RAPZ2, but we use a different notation because this enrichment is different. Okay, the enrichment is different because the previous REPZ2 can be canonically enriched in the dream field center of a REPZ2, but the dream field center of REPZ2 can The drain fill center of REPZ2 contains a braided auto equivalence, non-trivial one. You can use that braided auto equivalent to twist it to get another enrichment of VACZ2. Okay, so this enriched category are different. They corresponding to two phases of eye-sing chain. All right, so we achieve our goal. Okay, so I think my time is almost up, right? Yeah, so let me draw the conclusion. So the mathematical theory of fusion category and their reputation theory. Fusion category and their reputation theory, and doesn't study a topological physics in the full strength, okay, in the sense that nearly all the mathematical concepts have their physical meanings. And the physics demand us to study fusion even higher category, okay, and even and also in rich fusion category, and perhaps more are waiting to be discovered in the coming future, especially in the study of topological phase transition beyond the London paradigm. So I'm looking forward to have more to say in the future to tell you maybe there are more categories. To tell you maybe there are more category theory can be used in the study of how about physics. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Are there questions, please? David. Oh, I have a quick question. Yeah, so you had, I think this is super cool, this stuff about the 1D transverse field easing model. Easing model. I'm wondering if do you have any kind of results connecting when you don't either have just the XI terms or the ZJ, ZJ plus one terms, where you're really looking at both the typical, you know, closer to criticality? Oh, close to the criticality. Yeah, it's close to the criticality at the B equal one and J equal one. Then in this case, the gap is closed. The gap is closed. The gap is closed, you got an icing CFT. In that case, you also got an enriched category. That would be icing UMTC enriched in the dream field center of the icing UMTC. So this enriched diffusion category approach works for all cases, even include the critical point of the phase transition. Thanks so much. You're welcome. So I had one in the same direction. So you had the b equals to zero or the j equals to zero. So if you're not sort of on the critical point, but is there some analysis you can do for arbitrary values of b or g? Maybe like j is small. Or G, maybe like J is small and B is something, I don't know. Well, if it's away from the critical point, there essentially, so the phase diagram is pretty simple. You only have two gapped phases for different B and G. And then for a particular value of B and G, let's say B approaching one and J approaching one, you're approaching a critical point. So the phase diagram is only have two phase and one critical point, essentially, is that. But is there some way? That but is there some way where you can compute some enriched category out of so you're saying the enriched category is assigned to a phase in the phase diagram? How does it work? Yeah, yeah. So for a phase diagram, so this means that for on a phase diagram, you assign one gap to phase by this enriched category and another gap by a gap to phase by this enriched category. And on the critical point, you assign another point you you assign another uh i forgot to write i actually i in my previous pd i i i write a comment about the critical point but uh because my my computer crashed today so i have to rewrite all the ppt i forgot to add this um uh so on the critical point you get uh uh uh uh icing uh um tc enriched in the icing um tc uh greenfield center icing um tc um remember that all uh because all this uh enriched diffusion category no matter what there Diffusion category, no matter what, their dream field center have to be trivial because they're well-defined, the lattice model or a critical point, there are no higher park. So that's the constraint. So you can see that their dream field center can be viewed as invariant of the entire phase diagram. This works for all other cases as well. It's not just for Ising model. You can pick another lattice model in 1D, you get some similar results. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So is there basically when you have this phase diagram, right, you have your two sides of criticality and the critical point. So you have these three different enriched fusion categories. Is there any sense in which is there any connection between them, or are these just labeling these three sections of the diagram? Or is there some process categorically that might Categorically, that might that you can say anything about? Yeah, that's very good questions. I have to say, at this stage, I was not able to answer this question, but we're working towards finding the correct limiting process in the future. Yeah, we have this, we want to work this out. This question you just asked, I think that's a very deep question. So far, we don't, so far, they just look. So far, they just look at labels. There is no limiting process to, but in some sense, I think the enriched category at a critical point should be viewed as a certain limit of other fusion category or something. But it's wide open. I don't know how to achieve that. But we hope to work on it. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, I have no idea, but it sounds if there's something there, it would be really great. Yeah, we have actually some ideas. There's one of the paper I didn't show here. For example, you can consider the following things. You can consider a Tariqod model with two-gapped boundary. Tariq model have two-gapped boundary. Now you consider how this two-gapped boundary have a purely Purely have a phase transition only on the boundary, restricted on the boundary. In that case, we can sort of see a limiting process to see how the enriched category was emergent from the fusion category. But we were not able to write down the detail, but I think that's where if you want to investigate those cases, maybe that's a good point to start, I would say. Ah, okay. So, yeah, sure, right. Because one of them is enriched into our code and the other one is enriched in using cross-using bar. Other one is enriched in easing cross-easing bar, and you have a nice phase transition between the two given by these boundaries. Yeah, okay. Um, yeah, I think I see where. Anyway, thanks. I appreciate that. You're welcome.
