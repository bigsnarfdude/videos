Yeah, thanks a lot, Joanna. Thanks everyone for the invite and looking forward to share with you some elements and considerations regarding climate and financial risk. And just to put a disclaimer, I'm not going to share any modeling on any results, but I'm going to be addressing some questions like the question was asked by Paul from Western. So before moving in details, I'm just going to talk briefly, you know, introduce myself. So my name is Olid. Introduce myself. So, my name is Olid. I'm a director at KPMG US. I'm based in the US working on climate risk data analytics. So, my main focus is on helping additional institutions to start their journey, integrate their climate journey, and then document their solutions and analytics and help them with this quite pretty challenging way and exciting in the same way. Before that, I used to. um before that i used to yeah be in toronto i used to read the uh i used to be uh in uh tdbank working for t bank heading up commercial uh us commercial portfolio which is about more than 100 billion exposure responsible of allowance and the stress testing exercises like CCAR and AWS and before that I had the pleasure to be student of Dr. Michael Student of Dr. Matt Davison, who is in the room. I want to say hi to him. Which we actually by we were working on a climate-related subject, particularly the carbon initial markets. Back then, you know, why there is a lot of challenges now. Even back then, we had even more challenges subject. So I'm pretty excited to be here today to talk more and share some of my experience related to what we are observing. Related to what we are observing in the industry, because as of now, I'm not talking on behalf of APNG, I'm just talking as behavior of Louise, some food in my head today. However, I want to say if you are interested or you know someone who would like to work and join the fun part on the climate risk modeling, so please feel free to send me an email. We are hiring and always hiring open towns. So I can't, if there's no questions, I can't. I guess I feel like asking if someone has a question in the first slide. So quite, you know, I've seen it in previous conferences, by the way. I'm not particularly talking which kind of conferences, but I've seen people ask me questions from first life. I pointed out to the graduate students that you are hiring. You just mentioned that. So I'll point it out again. You just mentioned that, so I'll point it out again. Um, are there any questions so far for Belit from the audience? Everybody's asking. So, if any, if you have any question, you know, anything you want to learn more about the team I'm with, so we are part of the modeling evaluation team within KPMG US. And KPMG US is way, way bigger and like larger in the US. Um, and we have so many different clients, so my clients are. Different clients. So, my clients are not only banks, but also like on all financial institutions, including like insurances and other financial institutions. So, please feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions or if you want to inquire more about the kind of work we are doing. I'm going to keep it high level and I need to put this disclaimer before moving on. So, anything I'm saying express my opinion and not necessarily the company opinion. And asking a question, I know I'm Asking a question, and now I'm gonna focus like something quite interesting. And I find it quite helpful actually for the researchers understand how important it is, the subject we are talking. So we talk about climate a lot. We talk, you know, is this something you know? I don't think so. It's been a while in the industry, like 20 or 30, more than 20 years or 30 years has been what we have been talking about. But these days has been our focus. Um, our focus, uh, and I can see here, like, we are talking about you know, the UN Secretary General is talking on 2018, this is existential threat for us, for humanity. And the BCBS talk about, you know, there is a problem that this might create, like climate risk might create a broader financial stability implication for the banking system. The application for the banking system and the FSOC, which is like a council being created out of the Frank Act, this is a measure threat to the financial stabilities. So we are talking here about quite a serious threat in our humanity, on the way we live, the way we have today, and how the way it should evolve. So I feel like this is enough. I feel like this is enough. If I look at this slide, I look at climate christ, this is something literally quite important for people to think about seriously and to think the way of doing things. I think think the way of their habits. And potentially from a research perspective, this is quite exciting field. First of all, there's a lot of changes going on, but also this isn't an important and kind of and kind of mandatory things, just mandatory between COVID things to focus on and start putting our brain and our talent thinking about how to solve these problems. So talking about climate risk, so what does it mean really climatrics about for bank, let's say some bank? I've been many talks with many banks and I And I kind of most of the banks agree that climate risk is transverse risk. So, what does it mean transfer stress? Maybe this is going to touch a bit on the question that Paul asked, and I will add to what Philip has mentioned. So it means kind of hit all pillars of risks. You've got like credit risk, you have operational risk, you have reputational risk, compliance risk. Risk, compliance risk, strategic risk. So, all kinds of risk within the bank, climate risk is implying that. So, that's something quite important. It's not something like similar, like COVID, particularly like or like downturn period where you know exactly what's going to impact you, even though you don't necessarily know how to solve it at the time at the beginning. But it's kind of, you know, you have more clarity, more view on things. More view on it, how things will evolve. But when it comes to climate, it's something actually you're changing everything you have been doing for many years and used to it. And you need to get into consideration like a very long time horizon that goes up to 50 years. And that's what I've never seen before. And I put a slide that compare climate scenario analysis, which is something like similar to what Philip or might touch something, what Philip was talking about, and stress testing. Was talking about and stress testing, which is like the one common exercise we observe in the industry. But for now, I'm going to talk about like what we have been observing, what has been going on with the industry. It's been a lot of talk about the CFD recommendation disclosure, and those are the reports that also I mentioned to Philip because Philip did a really good presentation before my talk. And I feel, you know, John did good work in organizing my talk after Philip's presentation. Presentations. So, if you look at the CFT recommendations, right, the for disclosure, so they focus about what they call like the half-on usually, right? So, they focus about four elements. They focus about governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. So, overall, like everything starts from the board oversight and from senior management, right? And they have to identify exactly Exactly, you know, set an app either like a specific group that's focused on ESG slash climate. If you, you know, if you talk, like if you do some reading, it's going to see some differentiation between climate and ESG. We can talk about it later if you have questions, but in natural, like ESG is a broader view than climate and they include like diversity and inclusion and many other social aspects. But for my talk, it's going to be just focused. but for my talk it's going to be just focused on climate risk that which is like related transition mostly known as transition and physical risk on banking and financial institution in general so once you set up your governance and strategy you put up your body within an organization with the governance within the bank you set up your strategy you know they talk a lot about climate trust but keep in mind there is a lot of opportunities and those opportunities literally some people they cannot do really pretty well To do really pretty well with the transition with the climate through a net zero economy. And those are the opportunities as a lender, you're going to look and try to make investment and also try to lend more money in there. And then once you understand what your strategy, you look at, keep in mind you need to have a resilient business and you think about different scenarios, either like NGFS scenarios, CTP scenarios. These scenarios, whenever a particular scenario you would like to keep in mind. And once you already set up your strategic path, you need to set up your controls and monitoring with comes through risk management. So first of all, you see like what are the groups that have been identified, how you're going to talk about your research planning. Do you have enough resources? What do you need to have? Do you have enough data? What kind of data you have? Are the data of good quality or not good quality? Data of good quality or not good quality? Are they of good quality to pass an audit function like SOX controls? So, a lot of question talk when you start when you start like talking and putting things in practical way, right? And how you're going to integrate these processes without impacting your current resources and your current program. Keep in mind, whenever we're talking about today, it's additional for many years. What we used to have for many years, and what's like what's the key groups are used to work. So, literally, you need to think about how you're going to drive your organization forward when you start talking about integrating climate risk into your day-to-day business. So, right now, some big banks have been taking that pretty seriously. I don't want to specifically name banks, but some of them have been very specific on how to integrate and climate. On how to integrate and climate risk and have a clear path, but also many banks are still catching up and they're still trying to find out what's the best way to integrate a climate into our day-to-day business. The best thing, you know, to look now, there are a lot of reports, a lot of disclosure, but what you need, you need something measurements to put in action. So you have a metric, you can, you know, account, you know, use PCAT. Account, you know, use PCAF or any accounting like emission account system to say what's my emission, what's my copper footprint. But, you know, if you, but always, if you don't put your targets publicly, publish your targets along with the measure you have today, your planned path forwards, it's going to be challenged for any company to meet their targets, right? So, okay, you can't report. So, okay, you can report how much emission, how much finance emission you have. What's your scope one? What's your scope two? But what you really need to do, like usually, and there's a lot of companies that are doing a good job on that, like they're setting up targets, which target has been approved by the board. And they say, okay, I have by this X number of years, this is going to be my carbon footprint. It's going to be like these are pretty critical decisions. They're not easy to make. They're not easy to met yet. One of the reasons is like climate risk has not been fully realized by regulator. So it's not something yet driven by tough regulation. Regulations are slowly going on. We see SEC in March released some like asked for public commentaries on some 500 pages, you know, commentary about disclosure, disclosure. Commentary about disclosure, how you can disclose your carbon emissions. We see also recently they had their draft as well. So, from a seriousness perspective, like Bank of England, like Philip was mentioning, they already talk in Europe, they're already talking about climate stress testing exercises. And so we see a lot of evolutionary graphics, but up to today, there's nothing really quote unquote 100%. Of quote 100% forcing banks to take that seriously. So, like in the US, for example, when you say the SEC disclosure, that's something quite serious and make people really getting, understand that's something real and we should think about it pretty seriously. So, I move to the next slide. So, now talk, just want to say, like, this is climate risk, how it's impacting management framework. So, bank. Management framework: so bank overall, they have risk management function quite a great. So, you have different line of businesses and you have risk management, which literally like translate report risk appetite, one of it, and also responsible of many things, including risk identifications, measurement and control. So, overall, like at the board, it's going to set the tone from the top and cascade down the accountability. So, the tone of this meeting depends on. It depends on companies, right? So it depends on the financial institution, how they are seriously taking climate risk at this point, as I speak today, right? Probably over the past day I was on holiday, I missed a few things that I haven't spoken for, you know, that I haven't been following closely. So hopefully I didn't miss much. But yeah, but literally like the board is going to set up the tone, the metrics. Yeah, the tone, the metrics, the strategic pathway can scale down senior management. They update all their risk appetite, tolerance, they try to understand how they update their limits with regards to climate risk. And slowly they cascaded down to the governance framework. So governance framework is going to be unpacked in all the way how we do identify risk, what's going to be our measuring risk or not. Immersion risk or not. It's going to impact also the three line of defenses, whether it's like first line of defense, like second line of defense, like validation function or third line of defense, like all that function. And that's going to all just get down, unpack all the pillars of the bank. So this is where come the transverse function, like the transfection nature of climate. So now the question, if I have a transfer risk, how I'm going to handle that within... Risk: How I'm gonna handle that within big organizations like Mex, for example. Am I gonna slowly specialize on climate risk? If you think about climate risk and their impact on the banking perspective, it's still like we don't have banks don't have, I should stress on that, like our like financial institutions in general, not necessarily they have skill talents that really understand how this is impacting the bank. How this is impacting the bank. So, literally, first of all, you need to understand: is it better to start with centralized steam and then slowly integrate it to different colors? Or is it any other way I should integrate the climate risk into my BIU function? And this is like there's no unique answer, honestly, like depends on the depends on the Depends on the bank, out of the bank business, depends on their exposure to climate risk, and they will be like the solution. So, we help usually help like financial institutions to find the right solution for them and try to articulate climate risk in the most cost-efficient way. And once you know it hits the pillars, you always keep track of metric targets and slowly it's going to cascade back into like the board, which they should. like the board which they should but they should have like a slight feedback loop function where um where like things cascade down get your metrics targets cascade back up and then you adjust your strategy or adjust your targets as needed and from that you literally what you need to do is like take the appropriate decision and make sure you have the right people in the right spot take a decision like Right to people, right to politicians. Like one of the complexity, for example, climate data, right? So let's say you're trying to capture emission data. Where does the emission data lie on? Should that lie on in like data owned by the enterprise level? Should be data owned by risk management level. So this kind of all decisions that are all behind the scene happening, right? And you see, like it's not that straightforward. It's not that straightforward to have an answer to that. Particularly if you already have the challenges with your internal data and you try to add some external data and climate data, like at this point, you might have some internal data related climate, related to financial emissions, but there's a lot of reliability on external data set of external providers, which create another challenge and open the door to many. Open the door to many other elements and challenges when you bring in like external data set. One of the recommendations is climate scenario analysis. So Philip, like prior presentation, he showed like many paths, different paths, either early policy, late policy, or no action policy. And for each of them, there are... And for each of them, you know, there are some hypothetical and constructive scenarios where there are so many assumptions on their scenarios, but they are good enough to be able to understand or at least make an informal decision when it comes to shaping up your strategy and have climate into your consideration when you are setting up your. Um, your strategic goals, right? So, these are scenarios, these like hypothetical scenarios are literally like they are hypothetical, right? They are not forecast, they are not looking like getting protection or sensitivity analysis. There are so many assumptions going behind the scene, but they are very, very informative on making the appropriate decision and also like understand, for example, if we focus on credit, like to answer, like to add an answer. Like to answer, like, like to add to the answer to Paul's question, like, credit has been the main focus of many banks. I don't know because most of the business banks' business are based on credit, right? So, they lend money and to clients and they get deposits. So, like a lot of focus for now, a lot of the industry know they're focused on credit and they are not really focusing much on other elements, like operational risk, for example, but it's on the way, so I'm not a path. The way, so I'm not a path. So, and with the credit, you are able to leverage climate risk scenario analysis aspect to have forecast PD similar to the one that Philip showed on the prior slide. And based on that, you can compute your expected credit loss and make some decision. Again, like expected credit loss is only one measure, but there's so many things you can do when it comes to being able to forecast riskworthiness of your. Riskworthiness of your portfolio, either particularly if you have like strong, like a large exposure and commercial industry portfolio and commercial. So these are like many like steps that you might let, you know, there might be follow-ups if you are trying to do climate change analysis. So first of all, key element when you do anything, you need to understand the governance. So what would be the governance? Who should be approving the Who should be approving the numbers, let's say, who would be overseeing the particular process as simple as the process of getting the representative portfolio or subset of portfolio based on which, let's say, we're going to make very strategic decisions. And then you got to say, you ask yourself a question, what's the scope of my climate risk scenario analysis? So, first of all, you need to understand your So, first of all, you need to understand your portfolio, which one is impacted by physical risk, which one impacted by transition risk, which one is affected by both. Because usually, when you talk, you read people talk about physical and transition like they are displayed concept, but now you have some clients or customers within your portfolio, they are unpacked by both of them, right? And how they are unpacking your balance sheet. Usually, you're going to focus on material portfolios elements, you are packing like large elements. Affecting like large elements, like large exposure within your balance sheet. So, whether you have, you know, if you are bank operating an island, probably you might think a lot and worried about like sea rights, right? So probably the island will no longer exist in 100 years, right? So, or if there is like say economic, you know, have exposure and transition risk, you might. Exposure and transition risk, you might think about: okay, this is my expectation of a drop in GDP in that particular region. And you know, I do have a concentration in particular sector. So, and this is a high-risk sector, which is really highly impacted by climate change. So, literally, you need to have a clear assessment of your portfolio, understanding materiality and how it's impacting your business today, and how it's going to evolve through years, particularly, we're seeing when you're Years, particularly, we are seeing like evolving policy on the regulatory landscape. So, afterwards, you're going to determine what are the parameters. Let's say you might be like you have a large exposure online cast, probably the old price would be key factor in the analysis you're going to conduct. Afterwards, you need to select scenarios. Are you going to go with the NGFS scenarios or are you going to go with CDP scenarios? Kind of many scenarios. Philip mentioned AIM like models. So those are kind of temperature/slash emission scenarios. Those usually get translated to the macro financial impact. So you've got the national level, how it's going to be impacting like regional level, let's say state level. For example, like, you know, Calculate region would be impacted different way than Ontario and Council. Ontario when it comes to the path of an oil price, right? And then, once you get the impact on the microdrivers, you can evaluate the business impact. And based on that, you need to document. And the key element for me is communicate because usually communication and practical way, if you do a good job on that, you'll be able to overcome a lot of challenges. So communicate and having this like relevant report. Relevant reports that will give the appropriate information to decision makers, that's quite important when it comes to this climate journey. So I'm going to talk a little bit about stress testing because I'm not sure to what extent the audience is familiar with stress testing. And I will focus on both, I'll give an idea on both Canadian side and US side. Like Canadian side and US side. So, so stress testing. So, usually, like every year, let's say in the US, there is what they call a CCAR. And the main of the stress testing is like the FED releases some scenarios, hypothetical scenarios, which are more or less consistent with the criterion we observed on 2008 and 2010. An exception like last two years where we observed some COVID-related really you know scenarios. So, what we do. So, what we do, or what the banks do now is like try to project their balance sheet based on those scenarios and then making sure that they have adequate capital in place. So making sure that the better like the financial situation, even though there is economic shock, right? So, this has happened every year in the US through Sikha once a year. Usually, it was like twice a year, but no, like two years. Twice a year, but no, like two years ago, they started to decrease it to once a year frequency. And we have the same in Canada as well, where every other year we have like OSUI, they have like MST, like micro stress test, they call it, along with the Bank of Canada. It's a similar concept. You do it for casual balance sheet and making sure that you have a lot of, you know, You know, enough capital buffer, and you are resolving enough the way you're doing business. But also, we do have like Canada EWST is on the password stress testing and happens every year. It's kind of an internal exercise, but regulators are always interested to see the outcome of the results. So, this is like stress testing, something we everyone knows, right? So, we have been, banks have been doing this. have been banks have been doing that for many years and they know exactly processes and the way we are doing has been uh evolving for many years particularly on the us side where um where kind of uh you are kind of you are like it's very mature state comparing what i've actually seen in canadian side uh prior you know and my old work Prior, you know, and my old word, right? So, and what I've what I've like, we try to compare now. So, if you compare the time horizon of stress testing, it's like you're trying to focus on forecasting two to five years. So, there is no magic, like there's no like material change on the way how you do a business within two to five years. So, you expect your balance sheet remains mostly constant over straight horizon. So, you're not really focusing a lot on changing the business. Focusing a lot on changing the business, but you're all focusing on more how my portfolio is going to evolve and how I'm going to treat new volumes within like five-year horizon, let's say. But it's not going to be very, it's not going to be very different from the way I'm doing today. And as I mentioned, like it's depending on macroeconomic scenarios, let's say there is a drop on GDP by X percent, commercial Europe. Commercial real estate price and it will drop by 40% in four quarters with like the recovery speed of X quarters, let's say. So this is like something I would call like PIU now stress testing, something you know pretty well. We know how it works. We know the appropriate governance in place and we know how we can leverage and use that information to take the appropriate decisions. However, it comes to the climate scenario, something new. The good thing is. The good thing is, we're not starting from scratch, but we're leveraging a lot from what we have in stress testing work. And I personally, like, I find that my experience as leading up a team responsible of both US and Canadian stress testing exercises and wholesale portfolio that helped us a lot on how to evolve that process to incorporate an adjustable climate within climate context. So within a climate, usually there is So, within a climate, usually there is like multiple horizon you look at, you look at short-term two to five years, and then also you look at medium-term and longer term plus, right? And the much longer you look at, you estimate, it's like you need to understand like there is more and more uncertainty and you need to put in place some techniques or some strategy how you can address that uncertainties. You might find, you know, say. You know, say a particular customer has evolved like PDC for the years, and all of a sudden the results start to become an entwitter, right? So, there is a lot of way and techniques how we can make sure like you have an understanding of your long-term assessment of the risk. Usually, like climatic scenarios is useful to assess your impact on transition risk and the physical risk. Of the physical risk, and how you're uh you understand your portfolio composition and you set up your strategy moving forward. So, let's say I have X max, I don't know, like 30 percent and specific sector, which is like higher risk of climate. You might want to like reduce it by 30, 40 percent, or you might want to stay in that business and take the risk on reputational risk or other type of risk because it's going to be more profitable. Profitable, you might remain net zero at the end, or even with negative net zero and carbon, you might think keep an industry in oil and gas, right? Like it could keep an finance oil and gas industry because it's still very profitable and you have a lot of way of offsetting this kind of exposure to the oil and gas sector, for example. So it doesn't mean like you have a sector. What I'm trying to say here, I guess, doesn't mean when you have You have a high-intensity emitter sector, you should not make a business with, but I would say you should know how to make a business with, right? And that's comes the opportunity aspect with the climate and this quite interesting way of looking at things, right? When it comes to law horizon forecast, static balance sheets, similar to what they use in stress testing, might not necessarily. Might not necessarily valid, but it's a good indicator, kind of tells you this is my references in my base. This is how things look like if I'm doing business as of today. All right. But there are, you should do like some proportional dynamic balance sheet and make the mix your updated balance sheet makes up the way, first of all, depending on scenario narrative you are cheating, whether it's early policy, late policy, or whatever. Early policy, late policy, or whatever. And also, you need to keep in mind your have your port strategy and specific risk appetite that you should always keep in mind when you set up dynamic balance sheet assumptions. So, and it comes to that, something very important and something I feel like the research in the future is going to In the future, is going to move towards that direction is how to handle data challenges when it comes to modeling climate risk. For example, like you know, data is needed when you do a scenario analysis. It's actually at city, county, and zip code level or postal code level. So, there is no good data at this moment. We expect, I expect data will be enhanced over the next years, but at least at this point. The next years, but at least at this point, you know, there is a lot of cool things that can be done to handle some data-specific challenges that we're observing in data day. So that's what I have for today. Hopefully, I didn't pass the time.
