It is Damon from Gielma, and she will tell us about non-interpretation conditions and the passage from Northern Aras Greek. Thank you. Thank you very much. So good morning, everyone. And let me start by thanking the organizers. So it's very nice to have been invited to present my work here. And I'm sorry not to be able to be there with you, but I hope you will still enjoy what I will tell you about today. Will tell you about today. So, before I start, I should mention that all the results that I will present are joint work with Stefano Almi from Naples and Manuel Friedrich from Fauerlangen. And I should also say that I'm aware that somehow when you are in a hybrid conference, online talks can be a little bit boring, to be honest. And so, for this reason, I've tried to cut the technicalities to a minimum so that. To a minimum. So there won't be any real proof in my talk, just sketches of ideas. And also, I will be a little bit sloppy with the literature review, not to overburden, so to say, the slides with too many names. I hope you won't mind about this. So as you see from the title of my talks, what I will talk about today is a little bit the somehow interplay between three things. So non-interpenetration, interpenetration, and the way in which it's Penetration and the way in which it's modeled, Griffith fracture mechanics, and linearization. And somehow we want to see how these three things interact. Now, before I start talking about fracture, let's take a step back and let's just talk about non-impentration, but in a setting in which everything is a little bit simpler, so namely that of large strain elasticity. Of large strain elasticity. Now, I know that yesterday in the talk by Duvan, you saw very deep results concerning the modeling of, say, large strain theories for elastic materials. And so what I wanted to do here was a very, very short recap of what is known and what works, so to say. Now, I mean, the fact that you have some sort of modeling of non-interpenetration in elasticity. Non-interpenetration in elasticity, it's kind of natural because when you think about the way in which a body should be formed, if it's elastic, well, it's natural to assume that it shouldn't interpenetrate itself. And it's also natural to assume that if you compress it very much, this should blow up the energy. And so somehow these extreme compressions should be energetically unfavorable. The point is, well, how do you model that in practice? Now, we know that very good people. That very good people have worked on this, and that somehow there are two, I would say, more popular ways to do that. The first way would be to impose very nice boundary conditions on the whole boundary of the set. We know that this works, but we also know that this is not super nice for applications. So, somehow that's why it's also interesting to look at other possible ways to enforce some sort of non-impinpenetration. Non-interpenetration and invertibility. And this is where somehow the determinant of the gradient of the deformations comes into play. And this is because, well, a natural thing to kind of enforce, if you want to impose that there should be some sort of non-interpenetration, is that the determinant of the gradient of your deformation should be positive. But of course, this is not enough because it's just a local condition. And so it tells you that locally you would have some sort of invertibility. Sort of invertibility, but you wouldn't have injectivity everywhere and you wouldn't have global invertibility. Now, another avenue that you could take if you want to impose some non-interpenetration conditions for your material could be the following. You could ask that you have the positivity of the determinant of the gradient of your deformations and another condition, which is known as the CLN access condition. Now, what does this condition say? Condition say well, it tells you that basically the integral on your set omega of the determinant of your gradient of your deformation should be smaller or equal than the Lebesgue measure of the deformed set. Now, if you look at this formula, it looks very, very similar to the area formula, right? Because on the left-hand side, okay, normally you would have, say, the modulus, so the absolute value of the determinant of the gradient of your deformation. Of the determinant of the gradient of your deformations, but here I'm saying that we are requiring positivity of the determinant, so that's why it's not there. And normally, you would have an equal sign. But to be fair, if you have the CLNS condition, what is written here as an inequality is actually an equality because the opposite inequality here is always true. And this is because of the classical area formula. So if you don't have injectivity of your maps, on the left-hand side, you would have an integral on the deformed set. Would have an integral under the form set of the Banach function that would count the multiplicity of the inverse. If your map is injective, you have an equality there. And this is what the Silienets is enforcing, so to say. So it's a very, very nice condition. But there are some things to be careful about when you write it down. And the first important thing to be careful about is what is on the right-hand side, because what is written there is the volume of Y. Is the volume of y of omega. Now, I told you that in this talk, actually, we want to see what happens in the setting of fracture mechanics. And we know that there, the spaces in which we work are spaces related to discontinuous functions. So we work here with a functional that has been studied quite a lot in the past few years, which is just Griffith functional. And we are seeing in the two-dimensional. We are staying in the two-dimensional setting. And we know that, I mean, this is a way of describing fracture as a competition of two effects: the effects given by the minimization of a frame in different bulk energy density, and those given by the fact that you also have a surface term. So, this second term here, where k is just a positive material constant, and this quantity here is the length of the jump. Of the jump. Now, as I said, W has to be a non-linear elastic energy density. We assume it to be positive. And the thing is, these kind of functionals are usually defined on spaces of functions with bounded variation. In particular, we want to stay away from very pathological situations. So we work with functions having no counterparts for their distributional gradient. So that's why the S here. So that's why the s here, so in the space of special function bounded variations, and we know that at some point we might want to have some compactness for say sequences of deformations for which this energy is uniformly bounded. But if you don't impose any, say, a priori boundedness on your deformations, you end up in a bigger space, which is that of this generalized special function of bounded variations. Roughly speaking, if you're not super familiar with it, it just means You're not super familiar with it, it just means that if you truncate your maps, you end up having an SBV function. And of course, since you are in this bigger space, now what is written here is not the real gradient of your deformations, but just the absolutely continuous part of the gradient. And this jy is the jump set of your deformations. And now the point is, well, can we write down a condition guaranteeing non-interpenetration in this setting? This setting? And the answer is: well, yes, but you have to be a little bit careful. So, the very first delicate point is how to define the deformed set. And this is because if your deformations are not continuous, how can you make sense of y of omega? So, in the first step, one has to be a little bit careful and find another way of defining y of omega in a bit of a more subtle way. More subtle way. So, what you actually do is to resort to the so-called measure theoretical image. So, you start with your maps in GSBV, and then you look at all those points where your map is approximately differentiable. In those sets, it's going to have a Lebesgue representative, this Y tilde. And then you define basically another deformation, Yd, by saying, okay, whenever I am. By saying, okay, whenever I am in a point in which my map is approximately differentiable, I define yd by putting there the Lebesgue value. And when this is not the case, I just put a zero there. Now, what I get, which is defined as the measured theoretic image of E, is actually a nice object. And in a very nice paper by Giacomini and Paul Siglione, it was shown that actually by using this object, you can define a serial condition in this space of. In this space of functions, special functions of bounded variation. So, what you can say is that a map y, which is in this space, satisfies the Cel√©natus condition if the determinant of the absolutely continuous part of the gradient is bigger than zero. And additionally, you have a condition which looks exactly like the one that we had before, with the only difference that what is on the right-hand side now is not y of omega, but is this measured. Not y of omega, but is this measured theoretical image of omega. And what they proved in these works is that this condition is still equivalent to almost everywhere injectivity in the domain, meaning that in the worst case scenario, you have a set of measure zero in omega where your deformations are not injective. And Giacomini and Ponsilione also show that actually, if you impose this condition and you minimize the gritty functional, you can prove existence of minimizers and minimizers. Existence of minimizers and minimizers still satisfy this condition. And as I said, this is a very, very nice paper. And in the last part, they actually comment a little bit about ways in which you can model non-interpenetration in the setting of models for fraction mechanics. And in particular, they say, if you think to what should happen in the linearized setting, well, then a natural linearized counterpart to this condition would be a contact condition, meaning that. Contact condition, meaning that you should impose that somehow the opening that you have in the jump and you take its colour product with the normal to the jump set. Well, this quantity should be bigger or equal than zero in almost every point of the jump set of your displacements. Here, when I'm talking about displacements, these are also defined in a weak sense. And to be precise, they will be in the space of generalized special functions of. Generalize special functions of bounded deformations. With these two here, denoting the fact that you have some integrability for the absolutely continuous part of the symmetric gradient. So to be precise, let's start from the last two letters. So the symmetric gradient of U is going to be a banded Rado measure. Its absolutely continuous part is going to be L2. The jump set is going to have a finite length. And then, okay, this G tells you that actually. Okay, this G tells you that actually you're requiring something a little bit stronger, which is kind of comparable to what we were doing before for GSBV. But here it has been written, it has to be written in a bit of a more refined way. It basically, I mean, it doesn't exactly tell you that you can truncate, but morally, this is what it does. It's once again something that comes up because of compactness. And then the S once again tells you that you have no counterpart. This is a very Counterpart. This is a very horrible way to define GSPD2, but it's just that I don't want to be too technical. If you want the precise definition, I can then tell you about this at the end of the talk if you're curious about this. But this is just to say that there is already some work concerning non-interpenetration in the setting of fracture mechanics. There is a natural condition in the innovator setting, and there is another one that pops up in the linearized context. And then it's kind of natural to ask yourself. And then it's kind of natural to ask yourself whether these two things are actually related and how you can pass from one to the other. And the thing is, if you look into the literature, the fact that these two conditions must be related is mentioned in many places. And so as a non-expert, maybe the first time you stumble upon this, you ask yourself, well, why should that be the case? And this is how we got interested in the problem in the first place. So I talked. First place. So I talked to my colleagues, to Stefan and Manuel, who are much more expert than I am on fracture mechanics, and I asked them, Well, have you ever seen a proof of this, or do you know a reference? We looked a little bit into this, we couldn't find it. And then, as usual, when you don't find a proof, you try to do it yourself. So we spent one day on the Blackboard trying to figure out why this was working. And, you know, you do a bit of a hand-waving argument. In some points, you are very careful because there are jumps. In some other ones, you think, okay, maybe everything. In some other ones, you think, okay, maybe everything behaves as if it was smooth, and convince ourselves that, yeah, I mean, it works, right? And you can go from the CLN access condition to the contact condition. And the only thing is that two days later, we realized we were wrong. So the first thing that we proved is that actually there is a counterexample. And you can construct it like this. So basically, you can construct a sequence of deformations that are in the right space. So they are in GSBV and SBV and the absolutely continuous part of the gradient is actually integrable. They satisfy the SELNHS condition. And if you look at their associated rescale displacement, which you would define in a classical way as deformations minus the identity rescale by a factor epsilon, let's say, well, they would even have uniformly bounded linearized energies, meaning that when you look at the L-show norm of the absolutely continuous part of the symmetric gradient, this would be uniformly. Of the symmetric gradient, this would be uniformly bounded. The same holds for the length of the jumps. But still, these displacements would converge in measure to a displacement that violates the contact condition. So how can you construct these things? The thing is, this construction is super easy and it works like this. You take as your cytometer just the unit squared center in the origin and you take a displacement that does the following. It takes basically the right Basically, the right portion of your set and it pushes it on the left of a factor one. Then, if you look at the jump set for this displacement, it's just the vertical line in the origin. The normal is the vector E1. I mean, the jump is minus E1. And when you take the scalar product, you get a minus one. So it's negative, so it violates the contact condition. And then you construct. And then you construct your displacements like this. You just add to what you had already something of this form that takes a little strip very close to the origin and it pushes it a little bit, quite a bit on the right of a factor, say, 2 over epsilon, 0. So everything here is just in the horizontal direction. And you define your deformations, y epsilon, to be the identity plus epsilon times these displacements. Now, if you look at the Now, if you look at the absolutely continuous part of the gradient of these deformations, you just get the identity. Because, I mean, these are just basically piecewise constant things. If you look at the length of the jumps, you just get a 4. So these things will have finite linearized energies. You can easily convince yourself that they converge to you in measure. And on top of that, you can see that these deformations satisfy the CLNS condition because for absolutely. The CLNS as condition because for epsilon's wall, basically, what happens when you are far away from the line minus two epsilon in the middle and on the right, these things are completely independent. Now, if you don't see it from here, you can look at this picture to see what is going on. So, basically, you have the set on the left, and then what you do is the following. You break it on the two lines around the gray part. Then you shift the black, sorry, the white portion on the right. Sorry, the white portion on the right to the left, and you move the gray part completely on the right. This is what you're doing. I mean, this is not such a bad deformation because it's locally injected in each of the three portions, but still the kind of limiting displacement that you get violates the contact condition. And so you ask yourself, well, why is this happening? And the only thing that seems a little bit weird, and that could be like, say, the culprit for this behavior. The culprit for this behavior is the fact that the length of the jump along your sequence has twice the size of the limiting jump. So it's much bigger than what you would get in the limit. So you have this counterexample and you realize that, okay, things are maybe not so easy. And so maybe we have to be a little bit more careful and write down the precise setup in which, say, such a linearization can occur. So let me tell you a little bit about the models that we consider. A little bit about the models that we consider. So, I start once again from the non-linear setting. And since I want to kind of stay in a bit of an easier scenario, I'm not really working with Gray Fifth, but I'm working with a model for non-simple materials, meaning that I'm adding here a higher-order term. Now, don't look at the scalings for the moment and at the sets, just look at this term here. I want to be a little bit precise about the space in which this function is defined because it can be a little bit confusing. What is written here is the following. So, basically, the maps that you consider are still in GSPV2. But additionally, what you know is that the absolutely continuous part of the gradient is in GSPV2. Meaning that when you differentiate this again, its absolutely continuous part is what you see here. Is what you see here. So, this is not the full ession. And then you put here an epsilon to the minus two because you want to do a linearization. And you have here a certain power that works nicely with these higher order terms. And you have this set omega prime because you also want to impose some boundary conditions. And this set omega prime is going to be bigger than omega, and it's where you will impose your conditions. W as before, it's a frame indication. W as before, it's a faint indifferent function. It's a one-well density and it has quadratic growth from SO2 from below. And so you can ask yourself, okay, I have this kind of non-linear model. What's its linearized counterpart? Now, if you forget about the sillian access condition, what's been shown by Immanuel Friedrich in 2020 is that actually you have linearization to the class. To the classical Learized Griffin model, which would look like this. So you would have, once again, the sum of two contributions, a Bach contribution, which would be the quadratic form, the classical quadratic form evaluated on the absolutely continuous part of the symmetric gradient, and then a term that somehow keeps track of the length of the jump of the limiting displacements. But this linearization somehow is what happens when you don't deal with these temperature. When you don't deal with these penetration conditions. So now the natural question is whether this energy, say, augmented with the contact condition, is the right linearization when I start with the non-linear model augmented with CLN at once. We know that if we forget about the energies, this is false, but what if I keep track now about the variational behavior of my maps? And it turns out that the answer is still no. So this is still not. So, this is still not the right thing. And to show you why, we have a second counterexample, which basically looks like this. So, I take the set that I had before, take a vector in R2 with negative components, and take a corresponding displacement. We just look like this. So, I'm doing the same thing that I was doing before, but now I'm also shifting what happens in the vertical direction. And the thing is, this jump, as you say, this This jump, say this displacement here, and still a jump set on the say vertical line in zero. The length of the jump set is still two. Once again, the normal is E1. And once again, you violate the contact condition. And you start from here, and you can show that you can still construct a sequence of deformations having finite nonlinear energies and such that the displacement would converge to your limiting one. Would converge to your limiting one. So, and you can do it like this. So, we call this counterexample the comb because you can imagine that you do the following. Take your set on the left. You break it on these lines here and on the squares. Then you take the two, say, comps and you shift one of them a little bit and you move all the squares to the right. Okay, if you do that, once again, your deformation satisfies the CLNS condition. Ness's condition. Once again, your displacements are super nice. But what you can show is that, say, when you look at the behavior of the jump sets, you get a certain quantity here, like a 3 plus 2 times this quotient. The length of the jump of your instead is 2. So what does this tell you? Well, it tells you that actually there is something very wrong going on here because, a priori, if you can construct a country. If you can construct a counterexample like this, you can expect that not even the functional E is the right one. So, what I mean is that if you start playing with this non-interpenetration condition, then you can expect that if you compute the gamma limit in the sense of linearization for your functional, there should be additional terms popping up. And in particular, we conjecture that there should be an additional anisotropic surface term, which should be positive whenever the contact condition. Should be positive whenever the contact condition is violated, and which, in principle, should depend on the orientation and the amplitude of the jump. So, this tells you that the situation is much more involved than we thought it to be in the first place. Now, at this point, we had two choices, right? So either we could try to prove this general gamma convergence result, or we could try to stick to what we have and see when this convergence instead would be justified. And this was our dissection. And this was our second idea, it was our choice. So, what I'm going to tell you now in the second part of the talk is somehow, I mean, to present you some positive results in the case in which you impose a slightly stronger condition on your energies, sorry, on your sequence of deformations, namely that they are energy convergent. And I will tell you in a second what I mean. Before telling you what are our results, I need to be. Telling you what are our results? I need to be a little bit more technical now and specify a couple of things which for the moment I was hiding under the carpet. So, the first thing is, in what sense you have a boundary condition. So, what you actually do is the following. You impose your condition on omega prime minus the closure on omega, and you impose it like this. Basically, you take a very nice boundary condition h, let's say, on w to infinity on the bigger set, and you work in the space. And you work in the space of maps, which are of the form identity plus epsilon h when you are outside of your set omega bar. This is how you impose your boundary conditions on your deformations, and correspondingly, you impose a boundary condition h on the displacement. The second technical point concerns the notion of convergence that you can consider. And this is because I told you that you want to deal with linearization, but when you do linearization, normally you do the When you do linearization, normally you do the following. You start by saying you rescale your non-linear energy. You assume that you work with the formations whose non-linear energies are uniformly bounded. And then you try to establish some compactness for the associated displacements. And the problem is that this kind of argument doesn't work if your bodies can undergo some kind of fracture. And you can see this very easily because, for example, take a sequence of deformations which are like this. Which are like this. So they don't do anything when you are outside of a given ball, and in the ball, they rotate your set. Now, the thing is, if you look at the associated displacements, they are going just to blow up. And the same happens for the gradient. And this is because, morally, what you should do if you want to have some compactness here would have to be to rotate back your deformation whenever you were on the inside ball. Cyborne. And the thing is, there's a way of doing that which relies on this notion of asymptotic representation. So basically, you define your notion of convergence in the following way. You start by having a sequence of deformations which satisfy the boundary condition. And then you want to associate to it a limiting displacement. So to do that, you find a sequence of cachopoli partitions of your sets and a sequence of rotations in such a way that Of rotations in such a way that when you are on those sets, basically you rotate back your deformation morally. Okay, and then you define your displacements not as y epsilon minus the identity rescaled by epsilon, but as this y epsilon rotated minus the identity rescaled by epsilon. And you can show that these things are not so bad. So, because you get all the natural bounds that you can hope for. So, you can control the difference from the symmetric. The difference from the symmetric gradients of these quantities here from the identity in the L norm, and you have some additional estimates depending on a parameter gamma that you fix a priori. The thing is, in addition to that, you can also talk about convergence of the associated displacements. Now, this gets a little bit delicate because when you deal with this kind of linearization in the setting of fraction mechanics, In the setting of fraction mechanics, you always have to take away a bed set, so the set where your displacements might blow up. You can show that this set is not so big and it's not too bothersome in the sense that when you stay away from it, you get convergence of your displacement almost everywhere. You get convergence of the absolutely continuous parts of your symmetric gradients weakly in L2. Lower semicolon. L2, lower semi-continuity of the jumps, and actually on this set, the symmetric grade, see the absolutely continuous part of the symmetric gradient of the limiting displacement is equal to zero. To get this, you rely on a compactness result which was very recently proved by Anton Anchambo and Vito Chrismale. The point is that this U that you obtain is not unique a priori because it depends on partition and rotation, but still this is a nice notion of convergence. Notion of convergence. And it's the one that was introduced in a recent work by Manuel Friedrich. And actually, what he proved was that you have compactness with respect to this notion of convergence. What you can show is that if you start with a sequence of deformations satisfying a boundary condition and having uniform non-linear energies, so a nonlinear energy is uniformly bounded, then you can find a sub-sequence. Can find a sub-sequence and a limit in displacement u satisfying your boundary condition, such that you have this asymptotic representation for the displacements. Okay, so this is the starting point of our analysis, because having this notion of convergence at ends, this is what we proved. So, the first thing that we showed is that if you start with a sequence of deformations satisfying the boundary condition. Satisfying the boundary condition and the CLNSS condition. If you additionally require that the nonlinear energies of your deformation converge to the energy of the limit asymptotic representation that you find, then the limiting displacement satisfies the contact condition. So that's why we talked about energy convergent sequences. So in a sense, if you have a recovery sequence in a classical way, everything goes fine. And the limiting display. Goes fine and the limiting displacement that you obtain satisfies the contact condition. This, of course, is not completely satisfying because you could argue: okay, what if I pick a limit in nice displacement? Can I still approximate it by sequences which have this property here? And the answer is yes, and this is our second result. So, what we showed is that if you start from a displacement satisfying your boundary conditions and the contact condition, then you can Condition, then you can find a sequence of deformations satisfying the CLNSS condition, the boundary condition, and having this U as a syntaxic representation, and such that they are energy convergent sequences, meaning that the nonlinear energies of your deformations converge to the linearized energy associated to your displacement. Now, a couple of words of caution here. The first thing is you, I might have said this a little bit too fast. I might have said this a little bit too fast, but all these results are in R2. And the reason why this is the case is because, in this first theorem, you use a piecewise co-inequality, which only works in dimension two. So there's a technical point where this is the case. And the second thing is every time I'm writing omega and omega prime, you might have noticed that this is in blue. This is not a typo, but it's because actually I'm being a little bit sloppy in the way I'm stating. I'm being a little bit sloppy in the way I'm stating this theorem because I can't really take any set omega and any set omega prime, but there is a technical condition involving the boundaries of these two sets so that this boundary condition behaves nicely. Once again, it's a technical point and I'll be happy to tell you about this in the end if you're curious to hear more about it. Now, what I'm going to do in this last minute, In these last minutes, is to give you really a very, very quick sketch of how you prove these two results. Now, for the first one, which is the most technical one, my sketch is really very sketchy in the sense that I just want to tell you what is the main strategy. And the starting point is the fact that if you work with an almost everywhere approximately differentiable map, you still have a notion of area formula. So you still prove. Formula. So you still prove that, as in 4C1 function, on every measurable set E, basically the absolute value of the determinant of the absolutely continuous part of your gradient is equal to something that plays the role of the classical Banach function that counts the multiplicity of the counter images. And also in this case, then, if you combine the CELAN Elsa condition and the area formula with this notion of Formula with this notion of measured theoretic image, you actually get an equality exactly as in the case of non-linear elasticity. So, this is also why this notion of measured theoretic image is nice. And then the way which we proved that you can go from the Selenatus condition to the contact condition was to argue by contradiction. So, what we showed was that if you start by assuming that you have a rectifiable set with positive length where the contact condition is valid. Where the contact condition is violated, then you can construct some subsets of your set omega where you have a strict inequality here. And the reason why this is super technical is because you do it by blow-up. So you have to do a careful blow-up around the points of the jump set of u and then do a very, say, technical construction to show that you come to this contradiction. So this is why I'm not going to give you the details of. Why I'm not going to give you the details of this, but instead, I want to tell you a little bit more about the proof of the other result. So, how do you show that if you start from a displacement that satisfies the contact condition, you can construct a sequence of deformations that are energy convergent and such that they have U as asymptotic representation. And you do it somehow in a sequence of subsequent steps. So, the first So, the first thing that you show is the following: that you can make this contact condition a ten stronger. So, you start with your boundary datum and with your function, which is dsvd2, and only satisfies this contact condition. And then, what you can show is that you can construct a sequence of displacements that goes there in measure and approximates your limiting displacement, both in the sense of the absolutely continuous part of the symmetric. Absolutely continuous part of the symmetric gradient and in the sense of the convergence of the jumps, but it's such that now the length of the set where the condition is smaller than equality 2 tau n goes to zero as n goes to zero. So in this sense, you're making this condition a little bit stronger. An important thing is that you're not losing anything in terms of energy. So that's why this second and third. So that's why this second and third condition here are important. Once you've done that, then the first step is to show that you can take a map which is in GSPD2 and satisfying the boundary condition and this stronger version of the contact condition, and up to losing some small sets, you can approximate this map by maps in SPV2 which satisfy the same conditions. Now we have to redo it. Now, we have to redo it, but to be fair, the arguments were already there. So you can find it with boundary condition in the paper by Manuel Friedrich. But even his result is in turn just an adaptation of some arguments which were already there in the work by Cortesani and Toader and Chambol and Chrismale. So the nice thing, the bottom and the take-home message is that you were starting with something in GSBD2 and now you end up with something in SBD2 which has Which has a stronger code back condition. Now, once you are there, what you can show is that instead of working with U, you reduce your problem to working with the sequence of maps B epsilon, which are super nice. They are actually W to infinity when you stay away from the jump set. And actually, if you look at the bed set, so let's say the set in which the The scalar product of the jump opening with the normal to the jump set is smaller than this tau epsilon. Well, this bed set is just the union of a finite number of segments, which is called Ti epsilon. Okay, once you got to this point, then you can do basically the following. You can show that if you take these segments, since they are far from each other, you can cover Far from each other, you can cover each of them by very small rectangles. And you do that in such a way that you don't lose anything in the length of the rectangles, and they are very, very tiny. And once you've done that, then you can somehow piecewise describe how you construct your epsilon displacements and your deformations. Because what you do is the following. You take as a displacement this map W epsilon that does the following. W epsilon that does the following. When you are far away from your rectangles, you keep working with your nice map V epsilon. And when you are on the rectangles, you basically just put there some constants in a careful way so that you have the same behavior that we're seeing before in the counter example. So the part that is far away from the rectangles does something, the rectangles do something else. And even when I deform them, they remind. Even when I deform them, they remain completely pairwise disjoint. The reason why you want to do this is because this way you can show that you still have the CLNS condition. Morally, because you only work in small sets and you just have to show that there you're not losing injectivity. So, this is a very, very sketchy idea of the proof, but say the message that I wanted to give you is that. Wanted to give you is that, so in general, these two conditions, so this LN absence condition and the contact condition, are natural by fracture mechanics, but they are not related by a linearization. And somehow, even if you do a gamma convergence analysis, you can't deduce the contact condition from the C L and S condition. But on the other hand, if you are happy enough to work with these sequences, which are not losing anything in terms of convergence of the energy, then the passage from the silenetus to the The passage from the silenx to the contact condition still works, and you can also do a converse approximation. So, I think my time is more or less up. So, you can find the preprint on the archive or on my website. And I thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Lisa. Okay, there is already a question online. Yes, please. Yes, please. Oh, no, it's okay. Can be okay. So, what are the questions? Hi, Elisa. Uh, I wanted to ask you about your counterexample. It seems to me that in fact you have a problem of mass that can escape and be done, but is this problem or not? You can have also mass So, let me go back. So, which counterexample are you thinking about, Flaviana? Is it the first one or the second one? The column, but also the first one with cheap one. If you want to see it here, okay. Yeah, I mean, as you, I mean, one, to be fair, this was the first thing that we tried. So, in a sense, we were okay, once we realized that. We were okay. Once we realized that there was this counterexample, we were thinking: okay, maybe this is because.
