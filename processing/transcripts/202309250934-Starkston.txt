I'm so I'm from the symplectic geometry group and we're doing symplectic and contact geometry. So um my goal is to just give you guys a little bit of a sense of what that means and a little bit about what we're gonna try to work on this week. So feel free to interrupt me at any time to ask questions because yeah, this is meant to teach you all just a little bit about what symplectic You all just a little bit about what symplectic geometry is. It's a little bit of a weird geometric structure. I think for a little counterintuitive. So let me just start out by telling you what is the definition of a symplectic structure. And then you'll see what I mean by unintuitive. So, we're always working on a manifold. So, it's a smooth structure and a smooth manifold. And the extra geometry that we impose is encoded by a two-form, which we always call omega. And it has to satisfy two properties, which is that it should be non-degenerate and closed. So, you know, non-degenerate, like a metric has to be non-degenerate. This is a differential form, so it's anti-symmetric instead of symmetric like a metric would be. Like a metric would be. So, non-degeneracy, you can say, like for any tangent space, for any vector that's non-zero in the tangent space at some point, there should exist another vector in that tangent space such that when I evaluate those two vectors into this form, I get something. Into this form, I get something non-zero. Or I could normalize to say I get one. And so that's the non-degeneracy condition. In the metric case, you can take the non-zero vector in itself, and you get some positive number. But here, because we're anti-symmetric, if we put in a vector with itself, we always get zero. Because when you flip, you have the same thing, and so it's equal to its negative. Equal to its negative. So that's the first condition, and then closed is this kind of more global condition that the exterior derivative of the form is zero. And what this kind of ensures is kind of homogeneity. So if I look near one point in any symplectic manifold, that That looks the same as a sufficiently small neighborhood of any other point in any other symplectic manifold. So there's no notion of curvature, which is a local property. Symplectic geometry has no local invariance. It's locally always the same. But globally, you can have a lot of more interesting properties. So this is a little bit of a This is a little bit of a weird geometry because as a two-form, we can measure some kind of notion of areas of surfaces, but no lengths. We don't have any notion of length that comes out of this. And our area Might not always be positive. So depending on the way that your surface is sitting in your space, your area might be positive, it might be negative, it might be zero, and even kind of local contributions, it depends on kind of the angle, what angle is considered contributing positive. Considered contributing positively towards area versus contributing zero towards area versus negative. And we're always considering everything to be oriented, and so that's how you kind of distinguish positive versus negative. Something that's forced by the non-degeneracy condition is that they're always on even-dimensional manifolds. And so essentially what happens is that this non-degenerate That this non-degenerate sleep condition forces your different dimensions to pair up into pairs which satisfy this condition. And so you can only have these uneven-dimensional manifolds. So a few other kind of properties of symplectic manifolds. Symplectic manifolds, they're nicely compatible with topological kinds of operations where you're trying to do a kind of cut and paste. So they're flexible enough where you can do things in topology that are a little bit more flexible, but you have But you have some additional geometric tools to utilize to learn more about the space. Even when to restrict even-dimensional manifolds, not every manifold, even dimensional smooth manifold admits a symplectic structure. But a lot do. So they're a broad enough class of manifolds that we have lots of interesting spaces to study. But there are some homotopy theoretic obstructions that are easier to calculate. And then there's some more subtle things coming. Things coming from gauge theories, especially in dimension four. This gives some other abstractions. But it's not known in general which manifolds do emit symplectic structures. That's a big, difficult problem. And let's see. Let's see, maybe just a couple of other general facts about symplectic geometry in relation to other fields. There are connections to dynamics, dynamical problems. So I'm going to show you some ways to get interesting vector fields out of some plectic structures. And then the dynamics of the flows of those vector fields are kind of important problems. Kind of important problems in their own setting. And then there are also some connections to algebraic geometry. Especially, you can kind of mimic properties that you have for algebraic varieties and algebraic curves in complex geometry. In complex geometry. And you can do that in symplectic geometry with a lot more work. And the work involves studying partial differential equations and trying to pretend that you have a complex structure when really all you have is an almost complex structure. When really all you have is an almost complex structure. So, a complex structure at the level of the tangent bundle. And so, instead of having integrable charts, you have to solve all these PDEs that are imitating the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So, more work. So, those of you who are studying global analysis problems, that kind of thing shows up in Foundation. That kind of thing shows up in foundations for a lot of tools in symplectic geometry. Okay, so that was just kind of like general overview. Now I'm going to try to do some examples. But are there any questions at this point? Yes, right. So that is kind of one of the abstractions. They have to have an almost complex structure. Okay, so let me just show you some basic examples. So the first thing we can look at is just Euclidean space. It has to be even-dimensional. And here, the standard symplectic form, if we put coordinates. If we put coordinates x1y1 up to xnyn on our space, then the form will look like dx1 rush dy1 up through adding up to dxn much dyn. So that's a two-form, and the kind of non-degeneracy condition pairs the vector pointing in the x1 direction with the vector pointing with the y1 direction. And because of this fact that And because of this fact that I mentioned earlier, which is called Darboux theorem, that locally any manifolds look the same, this is like our standard model for what a symplectic structure looks like locally. So you kind of just split up your coordinate directions in pairs, and that builds up your symplectic form. So if you want to get a little more complicated than Euclidean space, the next example. Space. The next example is to look at the cotangent bundle of any manifold. So n is any manifold, and then the cotangent bundle has double the dimensions of the manifold itself. So that's automatically even-dimensional. And this cotangent bundle, we want to get a two-form. We want to get a two-form for our symplectic form. A cotangent bundle has a very natural way of defining a one-form because the cotangent bundle is the space of covectors. And like covectors are a section of the cotangent bundles of one form. So a point In the cotennium bundle, it looks like maybe a point x in the manifold itself, and then a covector alpha at x. So that's something that eats a vector in the tangent space at the manifold at x and gives you a number. And so let's call this canonical one form lambda canonical. And so the way that it evaluates. And so the way that it evaluates is it's going to take in a point in the cotangent bundle and then a vector tangent to the cotangent bundle. So let me just add one more piece of notation. We have the projection from the cotangent bundle down to the manifold, and we can take the derivative from the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. From the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle m. And so the way that this form is going to evaluate is at a point x alpha x, we take in a vector v in this kind of big tangent bundle. And the way we evaluate is we take alpha of x. rate is we take alpha of x and we input d pi of v. So if we start with v in here, we project it down to the tangent space of m, that's something that we can plug into alpha and get a number. So this is a kind of globally abstractly defined one form that's very natural on the cotangent bundle. And the way that you get a two form from a one form is by taking the exterior derivative. From a one form is by taking the exterior derivative. So the canonical syntactic form is the exterior derivative of this one form. So because d squared is zero, we know that this satisfies the closed condition. For the non-degeneracy condition, the best way to check that is to actually work not in this kind of abstract version of the cotangent bundle, but in actual local. The cotangent bundle, but in actual local coordinates. So if I choose coordinates on my manifold, local coordinates q1 through qn, then they're dual coordinates in the cotangent fiber directions, P1 through Pn. So the idea is any So, the idea is any covector can be written as a sum of some coefficients times the dqis. And so, these are the coefficients. That gives me coordinates on the tangent space directions. And so, if you think about what this canonical one form is in local coordinates, it's just pi dqi. P I and QI. So it looks like exactly the same here. Here I was thinking of this as a one form on M. Here I'm thinking of this as a one form on the cotangent bundle M. So here the Pi's are just numbers, coefficients, and the Qi's are the coordinates on my manifold. Here, both Pi and Pi. Here, both pi and qi are coordinates on my space. Okay, and so then if we take d of this, we can just do our normal exterior derivative, and we see that we get dpi reg dqi summed over all the 1 through n. And so this looks exactly like our normal Rn picture, just renames the coordinates, and so it's non-degenerate. And so it's not the different. So this is the canonical syntactic form on the cotangent model. Questions? Okay, so the next thing I want to do is associate some vector fields with our symplectic structure. So I'm going to try to keep the analogy with metrics not in geometry. So if you have a metric G, G and so we're always on manifold M. Like for me, my life is always on manifold M. So we have a metric and then we have a function, a real value function from the manifold to R. Then what can you do to get a vector field? Gradient, yes. Got the gradient. So So, how do we define the gradient vector field? We take the exterior derivative of a function, that's a one-form, and use the metric, which is non-degenerate, to dualize the one form into a vector field. So, this is the dualizing relationship. Okay, so in symplectic geometry, we still have a non-degenerate form. Have a non-degenerate form, so we can do something similar. So now I'm going to start with a symplectic structure, and I'm going to start with a function similarly to the real numbers, but now I'm going to call it h. And so we're going to do the same thing where we take d of the function and we use the symplectic form to dualize it. And I'm going to call And I'm going to call this vector field Hamiltonian vector field. I'll call it that because that's what people call it. This is not my invention. Okay, and so the Halatonian vector field is defined exactly the same way as the gradient, except now we're using the symplectic form. But because the symplectic form is Is anti-symmetric, the properties of the Hamiltonian vector field look a little bit different than those of the gradient vector field. So we know that. So we know that if we're looking at a gradient, if we compare it to the level sets of the function, the gradient is orthogonal to the level sets. With the Hamiltonian vector field, the opposite happens. So the Hamiltonian is going to be tangent. To the level sets of the function. And basically, the reason for that is, what does it mean to be in a level set? It means that when you plug in the vector field, you get zero. And with this anti-symmetric thing, if you plug in the same vector twice, you get zero. So that's what's happening. So now we have this vector field that's tangent to the level sets. With a gradient vector field, it points in the direction your function is increasing. And so as a consequence of that, there are no closed orbits of the flow, of the gradient flow. It just keeps going up, never comes back to where it started. Whereas with the The Hamiltonian vector field, we expect closed orbits. And counting these orbits or getting bounds on the number of orbits is one of the kind of big problems on the dynamical side of synthetic geometry. So understanding exactly what the situation is with the closed orbits is an interesting problem to study. To study. And then maybe just one more thing that who doesn't have an analog, or maybe you guys know an analog on the gradient side that I don't. If we look at the flow of this Hamiltonian vector field and we look at what happens to the symplectic form as we flow. As we flow, the symplectic form is preserved by the flow. So if I am kind of looking at my symplectic, I'm just like standing in my symplectic manifold and I look around and then I follow the flow of this Hamiltonian vector field, it looks the same as I flow. So the way you can see that mathematically is you look at the Lie derivative. So the Lie derivative in the direction of the spectrum field. In the direction of the spectrum field applied to the symplectic form. So I'm going to use Cartan's magic formula. So this iota means plug in the vector field into this form, the first slot, and then d is the exterior derivative. So this is a way of expressing how the Way of expressing how the form changes as I flow infinitesimally in the direction of this vector field. This second term is zero because my form is closed. So this part is already zero. And so I'm left with this other part. And when I plug in the Hamiltonian, The Hamiltonian into the first slot, that is exactly dh. Yeah, great. So I got d of dh, so d squared is 0. So this flow preserves the symplectic form, and so the flow gives me an isotopy, and that's called a Hamiltonian isotopy. And so people like And so people like these because they're an example of an isotopy which preserves the symplectic form and they're kind of a well-motivated dynamically form of isotopy. So a lot of times people are interested in quantities that are invariant under the under Hamiltonian flow, under Hamiltonian isotopy. It's just a family of diffeomorphisms. So the flow, maybe I call it like phi T, this is the flow of XH. So this will give me every time a diffeomorphism from the manifold to itself. And the fact that it preserves the symplectic form means if I pull back. means if I pull back the symplectic form over here by this diffeomorphism, I get the same form. Laura? Can I add a comment? Yes, please. I think the story starts here actually. Like this wet story starts with time of violence. Yeah. Right. And I appreciate this comment because it's a perfect segue to the very next thing I wanted to say. So yeah, I want to give a little So, yeah, I want to give a little bit of the origin story of symplectic geometry, which comes from Hamiltonian mechanics. So, so far, I've been going a little bit backwards and explaining this. So, let me go back to the beginning. So, let me just say one example of a Hamiltonian vector field, and then we're going to use it. So, let me just look in coordinates. Look, in coordinates, and you could think of this as on R2n or local coordinates on the cotangent bundle. I'll say cotangent bundle for now. I've got qn through qn, p1 through pn. And in those coordinates, my suspected form looked like dqi reg dpi. And so if I take the Hamiltonian That is a function of the q's and the p's. Then dh is just like you look at the partial derivatives with respect to the q's and with respect to the p's. So So you can write it like I've written it as a matrix, or you can write it like dh dq1 times dq1. And then the, yeah, I should do it that way. That's a probably better way of going. So then the dual with respect to the symplectic form is the vector field that if I plug it in here, I get this one form. And so in this case, what I have to do is to get like the dqi terms, I need to sort of kill off the dpi terms. So I'm going to have dh dqi, let me sum over all n's. Sum over all ends, dpi, but it's going to come with a negative sign because the pi gets plugged into the second slot. And then to get these dpi terms, I need to kill off the dqi. And that gets plugged into the first slot, so it's a positive sign. So this is my Hamiltonian vector field dual to a function, and just in terms of the partial derivatives. In terms of the partial derivative. Okay, so let's now go back to the origins of just mechanics and physics. So definitely didn't get to the level of physics of many of the people here who are doing actual physics research, but I did make it through mechanics. And so So the kind of motivation for looking at these Hamiltonian vector fields and symplectric structures comes from reformulating the equations for motion. So there's Newton, Newtonian mechanics, you think about you've got an object or particle moving in space. Moving in space. And you can keep track of its position. So I'm going to use two coordinates, maybe just three coordinates, because we'll just think about being in our three. So we have, this is the position coordinates. And then, you know, equations of motion have to do with position, velocity, acceleration. Velocity, acceleration. So you've got velocity by looking at the derivative of the q-coordinates with respect to time and acceleration. You can take the second partial derivative with respect to time. And then you've got various relations between these and other more constant quantities. Constant quantities. So, you know, this worked very well for writing down some equations of motions, which we'll go a little bit further with in a moment. Hamilton came up with kind of a different perspective on thinking about how to write down these equations. So instead of just writing down coordinates representing position, Hamilton will. Position, Hamilton wanted to write down both your position coordinates, q1, q2, q3, but also to give coordinates for momentum. And so in this kind of R3, or maybe you're in some more general space. In some more general space, manifold, you just keep track of what's your position and you derive the other quantities in terms of that. And of course, you can derive momentum in terms of velocity. So momentum is mass times velocity. And so this is mass times the time derivative of the position. But Hamilton said, like, instead of thinking about momentum in terms of the derivative of position, let's just give it its own coordinates in its own right. And instead of just looking at the coordinates in R3, we're going to look at the phase space, where we have both position and momentum coordinates. And you could think of that as the cotangent bundle of. The cotangent bundle of R3, or more generally, the cotangent bundle of a manifold, where you've got these kind of related to each other. You know, velocity is kind of like a tangent direction. Cotangent, I don't know, it's more or less the same, but works better this way a little bit for the equations. So in this case, momentum P is Is related to Newton's bias Mv. And so, what's the point? Now, we're going to try to write equations of motion. So, we've got kind of Newton way of writing equations of motion and Hamilton's way of writing equations of motion and various other quantities. So, So one quantity that's important is energy. So under the Newton version, the energy, you've got a kinetic energy term, 1/2 mu squared. And then you've got some potential energy, which depends on your position. Which depends on your position. So here's kinetic energy, and here's potential energy. And if you think of it from a Hamilton perspective, instead of velocity, we have momentum. And so momentum and velocity are just related by a factor of the mass. So if I rewrite this in Hamilton version, I've got 1 over 2m and is the And the momentum squared, and then plus the potential energy, depending on position. And I'm going to name this H of PQ. So that's the energy. So Newton's second law of motion is force equals mass times acceleration. And so, how does that relate to the quantities we have? So, force, this is if you integrate the force over your path of your particle, you get the total work done, which is the energy. So, the force and the energy are related by taking the gradient. So, the force is the gradient. Gradient of the potential energy. So just like D V E dq1, D V d Q 3. And the acceleration is second partial derivative of position with respect to time. In the Hamiltonian version, Hamiltonian version, acceleration, instead of being a second-order derivative, is a first-order derivative of momentum. So we can replace the acceleration as like one over a factor of mass times derivative of the p-vector with respect to time. And so, if we write out this second law of motion, we replace force by gradient of the potential. And then MA becomes just the derivative of the momentum coordinates with respect to time. With respect to time. So this equation from the Hamiltonian formulation becomes this equation, which if I just write it out totally, this is dv DQI equals DPI DT. So, okay, here's one equation. And then the other equation that I want to notice is just the relation between momentum and velocity. So yeah, just p i equals Okay, so now we have the equations and we want to say what does this have to do with the seplected geometry in the Hamiltonian vector field. Okay, so this is supposed to be the revealed time. So, okay, here's the energy. This is the Hamiltonian function that I want to look at. And if you recall, the Hamiltonian. If you recall, the Hamiltonian vector field that was associated with that is exactly what I wrote before: dH DPI DQI with a negative yeah that one's a positive sign and then minus dh dqi. So if I look at the flow of this, a flow line is, if I'm kind of moving around in the cotangent space, I'm following the motion of a particle, and I say, okay, what does that path do as my particle moves around? And so what's the change in the p-coordinate? P coordinate and what's the change in the q coordinates. So if I move in the p direction, I'm changing by minus dh dqi. And as I move in the q direction, I change by dh dpi. And so what are the partial derivatives of this equation? partial derivatives of this equation, dh dpi is just 1 over m p i, which is the velocity. So this one is velocity. And that's exactly what this is saying, right? So this second equation of being in the flow of the Hamiltonian In the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field, is just saying my relation between momentum and velocity. And then the first equation: if I take the partial derivative with respect to q, d h d q i, then I get the dv dqi. That's the coordinates of my gradient vector field. And that was exactly this equation: dv dqi equals. D V D Q I equals D P I D T May a negative sign in there. I maybe messed up and there should have been a negative sign here, but that's okay. So this other equation describing the flow is exactly capturing Newton's second law of motion. So at the end of the day, Hamilton kind of reformulated this equation of motion by saying: here's the energy equation, here's the vector field that you can associate to that energy equation, and the way that you can describe position and momentum of any particle moving around in space with this potential is that it's going to follow the flow of that vector field. So it's kind of more like big. So it's kind of more like big picture perspective on how to describe these equations of lotions using a flow. Questions? Okay, so now I'm gonna switch gears a little bit. So remember, symplectic manifolds had to be even-dimensional. And this is kind of a problem because sometimes you like odd-dimensional manifolds. And in particular, if you have an even-dimensional manifold with boundary, the boundary is odd-dimensional. And, you know, sometimes you want to look at manifolds with boundary, especially if you want to cut along a hypersurface and then glue things together. And so we kind of need an analogous structure for odd-dimensional manifolds. And these are contact structures. So this is like odd-dimensional cousin of some plucket structures. So these are a little bit more intuitive in some ways and a little bit less intuitive in other ways. The geometric structure that you keep track of on your manifold is a hyperplane field. So a hyperplane field, as long as it's co-oriented. As long as it's co-orientable, which we generally assume it is, is the kernel of a one-point. So at every point in my space, I'm choosing a codimension one subspace of the tangent space, and then I need it to satisfy a condition which is called totally non-integrable. And what that means is, I don't have any submanifolds whose tangent spaces are the same as these hyperplanes that I'm choosing. So not even locally. I can't make these the tangent space. So it's like the opposite of a foliation. And geometrically, you can measure that non-integerbility by requiring Requiring alpha reg d alpha. If this is a, so it's an odd dimensional manifold. If it's dimension 2n minus 1, then you take an n minus 1 reg power of d alpha together with 1 power of alpha. So that's a top dimensional form, and you want that to be a bottom form. The non-degeneracy condition for symphactic form can also be formulated in this kind of way. Can also be formulated in this kind of way where you say that the top power of the symplectic form is a volume form. So, this is like a contact version of it in odd dimensions. So, there are vector fields associated to contact structures too that are analogous and kind of related to the Hamiltonian vector fields. So, these are called rate vector fields. I'm going to make the French red. Thank you. I'm just going to let my teammates pronounce that. And so this is, if you start with a contact form, meaning the one form whose kernel gives you your contact structure, then you can uniquely define a vector field. So we have not quite nine. Not quite non-degeneracy of this T alpha, but it's sort of as non-degenerate as it can get, which means it has kernel which is one-dimensional. And so the condition of being a red vector field is that you're in that kernel line field of this two-form d-alpha, and then you normalize it by requiring. It by requiring that the one form alpha evaluates as one. So this uniquely defines a vector field, and we can study its flow and orbit. And so this is kind of the analog of Hamiltonian vector field. Okay, so for the rest of the time. Okay, so for the rest of the time, I just want to tell you about some general properties of interest in contact and symphonic topology, some kind of questions, overall questions, and then a little bit about the specific types of questions that we're going to try to work on this week. So for contact manifolds, There's this kind of dichotomy between contact structures which are called tight and those which are called over-twisted. And the idea is over-twisted contact manifolds have some kind of disk, topological disk inside of them, where there's a specific There's a specific kind of model about the twisting of the planes on that disk. And so there's some kind of model, a disk that you want to find somehow embedded in your space. And it could be a very complicated embedding, so it's kind of hard to recognize that. But if you happen to have that property, then the manifolds which satisfy this property are classifiable. So we can classify. So we can classify the contact structures. And the classification is kind of homotopy-theoretical. And you look at bundles and characters to classes and that kind of stuff. Whereas the tight ones, this is like not over-twisted. So this is everything else. So, this is everything else. And the point is: the over-twisted ones are ones where we have these classification results. The tight ones are the interesting ones. Some people might get offended by that, but I'm not sure what this is. And so these are the ones where it's much harder to classify. The sub-manifolds inside of them have more interesting properties. And so this kind of And so this kind of tight area is kind of the place where there's a lot of interesting questions that are holding up. So it's hard to recognize when you have this kind of over-twisted disc in a manifold. It's even harder to say that you don't have an over-twisted disc in a manifold. So recognizing that you're tight can be difficult and Be difficult. And one criterion that ensures that you're type is if your contact manifold shows up as the boundary of a symplectic manifold. So if your contact manifold appears as the boundary of a symplectic manifold, and here I need to put And here I need to put in an adjective, and the terminology in the field is to call it convex, but it's not really the kind of convexity that any other geometer would call convex. So I think it's kind of maybe better to call it positive. There are kind of orientations affiliated with contact and sympathetic structures. Structures and there are also orientations affiliated with the boundary of a manifold, right? So if we have our symplectic manifold with boundary y, then you could ask whether the symplectic orientation, so you've got a symplectic orientation, gives an orientation on your manifold. That gives you a boundary orientation from outward pointing first. And on the other hand, you've got a contact structure that's kind of related to the That's kind of related to the symplectic structure, and the relation is dα is the restriction of your symplectic form to the boundary. And if you have that relation and your orientations match up, your boundary orientation agrees with your contact structure orientation, which you can think of as coming from this, this volume form, then if you're going to be able to do that Volume form, then it's this kind of positive sort of boundary. And if they don't agree, then it's like a negative boundary, which we call concave for whatever reason. And so there's actually a kind of weird difference between a huge difference between convex and concave boundary. So the kinds of contact manifolds that can show up as the positive boundary of a symplex manifold is restricted, whereas every contact manifold can be a boundary. Every contact manifold can show up as the negative boundary of some symplectic manifold. So, the interesting thing is: when can you show up as a positive boundary? And in this case, we call it fillable. Of course, syntactically fillable, and then there are other variations on types of fillability, but I'm not going to get into that subtlety. But the point is, if your contact manifold is fillable, If the contact manifold is fillable, then it's necessarily tight. So we're only getting these kind of interesting geometric contact manifolds on the positive boundaries of symptomatic manifolds. And then maybe one of the things that we have to do is that And then maybe one from the dynamical perspective, if you look at your ray vector field, it will generally have orbits like the Hamiltonian vector field did. And you can look at the homotopy class of those orbits. And you can ask, are those homotopically trivial? Are they contractible orbits? And if it has no contractible orbits, Then the contact structure is tight. So these are, I think, nice geometric ways of recognizing tightness, but they're not sufficient. So there are examples of tight contact manifolds, which are not fillable. They're examples of tight contact structures where the rate vector field does have contractible orbits. Have contractible orbits, and so being able to recognize tightness in those situations is harder. And so, that's kind of one of the things that we're trying to work on. And the tool that we're trying to use to recognize tightness and to kind of test the level of non-fillability or fillability that might be present are certain invariants. Are certain invariants? And there are lots of invariants and some functions topologies that are sort of floor-inspired. And the general setup in these kinds of invariants is you've got one of these vector fields, like a rate vector field or a Hamiltonian vector field, and you build a chain complex. A chain complex, like you do when you do homology, like singular homology or cellular homology, you have a chain complex and you have a differential. And so the chain complex here is you specify it by some generators, and the generators, like over the integers or over some field of your choice, are the orbits. The orbits of your vector field. And then the differential, this uses an almost complex structure affiliated with the symplectic structure. And so you look at some kind of counts of pseudo-holomorphic curves. work like curves which limit to or have boundary on orbits that you're looking at. So these are generally kind of difficult to calculate in practice because this differential is hard. And every time you're trying to do something with pseudo-homorphic curves you have to You have to solve some kind of equation, partial differential equations. And to do that in practice, you usually have to rely on some properties that those curves have to be able to say these curves exist and these curves don't. And so they're different. Like these invariants sort of fall under this general category, the specific one that we're Category. The specific one that we're looking at is called embedded contact homology. And the kind of flavors that distinguish these, the way these invariants are computed, is you put some kind of conditions on what kinds of orbits you're allowed to consider, and you put some conditions on what kinds of homomorphic characters you're supposed to consider. So there's some. So there are some quantities, indices that are associated there, and you calculated that. So our goal is to calculate this kind of invariant and some affiliated quantities that are associated to it to explore tightness and fillability for a certain class of contact mails. Yeah, so I'll leave it there. So I'll leave it there. Any questions? So there were questions, but so out of complete economics, so how is this related with the previous thing we discussed apart from being If you have, so the ray vector field and the Hamiltonian vector field, if you have, so with a Hamiltonian, it kind of was tangent to the level sets of your function. So if you take a function where like the boundary of your manifold is a level set of that function, then you can kind of find a relationship between the Hamiltonian vector. Between the Hamiltonian vector field and a ray vector field, if you choose the right contact form. So these kinds of vector fields are kind of coincide if you set up your data right. Yeah, and I think, yeah, essentially, like you can, you can. You can never, or you can, but a lot of times studying contact manifolds, you really just see them like showing up as hypersurfaces or boundaries of symplectic manifolds. And so that's where our examples are coming from, too, that we're going to study is like we have some kind of larger symplectic manifold and we find like a particular slice, and so kind of restricting that gives us the The contact geometry. And you can kind of go backwards too. So if you start with a contact manifold, that's odd-dimensional. You want even-dimensionally multiplied by another dimension. So multiply by r or an integral. And there's a natural way to write a symplectic form on this. And whenever you have a contact hypersurface of contact-type boundary, you can find kind of a portion. You can find kind of a portion of this space where the symplectic form is given by taking the contact form, multiplying it by this exponential function where t is the coordinate on the extra dimension you pick, and taking the exterior derivative. So like the d alpha was almost non-degenerate, but not quite, and it sort of failed to be non-degenerate in one dimension. And so you kind of make up for that by multiplying by this extra dimension. That by multiplying by this extra dimension, and then you get on here. So you can kind of turn any contact problem into a symplectic problem, and vice versa. Maybe quickly because time's back to the next person. So maybe I can ask you later. Okay, sure, yeah. Let's think more then again. I'm gonna take some more around this minute before. I'm going to take some more amount of minutes before the next talk, but I'm going to say really quickly, we're going to give room assignments because for collaboration, here you guys all go into your own room, supposedly, we're going to put them up on one of those building a tablet. But I need to speak with the leaders of symplectic.
