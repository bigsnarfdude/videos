Hello, everyone. I'm Ray Chen Wong from Peking University, and today my lecture is about analytic study of sound radiation from semi-infinite elliptic ducts with uniform subsonic flow. First, I want to talk about our motivation. As you can see, this is a picture I took from Airbus's official website. It's a next generation. It's a next generation aircraft with a wind body design. This design will reduce the drag and improve efficiency. However, as you can see, the air engine of this aircraft is still the conventional type and just mounted on the back of this aircraft. So it could be better if we can bury the engine, bury half of the engine into the fuel stage and deform the air in. Air intake to much more flatter that will lead us to elliptic duct. So let's first let's see our research model. This is a semi-infinite elliptical duct with a half-major axis length A0 and a half minor axis length B0. A uniform axial means flow is introduced. From XL means flow is introduced with the ideal gas assumption, and the half focal length H0 is a length scale that we will use the full dimensional less later. Now, let me introduce you the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system. As you can see, this coordinate system is an orthogonal coordinate that consists of hyperbolas and ellipses that shared a coincident positive. Coincident both F1 and F2. By simply projecting this elliptic coordinate system along the axis, we will get the cylindrical elliptic coordinate system that we used for our problem. And the duct wall would be expressed by a constant radio variable size zero. Now we make the spatial dimension XYZ, mean velocity V0, acoustic density, time velocity potential, and acoustic pressure dimensionless on its corresponding scale. And we find that the convected wave equation will become like this. This is what the Laplace operator becomes. Laplace operator becomes. And from the velocity potential, we will obtain this three equations. From the velocity potential, we can get the sound pressure and the particle velocity and the acoustic density. Now, we want to emphasize the nature boundary conditions inside our problem. The continuity of the The continuity of the acoustic pressure and the particle velocity across the line segment connecting two foci F1 and F2 use these two conditions. This nature boundary conditions differs from those previous ones in a traditional circular duct because the radial variable cosi equals to zero represents a line segment rather than a point as they do in the circular circumstance. By variable separation, By variable separation, we will have this equation. And first, before we solve the sun radiation from a duct, we first want to work out how the sun propagates inside an elliptic duct. Fortunately, this problem has been thoroughly studied by Lawson and Basque Ran, and we can just substitute this. Substitute this, sorry, we can just substitute the separated functions into the convected wave equations and get the two separated equations. And the further separations of the equation 10 will lead to the angular Marshall equation and the radial Martial equation. The general solution of these two Marshall equations are equation protein. Equation 14 and 15. We can consider now we need to consider the natural boundary conditions we mentioned earlier. This term is about the radial angular variable eta. This term is about the radial variable cosine. And we just multiply this to this. There will be. This there will be four combinations of these four terms: CEMC, CEEMS, SEMC, and SEMS. The neutral boundary conditions will give us a result that only these two terms need to be kept, and the other two terms has no physical meaning. These two terms, the CE and the SE, refers to the angle. Refers to the angular Martial function of even form and old form respectively, and the MC and MS represents the radio martial functions of even and old form respectively. And the superscript one here represents the first count. You can just the first count radio martial function is quite likely to the quite similar to the Quite similar to the Basil function. And if you change this to the second kind, it's something like Neumann function. If you change this to the third kind, it's something like Hanko function. The first kind, the conjugate of Hanko function. So this is the general solution that confirms the neutral boundary conditions. Next, we consider the boundary conditions. Next, we consider the boundary conditions on the ductor wall. This is a simple rigid wall boundary conditions. As I mentioned before, the cosi zero express a duct wall and partial cosi over partial cosi is a radial velocity and normal velocity equals to zero. So substitute our general solution into these boundary conditions and These boundary conditions, and we will have these characteristic functions. I need to mention that there is a for all eta here, so the only non-trivial linear independent solutions can be found by only taking either m say prime equals to zero with b m zero or m s prime equals to zero with a m zero. Only these two situations. And by solving either. and by solving either or the either this or these characteristic equations we will have the q mn remember that these two q m are usually not identical we can just choose one two so and uh finally we will without lose of generality we only consider the even for martial functions and get the elliptic mode expression it's like something like this Uh it's like something like this. Here I noted uh the elliptic duct mode patterns of different radio and angular and radio order. Here I use N0 to represent the plane wave. Some researchers may use may just take out this plane wave situation as Plane wave situation as a special case and use and name this thing as zero, name this thing as n1 and so on. It's just a personal habit. I think both are okay. And now remember that we have the variable separation before the connected. Uh, to the connected wave equations. So here we have a we have a dispersion relation relations that connected the parameter Q to the XL wave number mu. And by resolving the QMN, the corresponding XL wave number mu has also been resolved. It can be expressed as this function, as this equation. function of this equation and hence the way propagates inside the duct can be expressed as equation 23. Okay now we since we have worked out our incident wave we want to try to find the scattered wave. We define the half-range Fourier transforms beta minus and beta plus. Beta minus is Beta minus is the transform of started wave s with respect to the axial wave, axial special variable z from negative infinity to zero and beta plus from zero to positive infinity. Here, u is a dimensionless action wave number, then we have the The summation of beta minus and beta plus as a conventional Fourier transform. Remember, this beta now represents the scattered wave. Similarly, we can obtain this function, this equation. This equation, here we dominate the annoying partial over partial z terms into this parameter, lambda. This parameter lambda. Lambda can be expressed by u and m. Now, this is something we have familiar with. It can be further separated and becomes the angular and radio martial equations. The parameter here is the q and q equals to omega square, lambda square over 4 is a function of u. Overflow is a function of u. The solution of 30 and 31 with arbitrary parametric coefficients b 0 kappa and b 1 kappa would be like this. Here we express the scattered wave as a series expansion of angular Martial function, which has a pair. function which has a parameter of capital Q and we want to use the beta kappa to express this the coefficients of this series expansion and the beta kappa can be written into a matrix form as this equation 34 where d0 and d1 are diagonal matrix of radial Marshall functions and Radio Marshall functions and B0 and B1 are column vectors of the complex antitude B. Now the radio displacement of the sound particles on the vortex sheet is defined as here also although we use the vertex sheet, the concept of vertex shape, the case our studied involves no vertex shape because it's a Vortex shed because it's a uniform flow. So no coup condition, no vertex shading, shading. It's just some concept that we used to express the feature boundary that for Z greater than zero and cosi equals to cosine zero. The particle displacement W etaz on the vortex sheet is related to the particle. Is related to the particle velocity as these two equations. And the continuity of the acoustic pressure across the vortex sheet is equation 42. As you can see, this is the material derivative of the scattered wave and the material derivative of the scattered wave plus incidence wave from inside the virtual boundary. And the boundary condition. And the boundary condition of the rigid wall is partial in this equation 43. Now we have found the vital, crucial element of the linear HOPES technique. They mixed the boundary conditions. This is for Z greater than zero. This is for less than zero. So we need to further introduce the half-range Bourier transforms. Fourier transforms. It's something like equation 44, 45, and 46. Here, F plus is with respect to the particle, radio particle displacement on the vortex sheet, and G stands for the G is the transform with respect to the scattered wave. The difference of The difference of velocity potential. Note that here we have the scattered wave from outside the vertex sheet minus scattered wave over from inside the vertex sheet. This difference is just the incident wave, and the incident wave is something we already know. And it's a mode distribution plus the XL wave. Plus the XL wave number of the incident wave, and hence our G plus G plus is for the greater than zero. By performing the incident wave, by performing 60 46 to the incident wave 23, we obtain this equation. The expression of G plus is already known. Now we turn to the key part of this theoretical. To the key part of this theoretical development, the distribution of almost all continuous and integral functions, periodic functions along the angular variable eta. For example, m beta can be decomposed in a method that imitates the Fourier series expansion. The basis function of this decomposition shall be the angular Marshall functions of integral orders with the same parameter that has say Q. Then F beta can be written in the Then, f beta can be written in the series form. The rationale behind our assumption is quite straightforward. Actually, we can still, we can further prove the orthogonality conditions as follows. If you are interested, you can read the references. And at this stage, it is important to clarify that the functions we intend to decompose are not arbitrary, they all arise from an They all arise from an even from elliptic mode as indicated by equation 23. And remember, we have the orthogonality relations between even and old formed angular Martial functions. So it is safe to assume that our G plus function can only be expressed only be expressed by the series expansion of the even form radio angular Martial functions. Remember that G plus is something that arise from the even form elliptic modes. And similarly we have the series expansion of G minus and F plus. Here G plus is something we are already known but G minus and F plus is something unknown and we need to use the linear hope technique to those Technique to those them later. Now, by performing a Fourier transform along the XL direction Z to 41 and 42, we obtain these two equations. As you can see, the left-hand side is a material derivative of the F plus is a radial displacement. The Fourier transform of Uh, the Fourier transform of radio displacements on the vertex shape, and the beta is a scattered wave, the Fourier transform of the scattered wave on the vortex shape, similar to this equation. So, this is physically correct. And next, substitute the series and comparing the coefficients, we have pin these two equations and here. And uh here uh the F plus is a column vector okay uh now the continuity conditions across the vortex shape and the boundary condition of the rigid wall that that is the our crucial mixed boundary conditions gives us the most important linear hop equation and here we can extract We can extract the kernel function as this equation 65. Now we need to first we need to analyze the behavior of the kernel function on the complex U plane. As shown in figure 5, as shown in this figure, since Q equals to omega square, lambda square over 4, the regularity conditions Overflow, the regularity conditions of the radio martial functions require that you can only take the value within this analytical strip defined by the half-planes R minus and R positive, where the half-planes are defined as this equation. And the kernel splitting, kernel factorization should be really simple because it's just a diagonal matrix and Just a diagonal matrix, and the kernel spating is just a repetition of the scalar kernel factorization. We can finally find the solution following Liwell theorem. We find the solution of the F plus for three different sequence patterns. M equals to zero the static uh flow, and uh m greater than zero the outline flow, and less than zero the inlight flow. Less than zero, the inlet flow. Then, this scattered field is calculated by performing the inverse Fourier transforms. This is the expression of the scattered field velocity potential, and the sound pressure can be easily derived from this velocity potential. Okay, and now it is of Now it is of great practical value to assessment to assess the sound field scattered back, reflected back into the duct. So we first write out the model decomposition of the scattered sound pressure field inside the duct. It's like equation 72. And here, C and N are complex entities and the reflection coefficients of one single instance. Coefficients of one single incident elliptic mode, Mn, are defined as this equation. Following Renscher and Gebart and Estley's work, the coefficients C Mn can be reflection coefficients can be calculated by evaluated by calculating the residual of the integrand as a corresponding acoustic pulse. This integrand. Acoustic pulse. This integrand means the integral expression of velocity potential all always says the sun pressure expression. Here we have the expression of the reflector coefficients. And this is the reflection modal spectrum of instantaneous sound pressure level showing with respect to angular and radial elliptic modes. And radio elliptic modes. Here, the figure A, the incident mode is Mn equals to 4, 1, and for figure B, the incident mode is Mn equals to 6, 0. Here is some, for the completeness of this work, we also perform independent FEM infinite element. affinite element mesh numerical simulations and this is our configurations for both theoretical model and numerical simulations and this is our setup for the numerical simulations this is a comparison between the numerical simulations which is expressed as the Expressed as the dotted line and the Winnier-Hof model, which is expressed as red solid line. The far-field directivity are compared in this figure. Three assessment plan is used. As you can see, the first column is a major axis plane, and the second column, the Second column, the minor axis plane, the third column, the XY plane. And the comparison of the SPL results shows great coincidence. We also have some near-field comparison results. Here, the first column is the results from the From the Vinyl-Hoff technique, and the second column is a result from the numerical simulation. And the first row is a result on the major axis plane. And the second row is a result on the minor axis plane. Note that there is some dotted line that represents a boundary between Boundary between simulation between calculation domains and the perfectly matched layer that used for adopting the far-field radiation conditions in numerical simulations. It is admitted that the computational domain is a little small and the results may be iterate, but since it's Uh, but since it's a three-dimensional simulation, the computational cost is really high, and that's the best I can do as far as now. And we also changed the incidence wave and get some different results comparison. Uh the the near field, acoustic field uh are really similar. Are really similar. And here is the comparison of the sound pressure level, which is also has great coincidence. Okay, that's all of my lecture, and I'm happy to hear any question from you.
