First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation and in particular for putting together so many different and related topics during this week. In this talk, I would like to present a result in A result in collaboration with St. Georg Kim from Seoul, and it is about solutions that blow up in infinite time for a flow that is a perturbation of the Yamabe flow. So, let me start with recalling what is the Yamabe flow, which has been already introduced in this. Already introduced in this conference. So if you have a manifold, a compact, smooth manifold with a metric G0 and dimension greater or equal than 3. Then the Yamabe flow is an intrinsic flow that modifies the metric following this law. This law, where this capital S of G t is the scalar curvature of the metric of the evolving metric GT and S bar is a constant along the manifold is the average and it's depending on only on T. So this flow has This flow has been introduced by Richard Hamilton in the context of the study of the Yamabe problem. The reason is the following. You can prove that if you have a metric GT that flows following this Yamabe flow, then at any time T, GT. Time t, g t belongs to the same conformal class as G0. So if you let this flow go and at a certain point in time you find that the scalar curvature is constant as a function in the space variable, then you have solved the Yamabev problem. So Hamilton introduced Problem. So Hamilton introduced this flow as an alternative approach to the Yamabe problem. So as I said, this flow preserves the conformal structure, which is very good because you can put the Yamabe flow in terms of the conformal factor. The conformal factor that relates gt and g naught. So gt and g naught belong to the same class of equivalence. So there exists some positive function here that relates gt with the g naught. And if you write this conformal factor exactly in this way, where ut is a scalar function, the flow becomes. The flow becomes this semi-linear parabolic equation on the manifold M. Here, P is the critical Sobolev exponent, and you have some degenerate parabolic operator here. Laplace sub G0 is. Then sub G naught is the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold on the original manifold M, Mg naught. So this is now a scalar equation and you can define an energy related to this part of the equation and you can define for any manifold Manifold the Yamabek constant, which is nothing but the infimum in the class of functions that are not identically zero on M of the energy I written above. Now, this Yamabek constant is a number and it is a conformally invariant. So, if you have another metric conformally equivalent to G0. Conformally equivalent to G0, the Yamabe constant is the same. So, what is known, these are classical results about the Yamabe flow. So, the result can be summarized as follow. The flow exists for any time until t equals, so capital T is infinity, and you converge to a metal. And you converge to a metric of constant scalar curvature when time t goes to plus infinity, meaning that the solution in terms of the conformal factor u remains bounded at as t goes to infinity. And this proof is more or less easy or classical when, sorry, there is a missing zero here, when the constant, the Yamabe constant is less or equal than zero, but the Equal than zero, but the proof is quite involved in the other case when the Yamabe constant is positive. In fact, it has been proven this result by several authors and in particular as many of these problems related to the Yamabe problem, there is a difference between low dimension, low mean. Dimension low meaning 345 and higher dimension. In fact, Swetlik and Struve approved the resulting dimension in low dimension with energy bound and Brendel first removed the bound on the energy and then covered the other dimension, the higher dimension. All this flow converged to a constant scalar curvature with exponential. Curvature with exponentially fast. And let me mention there is this result by Carlotto, Chodosh, and Rubinstein that provide examples of convergence with polynomial rate. Now, in all this proof, in these classical results, there are two steps that are fundamental in the proof, which is the first step is you The first step is you must be able to find a test function, a family of test functions. Here it is called u bar p epsilon. P stands for a point in the manifold and epsilon is a small parameter. So that the energy I introduced before, and you compute it on your test function, is below the Yamabe constant. This is a constant, universal constant. A constant, universal constant, the ammobile constant of the sphere with respect to the round metric. And moreover, this family of test function, they have to converge to the standard bubble. So to w of xi, let me be precise. So u bar is defined on the manifold. Is defined on the manifold around point P on the manifold. You can describe points in a neighborhood of P via the exponential map, which itself is defined on the tangent space at P of M. So you can identify this psi with a point in Rn. So after you do this, you pass to the You pass to the limit and you find that the W of Ïˆ, which is the usual bubble, positive solution with the finite energy of this equation. And all the other positive solutions are given by translation and scaling of this fixed profile. So we observed, I mean, that That okay, so so if you if you just modify a little bit the energy functional, namely in in the equation you add a linear term. So you you introduce this little h, it's a smooth function in m, and you assume that it is positive in m or at least somewhere in along the manifold. Then you cannot find any more. Then you cannot find anymore any test function that satisfy A and B. A and B are the basic tool to prove the result for the Yamabe flow. Let me give an example. If you are in dimension greater or equal than seven and you take, say, a bump, one of this bubble, rescale. Bubble rescaled, and you compute the energy at those objects. Then you can find that the main order term is what you want to compare with your energy, so the Yamabe constant of the sphere. And then you have two further terms. The first, it's a polynomial in epsilon. The first is epsilon squared. The first is epsilon squared multiplied by your perturbation h. And then you see a term coming from the geometry, which is the norm square of the vial tensor evaluated at the point P, together with the epsilon to power 4. So there is no way that this can be bounded from below by y. From below by y of sn. In fact, you can simply show that this is bigger than y of sn for all epsilon small. So the two key steps to prove global existence and moreover convergence to a bounded metric with a The constant scalar curvature, you cannot do it if you slightly, if you perturb the equation. So the question we were interested in was, well, what happens to the Yamabe flow? Is it still true that if you perturb in this way, this is the way it is perturbed, so H is here. So, H is here. The flow, you have global existence, and as time goes to infinity, you stay bounded. Well, and what we prove is that this is not anymore the case. In fact, we can find initial conditions. Initial condition for which this flow is defined for any time, and as time t goes to plus infinity, the solution is not bounded, it blows up, and it blows up exactly in the form of a bubble, of one of this object W for a scaling factor mu, which itself depends on time. Depend on time. And in the language I introduced before, having this object to blow up means that the mu of t, the function, the scalar function mu of t goes to zero here as t goes to plus infinity. So the result is as follow. Assume that the dimension of the dimension you are working with is greater or equal than five. Width is greater or equal than five. And that if you consider the energy, the perturbed energy, and you compute the infimum, so this new constant is positive. For instance, if your original manifold has Yamabe constant positive, you can find H if it doesn't have a certain LP norm too big by. Too big by using a Holder inequality, you can prove that still this inequality is true. Okay, so assume you have a point, so assume your function H, the perturbation H, is positive at a certain point in your manifold. Then we can find an initial data use at a zero so that. zero zero so that letting the flow evolve the solution blows up as t goes to plus infinity and it blows up exactly at the point zeta zero how does this blow up blow up so the solution if you look at it around in a neighborhood on the manifold around the zeta zero is more or less a bubble. A bubble while a bubble, a scaled bubble, with this mu that goes to zero with this rate. So it goes to zero as t goes to plus infinity. So the bubble is blowing up. And the rate of blow up is given by this relation. And saying that the bubble And saying that the bubble is centered at the point zeta zero is equivalent to say that this xi of t converged to zero. And we also have the rate of convergence to zero in terms of t of the point. Moreover, if you are far from the point zeta zero, the solution is given. In fact, this is given. Is given by g. This is a bounded function. This is the Green's function multiplied by this function here that since mu goes to zero, this becomes very, very small. So this factor here gives us quite an amount of problem because if you have something small here, Small here, the part with the u sub t degenerate. And this is complicated in order to have estimate, to solve some linear equation. We can prove this result also if you have several points on which the h is positive. So with So, with multiple blow-up points. And also, we have a result about the stability of this phenomena under a further geometrical assumption on the manifold. So, say here there are k points. Let me take this. me take this L equal to one, just one point. So we have this point at zeta zero where the h is positive and where we have blow up. And you can compute the Ricci curvature tensor at this point zeta zero. This is just a matrix, n by n matrix defined on the tangent space at the manifold at the manifold at the point zeta zero. At the point zeta zero. So you can this matrix is symmetric and you have eigenvalues. So if you have a bound on the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature tensor, then you can prove the following, that there exists a one co-dimensional manifold. I am just talking about one point, so a one co-dimensional manifold inside this space. Inside this space that contains the initial condition you found before, so that if you have another point in this manifold relatively close to that initial condition, then the solution to the perturbed Yamabe flow blows up exactly at one point. That solution with the initial condition U0. So we need this condition on the Recurvature tensor to prove stability. We don't need it to prove existence. So let me first mention that this work is related with other constructs. Construction. Let me mention which ones and the main difference with what is already known in the literature. So in this paper with the Cortasa Randelpino, we consider the similar problem for the Fujita problem, the critical Fujita problem in the flat case. And the difference here. And the difference here is the flat case, and also that in that case, the parabolic equation was non-degenerate. In this other paper by Dascalo, Apoulos, Delpino, and Sessum, they constructed an ancient solution for the Yamabe flow, so not the perturbed Yambabe flow, but for the Yababe flow, but for the Yababe flow in Sn. It's also a manifold, but it has a lot of symmetries, so we couldn't really use their tool to treat a general manifold. Now, there is this paper by Sira Wei and Zhang, in which they consider fast diffusion and the vanishing infinite time of fast diffusion with a critical sobo. Fast diffusion with a critical Sobolev exponent that can be restated in terms of another problem where you look at infinite time behavior. And the difference with this paper is that they are in the flat case. Now, during this conference, well, there has been a lot. There has been a lot of results, presented a lot of results concerning fast diffusion equations and their extinction rate together with not only in the flat case, but also on manifold. This author, I think they work mainly with complete manifold, not compact manifold. But yeah, so let me mention. Briefly something about the construction, so something about the proof. The proof of this result is done by building almost at hand an approximate solution. And we need to be extremely precise with this approximation. With this approximation, because not only close to the point where you have blow-up, so there we see the bubble, and furthermore, we need to see an extra term in the expansion close to the blow-up point. But also far away, because far away we need control on the solution to treat the term in the equation. The term in the equation which degenerates if the solution goes to zero. And after we build the approximation, we can find in a neighborhood close to the approximation a true solution. And the difficulty here is to find the right topology where to look for the purse for the perturbation. For the perturbation. So let me explain more or less how we built the approximation. So we have our point zeta naught on the manifold. So we have a geodesic ball containing the manifold and a point zeta in this ball that can be expressed through the Expressed through the exponential map where x belongs to the tangent of m at the point zeta zero. And we can even introduce expanded variables. So x, which can be identified with the point in Rn, can be written in this way. And I will talk about y as the expanded variable, because in this way, Variable, because in this way, in the y variable, you basically zoom what you are doing close to the blow-up point, zeta zero. And let me introduce G. G that appeared in the statement of the result is just the green function. And since we are assuming that the Yamabe constant associated to this. Constant associated to this perturbed energy functional is positive, G exists and it is positive on M. So the approximate solution has to be built very, very well. So it has this shape: you have a constant here that you don't care. Then there is the Green's function, then there is a function v1. And this function And this function v1 changes meaning depending on whether you are at a distance less than a delta zero from the lower point, in which case it's like the bubble multiplied by x to power n minus two. This is the behavior of the green function. So this green function and this x to n minus two, they cancel, and what survives is just the green. Is just the green, the bubble. And far away, well, far away, not that far away, at 2 delta 0, we simply put this v1 as mu to power n minus 2 divided by 2. And so the function looks like what I described before, something that goes to zero multiplied by the Green's function. And in the middle, we have to carefully design something that... design something that glue or or trans i mean you transition from this region to the other region is in a smooth way okay and in fact we because yes we we need this function to be smooth so um you want to uh um to find the solution u To find the solution u of this equation, so if I introduce this s of u, this operator here, I want u to to be equal so that s of u is equal to zero. And you can compute this operator on your first approximation, and you can see that this operator on the first approximation multiplied by a proper constant can be described as. Can be described as the sum of two objects. The first object depends on Î¼, and in Fourier modes in y, it is of mode 0, so it is a radially symmetric function in y. And E1 depends on mu and xi, and it is of mode 1. And E0 and E1, they are extremely explicit. There is a term in both. In both that are related to the derivative in time of the parameter, and then other term which can be explicitly computed. This CIs are constant. You see the scalar curvature. You also see the Ricci tensor appearing in both cases. So, if you want to improve So, if you want to improve this approximation, it's already a good approximation because the error is of size mu square and the mu squared is going to zero. But if you want to improve, you need to adjust the mu and the psi. And this is driven by the following orthogonality condition, okay? Because you want to solve a linear elliptic operator whose solvability in the class of functions that decay. In the class of functions that decay is guaranteed, provided you have the right-hand side satisfying certain orthogonality conditions. These are the orthogonality conditions that gives you the size of the parameter. So the parameter mu solves this ODE. So you are lucky here to have h to be positive. So mu dot is negative. And from the first equation, you get that the solution is like this with a That the solution is like this with a positive constant c for the point Ïˆ, you have this system. So, this is Ïˆ dot, then minus 1 over t, say a constant divided by t times the matrix, the Ricci curvature tensor, R. And you can solve this always. In what sense? You can solve obtaining a solution that goes to zero as T. Solution that goes to zero as t goes to infinity, regardless of the eigenvalue of the matrix. You can always solve to have a solution that decays at infinity. You cannot always solve if you also want a control of this Ïˆ at zero. So the stability. In the stability, we need a control on the eigenvalue. Control on the eigenvalue of this matrix. And this is why the condition I mentioned before. Okay, so sorry, maybe I took some few extra minutes. So thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Monica, for a very beautiful talk. Is there any question? So, I just have a small remark. So, you mentioned that in the case where the perturbation is positive at some point, then you have blow up at the same point, right? Yeah, so I just wanted, because I got lost a bit at some point, if you could explain me a little bit better what happens in the case of multiple blow-up, that multiple points. Multiple blow-up, yeah, that's multiple points. Yes, well, this blow-up are a sort of object that are independent one from the other. So if on your manifold, the function h is positive in, say, two point two points that are separate, I mean, two different points. Then you have blow-up as time you can construct an initial condition so that the solution blows up at those two points. This is the result. So it is enough that on each point the function h is positive to produce. Is positive to produce this even in the multiple blow-up case, this situation. Okay, thank you. Any
