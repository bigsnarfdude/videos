Progress on the pathetic fronts in bicycle equations. It is a joint work with Franz La Amber and Xinyang. We studied the traveling wave theory for the bi-stable equation. Here, the bistable means the nonlinearity has three zeros, zero to one, and the intermediate is set up. Okay, for this classical equation, the travel. Classical equation, the traveling wheel theory is well known. It is established by Aronson Winberg and Pfeiffer McNaught. And we know that for this phi stable equation, it has a five-minute wave collecting the two stable steady state one and zero. And the profile phi is discretion and unique up to shifts. And the speed C is unique. And also the speed C has a sign of the integration of F. sign of the integration of f over 0 and 1. And if the steady state 1 and 0 is non-degenerate, then the wave is globally a symptomatic stable. Okay, so this theory has been extended to more generation, more citations in several directions. So today I want to talk about the traveling phenomena in the specially periodic The specially periodic media. So, this is our equation. We assume that the diffusion coefficient A and the reaction term F depend on X. And we assume that it's periodic. A and F are one periodic in X. So in our equation, AX over Air and F over Air is AI periodic, and A is a positive constant. It models the oscillation of the median. Oscillation of the media. So if air is small, so oscillation is rapid. And if the air is large, the oscillation is slow. Okay, as a nonlinearity, we assume that it has a biostable form. So for any x, f has three zeros, zero, one, and the intermediate one is zero x. And we assume that f is negative in the interval from zero to zero x, and it is positive in this. And it is positive in the interval from zeta x to one. And for mathematical reasons, we also assume that the three zeros are non-degenerate. And a typical example is this cubic non-reality. Here, theta x ranges strictly between 0 and 1. It is one periodic. Okay, so in the literature, it is known that for the periodic equation, the symbolic. Quotion: The symbolic behavior is described by the passing front. Okay, this is the definition of the passing front. So I think almost all the audience are familiar with this definition, so I will skip this slide. Okay, so for this periodic equation, the main problem is the existence, uniqueness, and stability of passive. Stability of passidine fronts and also the effect of the spatial heterogeneity. And in the bi-stable case, the first difficulty appears in the ecosystem part. This is because due to the spatial heterogeneity and so between the area and one, the parabolic equation may have many, have multiple air periodical steady state between the area and one. State between 0 and 1. So, this may prevent the existence of pathetic front collecting the extremely steady state one and 0. So, nevertheless, there are still many people studying this problem. Here I missed some of the reduction. Actually, the existence problem was first studied by Jack Xin. And now, it is known that the existence of hold under the abstract. Under the abstract assumption of a bi-stable structure. In this sense, 0 and 1 are two linearly stable steady state, and any air periodic steady state strictly between 0 and 1 is linearly unstable. And this is proved by two different approaches. One is by Fang and Zhao, and another one is by Dikoho, Kineti, and Matano. And this result also extended to the multi-dimensional case. To the multi-demand case. So, next, I will review some reduction in my work with Jamir and because the present work is a follow-up of this work. And in this work, we give some explicit conditions which ensure the bi-stra-structure when the period is small or large. Okay, so the first in the case when the period is small, we assume that this homogeneous equation has a traveling wave with non-large speed. So here for this homogeneous equation, H is the harmonic mean of the diffusion coefficient. Sorry. And F bar is the average reaction over one period. So, our conclusion is that for this periodical equation, for all small air, there exists a unique passing front with non-zero speed. And when air goes to zero, the front speed converges to C0. Here, C0 is the speed for the homogeneous equation. And also, the front convergence as L goes to zero. Okay, so in the small Okay, so in the small periodic case, we have the existence and the convergence. Next, when the period is not, we assume that the integration of f with respect to u over one and over the area of one is positive for all x. And for all large errors, and this periodic equation has. Here, this periodic equation has a unicapacity front with positive speed. And similarly, if this integration is negative for all x, then the existence also holds. And in this time, the speed is negative. But I notice that this theory only gives the existence. So, a natural question is: when L goes to paras infinity, the asymptotic. The asymptotic behavior of the front speed. And the second question is: when air goes to plus infinity, the asymptotic behavior of the front profile. So today I will mainly discuss the first question, and if I have time, I will go to the second one. Okay, let me first review some learning results about the feature-KPB question. So, in the fisher-KPB case, it's real. It is well known that for any air, there exists a minimum wave speed, and this speed is linearly determined. And by this linear determinacy, Naren proved that the minimum wave speed is non-discreting in air. And in several papers by Hamir and his cross-sellers, they give the explicit formula of the limit as air goes to zero and as air goes to zero and as air goes to plus infinity uh but in our bi-stable case we think the problem is more more difficult because the unique front speed c year is not linear determined and also the speed is not a monotone in air in general okay next i will give our reduction on the convergence of the wave speed as air goes to plus infinity So intuitively, this is our periodic equation. Intuitively, when air is not, so this equation is close to our homogeneous equation in the local space. So next, if we freeze the coefficient at some point Y, then we get the homogeneous equation. Okay, here Y is a freedom point. Then we have assumed that the And we have assumed that for any while, f is a bistable pattern. So there is a trivial wave. Of course, the profile and the speed of the triangle wave depends on the freedom point Y. So we get a speed function from Y to Cy. And this function is C1, one periodic, and it has a fixed sign. It has fixed sign because we have assumed that this integration is positive for our... Is positive for our x. And our results show that as L goes to parse infinity, the passing frank speed converges to c star. So here, c star is the harmonic mean of this speed function. Okay, so this theorem gives the convergence and also gives an explicit formula for the image. For that, for that, for that image. Okay, next, before I talk about the strategy of the proof, I would like to first give some consequence of our convergence theorem. So the first consequence is as air goes to plus infinity, the speed C A can be classified according to the size of this integration. To the side of this integration, so if this integration is positive for all x, then c is positive and the c l converges to c star s l goes to pass infinity. Okay, so similarly, if this integration is negative for all x, then c l is negative. And in this time, the speed also converges to sysa. Okay, but on the other hand, if this integration change size, creation change size with respect to x, then the wave blocking phenomena will happen when AI is large. So this means the wave speed is equal to zero and the France is stationary. Okay, the last statement is a consequence of my earlier work with Hamir and Etsa in 2015. Okay. Then the next consequence is about the effects of the spatial heterogeneity on the function speed. So, in this case, I consider the particular example. Here, f is a cubic nonlinearity. Here, C d x ranges between 0 and 1 half. So, the integration of f with respect to u is positive for Rx. So, let me. x. So let me first consider the case where the heterogeneity appears only in diffusion, only in diffusion. So in this case, zeta is a constant between one and a half, and x is a truni periodic function. And we denote c0 and c star by the limit of c l as l equals to zero and as l equals to plus infinity, respectively. And because our convergence result, we have the explicit That we have the explicit formula for C0 and C star. And it is not difficult to compare that. C0 is strictly less than C star. So this means the propagation in the slowly oscillating media is faster than that in the rapidly oscillating media. So this phenomenon is similar to the feature-KBB case. But on the other hand, if the heterogeneity of hand if the heterogeneity appears only in reaction so it means the diffusion a is a constant and c d x is a is a one periodic function then in the in this case we can compare that c0 is strictly greater than c star so this is in sharp contrast with the fisher-kbb case okay so this particular example already indicates uh indicates that uh for the biasteopic corrosion the oscillation Big question: the oscillation in reaction and in diffusion have different effects on the front speed. Okay, so next I will explain our idea for the proof of the convergence. In the first step, we take the large time and the large space scaling. So take a t to ART, x to ARX. So this is a rescaled equation. Scaled equation and the corresponding passing front is transformed in this way. Okay, let's look at the risk scale equation. So when air goes to pass infinity, so because of small diffusion and a larger reaction, so the solution for this equation with a given initial data will be developed into an interface in a short time. And the motion of this interface. And the motion of this interface has been extensively studied by many people in both the ice double case and the Fisher-KPV case. Notice that the our equation is one-dimensional, so there is no curvature effect, and the motion of the interface is only driven by the unbalanced non-linear edge. Okay, so next I will review a nice result, you know, much earlier paper by. In a much earlier paper by Gattanab for the motion of the interface in the bi-stable case. Okay, here G is initial function, it's a founder night. Okay, gamma zero is in the section set of gx with zeta x. Here, zeta x is in the medial zero of the function f. And V A is a solution of the risk equation with initial function g. Then as AR goes to pass infinity, As a goes to pass infinity, the asymmetrical behavior of v is described in this way. Here, rho x, gamma, d, rho is a sign distance function defined in this way. And remember that Cy is a wave speed for the homogeneous equation with a Fourier coefficient. So it means that as air goes to infinity, the motion of the The motion of the V air is independent of the initial function g. And it also suggests that as air goes to infinity, V air propagates at a mean speed equal to C star. Okay, C star is the limit. So from Galileo results, so if we can choose if we can choose the initial function, if we can choose the profile. If we can choose the profile from processing profile as function, so almost everything is done. But the problem is, in colour with that, the initial function t is independent of air, but for the profile of our passing front, it depends on air. Then to overcome this difficulty, we prove that the front width is uniformly bounded. Is uniformly bounded for all large air. So let me make them clear. So, of course, by the definition, we know that for fixed air and for any small data, so the width is uniformly bounded. So that means for the frontlines arranged between the network theta and one minus theta is bounded. Bounded and also because the passing front is disgracing in the first variable. So the partial derivative of fire with respect to the first variable is smaller than an active constant. Okay, so this is by the definition of passing front. Then we show that these two estimates actually hold for all large areas. So it means the passing front to Passing front do not flatten as L goes to infinity, or in other words, so the shape of the front is preserved as L goes to infinity. So this is proved by using the other number arguments. Then by this uniform estimate, we know, then we can complete the proof by considering the risk equation. First, we constructed a super and the sub-super. The super and the sub solution by the five and the MacNaud method. So, this is a sub and the super solution. Here, the shift m and the constant k are all independent of error. And we know that from this subsolution and the super solution, we know that both the sub solution and the super solution moves at the speed C air. But on the other hand, we know from gathering that the solution as air goes to parallel infinity. Air goes to plus infinity, it has a mean speed equal to C star. Okay, so this means when A goes to plus infinity, so the proceeding from speed C must converge to C star. Okay. So I still have some several, so I will go to the second part. I will go to the second part: the convergence of the Frank profile as L goes to infinity. Okay, let's first do some normalization. So first for in this, in the periodic case, so this is a Pasadena front. We know that the front is unique up to shift in the first variable. So if we normalize phi zero equal to one half, Zero equals one half, then this solution is uniquely determined. Then, by the implicit function theory, we find a function from y to zero ly such that phi a zeta y is equal to one half for y. So, this is the normalization in the in the periodic case. In the homogeneous case, so this is an equation with flow then coefficients. Froden coefficients. And we normalize that for each y, the traveling wave phi at a zero is equal to one half for our y. Okay, then by the normalization, we can we have the have this convergence theory. Okay, so as I mentioned in So as I mentioned intuitively, the period when AI is not the periodic equation is close to a homogeneous equation in the local space. So it is natural to imagine the passing front convergence to a traveling front for a homogeneous equation when AI is not. But the problem is how to make the convergence formulated in the entire space. So there are So our result gives the formula. So it means, so this is our theorem. We prove that when A goes to pass infinity, the passing front will converges to a family of the traveling front for the homogeneous equation with frozen coefficients. Okay, so this function is Okay, so this function is a normalization function, theta Ly. And we have some estimates of this function. So in the local space, when Kissy is choosing the local space, when A goes to plus infinity and zeta iy plus minus zeta i y, it converges and minus this term converges to zero and uniformly in y. To zero and uniformly in y. But when consistent in the unbounded interval from AR to AR, and when AR goes to infinity, and this term is uniformly bounded. Okay, and from this term, we also get the convergence of the Frank speed to C star as a equals to infinity, but the proof is quite different. And we need some actually the proof for the convergence of front proof fire is more complicated. And we need some additional technical diffusion is a constant and the reaction F is homogeneous, homogeneous near U equals to zero and one. Okay. So So I think my time is running out, so I will not explain the details for that for the proof. Yes, Jeff, two minutes. Okay. So the key point in our proof is to determine the symptomatic behavior for this cauch problem with given initial data, which is close. Give an initial data which is close to the homogeneous traveling wave for some point of y, okay, for some point of y. Then we construct a sub and super solutions still by the five and the McNull method. But in this time, the movement is determined by this one. It is a solution for this OD problem. Here, see. ODE problem. Here cy is a speed, it's a speed function for the homogeneous wave. And we find that when AR converges to plus infinity, and first we choose, we consider the time capital T. This is the first time the solution touches the point, the position. The point, the position one-half at x equals to air. Okay, of course, when air goes to plus infinity, the capital T converges to infinity. And we found that when air is sufficiently large, the solution is still close to the initial function. But we shift the space by air. And so from this And from this estimate, we see that the solution looks like a pathetic front. Then we know that for the one-dimensional problem, the pathetic front is a symbolic stable. So here we use the stability of the pathing wave. So when A goes to plus infinity, the solution of the initial function converges to the path in front. But there is some. But there is some shifter. There is some shifter. And also, when AI is sufficiently large, it is still close to the homogeneous wave. So we can imagine that the passing front is close to the homogeneous traveling wave. Okay, so in the last step, we can last step uh we we consider the uh the shifter and show that when the uh when the ai is sufficiently large that the shifter is converged to uh to this to zero and in the last step we use we still use the uh uh the the front width is uniformly bounded when ai is large uh okay uh i will stop here okay thank you for the nice talk any questions Nice talk, any questions? Okay, yeah, that was so. Uh, by the way, uh, yeah, yes, uh, very nice talk. And did you, so you mentioned some zero number technique for some part of your argument, but to explain some sense, process, process, that, that, that, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yes, in this one is probably someone in the please go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Yes, I haven't. Uh yes, I I haven't uh I haven't got your your your question. So I at some stage you you said you use zero number argument for public argument and would you tell me once more tell me once more how what it was oh okay okay so so uh your question is how do we uh apply the layering Do we apply the Leroy argument to prove the uniformly boundedness of boundaries? So, this is your question? Yes, yes. Okay, so the Lyron argument is used in this way. First, we consider the parabolic equation. We consider the solution started from the heavy state initial function. And owing to your work with Deco and Gennetti, we know that the solution. Guinetty, we know that the solution converges to the passenger wave, and this is the first. And then we compare the solution with a steady state of this parabolic equation. But this is a special periodic case. We know that a completed understanding of all the steady state is impossible. But we know that, but here we consider the case here is large. case ai is not so when air is not the steady state is close to the steady state of the homogeneous equation and for the homogeneous equation the steady state is all known so it is either a constant or a periodic solution or a grand state solution so this is how we use the other number arguments okay thank you very much any one more question yes yes i have a lot Yes, yes, I have a one. It's um more related to your previous work with Francois and Zahl. Do you think that the same property of existence for small L or large L holds in a higher dimension? Okay, thank you for your question. In the high dimension, I think the problem is more difficult, it's more general. More difficult is more challenging. There are some several difficulties. The first one is the existence of passing wave in the multi-dimensional case. So as far as I know, so when AI is not the existence held only in two dimensions by the paper of Duke Ho. And in high dimension, I don't know. And the second is because It's because I think in the high dimension, if we prove the convergence, we still use a point that the front width is uniformly bounded. But in the one dimension, we use the real number argument to prove this property. But in the high dimension, I don't know how to prove it. So this is my answer. Okay. Thank you.
