Okay, uh I simply start on the behavior of all participants who were the last sentence in the Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, leading by Professor Jesus E and HG for both stats. So, this is a DIS workshop on such a different traditional time language. I think we're allowed to take other languages. I think we would like also thank all the members, Yan Cheni, me, I know, we make effort to find such beautiful place for us to get together. Well, some of them, you know, I were born in this province, you know, so it's really my great pleasure to come back to sit down and to be part of this workshop and And we give a talk today. So, in this talk, I would like to discuss some intrinsic phenomena of cavitation, decavitations, and concentration, deconcentration in solutions of the convertible oil equations and all convertible oil force equations, and the radio number being flow dynamics. So I have the  Thank you. Uh so uh the the complex equation as is not the complex or equation program takes the following form the first conservation mass first equation and conservation Concentration and conservation moment. So here the low density, V to velocity, G to the flash. Now how far this D and here the D plus equations. Now how many animals? The identity velocity flashes. So D plus two animals. So to close this T D plus part way we have the uh the list the the election fashion magnetic electron. And yeah, he plus is one equation d plus one I know. So this is uh this system is uh probably the whole basic system but still very dominant. Okay, the uh had a line in the broader and the fundamental class of non-P, now we have not. Now we have another normal concern. So, which take the form, this form here. Now, for this general system, for first of all, along the P, we call the system high-ball form. Means for any given unit, in any direction, okay, then you go into the same part. You also get as name argument and think little argument and little independent argument. So for such kind of PDF.  Okay, okay, I uh okay Okay, so for this class PPF does the chain and you want chain in the center we call that edge of solution so edge of solution we call it discontinuous wide and central solution. For these continuous solutions, those solutions contain the well-known magnetic waves. For example, short wave, voltage shift, vorticity wave, and entropy wave. So this we have been studying extensively in the last 70 years. And then another aspect that we compare these observations has been considerable activity in the last 40 years. To study the undulator weak continuity and also recently trying to construct high oscillatory solutions leads to now issues for solution of activating solutions. So today I will have two aspects. One is aspect of consumer cablication and decalification. And data creation, which is the general data. I will talk about the aesthetic concentration, deconcentration, then also we need to look influenced by these features. So I'm more talking about two types of the games. Well yes, maybe less variety. Maybe that's what I'm doing here. Okay, so who says that somebody, the first initiative for that we want to analyze the anti-archites, they first want to know what the upper operated potential space is of the absolute machine in certain oxygen. In certain observations. For which we should, it's very difficult, it's fundamental to understand that in understanding the Asian constitution. Another part of how we know that n charge solution we said by N short is popular. Okay, and shall be plus here. And make it smaller, okay? Make it smaller. Okay, anyway. So for such kind of if I is a number actually if u sigma can be transformed to the best if I q well make enthral, then we can make sure if I put it. as a distribution, right? Then we start by defaulting the sensor of distribution. So this is a very which class of natural anchor products we could use in analyzing our financial solutions. So so now for scalar observation now. So yeah, how is the space path first? Because the activity here is anti-the volume was taken with T ampinity of the F and the major space. So that Okay. Okay. So for scale conservation after we have marks in principle. So initial data and finity solution are there. Then for these scalar mod systems, if you initial data BP has more solutions. Then we have 200 have initial data in the battery. But initially if I have a photographic button, then it's a logic about photography button. So I will have a pinnacle or difficulty. In average, you have general new phenomena and no concentration phenomena. So if you're not familiar with Parliament, I recommend this in our several listen books, they should cost us the first book in our listening. So that together look at further fundamental issues. First, look at the large dimension and without a fundamental issue, but second now should have more class. Okay, student have one field, and what are the multi-dimensional cases. Okay? So let me start now the uh my favorite the one-dimension as a short-load equation is. as a short-load equation. For this equation now you can write the first equation with the load and for the momentum rho n as rho u, rho v. Then you have two item systems, which is function of the density. Then you compute two other values, lambda or lambda two, this is four. So calculation means density equals zero. So if density equals zero, you will find the two eigenvalues coincided. Point side. So students have a lot of fields. You can teach genomy and then pause. Now, the question: where are we going to concentrate in genomics? If we concentrate a code, would I tool and deliver mass and uh not only types, then the the problem issue of the usability of your design change. You know, if I change the testing or you can't exit, I don't make sense. The second observation of plastic HTTP has a different. Of course, I had already forgot where essentially featured trying to make the finalists of plot gambling speed. But this is all general, additional similarities somehow. The general stuff like that. Nevertheless, this TV, those panels are not a good thing. Who starts another door? Simplest example is initial value problem. You have initial VAI problem. Initially at 80 to 0 jump. Rho minus U minus U plus Rho plus U plus. According to JAR, you can find that a power initially two affection waves. Initially density was positive. And initially to attribute that very fast in the middle. In the intermediate state, can't you zero? So from additional now, then you can do fun general gravitation. SR, so keep it in that. Now this is going to be a random object. If you change to a lot of operate, then uh the traditional wire is very far this P system here, this part G motor here which is the top alright So if you have a vacuum, now in a new coordinate, they are called a statistical order. Then we can call it a vacuum that calls become denominators. So solution you can measure. She equals zero normal function, just their function. She equals them become become their. Of course, the weak T0. T0 means they are not disappeared, but as of T is the angle, the Delatonite is hold. So this is called concentration. So can TG concentration among actually take anyway? But that looks stronger than it comes back. Alright, okay. But nevertheless, well this is this term there's a not in existence. Not in existence here. As far as initial data, in the 75 density and velocity output, density of the solution, 75 container condition vacuum, and 75 H of the thing properties. Okay. I don't know what I'm saying the proof involved H of the analysis for measurement We will mention artists for mental data solutions. After the other case, now there are terms that support the avatars. So that will help us to handle this case, so that exists. The end chopping problem, those kind of solutions are very weak. Weak solutions are not very weak. So we are seeing about additional transmissions called end chopping quality. N chopping quality here and after. Participate here, not over here. Now, this is for existence. So, maybe you after whatever you did this for this class solution, every two centimeter HF is a big HF. This is still wide open. Okay? Okay. Now, we want I want to we're all doing a share with you. Although this is not really easy, but I think they talk about that shoot. I showed you earlier, you become painful here. Due to my high-energy case, those kind of effectively will vacuum almost give you a big chaos of the Hart solutions. In the H of the Norm, we're kind of like a this kind of form, this norm here, H of the norm here. So then, after the chemical sound is just the same part of the relationship, they are actually in our deeper actually at least in the country. They can be simple and there are serious content examples. Lead my solution is short or bottom-up sheets. You could use easily minimal solutions. Say to find. I think. But for those types, actually, But for those who have actually, you cannot find a system. All of them is a big class there. So this is what they have actually. So they send the alphabet like in J, they study units the weight of EG standard rate. If the solution has a lot of strong tricks on every matching curve, then this is a suitable idea. But a shift can argue in the simple norm, by a single norm, they can have a unique stable shift. So my sense now this observation is that observation, it's probably very likely the original for the sunway to handle. So I just call your attention to this open problem, and I still have several observations. So just call your attention to this problem, but I can get it through that. Sure, okay, that's perfect. So fetch kind of amazing here. Now, next when we talk about catch penetration, I want to show you what about this penetration concentration thermometer measurement. Maybe that the system   So, now the range pleasure case they are ever this by scale. Basically, the file scale is like a Mahanama going, okay? Or hypersonic super hypersonic devices. So, you can ipsome here, no Mahananda basically scale. Now I think the same initiative have in that problem. That for this leader problem, there are two distinct little case. One is two attraction ways. Here you start from this X S T you can get the colours actually waving like what I showed you earlier. After beginning our soap, those side. So, okay, those types of bigger zero designs. Then you have two legs actually, so you can get there. And I'm gonna take two short waves, okay? You can get the leaderboard on HT. So there are sexual waves. Let's actually x. Okay? So I'll say this is the location of the earth, bigger than zero, and the jump together left to right. So let's consider two cases. What happens when I get two words together? The loop class, loot number, e plus, b are fixed. Okay, we solve them. Two cases. They will be fine. When xo goes to 0, our equals zero is actually here. That when x2 goes to 0, Then when I influence too little, this variable then intermittent step or into biggest answers, then become natural. Then when I feel the voice, left bundle it starts moving. Eventually it's to right hand side. This to right. So middle, middle to actual state. So this is the language, this is all KNP at Curve. Okay, they're kind of the content community for this. Here the for this form here, limit here. Okay. So this is the limit. The the limit to that. Could you check, go back to the side? Yeah. Okay. So this phenomenon is the cavitation phenomena. Or you know calculation, you can naturally then the cavitation uh Other things, two shots. Two shots? A little bit more than the stand. If it's left at the right, then if the biggest stand after the biggest engine, the low engine, the actual goes together. The entry was together. The tones are too short to start moving together. And then that's going to make a larger arch. So eventually those two shorts can be together, we can form one shot called the large mass, which we can measure, the base that we can measure, analog resistance shots. So this is the case the the analytical concentration And concentration, the concentration of the box. Okay, so this is the case where the colours are made of the colours. Okay. So I'll go there. Next one. And we'll not move to the next one. Yes. So this is a picture concentration phenomenon. It's a basic but it's too hard, very functional, too short, very tight. But it's a good this is because I have this. So we can see. So the map you can see you can see the map you can see right so here we start the density velocity profile. You can see if so for the four magnetic to every possible cell, the density unit will short to two shortest diagrams. So I started closer to the closer here. Eventually, the static form of the R mass and the velocity becomes that function. So this large concentration market and the RFC there. So this is the related concentrated characterization phenomenon. But I would like for this art for this article chocolate and orange patient. It provides out initially all the other catch page, like manufacturing component. Then it can provide RPM closer, closer to one, the technology becomes smaller, smaller. Eventually big health is actually. Eventually decay is a shift somehow will disappear, then we disappear in this phenomenon. So this another phenomenon, different kind of limiting, gamma goes to one, and you got the bigger energy. This can be put together and chopped some sheets. I'll just show you the picture. This can be used now. This is the later finished here. So this is related to So this could relate to the maybe next question we have to look at how the direction actually case. Okay. So especially it's a single selection solution. Where does the concentration occur or can the patient occur in the middle? Or is it? This is the best suit for that. So this is the question of the cancer patient before. May the parents become a better man. anything can have blackness or zero other objects, especially when a focus in a different substrate shows either moving inward out of the object. Actually what happens. So mathematically we are looking for this short frequency and looking for strips matrix solution. We want identical density and the scalar ID here in the velocity of stress matrix form. Then we look Then row material as topic over equation and low dimension, but coupling with singular geometric form. But they say let R1 over R there. So R equals 0, they say that all things of R equality goes up to the X. Now for focusing case, you may have the I mean the this quite a lot ago I resolved that if initial data set are the sewage machine, then since we launched the sewage machine, then you can find the solution you all can send for with and the expanding array. So origin will form in the peditation eventually. Initially not arguable arithmetic eventually forms a peditation and origin. Okay? Okay, always it's the scan multi-regular spray for that. So after one interesting case the concentration case, if the spring is the measure under all one wave of theology, what happens? Especially if you have a level exit. Why? This has been understood in the early 90s or 40s, not 50s. Listen to you when we sporting per Very beautiful paper that published 2020, which are the other separate standards of machine. One, the question of one of the density was the question where the density still functional origin of the continuum max. So this is a passion concentration issue. But this concentration I feel of generative. So the density development measure So this is the question of this part. So basically we own that. Answer yes, this is the answer actually no, no construction trees. Solution goes to infinity by notes without a constant choice. So basically statement the following. You have solution with the language You have a solution with length to find out energy and at the infinite density, you know, zero and another zero. Then you can construct, we can construct land stocks type approximate solutions, and then which converges almost everywhere to a finite energy statement. And this solution has a finite length to finite energy. Then we find out energy, but it density never forms. Although arrow goes to infinity, but still in the function state for every space. And through space. So we first proved density at infinity robot zero. Then we solved the length two. And it turned out imaginary robots in between 15 years at zero. Well, let's just robot offer their mass temperature. That's a really unique surprise to us, but we check very carefully that is the truth. Our damage energy. The proof came to the end of the analysis. Here we talked about H before. This is like after formulating our system of this four ideal wall terms. Then we can actually find entropy flats, then we have to simplify this two-part system, the linear ball in the linear system. And then you can use the system of our root to define a root will define a new network. look at the time of unit values. Then you can diagonalize the entropy equation, you can have volume equation with this diagonal forms. Then you get the radar of Q competition and this you get theta. In that sense are sitting on the wave equation with this form. So this was the natural please. Now if the near vacuum this equation can be light as a Can be written as lambda to lambda these coefficient matrix. In terms of W minus, in terms of unique values, the W minus W when the alpha, this index is very important, the alpha, this index is very important, in terms of single value of H must be near low equals here, but we have very much equal hydrogen. So when they can additional curve, this wave increasing, constitute increasing now, to have a lot of We're creating a plus a half parcel at the fish. There's an index there, big curve. With this index, there are two curves, one is wave fish. One is strong and one is weight. Unfortunately, strong code that they both notice is the other one. So we decided we don't use there, we only use three H. This is what is the HR equals zero. The H of equals zero, my remote equals zero. So this is what N ch of weight N shopping. Yeah, the this box. So you can generate a full family of weight transport tables for weight energy. So for students, mechanical energy energy Uh mechanical energy energy flux the same flow is an energy energy. So we require something one of those flux. So with this we can prove that solution are uniform on the air. So with the better to do with another There is a ergonomic density component before. As last density, this velocity of the moment is bound to independently. Then if this value of the H of H of Lux, this H of see this division actually is compact, h minus one, then conclusion that we have is compact, the signal is compact. You need the substitution the extra conclusion. Now, this was the actually we started the last time we could not put each language with competent for all the slides. So we found we are very true observations. We thought we are natural of the each nature. We don't have all sub as I count as all text by each other. Then we have all the major things with the all context function. So here is very important that we don't need the all text type. Other rather than basically source action basis. Anyway, in this case we'll make it hard to get here. So this is what was starting for online teaching. Then next went maybe you'll say, oh yeah, how Maybe you think what are all muscle patients? The flow, they are the cells for animation. You have not only flow, they are also attraction, right? Flow attraction for all you have this. This concentration cannot be specified for that. So, in this case, we had a cut off. There are two cases. There are two cases. One is doing my digital potential, Kappa Builder, other plastic. So this far I'll be focusing on the first case. Kappa Buzzett level for the page case. Say where the concentration phenomena occur for solution of all our parts of the page. Now for this case we can do a similar, you have to be a splitting symmetric solution with form that is density velocity and now we have this And now we have our DC mode with potential. It will have PC protection. The next system now will be coupling with our patient with geometric software, coupling with the bus application. I will file. So I think how to find a room E5. See whether or not. Well here are the idea of machine. Uh This is like S of star. This is a model by compass of outline S of the star. So long as the action. There is a competition between plasma here and the blood tissue. There is questionable mass matter. Plash is a high and question is away. Okay? This is a lot high. So we can teach you how to use this. Well with the traditional Uh the dark tissue. So this was there, and there is a long history for this problem. So it was the Chinese, they did not observe that. Because they had a gamma. This gamma, they had the magnitude as well. This gamma bigger than like the six over five or six, this is the necessary to ensure the global existence of finite energy solutions with finite max. With five and x. So, yeah, this is necessary, which is corresponding to the word for lag and solution. And he also showed that there is no existence step solution for without total x, okay, with total matrix larger than the principle x. Now, gamma between, if it gets bigger than 6 over 5, less than Unless I told this we uh generically you don't have as well. You need the total max less than critical mass. This one has our condition. So this is steady case. So kind of penny case, now this is kind of sleek in our security wall works. Then you can find you down and you fold the sleep. Okay. You can find the solution, but And then another recent came to the Guo Helen Xi Jan, they proved that if gamma between 1 and 4 over 3, the mass is critical, meaning the mass is bigger than the China single mass, and the market lucky enough. And the mother that lucky enough, the solution will have constitution. So this is the the uh you don't have actually uh in some way have the solution. But there are other works not uh listening to it. I don't have companies to men like le Hu and Ro and Ropa here, Xing Cheng and others. So overnational there exists Open that there exists a way that so we think we call orange. And here we have a self-confirmation. And with other supporting care of the state, the London Council protects it. Well, this is an interesting challenge. You guys have a little bit you can see through the latest year in Morris. Because then you drop all these other terms, so your leading term really is pleasure and the term pitching. Pleasure and transportation pleasure and collaboration. Thanks for anxiety. So time is dangerous here. You want to solve this problem. It turns out I introduced the Laplace A problem. Laplace H for A for Q. Traditional Laplace Age. Laplace U for F U. Now if you depend on memory for critical subcritical critical case. 24, 24. Yes? So in that here, I showed you earlier it's a link to the 202 index. So this is Life Definitely. So this is a pro 2020 organization between 56 over 5 between two zero qualities. Otherwise, no politics. So no star. Star potential. So this is a kind of thing now you can really convert into PD buttons related to the standard P E theorem. Now the all buttons are initial data dependent problems. So under the initial data of course, then give a asymptotic state whole this potential function. Then you have some simple identification basically, right? Right, from Chandler Singer's analysis, this is also important. Initial mass as well. So, initial mass, initial data benefits. So, after that, it is initial part of that problem. So, for this case, we put this input back. Answer yes, it's still a similar example. We can find the existing ch of the ocean as in which the n stops limit with infinite probability, but without so huge and original and the self-dimensional and self-like AP, uh and there is two cases. First case, if gamma large. You know, gamma large is uh Now if you garner between 6 over 5, 4 over 3 for 3 dimensions, for the average editor, and then with a click from X, if you initially cut less than 3 from X, you still have a low both error solution. So there are no kind of solutions, but also solution. Even under the scale we have an issue. Still, we have solutions far energy. So prove that probe basically will design a proper internal approximation. Form the proper S3 value problem approximation. We ideally want maybe to at infinity we get the the The three variables. If we have we wanna take a infinity then we start with the three variables. Here's R. Right, here's the T here. So are we from all the chips of problems? Away from start from V here, I think V, then we volume of V under problem. E prime T equal to velocity E minus velocity. V plus velocity H T B T I'm C D T V T And so free after A then we first solve the problem here fixed E largita for an entry V latita then this is E minus for here and so I will enter it or three parties if I drop then four Then for this form, we are supposed to get the robes of chip. We can open the ropes of chip for this setup. After we do the online condition, the traditional online competition here, stress-free argument, then design isolation data away from that. So then you can prove for fixed age from BE. For fixed edge on B, has come from actually such. And the pairs are T goes to zero, M so zero, what the linear. You can see for that. So we have the estimate, right? We cannot estimate that. Okay, but first off, the very important energy estimate. For this setup, it is nice thing. For this setup, then you can do energy estimate nicely. After a way now, you see energy is the traditional energy for dynamics. Then you now give you the gravitational energy here, additional couplings, with another sign here. Gravity shift. Okay. Now for the right hand are the And our control bind is initial or actually barnicle as such. So together, energy estimates, one part of the positive, who part of the negative, then there are competition, which will dominate which, right? So this is the key idea Charles Sita pointed out that the gamma index. Okay? If a gamma large enough, first term probably doesn't matter. If a gamma is not the same as the game, If gamma is smaller, first turn down the signature. If you assume initial mass, the less than critical mass, allow you to some trick you can first turn without this. So this is the key point for anything. It turns out it's necessary to solve the other one. So this is the key point I want to So this is the key point I have to talk about. First of all, energy estimates come out with two competitions. Inference from the SRIs. There are competitions between the so decision of energy, total energy with the weather. Disinal for X X. Seeing the layer come together from X, we have derivative X. We already have the relative X for V here. You see epsilon V R squared. It's nice. But we don't have But we don't have low R squared. We have the X we also have some non-derivative but some derivative X. So this command of the signal XQ called Barbara SQ we control derivative esters, those good here, and this is form, control by and a free market way of how we can check with our details. So this is a Okay. So this is uh uh we took it very carefully. We how to control algorithm terms and then how to design nature data, the key point of here. Maybe uniform part. Then final part solve the three partner problems. The three part of the way you don't know before putting it back, right? So all the chickens go infinity. So when the testing if the three partners are low part, then we need to go back to the order chicken, you know, left. The origin, you know, left arm, right? So you can test it. The three band actually can hear the at the key point here, after this half, okay? T button never, although they also put it here, but also but at the after half here, then t bound to the more n but less than the boundary. That's p minus two. Then p also is different. Make sure the estimate of the role part. So this is the one eaten very carefully. Then after the high uniform high, leap pile for passing pop packing. This is flavor. So that the here the the high. The high integral rate. In the hands of pain, so and the peak. That's the full point. Util depends initial also have mass and energy fixed part. But pink depends on equals peak. That is the full point. After you get this estimated value, we can look at dual zero first. Oh, he was three first. Then we come up with a lot of so looking after the We're also looking at the contested momentous loss of particle fiction, the unbound magnetic field, because we are pushing out a uniform biomass. And we also can prove that this energy looks better with energy control, uniform with inflow, also in each monitor of penis for all this major entropy and chopped market here. And the role of existence of the separate part is necessary as a result of the same thing. Passes necessary SPI. Possibly not anything or then you can pass in, then it will directly. Okay, so this is the basics that give you some idea how to approach this theory, yeah, the issue. Okay, so here, yeah, so this is a serium uh this did earlier. Uh See earlier. I also explained why the gamma large, also the critical mass, okay later energy escalate. After that, we can get to the focal for that. So this is the gamma model case. But on the other hand, if there are really other models like the light or star, the pressure is not down at all, okay? The genetic pressure basically allows the sound fall. It's not an animal. Now with a you can see logo suddenly power is the this model, power five of the Sui, but logo infinity in the four of Suji, the fifth time, after the same time. Okay? So what do we should do with that? So this is the way to get this generalized compared to framework now, the general flash law. And remote cash marketing through those cases, the line law case. And so we set up with a measure of our general measure law. And this is our hypothesis. This is genuine on the NP, it's very generative. Then maybe the rho goes to 0 is gamma and rho goes to infinity with gamma. Different x. Of course, it goes no problem, but we allow that different. And then we have proof of the compactness now, even for general version. With this compared framework, then we go estimate the components that are careful because logos will be different, but more does a similar STV. There are two edges completely different, but the harder part, most part of the same. And eventually you can get the same kind of S T V, you can pass the both in the care collection of this. And you can get a better. You can get it. The same thing around no console change can do. Okay. Now, this was gonna go bound profile. So the bomb profile. And this experiment can find out that the result of any time. And the non-constant output profile, this is the approach you could apply to it. As to make the working people, you know, with our additional curves of the profile, we're very careful. But more or less, we can do the approaching the low concentration, including the spiritual case, they have a spiritual nature. Okay, so uh those kinds of concentration uh retention I don't give an example of how one dimension is matching case. But there are big kind of multi-dimensional problems that have a teacher. For example, the woman, an alien model understood. This is a male expensive example. They have a wing, like a plane shot moving from far field. They're moving. They pull it to the corner all the same. And the matching up, this would And the batching up is for the short position alone at X. As a total dependent angle of this wave, if the wave angles more up than the market configuration has the full short wave, three shorter wave and the body actually form full wave configuration. The full wave and body. Now is the boss this body sheet that took the form of this is a weight rolling allow me. Rolling around here. So now the the pair string does include before the origin of this such odyssey wave. And what are the line space form of DCT, this omega? And it was curved from the back. It was very extensive about this kind of form. They put there. So this kind of understands very essential. If you want to know more setup on the actual button, we have I felt I have a model where I few years ago. The last check to put the list of open buttons. Some day we look at the HC time situation. Maybe you check again. I just find out. Okay. Uh then another thing about 2D problems are the issue of 2D type problems. Well that's full shot, initially full shot window. Initially, that significantly what happens. Genetic area actually are the serious paper classify this possible actual population as you put in the classified in the nineteen Specify under 19 different cases. Here are just a list of four of them. All in our photo of wheel information, you can see four wheel information already very complicated configuration. So somewhere somewhere where concentration calculations, if we can prove, you know, some more information about the habit either yes or no, then really helps us to solve the the global social email. This is a viable thing actually to point out. Now, wind case really simply solved in the foreshark and the actual waves for wind coffee relations. Okay, here I just used to analyze my honor to Articles, the honour of the Professor Go Ta. Okay, this is the Yeah, initial skills have maybe love to check. I or have other knowledge differences here for who will come from here. Okay. So I do have convinced you now. So those are solutions of group energy of solution. It's a phenomenon where the other phenomena is conservative, phenomena many activists. And they should be careful for them to make analysis of energy solution. Of NHRP solutions. Otherwise, the short wave is a dynamic wave, also issue compared to also the application and concentration. Each year I want to find the suppose we have a solution in this class. You justify the fashion, what kind of information, maximum information you can get about the solution. Right? That's the question. So actually, this was patient puzzleing and sometimes Can teach consulting sometimes limit our choice of family and choice. Then we more difficult to get information, more information, our solutions. So when framework I want to find out now variable is this many fields. Okay, well by instruction. Suppose we have very many structures, which are many space areas. All plus some additional features where available. Let's say NH of P in college will come less H of N of plus A in the sense of distribution. As largely I think they make sense in the sense of distribution. The question, how do we have the information solution? After all information is either the class or family of religious space, all information from age of people. All you want to make sure you can poly information you can get from it. Now, this is the distribution less than 0. Our observation zero is equal to dynamics. For this distribution, basically, you can compute sine. So, you can that distribution is a lot function, a measure. So, we call bio participation measure. We call that sign. So, this typical So the second law pseudo dynamic tells us distance distribution must be measured, not a general distribution. So it's generic from physics point. Now we call this field actually is a very geometric field because this is the diamond magnetic field. Now the question is, what is diagnosed magnify field? Can we go to business by parts if I'm all the trees of the air volume or if air After everybody, so every function, everything, you can arrive at this. You can account everywhere, right? Then how do they deliver parts? If you have delay tweets. Now, observation said, if this land field has a little bit layer, although you can define, you can not define trees and all trees, but you can define novel trees, then there's a lot of condition. Now the tank interests are our choice. Now with them we can do that. So that is starting point about selling problems and trust, right? First step, it is the two parts. So this is the candy path now. I mean, this is very funny. And a series of speakers last 10 years. There's a nice translation here. Recently I wrote a small campaign to read articles in GoToCNX.
