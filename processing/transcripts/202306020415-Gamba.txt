Basically, and the recent problem is the computational engineering sciences program for that student. I got funding with a group of physicists, and it was just to study problems of runaway phenomena and topomatic, which is a very hard problem, and very little has been done in this direction. But this perhaps is the beginning, not the end, of absolutely anything I'm going to say now. So, essentially, the problem that the quasi-inal. Problem that the quasi-linear diffusion comes from is the perturbation of, you might think of a stationary, radially symmetric, decreasing state, or which could be something that close to a steady state, or which you want to put a bampon tape. And you want to see what happens with the dynamics of the bampon tape if you actually use this. So you start with the systems that are collision less coupled to. Systems that are collision-less coupled to Maxwell's equations or to the Poisson equation. And then you look into the different aspects that come up from the fact that you have this perturbation. This is a picture I took from the Book of Thorn. It's a 3,000-page book, but you can get the paper divided in five volumes, and it's extraordinary for modern physics. It's really a very up-to-date thing to do. Updated thing to do. He renders here a drawing. It's not the phenomena. The phenomena really should be a highly picked regime after they do the analysis, as you will see. And what you do is you are putting a small perturbation, which is this band here. It should be even a little bit more tight. But what is very interesting that if you look at the variance that you have with respect to the mode of the perturbation, has to be certainly small. Has to be certainly smaller than the variance that you get here. Okay, so that is what the scaling means and the things that are going to break down. So what it comes, I mean, what I wrote is, I would say it all started with Landau and Meanfield Theory and then there are contributions of Valesko, Vedanov, and Sagrez in the 60s, also where they start to really look into more The expansion and how to enter correlations beyond the collisional SDG. Because as you have perturbations on the tape, like it or not, if you do magnetized plasma, the magnetic field starts to move on and the electric field starts to move on, even if you start with beta z, as you will see in the simulations. So it tell me you cannot escape it. You know, we are, I grew up in the community in the community. grew up in the community in the community of doing simulations and studying semiconductor equations, which is a completely different problem to talk about because you are actually modeling devices, meanfield theory, but you do devices on which you want to have a stable state and you apply potentials and so that and you ignore the effect of the magnetic field. What is interesting that today I will be able to show you simulations for the magnetized case and for the Magnetized case and for the electrostatic case, which is just with the Poisson equation, and that we can actually solve the problem that has been recently studied for the derivation of the quasi-linear, it's called somehow the quasi-linear model, but now we are all starting to say, well, it's a system, it's not a single quasi-linear equation, except that when you do the one D. That when you do the 1D model and you couple with the spectral form of the Poisson equation, then it becomes, in a certain scale, it becomes a scalar equation. It's very interesting. It's quasi-linear and it's going to be a Porus media equation with a non-local term and with an extra term which is proportional to a quadratic form of the gradient of the solution. So that makes it to be. That makes it to be somehow different. And I will tell you if I will show you first the simulations and then the analysis that we do for this particular case. And this worked with my student, Kung Wan, who wanted to do numerics, and he embraced analysis and amazing way. So I'm very lucky somehow. And then I will show you the magnetized simulation. Magnetized simulations because there is a lot of work to do there analytically. We may have some hints coming from the 1D model for the electrostatic case, but you cannot do magnetized plasmas in 1D. That's an oxymoron. But it's interesting because it works as good as, I mean, it seems to be everything stable and so on. So maybe it's the beginning of. Maybe it's the beginning of something that would be much more interesting. So, as I mentioned before, the tools come from infill theory, breaking off symmetry, all this understanding. It's a lot of discussions these days about the things, the Bayam-Kalam of formalism that may allow you to write collisional forms out doing the Green's functions as they call it, not the Green from. Not the green from what we use for the Sulfaton operator, the one that has been used for pantomime theories. And essentially, what is really crucial here is that there is a model reduction. I mean, you may view this as a model reduction from a system that it would be in space-time three plus three plus time. Plus three plus time, because it's the velocity space or momentum space, physical space plus time, and it would be a couple with the you know the collision-less equations and the Maxwell's equations and the perturbations or data that becomes very perturbative. That would be extenuating in terms of computing. But what this model does, I mean, and that is, I mean, it took me a while to understand why did they hear about this. understand why did they hear about this in fact it's a model reduction it reduces the system to a two by two uh you know it's sorry it two in time two in so so you reduce the dimensionality by two inches what is the caveat there are two one is that you assume that you have to start with initial data and that you have a domain and that's the toka map would be perfect which is either periodic domain or something that it would be enclosed for which Would be enclosed for which, if you wait long in time, the solution would take a homogeneous, I mean, the average in space would actually homogenize completely with the flow. Okay? And that is expected to see. And that is usually that comes from configurations that are from the where do I have it here? The random phase approximation and ergodic field. Anergotic sequence, and that's actually Pes and Bardot discussed that very, very. Okay, so all right, so just to give you the set of the tokoma, and that makes it to be a special because you can actually, you need to use, I mean, or you have to have a clever way of coordinates to do any simulation. And what the physicists would start to say that said, bread and butter for this is that you have to work with the elementary to. To work with the elementary toroidal and cylindrical coordinates, where the toroidal is with respect to the guidance center that you have in the topomatic, and the toroidal angle is the polar angle is the one that is the deviation from the magnetic field, and the toroidal angle is the azimuthal one associated to the tokamax. And the radius are usually numbers which are positive and because. Positive because you have there is not in the inner core, it's not part of so you have to put radials function radial configurations that make sense to put that type of problem. So when we do then, we look even, you know, you may view it also before, after you do the average in a space for the For the probability distribution function, which is the particle probability or the particle distribution function, you also want to put this framework in the same framework that you have, and the parallel is the parallel with respect to the same framework that you get the K parallel for the coordinates in the state. Coordinates in space. Okay? So momentum and space have to be somehow aligned. This is what we do, for instance, at least when we did the calculations on Boltzmann-Poisson or Blasso-Poisson, right? You always, when you talk about directions and the polar direction of the field, you align them with your domain structure and with the geometry that you have in the domain and the electron. And the and the electric field, usually you align it in one direction. You can choose the first, the x1 or x3, whatever, but you have to be consistent in the set of coordinates. So indeed, you decompose in the momentum coordinates also in p-parl and p-perb, and p-perp, of course, is a 2D vector with It's a 2D vector with asymmetrical directions or variations with respect to the value. And in the way, I'm taking the notation from the physics that the bold is a vector and the unbolt is the magnitude of that vector. Okay? And so you have the two directions. I think that the parallels can be renormalized to be trigonometric. Okay, so and then we. So, and that would be the way we are going to model the PDF. And what I'm going to show you is that we are going to start with data, but it's going to be the little block that you saw on the tape. And I'm simulating the part of the tape because I'm assuming that the bulk is static. We have to put the part. We expect not to see much difference. And I will show you some simulation later on. But the interesting point is that as time goes by, that blob, it doesn't go back to the equilibrium. It doesn't go back to the equilibrium. I mean, or it's not that it's going to be a static. That is going to be spread in the math according to the mass of that distribution, the initial data, according to an advection vector that is determined by the dynamics that come from the motion of the toroid in the torrent part. It comes from that direction of the torrent. And similarly, and the plasmon, I mean, the plasmon. Similarly, and the plasmon, I mean, the plasmon is actually much more remarkable for me. I have no clue because we start with zero data for electric field and magnetic field. And instantaneously time, instantaneously time, the fact that you have here a non-zero data and that actually pollutes and you see the coupling. What happened is, and remember the mean field theory coupling that modifies the acceleration of the PDF by putting the force, right? By putting the forces, right? Like you are putting the Lorentzian forces, that generates a perturbation that actually is modeled here in spectral space. So we are looking at the frequencies that come from the Maxwell situation. Okay? And that generates a need that doesn't, it seems to persist and doesn't decay. So it's very interesting because my first thought of this for Thought of this for me was the first time, and I'm getting better old in this community of very young people. It's the first time that I get to see non-equilibrium statistics that are not modified by boundary conditions in the force. Because we could foresee, and it says, well, if I could foresee or nothing is going to happen, but the perturbation tree. And I think that is, that was very. That is that was very surprising for me. Okay, and I'll show you more. Okay, so the plasma will do that. Again, you do in a spectral space, you exactly take the decomposition of the vector k, the k and volt is the magnitude of the vector volt k of the cool vector. This is a parallel component with respect to the same one. Parallel component comes from the guidance center here. Component comes from the guidance center here, and we use here, and we use here, and then we are going to talk because we have to talk about the dispersion relation. That you will see the system is going to be mixing the momentum space. We have averaging x, but for the plasmon, we put the spectral value. So, what is going to be mixing is the momentum with the spectral motion. And that comes with a dispersion relation that actually generates this noise. And that proceeds. Noise and that persist. So, this, I should say, while the model was proposed by Kenel, and I will say for the space, for the electrostatic, it was analyzed earlier, the work of doing it for really higher dimension, really. The TokoMax is initiated in 66, but he doesn't talk about the system. There are some. There are some words of people talking about the system, but there was no numerics, there's no analysis, there's no analysis for this type of problems. You will see in a minute. And it has been proposed, and Reisman is one of the authors of this paper from numerics because he's the physicist at Nutioskin, and we have copyrights on the part. All right. So, so. So, the starting point is to get a system that many of you are familiar with, right? It's the collisionless electron ions. But the problem reduction immediately is going to be taking out the fact that you say, well, you have some ions in equilibrium. You replace for the electrostatic case, the Poisson equation, you put the mass of ions is one without loss of generality. One without loss of generality, and then you actually make perturbations that correspond to these small bumps here by doing the following. And this is actually the interesting point. We are going to assume that our probability distribution function, and that again is the model of reduction because it's an expansion that you cut, pretty much like Leonard by. much like Leonard Valescu, but Leonard Valescu uses the reverse observation and put the dependence of the gradient of F inside. And that doesn't happen here. That actually is kept as a system and you have to compute it as a system. And so what happened is the so what you take in the, so you have to wait a long time in such a way that you have this. In such a way that you have this average inner space. And so the system, this will happen with the Boltzmann equation, with periodic boundary conditions, so with specular or diffusive reflection, ultimately it would homogenize even if the initial data is not homogeneous in a space. And then you decompose the probability distribution function as a function of p, x, and t as the average part, and that's the bar, and the average part. Bar and the average part you are going to decompose it on some massive distribution plus some perturbation which is here. And we are going to model, we are going to track the model of the perturbation. Okay. And so for the plasmon, which is what happened, I mean, they called the plasmon. I mean, I found it kind of a funny word. I didn't even know that until a couple of years ago. couple of years ago that but what what basically uh they refer is the effect of the of the lawrence force through the variations of the i actually actually said electric and magnetic field but what is very interesting that when you take the fourier transform of maxwell's equations you can actually write it as an equation in fourier space is a function that it depends That it depends on the electric field because of the nature of how the electric field and magnetic field entangle into the Maxwell's equations, multiplied by a function of k. So that is perhaps the most strong model reduction because you cannot take the anti-transform value. So the anti-Fourier transform value. So you have to live with the fact that when you look at the spectral form of Maxwell's equation, everything is mixed up and you can Everything is mixed up and you cannot retangle. Or I don't think that you are not so. I don't know. But here, what we have is again that the average would do the average field, in which in that case is a function of time. And the perturbation we are going to be doing is assume that this steady state is zero, there is nothing, and you are actually getting a small perturbation of this order. This order and so scaling stuff to take order to take over. So the bound has to be small. And what we are going to show is that also we were able to prove that there are spectral modes on which you pick up unstable forms for that perturbation. So this is not the Landauer lamp image. We are not behind it. We are not looking for elements of which you are going to have perturbations and dispersion relations that cause. And dispersion relations that correspond to the low to negative frequencies. Really, they are positive. Okay, so we get to then to the system. And let me tell you what is the system. I have some slides that explain that, but I will skip them. I would like to read it later on if you are interested. I would just say a few things. So the system is really, and it's Really, and it's it was for us a little bit difficult to track, it was completely unfamiliar at the beginning. Uh, but the idea which you have seen here is color-coded to make it easy for you. So, the probability density, so the equation for momentum in the classical sense of the probability density, which by now I'm modeling the perturbation, which is space-homogeneous. Remember that the component. Space homogeneous. Remember the decomposition that we said? Well, we assume that the perturbation is small, you throw, you do the linearization process, entering that decomposition of f of x beyond, and then you throw out the space inhomogeneous participation because you take it to be very small. So, what happened is then, so we have the equation here is for the plasmon, it's quasi-linear, and it depends. linear and it depends sorry for the for the particle density is quasi linear because it depends on a diffusion that depends on the evolution of the plasma and the evolution of the plasma comes from maxwell's equation this is the web equation in fourier space that gives you an ode after you have averaged space you sorry you sorry you cannot average in space in the sense that in fact you still keep the spectral modes Keep the spectral modes. And so space is alive through the Fourier transform for the equation associated for the Maxwell's equation or the Poisson equation. So in this sense, you may say that this model consists of partial distribution functions in diffusion equation whose diffusion coefficients depend on the web spectral energy or plasma data. Okay? And then the And then the and then there is something here which is very interesting, which this is has so this would be this is an ODE with a tongue that is local, right? But it's also entangling with a plasma because I mean it's local with respect to W but not local on its own because it's Because it's given here. We call this the perturbation term for the plasma. And this has, and look at what happens here. Here appears the divergent form of the solution of this equation written in the parallel components associated to the coordinates, the guidance center, coordinates I actually. Coordinated, and this was written in the 60s or by Kennell in the 60s. They ignore the orthogonal part because the momentum, there is no, the component of the orthogonal component P for the momentum associated to the evolution of this equation is zero. So nothing should be coming from that. So, nothing should be coming from that direction. But what is very interesting, this is almost like taking a sort of a moment associated to this, except that they have here a term which is mixing the T space with the K space, the momentum space with the spectral density. So it's that the momentum has this influence of these frequencies that can. influence of these frequencies that come from the from the from the equation and that function is usually given by in the higher dimensional magnetic form for a sun that you can put as many modes that you want all different dispersion relations that you would calculate from the equation associated to the spectral analysis. And the spectral analysis for the mass distributions. And it's so interesting that actually is, you cannot completely detangle the two things. The dispersion relation actually, or the sorry, the resonance condition actually is going to be associated to a frequency W that it has to be calculated and a parallel component of the field relativized with respect to P if you do the magnetic component. If you do the magnetic component, and we can enter that numerically, but we have not analyzed it yet. But something, you know, it's actually interesting that maybe it could be that. Historical remarks, let me skip this part, okay? You can read them if you wish and they said other things. But what actually matters here is that when we actually look at what is the plasma The plasma dispersion form in the electrostatic case is actually going to be a very simple form on which K dot P, so that would be the resonance condition or the dispersion relation that you get from analyzing this perturbation wave. That is very eloquently discussed by the papers of Bess, Nicolas Pess, Nicolas Bess, and And clock valves. Okay. In the more complex case, if you want to use, so if you have to go to Halley magnetized, you have to go into the relativistic form of the velocity vector as a function of momentum, which in a sense, I am starting to believe that is a much better tool because it controls and bounds the Hamiltonian dynamics. Hamiltonian dynamics because the velocity fields tend to separate. They cannot pass because of the speed of time. Okay? So, this is and the recent rigorous work on this particular blowing the plasma frequency relation, or as we like to say, the resonance conditions, that really matters because this time here is what entered in the previous slide, it would enter here as a duet. Here as a divator. So it basically tells you the exchange of coordinates and the mixing. This is in Neurovales that is used into calculating what is the angle to the dispersion form for correlation as you go into second order correlation. Okay, so what did we do here is again, I'm explaining that for the highly magnetized Explaining that for the highly magnetized plasma, what we have to do is to use a dispersion relation or the delta or resonance condition corresponding to this term. And here you can put as many as an accurate number, positive or negative deviations, absorption emissions, very specific physics we do that. We calculate it only with one, n equals to one. For the first frequency, you can calculate. But as you will see later on, there are up to four that come up explicitly. That comes up explicitly if you assume that the massive bulk is a Gaussian. And then you can calculate explicitly the dispersion. Okay, so about the energy, let me tell you that you need to do two things when we do the electrostatic case without the magnetic field. You can actually take the classical as we like to. Actually, take the classical, as we like to call the parabolic bonds or parabolic form. But if you do the magnetic field, you really are going to go into relativistic. Otherwise, it becomes very hard to find. So that is a mass. And so from now on, you are going to see whatever I refer to the electrostatic unmagnetized case, as we call it. I use blue and I will highlight it. And if it's highly. And I will headlight it, and if it's highly minetized, it's red. So you have the brown, the yellow, the brown, the green, the and the and the red for differentiate in what routine you are going to be. So the plasma wave theory actually basically assumes, and this is what I said in the first slide very, very quickly. And sorry, and so the resulting season, why we are using just the perturbation? Well, somehow is we are going to perhaps it's not quite, I mean, this is what everyone has been doing from the mathematics point of view. One will have to verify, even numerically, that if you actually take a Gaussian distribution, A Gaussian distribution and a perturbation of a vampon tail, such that you have that the vampon tail has a much smaller mass that's the scaling somehow, right? That the one that you have on the massive distribution here. Then the resulting system you actually calculated in this form. And because here is a Gaussian, you get that this actually is going to give you something that is zero in the quasi-linear setting. Zero in the quasi-linear setting, and also in this case, the gamma and the Gaussian is going to be zero. And then what survives are these two equations. Okay? Be elastic, sorry, magnetized or not. But the interesting point is that, and the equations are the ones that you saw. They show up here written out in the coordinates that are That are pertinent to what we want to talk about. And so, what we did is a scheme for solving the equation, this equation of the PDF, and we are going to stagger the calculation. And so, here what we have is that this object is going to be the mixing term. And you can view this mixing term that appears here, right, as the, so this is just the The so this is just the equation itself, and when you look, what is this term appearing here? Is actually, if you look at it, appears in the diffusions all the time. And so you cannot avoid this decoupling, except in the case of electrostatic 1D for a particular scale. And that's the one that we can solve. All right? Otherwise, you are a scar. Remarkably, it was not so hard to. It was not so hard to compute. And I'm not sure, you know, I was super, very surprised because of that. So let me move on on this, so maybe I can get to show you some of the things that are highlighted. One is the form on which the coefficient comes as we define. Sorry, let me go back, maybe I have it later, but there was this gamma form. That it was this gamma form when I show it for the first time. This term, this seems to be an advection, right? It's really the advection, and so that operator becomes crucial for the calculation. And in fact, this is something we did with Kunwan, my student, is that we can actually identify what is that advecting part, okay, which appears in a very simple. Which appears in a very simple form from the electrostatic, the unmagnetized, but it becomes much more directional, if you wish, for the magnetized case. And so based on that representation of this L operator, we also realize, and Reisman, who is a physicist, was delighted, he had worked a lot into that, but he never saw such a representation. And when we see it, it's a structure, I mean, the See it is a structure. I mean, the divergent form also is clearly telling, right? But what it comes up here is that you can write in terms of this L operator of the self-adjoint the two equations. And if you look at this, this is an extraordinary framework to do a weak formulation. Okay? And the weak formulation gives you actually from here, we can get the conservative, the unconditional conservation properties. Conditional conservation properties that come, as you do for magnetized or for Ninfield theory, by the sum of the two components. In this case, it's the volution of moments of the PDF plus the L2 norms that come naturally as you compute for the, or the norms that appear when you compute for the forces. Okay, yeah, the moment would be just one. So, so So you can actually see that then we can write, and here is the gamma again, oh sorry, the perturbation term that appears into this equation, right, is now written as a form of an operator acting on W. And that is the interesting point. Wow, this is really interesting. You can actually manipulate this operator and the Manipulate this operator and did finite elements, discretization. I mean, in fact, we do finite elements of this by conformal functions. And here we can actually put, you can do a discontinuous Galergin if you want, but it's an OD. All right. And so what is interesting perhaps is the comment here that when you look at the addiction operator acting, Operator acting on the energy. And remember, the energy are these two, the non-relativistic and the relativistic, or the non-magnetized and magnetized, distinguish the role of the two internal differential operations that plays an important role in the conservation of the numerical scheme. And that really was mine. So we can actually get the positivity preserving schemes and all the things that came up. And all the things that came up, and actually, conservative force, and that is very interesting because you get something that gets a lot of control. That's what I, yeah. So, so then, okay, so we basically wrote the wig formulation, and then you immediately start to get that conservation laws are obtained by just choosing test functions, as we know, that are different for the momentum equation and for the fructus. Okay, and then. Okay, and then mass conservation follows naturally. There is nothing, it's a divergent form operator for F, but for the plasma, and so I would say, and there is, you define the occupational number and so on, the plasmon is then the equation that, sorry, not the plasmon, the momentum equation for the PDF. So you have to. So, you have to put it together, right? And that is that you multiply one equation by a test function, which is going to be the ones that as you take moments. And for the other one, the test functions are different. Because you're looking at, it's like looking at the system, so at the topology of a system on which you look at the vector functions and entropies and so on, are going to give you something that adds up, like you do a system of. That outside, like you do a system of equations, you may fragment. So, so let me let me move on because I want to get to think. I mean, there are a lot of stuff you can hear the fact that the momentum conservation does not have the perpendicular component to the magnetic field mine. The no-weight zero is something that we study also with Phil Morrison, Fenya Li, and Chen Yingda Chen a few years ago. And all of this is. Ago, and all of this is being preserved and in this structure. I don't think you know, it's something we put there a little bit of operator theory to make it fancy, but it's something that you would expect. And so, and so one of the things that the entropy actually remains, and our simulation shows a very nice calculation of the entropy. We have the H theorem that gives you exactly what it is expected for the momentum equation. The plasma doesn't have any entropy. Plasmon doesn't have any entropy. At most, it's like the Meisko equation, it's like a wave equation. And the stability estimates can be actually obtained and it's unconditional state using the structure that we use with the L operator. So you can do these calculations very nice. Now, let me, I'm going to forward a little bit up, and all of these calculations are for the non-magnetic size and magnetic size. Size and magnetic size and non-relativist or non-relativistic and relativistic energy. So, this is actually with. I'm going to skip this part because I want to say the word about the systems because Puerto Ric is here. So you have to, you cannot leave it. The resume need to go. They want to. Okay, so with this, what we did is calculated if we see there were different frequencies, and if that were people said, you know, there is. And if what people said, you know, there is, oh, you have the plasma frequency, the cytotonal frequency, they have formulas, they only did calculations with that. What we discovered is neither one nor the other. It's a different thing. So we calculated this mode, these frequencies by using a marching time algorithm, which is the same thing that you do, for instance, for tracing by mean curvature a surface that is moving, and it works. That it's moving, and it worked perfectly here, and it gave us what we want. You see the pictures later. So, let me skip that. And here, you see how you get four positive simple roots, which would be unstable modes. We only come. So, this L that you saw in the mixing function would be L equals one, L equals two, three, and four. And you can see what happens. But we expect as much as in Fourier theory, as if higher in frequencies because they are ordered. Sequences because they are ordered, they have less impact in the motion. Okay, so or in the impact of the solution. So, this shows that we get things that are different. This is the exact computed relation, and one is the wavelength would be the frequency that corresponds to relativization, and the plasma is the cold plasma frequency. So it's not one nor the other. And you cannot just even write them as a convex coordination. Just even write them as a convex coordination. We try, but it doesn't, it didn't work. It's just difficult. So from there on, let me show you, if we compute, what do we get? And so in the 1D case, it was very easy to do it. And that it came so quickly, so fast, the calculation, that we got very enthusiastic. And then we, the brain pushed. And then we, the Weissman push us to say, try the 2D, try the 2D. It took us a bit longer, and it worked. Now, the interesting point is there are a sort of bunch of numerical conditions for stability. Here is the algorithm you use when you solve the system. And what you do is staggering. You start with boundary conditions. For the plasmon is in brown. Remember, the plasmon is in green, the particle is in brown. The particle is in brown, and what you get here is that you're going to be staggering from one to the other and from one to the other, pretty much like you do the domain decomposition of things that are maybe living in neighboring areas. But here is you pass from one space to the other and make it walk into a way that is not a closed wall. That we did a lot with, for instance, world moments, but it was in the same X. But it was in the same x, well, it was x and p. But here is p and k. But you know, after all, the interesting point is how do you do the calculation of the dispersion relation of this v function with this object. And this is done by a marginal. Let me skip that. You can read it. It has never been used for meaningful physics. It has only been used for It has only been used for what is what Richard does, Maria, and motion by Nin Caraba. It's that type of algorithm. I know he works a lot. So, so, so, well, okay, so here is the dispretize. I mean, there are conditions. I mean, by the way, this appeared just two weeks ago, or no, last week. Two weeks ago, or not last week, in journal computational physics, and you can actually one of the reviewers, you know, when they said you wouldn't major revolution, I usually, I mean, if it is not tough, and it was not tough, but they say major, it's the best opportunity we all have to improve our paper. And they said, how can you show that this tan step is not going to go to zero very quickly, and you're going to end Very quickly, and you're going to end up being without any, you know, the code would stop because you have no way or would blow up because you are getting into a very stiff configuration. In fact, the estimates provide we could do numerically, and of course, you have to assume some a pure regularity that we still don't know, but for making, so this is what the numerical aspect. Is what the numerical analysts call a posterior error experience, okay? But we can actually prove it, and we see that it doesn't, it keeps on marching and keeps on marching the time scale. So the simulations are here. This is for the 1D case. And the 1D case was done in 99. I mean, it's in the paper. I mean, we have finished the writing of the 1D because we have the 3D and it was quite spectacular. We sent it and people took it very, very nicely with this mention. Very nicely with these major revisions, but very fast. But you start with the blue line, and this is the motion that you get, and this is the formation of all the physics called the plateau. This is reported in the paper of Rostokov and Ivanov back in 66 that it should happen. And they basically do a simulation and they do the scaling, which is so similar. Similar, and they said this is in the spirit of the Porus media equation. We never investigated into detail, but you'll see what it does. This is the unmagnetized case. And the plasmon, you can see here, it actually has deviations that go into one direction, but they do not impede into that negative act. We also have a simulation with a deep plasma. A simulation with a big plasma paride chest. And we did a lot of things to check whether this function will always because this is the simulation, so this is the discrete function. It should be that it's non-negative because you have this, because W is proportional to the square of the Fourier transform of the electric field. And that should be non-negative. And it actually, we cannot pick up absolutely anything that touches. Absolutely anything that touches you. But we, a posterior, we can prove a positive, a non-negativity preserving scheme. And here you have the calculation of the conservation loss, and you see a cross. And this is very interesting because I told Kuhn, I mean, I would like to also see what happens when you do the calculations with the dispersion relation that the physicists do before without computing it ourselves. And they cross each other. And they cross each other. The difference is not big, but what is interesting is that, as you see, for some reason, we chose the bad colors in this case. It should be green. It should be green. It should be brown. And the green is a sum of them, which is a conservative. Okay? So what I'm saying, the probability density decays. Density decays, and that's the entropy we know, right? For the moment. Well, I mean, that would be for the mass, and it's in here, but for the F-log F, but the momentum also decays while the plasmon increases a little bit. Okay, but the sum is concerned, numerically. Okay, this I really like. This is the calculation of the margin algorithm that gave us the trajectory of what happens with this advection operator that appears. Advection operator that appears in the dispersion relation that is like the transition probability, and that actually you can see that what the way the blob starts, I think it's between 15 and 20. And what you get to see is that this motion is along this direction. So it spreads the map in this direction. This is a directional derivative. So, and this is the, sorry, this is the PDF, and this is the plasma, which is the. And this is the plasma, which is the Fourier transform of the Ethiop. So let me then say the word about the existence, because that could be an interesting point. Three minutes? Two minutes. Okay. The existence is this equation. Vadenov writes it in the 60s for the Lekrostatic case and Landau in the 50s. And then we just are now in the unmagnetized case, the energy is a parallel. Energy is a parable. So, then we want to do the calculation of this particular system. Whether it can be calculated or not, it turns out that we have the hint of the paper of Ivanov later on that that's the first simulation. That indeed, if you do this rescaling, what I don't know, maybe you can receive you can have a better interpretation, but not. Interpretation, but not now because I don't want to tweak my minute and a half. And so, what happened is with this calculation, you can actually see that you can replace the time derivative of this part by taking this relation here and doing the calculus and replace it into the equation of the plasma of the electric field. Of the electric field. And then you get this equation that says, oh, but it's not in divergence form. And then Kuhn said, okay, let's write it in divergence form. We wrote it in divergence form. And it shows up here, which here is like a Poros media equation with this coefficient. And we have a term which comes with a negative sign. It could be good, right? And you say, well, I throw it, but we didn't know if we could throw it because things are changing signs. Throw it because things are changing sign all over, and you cannot tell because here it could be a positive or negative, depending if you is increasing or not. So, what happened is we said, well, what do we do with this? We worked for a few days, a few weeks, or maybe, and we couldn't find it. Chenlong read the Vasquez book and we started to do the preliminaries, and we end up by doing the following. That by doing the following. So let me tell you, so I can conclude quickly. The details are written there. The problem is the square of the gradient. That is a term we didn't know how to count up, how to fit all what has been done for the Poris media equation. I think you have done, Cuandruise, you have covered the cases with this and the cutoff is. With this, and the cat office is there, you see, and we have done all of that, but we didn't know how to put, how to deal with this quadratic term, with this one here. Until one day, Kuhn tells me, I don't want to do more analysis, I want to do numerics. I says, Kuhn, one more week. Let's Google. Let's start to come up. And he sent me an email and in 48 hours, he was Googling ahead of me. And he said, I think a thumb is a spark of light. And the spark of light came. Spark of light came from what we found was a paper of. Let me move on. So I'll go back. You show there are non-equilibrium states. You cannot go to Gaussians and so on. Let me skip that. That is expected you so many rates. Right? But that spark of light came from a paper of Abdelauli, Irania Operan, and Madalena Joalins. And Madelina Juanes. And I was amazed. I said, maybe you know them. Yes, of course. And in fact, I say with a little bit of sadness that this happened perhaps three months after Irene asked the way to obedience. So it's not quite the same proof. We have to adjust it because they do it for a very generic form and they do it for a quadratic term and they use the sign of it. And they used the sign of the quadratic term, but we have the extra term, so they didn't have all of the things that could actually affect the sun. But the strategy, which I the first time I read it, on which you get a transfer of, and that comes from that paper, you gain regularity for the quadratic term by borrowing from the time part. And so what they do is they write the equation, they differentiate it again, and they Differentiate it again and they gather estimates. And amazingly, they have never been done from infinity. It's not that we copy them, we have to adjust them. And there were extra estimates we needed to do, but it works. And this is what we got as a final figure. Okay, so you have that a classical solution and it's so, I mean, it's a classical solution in the following sense, and it's a unique classical solution on this form. On this one, and the and sorry, it's the theorem one that I have to read: the classical solution. The classical solution, okay, so it's here. It's a weak solution, okay, that actually you have it here. It has to be in L2, L2 will L in time, and that is W1 into L, and that is the absorption of the calculation. That is the absorption of the calculation from the calculation. And with that, we are very happy. And I don't know. And I hope you too. And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for this beautiful talk. Questions? I'm very happy that any journalist working. That's a one deep problem. I wish we could do it. I mean, I hope that higher dimensions would be in which regime are you? So, the runaway bulk is still small, but how high is the velocity? Okay, this is not a runaway process. A runaway is when you have an Runaway is when you have an electron that bends out of the guidance. This is the quasi-linear diffusion on how you move out. I mean, the runaway was the title of the graph. It's a very hard problem. And it's still no one knows how to tackle fully and it's a lot of discussion after seven years of time. But this is, you have this blob, and which can be, what has been averaged in a space. Average in a space, and you have time. And then you put this little, you have the massive distribution, and you put a perturbation that is a single mode. We did it with the Gaussian for the simulations. I expect that rapidly decreasing functions of any order or even polynomials that decay faster than quartet should be fine. We'd like to mark for as long as you get something. I mean, we would have, you know, there are people exactly, well, also you have to take a caveat. Also, you have to take a caveat: this is a single mode. If you start to add modes, we don't know how the non-linearity starts to do. And we are going to do simulations first because the simulations were so nice that they were inspiring. That's what I'm trying to say. We did first the simulation, and I said, it must be something, it must be something. It's treasured prototype of Ansar. Yeah, there's another question there. Can you just explain a lot better on this resonance condition? On the resonance condition? The resonance condition, well, it appears so many times. But so what is exactly the, I mean, can you sort of say if you were, if you didn't have this, what is something that would the resonant condition, okay? Let me, so, okay, so maybe. So, maybe that puts me back to the beginning. People may want to leave if it gets too long, but I don't know. But I think it's a great question because it took us a lot of thinking about it. The resonant condition appears once you look at the perturbation. And that is a mechanism. And this is how we call it now with COVID. This is a transition probability. As much as you have in the Boltzmann equation. As much as you have in the Boltzmann equation, when you put what we call the collision cross-section, and instead of just integrating with respect to dv star, if you're familiar with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, you would say, well, I put then a Turial delta on which I enter the dispersion relations or resonance conditions that give us the conservation loss. You know, the momentum, you know, the sum of the two momentos pre and pause, have or the difference have to be zero as much as the zero as much as the energy. And that appears with Dirac deltas. So here, in that case, the resonant condition is the same space. It's the velocities before and after in the same space. Here is mixing the space, the momentum space, with the spectral form. Is that imagine electromagnetic wave that is moving like that? So the momentum is starting to hop and the seam. And the simulations you see a lot of hopping in the output. It makes sense? Yes. Okay. I'm sorry. All right. All right. So since we are on a rather tight schedule, I'll hope that we're in the speaker again. Since I'm the last chairman at this wonderful meeting, let me thank Thank you first, of course, all the speakers, most important, all the people who organized this beautiful meeting. The head and vice head of this beautiful institute, fantastic idea. I heard a comment probably from Juan Luis about bringing Canada to Andalusia, which I think is a great idea. We can really meet this in the winter in Granada and in the summer in Granada. Yeah, that's right. Maybe that's a good idea. That's a very good idea. That's evaluated. If anything, it's wonderful to see somebody actively here. Work, work, work, and it would be enough. Thank you. Work, work, and you come back to Trana. I think it's very beautiful.
