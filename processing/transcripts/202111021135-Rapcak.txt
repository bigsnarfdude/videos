So, thank you very much for giving the talk. Thank you very much for the introduction, and thank you, everyone, for coming. It's a big pleasure to speak at this nice workshop. And today, I'm going to cover some of the aspects of my work with W. Callotto from last year, where we and I'm going to talk about various modules of W-infinity algebras and how they relate to crystal melting. Crystal melting of Donald Fontomas and Pandari Panditomas. There's not going to be much semi-simplicity in the talk that I'm going to talk about today, though we are at least going to see some non-diagonalizable action of Cartan generators of the Feyne, which might be hopefully fun. Okay, so let me start with the introduction, very slow introduction and physical motivation for the question. And physical motivation for the questions that we are going to ask today before diving deeper into the algebra and representation theory. So starting with the work of Alda Igato and Tachikawa and the mathematician Hirak Punakajima, people have been investigating a rather close correspondence between four-dimensional gauge theories and two-dimensional conformal flow theories. This correspondence is often called by different authors the AGT correspondence, the 4D2D correspondence. Correspondence, the 4D 2D correspondence, or the BPS CFD correspondence. Just a warning: the correspondence 2D 4D correspondence that I'm going to talk about today is not the same one as in Tomuki Arakawa's talk earlier today. One of the explicit predictions of this correspondence is the equality of the instanton partition function of UN gauge series and conformal blocks of. From blocks of vertex operator algebras known as Wn algebras. The appearance of this vertex operator algebra can be motivated by the following construction in M-theory. So the algebra is parameterized by the integral number n and continuous parameter psi that I'm sometimes going to write also as a ratio of other two parameters epsilon two over epsilon one. Epsilon 2 over epsilon 1. And the existence of this algebra can be motivated by looking at a stack of nmfibrains in omega background. Just to be more concrete, let me place nm fibrains on a product of three, there are nm fibrains, there are six-dimensional objects in 11-dimensional M-theory, and we place them on a product of three complex lines. And let me introduce a deformation of the system by introducing. Introduce a deformation of the system by introducing parameterized by two parameters epsilon one and epsilon two associated with the torus action rotating the two C2s. This deformation effectively localizes the theory to the origin of C2. And such a system should then admit an effective description in terms of a theory living solely on this other C, this is remaining C. This other C, this is remaining C and this algebra turns out to be the vertex of beta algebra known as Wn algebra. Just to give you an example, the simplest Wn is W1, which is just the Heiseberg VOA, or at the level of modes, the universal enveloping algebra of the algebra generated by Jns with the following commutation relations. The following commutation relations. And you can see that the parameters epsilon appear in the normalization or on the right-hand side. This picture is extremely useful for predicting various generalizations of the story as we are going to see today and is going to serve us as a motivation for the existence of the whole PT modules and DT modules and these kind of things. And DT modules and these kinds of things. But before moving that, let me investigate another important actor in M-theory, which is the three-dimensional M2 brain. There is an analogous story for a stack of NM2 brains supported on R times C epsilon one, where we again deform the complex direction C by omega deformation parameterized by parameter epsilon one. Parameter epsilon one and this leads to one parameter family of algebras that I'm going to denote for the purpose of this talk talk as a n and these algebras you can define them as quantize as the algebras quantizing the ring of holomorphic functions on the adhm quiver variety with framing one and n being the rank associated with the gauge node. Again, to give you a simple example, the A1 algebra is simply the Heisenberg algebra or the algebra of differential operators in one variable. And this algebra has obviously these two generators that commute to one or epsilon one. Okay, but since now we are in M theory, we can actually generalize the story considerably by employing. Considerably by employing all the other directions one has in theory. And the kind of picture that keeps appearing again and again in my research comes from exchanging of this C epsilon 1 times epsilon 2 by a product of three coordinate lines deferred by this omega background. And one can see that now you can consider more complicated configurations of M5 brains. Complicated configurations of M5 brains. They can intersect in the compact directions in this C3. And in particular, there are three different orientations of M5 brains that are consistent with this omega deformation. So you can see that, right. And analogously, there are M2 brains that can be supported along the three possible coordinate lines inside C3. And analogously to this motivation. And analogously to this motivation above, the standard motivation for the AGT correspondence, there should exist a free parametric family of vertex operator algebras that I denote as y, n1, n2, n3, associated with the general configuration of n5 brains. And analogously, there should exist a three parametric family of algebras y, n1, n2, and three, generalizing the algebra of differential operators in one variable. Differential operators in one variable associated with the general configuration of two brains. So, for the purpose of this talk, these algebras y and 1 and 2 and 3 and a and 1 and 2 and 3 are really just going to be motivational. I'm not really going to define them here. And instead, I'm going to think in terms of some universal algebras since it is sometimes used. Since it is sometimes useful to think about these y and 1 and 2 and 3 and a n 1 and 2 n 3 as quotients of some universal algebras that I denote as w infinity and a infinity. And most of the constructions later on, after the introduction, are going to be purely in terms of these universal algebras. Okay, so I've introduced M fibranes, I've introduced M fra. M5 brains. I've introduced M2 brains and the corresponding algebras. And now let me investigate endpoints of M2 brains and M5 brains. This is what we did in the work with Davide, where we investigate those endpoints, but also intersections. But today I won't have time to talk about the intersections. So I'm going to restrict only to the endpoints. So the endpoints of N2 brains ending on M5 brains are known to lead to modules of these vertex-operated algebra. Of these vertex-operated algebras parametrized by a triple of partitions. So the idea behind this statement, oh, sorry, okay, is that if I draw just the non-compact directions, the M oh, what is that? The M fibranes are supported. Are supported along the C, and you can add the M2 brain and on the and on the M-fibrain, leading to local insertion of some operator at C on which we can act by the modes of the M-fibrain algebra. The M-fibrane algebra giving rise to a module for the M-fibrane algebra. Why? But analogously, you can look at the very same system from the perspective of the M2-brain algebra and act by the generator of the M2-brain algebra on the very same endpoint. So, not only that, this picture should lead to A module for the M5-brain algebra, it should also lead to a module for the M2-brain algebra. And these modules are going to be labeled by the triple of partitions. Why triple? Because we have three different orientations of M2 brains. And Y partitions? Because the partitions actually encode how exactly the M2 brains end on M5 brains, how they are distributed along different M5 brains. Did along different amplifier in the picture? Okay. Right. And what we are going to do today, as I already told you, we are going to construct these modules at the level of the universal algebras A infinity and W infinity. And along the way, we are going to see that the We are going to see that the characters of these W infinity modules count melted crystal configurations of the North-Son-Thomas topological vertex, which I label as chi lambda mu nu. The countries of A infinity modules count melted crystal configurations of the Pandaripandomastopological vertex that I label as chi PT lambda mu nu. We are going to see that the dt PT correspondence that relates PT correspondence that relates the DT topological DT invariance and Donald's onto Panaripanatomas invariance that translates at the level of a topological vertex to the following expression, actually has an algebraic uplift. So we are going to see how to divide by McMahon function at the level of algebras. And finally, we are going to see that defining these PT-like modules. Defining these PT-like modules requires an introduction of some new techniques in the pro-offeins, such as allowing non-diagnosable action of Cartan generators. Okay, so before doing all that, we are going to let me now review some facts about this W infinity and A infinity. About this W infinity and A infinity algebra. Let me introduce those algebras or at least give you an idea how they look like, and then we are going to move to the discussion of their modules. And let me start with the introduction of the W-infinite algebra. This algebra plays an important role in many places in physics mathematics. And in our story, as I already told you, this is the universal algebra describing a M5 brain algebras, YN1, N2, N3. Algebras y, n1, n2, n3. To give you a definition, let me recall the Verazoro algebra generated by the stress and energy tensor T with the following operator product expansion encoding the singular behavior of insertion of T when we move the insertions together. Let me also recall the definition of the primary field of spin N, which is a field with the following OPE operator product expansion with the stress. Operator product expansion with the stressor-energy tensor. In this expression, in these expressions, there is the parameter C known as central charge. It is a function of this other parameter psi, that was the ratio of the epsilon parameters that I mentioned above. So you can, right, okay. And it turns out there exists a two-parametric family of VOAs known as W infinity. known as W infinity, extending the Virasero algebra by primary fields of spin one, three, four, and so on up to infinity. And one can obtain all its relations by a bootstrap analysis by imposing the associative of operator product expansion. Know that compared to most of note that here I add also a special. Note that here I add also a spin generator of spin one, which is sometimes not added in the literature, in the VOE literature. And I don't distinguish the corresponding two algebras by the label w infinity and w1 plus infinity, because I just hate this distinction, hate this plus one. So I just denote it as w infinity. Anyway, unfortunately, it is enormously hard to write down the relations of w infinity. On the relations of W infinity explicitly. But luckily, the mode algebra of W infinity is actually isomorphic to different algebra known as the Eiffanian of GL1. And this algebra is generated by generators En, Fn, and Psi N for non-negative integer n. And these are the made a concrete set of relations that I'm going to review soon later on. But before doing that, let me also recall a nice automorphism that this W infinity admits. It turns out that W infinity emits an automorphism, sigma, that changes the sign of the odd primary generators, odd spin primary generators. This seems a rather trivial transformation, and it indeed is from the perspective of the VOA. VOA, though it is going to play an enormous, mostly interesting role when translated into the language of Feynyangian. So let me now move to the Feynyangian. The Feynyangian is, as I told you, the algebra generated by these F's and E's and I and Psi's, and they satisfy the following set of relations. It's not going to be very important the explicit form of the relations, but let me at least tell you that you should be thinking of the generators F as the decreasing, as the lowering generators, generators E as the raising generators, and psi as Cartan generators. Note that the relations depend on two parameters, sigma three and sigma two. They are the following combinations of the parameters epsilon. Combinations of the parameters epsilon. If you want to see details, and this is actually a presentation that appears in a nice paper by Sachet Simbaliuk, where he reviews some of the representations of the algebra and gives this nice triality invariant representation of the affine end. So I encourage you to look into this paper if you're interested. Okay, what is going to be important that this Feynman of Geo. To be important, that this affine of 01 contains a nice sub-algebra that I denote as WA infinity that is also known as 150 affine or double affine Hecke algebra. And this is generated by the generators F, all the generators F and Psi, but E n restricted to positive integers. So the only thing that I'm doing, I'm just throwing away the I'm just throwing away the e0 generator. And it turns out that this A infinite algebra is the universal algebra describing M2 brain algebras, A, N1, N2, and N3. One can also write down explicitly the isomorphism between the finite eigen and W infinity algebra, and this is given by the following expressions. So the modes of the spin one generator of W infinity is generator of w infinity is uh related to the is proportional to the um commutators of f1 with f0 and um e1 and e20 and this e1 e0 commut e1 e2 commutator is uh isomorphic to the following pretty non-complicated Pretty non-complicated, pretty complicated-looking expression on the W algebra side. But what is important is that if we do this change of basis of the algebra, the charge conjugation automorphism is not simple anymore. It receives this tail contribution by the modes of the spin one field. And the appearance of this tail in the second expression has Second expression has highly non-trivial consequences in the theory of affine English representations. For example, as we are going to see below, the charge conjugation relates well-known modules of the affine Englishian with the rather exotic modules with non-diagonalizable action of Cartan generators. And it is going to lead us to the Pandaripanda Thomas counting and these PT modules. But before doing that, But before doing that, let me also review a different way to compactly write down the relations of the Feynman. For that, let me introduce these generating series of E, F, and Psi generators as a formal expressions of the following form, using which we can write down relations of W infinity in the following way, where I've introduced the ratio. The ratio of z of the following form. How you should be thinking about these expressions is the following. First, you need to multiply the expression by the denominator of the phi term on the right-hand side, and then expand both sides around infinity in variables z and w, and identifying. Z and W, and identifying different terms in this expression reproduces exactly all the relations that I've written above. Okay, let me also tell you why I'm introducing these generating functions. It's because using these generating functions, this is going to be the way how we are going to define all the modules, both the DT ones and the PT ones. And let me now review the And let me now review the DT, the Brownson-Thomas-like modules of the affine ANGIN. Okay, so the W-infinity algebra is known to admit a class of modules labeled by a triple of partitions, some Wν. And the basis of these modules is labeled by 3D partitions built on top of the vacuum control. Built on top of the vacuum configuration. So let me tell you what a vacuum configuration is. Vacuum configuration of boxes is a configuration, a minimal configuration of boxes in a three-dimensional corner that asymptote to the prescribed particles, prescribed partitions lambda mu nu. So in particular, here is depicted the minimal configuration for For the box, box and 2-1 partition. And I can now start building up boxes on top of the vacuum configuration by adding boxes in such a way that they don't fall. They don't fall. I mean, just right. So, for example, let me give you an example for the zero box zero vacuum configuration, which is depicted here at the top. At level one, one can add boxes at two possible locations here. And at level three, at level two, we can. We can produce the following different configurations containing two boxes on top of the vacuum configuration. And we can now associate a state to every such configuration and define a module structure for this W infinity or a Feyne-Angian algebra. So let me start with the definition of the action of the psi generator and psi generator and first let me tell you that the psi diagonalizes the action of psi that the basis I've introduced diagonalizes the action of psi in particular this action is given by product of these phi z minus epsilon factors that I've introduced above for each box at position epsilon box Box. And all that is multiplied by a vacuum factor of the following form: Z plus sigma 3 psi 0 over Z. Okay, so that's the action of psi. Along the C, you can write down action of E, and it acts as a raising operator, adding boxes at each allowed location. And F is a lowering generator. Is a lowering generator removing boxes at each allowed location. Writing the expressions more concretely, EF acting on a state associated to a three-dimensional partition lambda produces a sum of states associated to each of the partitions that can be obtained by adding one box. There's this pre-factor of one over. There's this pre-factor of one over z minus epsilon box, where the epsilon box is the epsilon associated with the added box. And there's this square root of a residue of the function psi lambda, which is the eigenfunction of psi acting on the state lambda. So you can see that the residues of this Of this eigenfunction actually control the play, control the action of E and phi generators. Let me give you an explicit example just to decodify this expression a little bit. So we have this day labeled by the vacuum configuration, as we had above. We act on and by the generating function psi. By the generating function psi. And the result should be equal to the p-factor, to the general factor, the vacuum factor that I mentioned above, times product over all the boxes in the configuration. So here we need to take a product over all the boxes in this infinite, half-infinite row of boxes. There's a lot of cancellation going on, and the result turns out to be this relatively simple expression. out to be this relatively simple expression and expanding and one can then expand uh expand in in the powers of z to obtain to identify the action of the psi i generators similarly as i told you easy access raising operators adding a box so acting on the vacuum Box, so acting on the vacuum, one gets a multiple of these two states where I hide all this square root of the residue in labels E1 and E2. Or if one expands in the powers of Z, one identifies the action of the generators EI to have the following form. And obviously, you can write down action of the generator f that decreases the number of boxes. And it has the following form. Anyway, so this is a nice class of modules that I call DT modules. And why DT? Because their character is the counts the boxes in 3D Count 3D partitions with asymptotics given by mu, nu, and lambda. And these are exactly the Donaldson Thomas topological vertex, or the topological vertex for the Donaldson Thomas invariance. And let me now move to the PT modules. And let me start with a surprising observation. First, remember that we had this. Just remember that we had this charge conjugation automorphism sigma. We also had the, I'm going to also denote lambda mu nu as the highest weight vector of this module of the dt module m lambda mu nu. And recall also that we have an embedding of the algebra A infinity inside W infinity forgetting the E0 generator. The surprising observation is that T from A infinity From A infinity acting on the highest weight state lambda mu nu via conjugation, generate a highest weight module for algebra A infinity, and its character is the character of the PT topological vertex, topological vertex for Pandari-Panda-Tomas invariants. And in the rest of the talk, I'm going to sketch the idea of the proof of this statement and offer a more concrete definition of such modules by utilizing the box counting. By utilizing the box counting of Pandre Pande and Thomas. Okay, so let me now look more closely at the charge conjugation and look how the eigenvalue of the psi generator changes under the charge conjugation. So, using the charge conjugation automorphism, one can Conjugation automorphism: one can easily determine the conjugation of the first two Cartan generators, psi i. The determinating function of conjugated charges, psi tilde i, acting on the lowest weight state of the module m lambda mu nu has the following expansion. And this is consistent with the general proposal of Gabriel DLD and Penck that has the following form. And what we'd like to do, we would like to now find an explicit construction of Now, find an explicit construction of the conjugate module generating from highest waste data that I label as lambda mu nu pt with charges given by the conjugated expression. This construction is going to generalize the one asymptotic case due to Gabriel Dior Lee and Penck that they called high warm. That they called high-wall modules for some reasons. Anyway, they argued that the modules can be defined by the same formulas as the more standard M lambda mu nu with boxes added at two different locations. So compared to adding boxes on top of these vacuum configurations, we now have two different locations. One is the empty corner that I call the DT location. And another location is Another location is a location at the top of a high wall that I'm going to call the PT location. The box counting at the DT location is the same as before, just with trivial asymptotics. So you're just really counting the 3D partitions with no asymptotics. And the box counting at the PT location is given by the following. First, we look at this We look at this half-infinite row of boxes, this half-infinite cylinder of the shape given by the corresponding partition. And we look at it as a hollow structure inside of which we start building boxes. So, in particular, there's this vacuum configuration, and we can add two different boxes at level one. We know that now we are adding boxes. Are you adding boxes with the gravity pointing towards us? So these are the only locations where you can add boxes for them not to fall towards us. And at level two, you can obviously get these three possible configurations. And what we have found out is that this picture of two independent locations actually persists for locations actually persist for the more complicated lambda mu nu for an arbitrary for arbitrary triple of partitions lambda mu nu. And let me sketch a proof of that statement. Recall the structure of the psi acting on the highest weight state of the DT module. It had the following form. There was the vacuum prefactor, and there was a ratio of two polynomials with zeros at the positions of the added boxes. Positions of the added boxes. After the charge conjugation, the prefactor, vacuum prefactor, doesn't really change, but the two polynomials become different polynomials with zeros at shifted positions. So these are the positions of the boxes plus this extra shift by the size zero generator. And assuming that positions of boxes. And assuming that positions of boxes that can be added to a given configuration is again given by positions of poles of lambda acting on a given state, one can either add a box at the origin coming from this pole or add the origin or at shifted positions coming from the poles in this polynomial p tilde. Polynomial B tilde. And assuming further that psi acting on a state with an added box is again governed by a simple formula where we simply multiply the eigenfunction psi lambda by the factor of phi times z minus epsilon at added location. This rule actually turns out to require a modification, but that turns out not to modify the argument here. Adding boxes adds Adding boxes at the shifted or PT location does not change possible locations to which one can add boxes at the unshifted or dt location, and vice versa. So since growing boxes at the shifted and unshifted location is independent, and the psi 2 generator counting the number of boxes is invariant under the charge conjugation, the character of the module factorizes into the following form. form where we have the Megmahan function counting boxes in the 3D the empty 3d corner and there's this Kai IPT lambda muenu that counts the boxes at the at the shifted location or the PT location and this is exactly the formula rating the DT and Exactly, the formula rating the DT and PT topological vertex due to Pandri, Pander, and Thomas. Let me now tell you there actually exists a way to divide by this Magmahon part at the level of algebras. So assuming that Ez acts again by a sum of terms proportional to 1 over Z minus epsilon box, for epsilon box being the position of the added box. The addition of the first box at the DT location, At the DT location, which is at the non-shifted origin, is going to be proportional to 1 over Z. But since the first box at DT location can be generated only by, and that means that the first box at the DT location can be generated only by E0, because this term is never going to contribute to terms proportional to E. To ENs for higher n that are encoded by the terms of the form one over z to the n with n greater or equal to one. So restricting to the co-current of this E0 produces a nice module of the sub-algebra A generated by psi i and fi for i and a non-negative. i for i and a non-negative integer, but only e i for i greater than zero. And we can then that we can thus construct a P T module for the algebra A infinity by dividing by taking co-kernel of the E0 generator. So you can see that chi P T so right and this can be thought of as an algebraic refinement Be thought of as an algebraic refinement or algebraic uplift of the DTPT conjecture. Okay, in the rest of the talk, I'm going to review how to actually define these PT modules more concretely rather than using the charge conjugation. So far, we have really used the charge conjugation. It is nice and concise way to define those modules, but it's pretty. Those modules, but it's pretty hard to work with. So it'd be nice to have a more concrete definition, like really in terms of an explicit formulas for the action of the generators E, F, and Psi. And in order to do that, let me recall the PT box counting. Since it turns out that the chi P T lambda mu nu actually admits a box counting interpretation that we are going to review next. So, right. So, first, let me review how to perform the transition from the DT box counting to the PT box counting. So, here we have this vacuum configuration of the DT box counting. And the first step in this transition, we want to extend the two half-infinite cylinders. two half infinite cylinders in negative along negative directions to obtain the figure in the middle. And the next step, we are going to remove all the boxes in the positive quadrant that do not lie at least in the intersection of two asymptotics. So this produces the picture on the right. And here I've labeled the boxes that lie exactly in two asymptotics, asymptotic cylinders by the blue color, and those that lie in the intersection of all the three cylinders of shape given by the partitions are labeled by red colour. Generalization of the module structure for two For two asymptotics, it is straightforward. It is really the same thing as in the case of the high wall modules. The only difference is that one builds partitions inside these hollow structure given by the proposal from the previous slide. But compared to two asymptotics, we can associate three kinds of, but compared to two asymptotics, Compared to two asymptotics, the module structure for the three asymptotic case is very much different. And it's different because we can associate three kinds of boxes to the location at the intersection of three cylinders, those red locations. And let me call the boxes heavy, light, and ultra-heavy. Let me introduce these simplified rules for adding boxes in the PT, in the PT location. These are kind of These are kind of oversimplified rules, but they're going to be sufficient for the purpose of our talk. So, first, light and heavy box contribute by weight one and ultra-heavy box contributes by weight two. Light box cannot support other boxes, and heavy box can support boxes at uncore location, but only in one direction. To illustrate the main difference between the modules m lambda mu nu and those pt. And those PT modules, it is actually going to be sufficient to consider the box, box, box module. And in turn, the above-simplified rules are actually sufficient to determine the box counting in this case. Okay, so let me review the box counting in this example very briefly. So we have the following vacuum configuration. We can see that there's only a single red box corresponding to the intersection of the two. Corresponding to the intersection of the two semi-infinite cylinders, the two infinite cylinders. And on top of this vacuum configuration, we can obviously add a box on the red location. But on the red location, there are three kinds of boxes that we can add. One that is the heavy box, light box, and the ultra-heavy one. But the ultra-heavy one, according to rules on the previous slide, cannot be created at level. Cannot be created at level one because it has weight two. So the only thing that we can create at the red location is the heavy or the light box. On the other hand, at weight two, we can either transform either of the two red, two boxes at the red location into the ultra-heavy box, or we can keep stacking boxes. Keep stacking boxes on top of the heavy, um, heavy box in either of the two directions, right? So you can have like a heavy box here and a box on top of it here, or heavy box or any of the other three possible directions. Okay, and what turns out is possible that one can try, one can bootstrap the action of all. Bootstrap the action of all the generating functions of E, F, and Psi in this basis of PT box given by PT box counting. But some modifications of the standard rules are necessary. To motivate the first modification, or actually the main one, recall the charge conjugation of the eigenfunction, psi eigenfunction acting on the highest. Psi eigenfunction acting on the highest weight state. It is given by the following expression. And compared to the DT modules, you can see that there is a second power appearing in the denominator here. So that suggests that the generic functions should contain higher order poles as well. And writing an ansatz for E, for the action of E of the following. For the action of E of the following form, where you can see that the light box or the state-associated light box is multiplied by the second-order pole term, and the heavy box is multiplied by the first-order pole. It turns out that one can satisfy the psi-E relation if E relation if psi acts in the following way. Right, so there should be this other term multiplies 0 L. So in particular, you can see that the action of psi in order to understand modules, these PT modules or PT modules, one need to introduce One needs to introduce non-diagonalizable action of the Cartan generators psi. One can then write down answers for the action of f and check the e f relation of the affine and determine all the coefficients in the all the coefficients in in the coefficients in in front of the first and second order pole uh in all the in our anzac in in our anzats in terms of the first order in terms of the first order and second order pole of the generating function psi and these are the explicit relations here i sketch the construction only for the simplest module associated Simplest module associated with the box, box, box configuration. But you can perform the very same analysis for an arbitrary PT-like module and recover very explicit module structure on the vector space with basis labeled by Pandri Panda Thomas, Pandri Panda Thomas box configurations. So let me conclude with So let me conclude with a summary. First, we have seen that the trivial looking charge conjugation automorphisms of W infinity has highly non-trivial consequences when used in the context of the Feynman. We have found that a pair of W infinity and A infinity modules parameterized by partitions lambda, mu and nu, describing points and points of N2 brains on M5 brains. Two brains on M fibrains from the perspective of M fibrains and M2 brains, respectively. We have found that their characters coincide with the DT topological vertex and the PT topological vertex. We have also seen that the PT modules admit an explicit construction utilizing the Pandary Panditoma box counting that requires an introduction of non-diagonalizable action of Cartan generators. Of Cartan generators and higher-order pulse in generating functions. And finally, we have seen that the DTPT correspondence has an algebraic uplift to the relation between the Pandere-Pandomas and the Nawson-Thomas-like modules of W infinity and A-infinity algebra, where one of them is a co-kernel of the other one, co-kernel of the geometer EZ. Of the geometer E0 of the other module. And finally, let me just sketch some obvious other directions. Exchanging the compact C3 by other toric geometries lead to other rich classes of M2 and M5 in algebras, like a matrix refinement on the story and And many other interesting things that will be nice to explore. Exchanging the C2 part in the non-compact directions of the space-time should lead to trigonometric or Q-deformed version of the story. It would be also nice to find geometric realization of these modules discussed here, analogously to the old work of Nakajima of the algebra. Uh, the algebra, the geometric action of Katzmulli algebras on the moduli space of in some tons, and there are obviously many, many possible applications in different kinds of in like all around physics and mathematics. Thank you very much for listening, and I hope there will be many questions. Let's go ahead and thank the speaker. Any questions? Go ahead, Sergei. Hi, Marisa. Nice talk. Hello, thank you. Good to see you. So, this system of M-theory brains, it has more structure. Structure related to, I mean, can I ask about left and right sector of a conformal field theory, which in the language of algebraic geometry of DT or PT would be to ask about the homology of the corresponding moduli spaces and their definitions in terms of and you can ask about its cohomology rather than numerical invariance. So, have you thought about it either from the Thought about it either from the physics perspective or from this algebraic geometry perspective, how to recover this more structure. So you're asking about the left and right sector of the CFT. Yeah, on the M5 brains and the corresponding modules, there will be certain operators whose phrase and cucohomology is exactly what you're describing. Describing, but I'm basically asking if there is a description of the full physical system or in algebraic geometry language of if you thought about moduli spaces. I think for Y algebra, I did boris. We had some thoughts on it in this POA paper, but I don't, I have no idea what would be the A analog. And you have a nice A story here. So can you tell me more about the device story? I'm not sure I understand what exactly you mean. So, if you can be just more specific about just take, say, this configurations of M5 brains, so by story, we don't need M2 brains, and ask what is the effective physics two-dimensional theory that you find on these brains. So, it will be some 0,2 or 0,4 theory. I mean, in the case with two-brains. I mean, in the case with two brains, it will be effectively zero to and then you basically ask what's the superconformal theory? That's that's the physics language, right? Okay, that's an algebraic geometry language if you prefer sheets or modules, basically. I see, and now you're asking the same question for the M2 brain. What's going to be the full theory? Well, I can tell you the answer for. Well, I can tell you the answer for the single stack of M2 brains. This is just going to be the three-dimensional. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So in the end-to-brain theory, this is going to be some kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, right? And I think the supersymmetric quantum mechanics is just the quantum mechanics at n equals four or something, supersymmetry quantum mechanics that quantizes the like sigma model. like sigma model uh into the adhm um into the adhm quiver for a single stack of m2 brains for these intersecting m2 brains i do not have an answer and i would love to uh but i don't know yeah no thank you for the Are there any other questions? Okay, well, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you for that. And we'll reconvene in about an hour. We'll reconvene in about an hour with the discussion section by Christian Blanche, where he's leading it. Thank you. Thank you. Bye, everyone.
