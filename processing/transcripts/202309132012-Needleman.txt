So, I'm very interested in biological self-organization, and my lab is increasingly working on diverse aspects of that. But the type of thing we've done the most of is study spindles. And that's what I'll put in a comment about it today. Particularly spindles today. I mean, we do spindles in many different types of systems. And I'll tell you about some relatively recent work on spindles in tissue culture cells. So, spindle, self-organized, subcellular structure. On the one hand, Structure. On the one hand, the spindle divides chromosomes. That's one thing it does, very important. But also, the position and orientation of the spindle set the position and orientation of the cleavage plane of the cell. So, which is obviously very important for tissue architecture. So, understanding what determines the position orientation of the spindle is very important. All right, so today I'm going to talk about two bits about. About two bits about spindle mechanics, having to do well, yeah, so I should say we studied many different aspects of biophysics with spindles, but the theme of this conference, this will be two, you know, I don't know, vignettes on spindle mechanics. One will be about the mechanics of spindle positioning in human cells, and the other will be about the mechanics of spindle morphology in human cells. All right, so mechanics of spindle positioning. So, we know from a lot of work, from a lot of people, that Work from a lot of people that astromicrotubles, which are microtubles which extend out from the poles of the spindle, are crucial for spindle positioning and orientation. However, what forces they actually exert and how those forces actually position orient the spindle is not well understood, particularly in human science. And so, Maya, who was a fantastic graduate student in the lab, and now who's a postdoc at Graduate student lab, and now who's a postdoc at MIT. This is what she did her PhD on. So, I'll give you a quick overview of her PhD. Okay, so the idea was that she was going to apply forces to spindles and see how they found out their position. And the way that she did that is she developed a procedure to deliver magnetic beads to human tissue culture cells, and then used magnetic tweezers to apply calibrated force to spindles to study them. Alright, so here's a move these typical. Alright, so here's a move these type of experiments. So she, you know, takes the bead and then can push the spindle pole and see how it sees how it responds. And again, this is calibrated, so she knows what force she's inserting. And, you know, and so you can see what happens when she pushes on the spindle pole, the whole spindle rotates. And in this case, the spindle is rotating at essentially a constant rate as she's pushing on. All right, so now she can repeat this many, many times. She can repeat this many, many times in many, many different cells. And then it has a bit of spread, but she sees something. She can average together that's less spread. But okay, anyways, so this is the part where the force is turned on and depending on how the little things are rotating. Right, okay, so she knows the force she's applying, she knows the length of the spindle, therefore she can figure out what torque she's applying. She can figure out what torque she's applying. And if you just say that you have some resistance to rotation, which is sort of your relation between the torque and the speed it's rotating, then by measuring the speeds, you can figure out what that resistance to rotation is. Or are the cells fixed? The cells are fixed somehow and you rotate the spin around. Oh, well, I mean, they're adherent cells, so they're just getting, yeah, do the spread have to do with how much they're spread like spreading the data? Oh, uh no, I don't think so. Yeah, no. Yeah, no. Yeah, I don't think it's related to that. Okay, so then she gets some number, which is 15 people newtons minutes per micron degree, which I'm sure you'll all agree is a fascinating number. But one of the things which is interesting about this number is that if you estimate what you know, like what this number would be if the resistance to rotation was purely due to cytoplasmic drag, this number is about ten times the greater than you have. This number is about 10 times the greater than that. And so the resistance to rotation from the spindle is not due to cytoplasmic fag. And in fact, she can do an experiment, which I won't tell you how, magically, she can change the viscosity of the cell, and she can see that that actually doesn't affect the resistance to rotation. All right. All right, so perhaps in rest of it, it's not really so surprising. The resistance to rotation is most likely, and I'll come back and say later, it is, set by actually the interaction of the Set by actually the interaction of the air-store microtubules with the chord counts. That's what's the transition fluctuation, not cytoplasm interaction. All right, so what are those interactions like? And in particular, here's an incredibly basic question. Do these astromicrotubules actually push on the quartets, or they pull on the quartets mostly? Actually, even at this level, this has been controversial in human cells. All right. So, one way you could figure that out is you could cut the microphone. You could cut the microtubules, and if you cut the astral microtubules and you were succouring via pushing, then you would notice that it would be toward the cut. If there was pulling, you would cut and you move away from the cut. All right, so Hai Yen Wu, who's a postdoc in the lab, she built what I humbly claim is the world's best laser evolution system. And this is a reduced repetition rate from the second laser, which can evolve sub- Of late, with sub-micron precision, she can do complicated three-dimensional cuts, which very, very little damage outside of the piece of blading. And then Hyan and Maya use this together to cut a little curved surface to ablate astromicrotoodles near one of the poles. And when they do that, they see that the spindle rotates away. They see that the spindle rotates away from the cut. And so spindles rotate away from the cut, which means that, oh, yeah, and that you can do this for many, many spindles. And if you average stuff together, it looks very reproducible. No, no, I mean, it is reproducible, that'll always be because you cut, and that's not future cuts somewhere else. Cytoplasm. Is it downward part recoil? And so, and so, what happens? So, you cut the microtubules and roughly. So, you cut the microtubules and roughly 20 seconds later they grow back. Yeah. I mean, you can't. It'd be a fantastic conversation to have if. Yeah, those quote. Yeah, what exactly is being cut? So the astromicrotubules. And so these microtubules, which are there are microtubules which are There are microtubules which are radiating out. Yeah, so maybe it's a little, I'll go back to the cartoon. So you have these microtubules which radiate out from the spindle poles, and she's cutting these ones. I guess technically she's cutting everything that's there, all the proteins. But we're really pretending this is clearly astromicotubule. Okay, and so, okay, this argues that astromicotubiles are primarily during pulling forces. All right? Alright, so now, okay, so now she can do the following trick. Okay, and after she cuts, she can see how fast the spindle moves right away after the cut. By the force measurements, she knows what force it would take to make the spindle move at that speed. And therefore, she can say what force was being exerted by the microtubles she cut. By EM measurements, we actually know, we can estimate the number of microtubules. We can estimate the number of microtubles that work up. And by putting those together, she can estimate a forces per astromicotyl that contacts the cortex. And if she puts all of those numbers together, she gets an estimate of about one kilonewton per astromicrotule that is contacting the cortex. And that suggests that that's similar to the stall force of a molecular motor, such as dynein. And that suggests that each astromicotubal is. That each ester microtugal is likely being pulled by a single molecular remote. All right, so speaking of dynein, again, a lot of work from a lot of people. We know that actually dynine binds the cell cortex. There's a lot of dynamic gets recruited there. And if you knock down a particular protein that's responsible for getting recruited there, it's no longer at the cortex. So Maya can do that at the experiment, so she can remove the dynaphone cortex. And when she does that, now laser. Does that now laser ablation no longer causes the sponge to rotate, so she strongly reduces pulling forces. And when she uses a magnetic tweezer, it becomes very, very, very easy to move the spindle. Actually, it becomes similar to what you'd expect from cytoplasmic drag. So that argues that pulling forces from cortical dyne determine the resistance to rotation on the spindle. Alright. And in a fair of them, my A few of them were dying uh uh Maya has done a bunch of work knocking down many other proteins that regulate diamond cortex and has had various effects. But are the acid microtubules still there? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, they are still there, they're just not anchored. Tiny post, yeah, pulse. And then actually, we've done, so I don't, I'm not gonna tell you about it, but I'll just serve, we've worked a lot with my Worked a lot with Mike Shelley to develop a theory which then can actually explain how the pulling forces from astral microtubules of this magnitude actually can use that theory to explain the actually observed cancer dials of the orientation. And actually, just, this is maybe a little bit counterintuitive because other people have proposed that just pulling forces alone actually can't center something like a spin. Something like a spindle, but what a lot of previous theorists neglected is that if you have a molecular motor that can only bind a single astral microfield at a time, just using that kind of stoichiometry, that allows only forces to be stabilizing. That's sufficient to explain everything. Okay, that was pretty fast, but I'll go into the next subject. Unless there are any quick questions. How many astromicrotubials are there up in the cell? Twelve are there in a cell? Is that pretty consistent, I guess? That's really the question, I guess. Oh, well, certainly cell type varies a lot from cell type to cell type. And so in these cells, I believe the number of astromicles that's contacting the cortex is of order, I can't remember the exact number, well, we don't know the exact number, but I can remember our best estimates of the exact number, but it's going to be of order 20 per pole. They're not short pieces, but they're continues from the notable port from the yeah, so that's a great question. So, so, okay, so like the EM which we have right now for this is very, very limited, and so it's hard to say for sure. There definitely are examples where they do go all the way from the pole. In C. elegans, for example, I know for sure they don't go all the way. So it's certainly not true that they always go from the pole. But the astral microtubules, is there another cytoskeletal network there? Are they like Psychoskeletal network there? Are they like interpenetrating through active, or is there nothing out, or is it fluid they're going through? It's it's um uh well, okay, I guess there's uh yeah, so there's there's there's no obvious other filamentous network there. There's certainly membranes and stuff like that. When Maya used the magnetic tweezer to measure the rheology of her computer best to measure the rheology of the cytoplasm, it's essentially viscous as far as you can. So when the spindles rotate. So, when the spindle is rotating, the astromicotubules just originally going with it? That's a great question. That's a really great question. Actually, like, it's very hard to image the astromicrotubules with light microscopy, do a good job of imaging it. So, we really don't know the answer to that, but that's a really interesting question. See the cell method default? No, we don't see it in DLC or so. I think we use it. We don't see any obvious, yeah, yeah. I mean, actually, what people have done, what Steffi Brennan has done in CL, again. Steffi Redmond has done in C. elegans is by knocking down stuff which weakens the cortex, I think, screwing up actin, I forget exactly what it was, or something like that. In that case, they actually can see membrane protrusions being drawn out and when astral microtubles contact, but that requires kind of screwing stuff up a bit. Sorry, you mean being pulled in. Oh, I'm sorry, yes, pulled. Yes, yes, I'm sorry, pulled into the interior. Yeah, I'm sorry. The escalate microtolets grow back after you can do the stellar. Yes, yeah, they grow back in roughly 20 seconds. Do you do the experiment multiple times? Was that the, that's for a single cell? Are you showing traces from the same cell? Those are separate experiments or separate cells. And so you can do it for multiple times. I mean, eventually the cell starts freaking out. You can do it a few times. But yeah. How dynamic do you become? Oh, very dynamic. Oh, varied. So their lifetime is, as far as we can tell, is of order 22%. You have only 20 of them. Can you see fluctuations? There are a lot of fluctuations. There are a lot of fluctuations. Actually, that's not something which we, I miss the theory that we haven't explained a lot. We haven't been able to get it to explain the fluctuations yet. We'd have to do some more sophisticated overdue now, but I thought that's a really interesting thing to look at on. Okay, so now I'll tell you about the work on mechanics of spindle morphology in human tissue culture cells. Alright, so metaphase spindle, so I'm thinking of the spindle metaphase, where the chromosomes are aligned up in the middle. And so spindles in human tissue culture cells contain roughly 10,000 microtubules. And these microtubules are continuously growing and shrinking and sliding relative to each other, even as the spindle maintains a constant size and shape. Maintains a constant size and shape. And however, our understanding of spindle mechanics in human cells has been limited by a lack of information on spindle structure. But that's all changed recently due to work from Thomas Muller-Reichart's group by Gunnar and Robert, who have done large-scale, totally amazing work, large-scale reconstructions of symbols by serial section option tomography. So, what they do is that they take these. So what they do is that they take these human cells, they do high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution, and then embed the stuff in plastic, they cut sections, each of these sections are 300 nanometers thick, they do tomography on those sections, they track all the microtubules in one of those sections, and then they do 30 more sections, and then they stitch all the microtubules together, and then they have a complete EM reconstruction of every microtubule. Reconstruction of every microtubule mosquito. So you know it's the trajectory of every microtubule, you know, where it's ends up, everything. And so here I'm just showing kinetic core microtubles, which are microtubles, which touch the special regional chromosomes called the kinetic core. And we also have a lot of kinetic microtubules. That looks like more than 20%. No, and so here, actually, there are very few, the astromicotrotubules would be like these type of. And yeah, so there are very few astromices. Yeah, so like there are very few astrometric holes here. Does this sound like one of the small one? This is Gila. And so the red ones, are the red ones like a bunch of small ones or are they continuous from the pole to the kinetic part? And so they're not continuous. Their ends are distributed all throughout. The minus ends are distributed all throughout. And so we've done a lot of work investigating that. Okay, okay. This data is incredibly rich. There's a huge amount of information here. We've done a lot of work, for example, investing. We've done a lot of work, for example, investing in kinetical microtubules and comparing a lot of light microscopy measurements of dynamics with the EM to try to understand what they might be doing. Today I'll just tell you the work that we've done about analyzing these EM reconstructions to learn about mechanics of spinomorphology. The red lines? Are they tubing? Do you only want the red lines or are they shorting? Well, each red line is an individual microtubule. So they are lines deep or half. So, they are lengthy about how long it's been? Well, no, and so this is very misleading. It's very hard to look at this and tell the length because there's so much going on. For example, the blue microtubules are essentially distributed with a mean length of two microns, even though the spindle is 10 microns in length. For the blue ones, the red ones are not essentially distributed. Those are five of me. Yeah, but some go all the way, some don't. It's very complicated, very interesting, and we've done a bunch of work on it. Again, very interesting, and you've done a bunch of work on that. It'd be fantastic to talk about further content. The fact that there's a wrinkle, is it some artifact? Because I would have expected it to be. Regular? There's a wrinkle. Oh, no, no, no, that's real. I'll come back to that. On what's a length scale? 10 microns pole to pole. Yeah, I'll come back to the very sharp kinks. Oh, yeah, okay. There may be a little bit of some kinks like yeah, there may be a little bit of stuff which could be artifacts, but the vast majority of the bands are real. But the vast majority of the events are very readable. Okay, so one of the things, okay, so Will, who's another, another phenomenal graduate student in the lab, I've been very lucky to work with amazing, both grad students and postdocs, who's now a postdoc at Flatiron and New York Social Biology Center. He did a lot of this analysis of EMTA and light microstructure. When you combine the two, this is just one of the things he did. One of the things is just looking at the orientation of microfuels. All right, okay. Alright, okay. So then what he does is that, well, he just holds off all the microtubules in the spindle. And here this is just projecting them in 2D for display. And you can see that here's one of the sensor zones. The microcuttles over here are going up, microcubles over there going down, et cetera. And so then Thomas Lescript did constructions of three spindles and will averaged the results from this together. And here's orientation averaged together. Okay, so now we want to think about the mechanics of what's determining the orientation of microcridols in this spindle and what's determining the morphology of the spindle. All right, so, all right, so yeah, think about. And one thing we're going to think about is drawing an analogy with liquid crystal droplets. So we heard about tachoids earlier. So tachoids, you know, Ben Mr. Hopefully you were paying attention to Jenny's talk, but like if you were, if you tick around like while field If you take round-like bottle peels and just throw them together, which are attractive, they can form liquid crystal droplets, which have a kind of a shape that looks a lot like a spindle. That's true for inorganic molecules. It can be true with actin mixed with a depletant. And it can be true with microtubules and PRC1. Now, of course, these are passive liquid crystal droplets, which I've just Liquid crystal droplets, which are just kind of formed by liquid crystal physics, where the spindle is perhaps an active liquid crystal droplet. Again, what do I mean by that? I mean that in the passive case, the relevant things which are going on are conservative forces and friction and drag, while in the active liquid crystals, you have molecular motors and microtule growing and shrinking and nucleation, all of which use chemical energy. Alright, so continuum theories for both. Continuum theories for both active lignin crystals and passive lithman crystals can be very complicated, but one can argue that in the limit that's relevant for the spindle at steady state, it all just reduces to del squared n equals zero. And so, and so what is this? What I mean by that? So, basically, this is essentially the limit where you have no flows, which we think is what's true in this middle, and that all the white. In the spindle, and that all the micropoints are incredibly well aligned. So it's just basically. Oh, no, I'm talking about inside the spindle. I'm not talking about the boundary right now, but I'll come back to that. All right. And then it's also true that in some cases, in some limits, acid-liquid crystals inside that as well. All right, okay, so, and this is just, people aren't used to thinking about it. This is essentially the way to think about it, this is just a theory in which. Essentially, the way to think about this is just a theory in which micro tubes just locally want to line up relative to each other, and that's and it's okay whether they want to line up to them like motors or passing cross-linkers or steric interactions or whatever. They all have the same form. All right. All right, so then Will asked, all right, is this type of theory, can this describe the orientation of microtubles inside the spindle? That's all we're talking about right now. So then he just did the following, the theory of this. He said, okay, let's assume the spindle is an ellipse because it isn't. Assume the spindle is an ellipse because it is an ellipse. And then just place down two plus one defects where the spindle poles are. And say the microtubles want to radiate out from those. And then just assert that the microtubles want to be tangential to the boundary. And then just solve del spread n equals zero everywhere inside. And he does that. Oh, then, and then you have to adjust the position of the defects to see where they, you know, to make them line up with just by hand, just to adjust them. Just by hand, just adjust them to get look like the experimental data. And then that's what he gets. All right, from this. He just, by hand, just positions them to calculate the energy. This is not done here, so this will be. We can talk about that later, but as of now, this is just. Just put it where you see it. Just put it where we see it. Yeah, that's all. This is data fit. Besides, I mean, it's. Besides, I mean, it's delta. It's fitting for the positions, and then it's solving our currents. So, why is the capillary film in 2D? No, no, it's not in 3D. It's not in 3D. We're just showing it in 2D so you can look at it. Okay, so let's look at this more carefully. Okay, this is the EM results. We also did quantitative polarized light microscopy measurements to measure the orientation everywhere just because we were being paranoid about checking the EM. And we had this theory. And we have this theory, and they look very similar. And if you do like line scans and you look at all of them, the theory basically perfectly captures everything and orientation everywhere. And I think this is really remarkable because, again, they agree, but the predictions depend only on boundary condition defects. There's no parameters here, right? But we get very good. But we get very good agreement. And so, this again, I think, argues that this picture of local mutual alignment and micro-tribal standard orientation argues in favor. Okay, but what sets the spindle boundary? Right, so we talked about that a second ago. All right, in other words, you can say, so the spindle is an ellipse, but what determines its aspect ratio? All right, so there are maybe three expected contributions. You can imagine there's Controls, you can imagine there's surface tension, you can measure there's pneumatic elasticity, and you can measure there's active stresses. Okay, but which ones dominate? All right, so by looking at the relationship between the spindle aspect ratio and the size and its size, I can provide insight. So what I mean by that is that, so for example, let's just consider a case of surface tension balancing pneumatic elasticity. Again, this would now be what determines the aspect ratio of a typical Of a typical acid tactoid under certain cases. So, this problem should be studied a lot. And, of course, in general, it's very complicated, but this is just a simple scaling argument by Vanderschutt. So, you can just think about this as some surface tension, some dynamic elasticity, and you can balance those and minimize the free energy with constant volume, and you get some formula for the aspect ratio as a function of the volume. And so, for example, And so, for example, for passolipid crystals, such as FD viruses with Depsterum, which were identified by Vener Dojek, this theory from Vanderschoot, at least qualitatively, seems to capture the trends in the data. All right, but what about spindles? So spindles in human tissue culture cells are really screwed up, and therefore they have different sizes. Well, just qualitatively, like it goes like this. It's just qualitative. You know, it goes like this. This is called paper. Whatever, okay. It's not like paper. Okay, all right, okay. But what about for spindles? So that we can ask the same thing for spindles. How does this do? And that's the, it doesn't do a great job of capturing the trend in this case. Okay, yeah, okay, okay. Quickly. All right, okay. But if you use an alternative theory where it's just actually actually stressing bound surface tension, surface tension, you can do a Attention, you can do a more of a stress balance argument. And in this case, you also get a relationship between the two, and that does capture the trends. And you can fit this with one parameter, which is essentially the ratio of the state cancer math and stress. And you can get a number out when you do that. And then what Will did is now he started doing perturbations. So, for example, if we returch PC5, which is a motor that slides into a parallel. A motor that slides antiparallel microtubules on the knob, if he does a partial inhibition of PC5, which is a motor that slides antiparallel microtubules away from each other, then this ratio increases. If you're a partial humanist dining, this ratio decreases. Can you do, is it possible to expand a volume lower? Like, is there a limit to how low you can go? Just to see if you can really follow that trend? Oh, totally. No, that would be awesome. I mean, like, well, this is just a function. Like, well, this is just a function of how screwed up the cells are. So, this is like we're not doing anything, we're just looking at screwed up tissue protocol cells. And so, this is just like what we have in our dish, basically. But no, yeah, it's a, yeah, I mean, this is just, I'm not claiming it's getting everything right, but it's clearly like capturing the gist of what's happening, I would say. Okay, and so then this suggests that Kinsha 5 is contributing to extensile after stresses, and dynamia is perhaps contributing to. The stress is, and Daniel is perhaps completing the circuit which I can track out of the stresses. All right, I'll try to go to the next part pretty quickly. Okay, all right. And so, and then we'll do a bunch more rotations. All right. All right, so that's, okay, so we want to further test this idea of does active lipid fiscal theories, are they really good? And, and, okay, so active lipid fiscal theories of an average orientation, but what about deviations away from the average? So, for example, Average. So, for example, you know, the director, you know, maybe on average it's all this way, but at any given point, it might be some fluctuating in some different configuration. And so, again, in the absence of flows, one can argue that, like, okay, it's very simple in the absence of flows. That all you have is that, you know, you have some equation of motion for n, which would just be k del squared n equal plus some noise. So this is numatical elasticity. So, this is pneumatic elasticity, this is the magnetic noise. If this is all you have, you predict that the fluctuations would go like 1 over q squared. And so with actual data, at any given location on record two, we know what the actual director is just by looking at the DM. Oh yeah, sorry, this is all work done by Sari and Hado, who's also fantastic about the flat iron. And one can calculate, so by EM, you just observe the local kinetic directive. The local director, and then you can calculate del spread n equals zero at that location, and therefore you know what the average director should be, and therefore you can calculate this empirically, you can calculate the correlation function, and it does, you know, it more or less goes like one over two squared, as this simple theory predicts. And then one can consider density fluctuations. One can consider density fluctuations as well. So, if you now modify this and you include the density field, and you say microtubules can undergo a kind of random diffusive-like motion, and they're actively transported along the streamlines of the director field, and they nucleate and turn over. Then you can also calculate, in this very simple thing, density-density correlation functions and pneumatic density cross-correlation and the trends. And the trends are at least relatively consistent with the data. Now, that argues that this theory does a decent job of explaining the collective fluctuations. Now, microtubles in the spindle aren't straight. Okay, we've talked about this before. You can see all these crazy curves. Can we understand that from this framework as well? So the idea is, the way to think about this, or the way we think about this, is that you consider any given microtubule as a microtubule. Consider any given microtubule as a microtubule interacting with the active kinematic given by the other microtubules around it. And so, in other words, you're thinking about this. Yeah, okay, and so then building off work from Ramaswamy and Rao and collaborators, they developed a theory for a semi-flexible polymer in an active pneumatic, which we did some minor modifications of. And this is very reminiscent of the. And this is very reminiscent of this type of stuff which Christoph was talking about, but in our case, we're considering again this filament in the type of pneumatic instead. And so we have the filament under, you know, kind of go bending. It wants to align with the pneumatic. And you have fluctuations due to the fluctuation in the director causing fluctuations to happen with stress. And one can calculate in this, one can predict from this that bending fluctuations go kind of like one over two stresses. Go kind of like one over two squared. I just don't know. Are the micro tubules bundled here? Like, meaning all the inputs are wrapped into magnetism. They're all relatively bundled here. So, so, okay, it's a really interesting question. We've asked ourselves that question as well. Like, what does it mean to say they're bundled when I actually analyze the EN data? Like, in some sense, you know what I mean? Like, how can we analyze it to define a bundle? And so. Well, I mean, certainly the density, density, you know, like the form of the fluctuation. Like in this theory, there's no concept of bundling. And at least at the level of the fluctuations I've shown, this very simple theory can capture it. I'm not sure. Well, it'd be good to talk about. I'm not sure. Do you see that? Yeah, cross-connections to Libra like you doing this? So that you can't visualize Cry. Yeah, or sorry, at least not this EM. So if I went to Cryo EM, one might have a hope of doing it. One did Crywell might have a hope of being left in half of this. But I just want to show my big punchline. Oh, data supposed to be raised. Okay, so this theory predicts us what Rt squared, basically. And this is the actual vanity functions of the data. This is the theory. Now, one thing which is interesting is actually this function, this form is basically the same that you would get in even a passive system. But the apparent persistence length, okay, a real microtril is a persistent length of a millimeter. The kind of apparent persistence length that we calculate. A parent persistence length can be calculated. You can look at this as like 10 microns. And so it's obviously this, it's not equilibrium, but it's not the same functional form. Anyways, okay, so work in project, you know, so I think that's all great. But we also want to do direct mechanical measurements of the spindle. And so Maya is considering Maya's other Maya's work. It is getting magnetic, is moving. Getting a magnetic bead, is moving magnetic beads inside spindles and directly doing force measurements to try to determine the internal rheology of the spindle more directly. And her ultimate goal is to get to the mechanics of chromosome segregation. And so I'll just very briefly say, okay, so spindle positioning, we think that each astromicrotule context of core text is pulled on by a single molecule diamine, and a model of that can explain the antana system of construction orientation. String orientation. And then an active looking crystal theory can explain this between the cells, the spindle shape, spindle scaling, microtrol orientations, fluctuations, and microtril bending, which argues that I think is pretty good. And we want to go towards having a more microscopic understanding of where this kind of like core screen pressure comes from. So I have a question about the persistence length that you mentioned. Do they behave like worm-like chains? Like, is it just decorrelation of tangent angles, or is there some underlying sigmoidal modulation? Well, and so the spectrum of their behavior looks exactly like the equilibrium one. I mean, that's an empirical statement. But and yeah. Well, yeah, so it's an empirical statement, and so like there's not anything which looks like if you just look at the spectr, the form of the spectra empirically, that just ends up to be true. But we could argue about why that's true or not true. It also ends up that this is the theory which in a certain sense can predict that as well. And so it's kind of a consistent explanation of that. Well, what devil's advocate on that point a little bit? It turns out there's multiple different unequilibrium microscopic. Non-equilibrium mechanisms. We have the same equilibrium apparent persistence-length sort of huge mechanism. So it's a little hard to identify one model over another, although this does seem at least to be consistent with. But what would be useful would be to, I think, test how the amplitude of that spectrum depends on some parameter you can chip or adjust. Oh, because people throw out the term effect of typically. You know, people throw out the term effective temperature, of course, to get effective thermal spectra. But there's there have been multiple different mechanisms for getting temperature. Oh, there's no effective temperature in this theory. No, I know, but you get a Q squared. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of things will believe you that, if you say that. And so at least that has been referred to. That's what it makes sense. No, and I'll just mention one thing: actually, nearly everything which I showed here would essentially have the same. Here, like, would essentially have the same prediction for an equilibrium stuff. Not entirely everything, you know, like, you know, because there is stuff from this term which you wouldn't get from an equilibrium stuff, but nearly everything would look equilibrium model. I just bet the bend thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the one thing I want to say is that I think you're 100% right, and you really want to go there. I'll do creation, but it's not even clear to me, I mean, we're going to do it, but like, how we're going to know if our well, okay, yeah, I know. We're going to need some more microscopic model to connect it to. But yeah, it's a totally different thing. Looks like these these bands sorry. These bands were so large, they they seem to be non-dynamic almost, right? They seem to be just buckles that were frozen in time. Oh, and so they're certainly not frozen in time. Again, the turnover of those microtutles is like 20 seconds. Okay, we do. Well, of the blue ones. The red ones are longer. I was looking at the red ones. So the red ones, if they were to stretch out, the whole spindle would have to stretch out. Well, uh I mean, um well, okay, you know, I think yeah, no, no, they are pretty large. I mean, you know, it varies. I mean, I was just zooming on one particular region of one particular reconstruction. Yeah, here. Yeah, like every weight. If you want to make those guys go through their equilibrium position, the whole spin would have to be. Well, okay, there's multiple things going on here. One thing which is very interesting is that you can see, okay, it's a little hard to see from here. It's a little hard to see from here. The pole here, okay, if you think of the spinal as an ellipse, the pole is inside that ellipse. The microtubules do, even the kinetical microtubules follow those streamlines on average and even go around and turn in. So they even do that. And so there's definitely a lot going on here. There's also Kinetic Core and Linux Intel RX and Yeah, that's the new ones, but the ones that connect and act five is in between us all. So it can be tension and compression at the same time. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, both of them. Yeah, yeah. Well, one thing I just want to clarify again, like earlier, these blue ones, which were the so-called interpolar microfuels, they are exponentially distributed with the mean length of 10 microns. So it's not like you see in a cartoon where it's like you have a lot of microlucines in bed, that's just not. A lot of Mike looking good, that's just not how it is. And so it's a bunch of short dies. And it's kind of hard to see from that to each other. But stuck to each other. Yeah, exactly. You showed that the pneumatic elasticity doesn't play a role, the aspect ratio is one to the colour scales of volume. And is that like a requirement? I mean, say that's after pneumatic mirror. You're assuming that there's no less specific scale. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, like, all, like, this was. I mean, like, all like this was, and in some sense, I'm like, I'm making an even weaker claim, I would say. I would say that, like, the data is not consistent with a theory which is pure dnemic elasticity and surface tension and nothing else. The data is consistent with a theory that is pure active stress, again for the shape and surface tension. That doesn't mean that pneumatical SS3 isn't there, right? And in fact, what we believe, even though we haven't shown this yet. Believe in, though we haven't shown this yet, is that main medical SSC, for example, plays a role in setting the position of the defects? Because a lot of times in other pneumatics, there is no elasticity, right? Well, I think if you have a pneumatic, like kind of then there is a pneumatic elasticity, I mean, again, like it's kind of importance may or may not be there. Okay. Yeah. Um asked uh what is the nature of the sort decision? Or the slope to tie it. Okay, that's it. Okay, I mean, the stupidest idea, which I, you know, microtools, you know, cross-linkers, so microtools want to bind each other, and then therefore, you know, things on the surface, you want the surface tends to do to that. That's a possibility. It also could be that there's active components to that. For example, one could imagine that the fact that you have dyne, people have, some people have argued that dyne could also. That dyne could also have a role in giving a surface tension-like impact? I think that's an incredibly interesting question. How that actually arises. Yeah, but the short answer is we don't have. Patients, in first part, dynamic distribution on the cortex. Is it uniform or it is specifically arranged to provide a directional? Provide the directional influence? Yeah, and so the it is not uniform in every in any way you could mean by that. So one of the ways is it's not uniform is that it's enriched in the poles here. And another way it's not uniform, actually, if you look very closely, and this is which we think is actually very important, it's punctate on the cortex. And actually, we think that plays a very important role. And actually, we think that plays a very important role, the clustering of dinormal cortex. Is it delivered by microtubules, by kinesins? Oh, no, no, no. How of the airborne? Okay, so the exact. There are molecules you can knock down which make it no longer there. But how exactly? And so presumably it's kind of, yeah, the real answer is I think that's not totally clear. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if it's essentially diffusing and binding to the things there. I think that would be the most minute calculation, but I think that's not clear. And for the second part, where chromosomes are, the spin hoop in this reconstruction look quite dense. Yes, yes. And it means that chromosomes which are quite big are outside of corporate. Yeah, that's no, no, no, no. No, they're in there. No, no, no, no, no. No, they're in there. Here you can see this is one cross section, and here you can see here's one pole, here's the other pole, here are the chromosomes. I didn't display it in here. But it's not obvious from looking at where the microtubles are. Actually, one thing which is quite interesting, in mouse oocytes, we've done work, actually, Columb Kelleher, who's a bus talking about, has done work looking at this thing in detail. And at mouse oocytes, it seems like there you have chromosome. Like there, you have chromosomes, and you have basically a negative tactoid around them. There's a reason why you don't have microtubules, and it forms this kind of anti-tactoid shape. But that seems, at least as far as we can tell, not to be happening here. Thanks. Fred, I'd answer your question.
