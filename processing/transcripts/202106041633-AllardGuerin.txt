Two talks, and for the first talk, we've got Philippe. And yeah, Philippe, I'll give you a warning after 20 minutes to let you know you've got five minutes left. So, yeah, total time of 30 minutes, 25 talk, five questions. Yeah, so whenever you're ready, Philippe. Okay, thank you, Thomas. And thanks for the organizers for inviting me. So I'll be talking about this work on the Wigner's Friend thought experiment that I did with. That I did with Veronica Bauman, Flavio Lesanto, and Chaslav, who was there at this conference, but I guess it's late now in Europe. So it's quantum foundations, but not really, it doesn't really have much to do with quantum gravity or causality, but has something to do with time. So maybe there's a vague connection that I That I encourage you to find yourself. So, I'm sure most of you are familiar with the basic idea of the TOT experiment. It's kind of an improved version of Schrodinger's cat. So the setup is we have like an isolated closed box, and in this box, there's a friend who is like a normal observer. Normal observer like you and me. And this observer has access to a quantum system, which here will be a qubit, a spin, and performs a measurement on this system. So yeah, here it's a measurement in the Z basis. So the friend can use the usual quantum formalism with the Boeing rule and the state update rule to compute probability. Rule to compute probabilities, like to compute how the probabilities of outcomes depend on the initial state of the spin, and also what is the final state of the spin conditioned on the observed outcome. So these are non-unitary evolutions, as you know. However, there's a conflicting perspective on what is going on from Wigner, who is standing outside and And has, let's say, science fiction levels of technology. And because of this very advanced technology that he has, he can know exactly the quantum state of this joint spin, friend, and everything else system. And for him, it's just pure state evolving unitarily according to the unitary postulate of quantum mechanics. And this Wigner could, for example, And this Wigner could, for example, do measurements that are not compatible with what the friend's measurement is. So, for example, measuring the combined system in the Bell basis. And if we try to reason about what Wigner would think the friend is seeing or what the friend thinks the Wigner is seeing, there can be some apparent paradoxes. And so recently, there's been a lot of interest in this. interest in this with variations of this thought experiment where there's more than one Wigner and more than one friend. And it shows, they're all more or less showing that the Wigner cannot treat the friend's observed outcome as if it were an objective fact. And these are essentially hidden variable arguments. But what we did in this work was slightly different. Uh, was slightly different because we're focusing only on the friend's perspective, so we're putting ourselves in the friend's shoes. And the question we're asking is, can the friend treat her own future and past observed outcomes as objective? If so, what kind of predictions can she make about it? And does it make sense for her to assign probabilities to huge? To future or past observed outcomes. So now I'm going to go over again this same thought experiment, but with a bit more notation. The description will be in this, what we called unitary quantum mechanics, which is basically quantum mechanics without the like state-of-the-art rule. So it's kind of natural if you're a believer. Kind of natural if you're a believer of the many worlds interpretation, but you don't need to believe in the interpretation to use the formalism. So we're going to take this kind of agnostic many worlds type description. Okay, so here we go. The initial state, we assume it's pure of the spin. And then at this time zero, you just have the friend and Wigner who are in a ready state. So they're ready to start the experiment, but haven't yet. Start the experiment, but haven't yet. And the global state of the spin friend and Wigner is just a product state, like here. Then at time T1, the friend is performing her Z basis measurement. And within this unitary quantum mechanics description, what we get is an entangled state of the spin and friend. So that you see here, the friend sees up when the spin was up, and friends. When the spin was up, and the trends down when the spin was down, and we have these amplitudes that we could take the module squared to get probabilities. And finally, at time t2, Wigner has finished performing his measurement on the joint system. And the measurement that he did was a projective measurement that has these two basis states. These are the two relevant states in the projective measurement. In the projective measurement, that are entangled states that depend on these two free parameters. So, in the case where it's one over square root of two, it's just a Bell basis measurement. And again, we describe this unitarily. And what we get is that, well, same kind of idea, an entangled state between Wigner and the spin-franc system. So that Wigner sees outcome one when the combined spin and The combined spin and friend system was in state one, and Vigner sees two when it's in state two. And there are these amplitudes which are starting to get a bit complicated, but not really. Okay, so now what can we do? Using this formalism, there's a clear prescription for how to compute observation probabilities at a single time. For example, this was the state, the global state at time t2. The global state at time t2. And we can use this to compute the probability that Wigner sees outcome one at time t2. It's just the modulus squared of the corresponding amplitude. Similarly, if we want to know what the friend is seeing, it's a bit uglier. You can just rewrite this using the up-down basis. And so if you want to see what's the probability that the friend sees outcome u, it's just the modulus squared of the amplitudes corresponding. Of the amplitudes corresponding to you. So it's this one and this one. And well, the details are not so important, but you can compute these single-time probabilities within this unitary quantum mechanics. But now the question is like, what about probability at multiple times? So here I have this quote from Winger, actually from the paper where he introduced. Where he introduced the thought experiment. And he says, in a kind of very positivistic fashion, one realizes that all the information which the laws of physics provide consists of probability connections between subsequent impressions that the system makes on one if one interacts with it repeatedly, i.e., if one makes repeated measurements on it. But the emphasis is on probability connections between subsequent impressions. Between subsequent impressions, so impressions or observed outcomes at different times. And it's kind of important in the setting that we're considering here because the friend, she knows that Wigner is performing this weird entangled measurement on her. So she would be reasonable to worry that this intervention will disturb the outcome that she observed. Uh, the outcome that she observed, so that her, when at time two, maybe she cannot trust her memory, right? Maybe she would like to say, I'm remembering this, but actually it's not like that because my memory was altered by Wigner. However, it would be nice if she could nevertheless quantify her uncertainty about the connection between the two memories. Connection between the two memories at time t1 and t2 using a probability distribution. This would kind of connect with this idea of Wigner that this is what physics is only about probability connections between impressions at different times. So that's what our theorem will be about. So again, this cartoon at all the times, and to introduce a final bit of notation, at time. Bit of notation at time t1, when the friend has just finished performing her measurement, but Wigner has not yet performed his, the friend, if we're taking the perspective of the friend, right, with putting ourselves in her shoes, sees some definite outcome. And we label this outcome F1. So it's either up or down. And at time T2, after Wigner has done his measurement. His measurement, the friend still sees some definite outcome, which now we label F2 and can be up or down. And we admit the possibility that it might be different from F1, so that the memory is not reliable. But a question we're asking is: Can the frame assign a joint probability to the observed outcomes at the two times? So we are now. So, we now describe the assumptions we make about this two-time probability distribution and try to motivate them as well as possible. Although ultimately, they cannot all be true. So the motivation is not proof that they're correct, just trying to convince you that they're all pretty good assumptions. And these are assumptions are basically governing how this probability distribution. This probability distribution is allowed to depend on the initial state of the spin that is getting measured by the friend. Okay, so the first assumption is kind of the most basic. It's the assumption that it makes sense to assign a joint probability distribution to these two outcomes. So the way it's formulated here, it says the events F1 and F2 can be combined into a joint event in the kind of Event in the kind of probability theory sense of event to which is assigned a probability distribution P of one of two. Moreover, if we want to know the single time probability distributions, we can just use the normal rules of probability calculus and take the marginals. So, why should we expect this to be true? Well, Wigner sort of already, I think, motivated. I think it motivated it for us. It's one way to interpret this is that at the basic level of what physical laws do is provide such probability distributions. Maybe that's too strong, but maybe you can see it's not maybe not all they do, but it's nice that they can do it or something like this. Also, I think our I think our notion, the sort of scientifically usable notion of prediction, I would say, probably uses the probability concept somewhere. And so if we're not allowed to assign probabilities to events at multiple times, what does it mean to predict the future and the past? So it's kind of dropping P1 is dropping predictability of the future. Predictability of the future. Yeah. Okay. Our second assumption is about the one-time probabilities and how they depend. So the probabilities of observations at a single time and how they depend on the initial state of the spin. And it's about what happens when the initial state is in a pure state. So basically, it's this probability rule that I already kind of referred to. Kind of referred to the unitary quantum mechanics probability rule. So, if you want to know what's the probability to see some outcome at some time, you just take this state, evolve it unitarily, and then look at the modulus squared of the amplitude corresponding to the outcome you care about. So, it can be written like this as the trace of this projector onto the outcome you want, and here being the unitarily evolved. A unitarily evolved global quantum state. So, why should this be believed? Well, one thing that's nice about this one is that it's in principle testable, right? You could just record the, well, you need slightly extra assumptions, but you can record the outcomes and then. Record the outcomes and then make the experiment many times, and then get relative frequencies, and then compare it to this formula. And if you get something else, then you can falsify this hypothesis. Also, it's kind of obvious that this is true in the many worlds interpretation. And so basically, by saying this is to say the many worlds interpretation and other interpretation. And other interpretations that have the same empirical consequences is what quantum mechanics is. So that is basically saying, you know, collapsed models don't obey this, but that's not what we're talking about here. So it's questionable, but this one is testable, which is kind of nice. And finally, the third assumption is about how this joint two-time probability distribution depends. Probability distribution depends on the initial state of the system when it's a general density matrix. And it's a pretty natural, again, I would say, assumption that this joint probability should depend convex linearly on the initial density matrix. Okay, it's important to note that this is not logically independent from P1. P1 was the assumption that this joint probability. This joint probability exists, right? So it has to exist in order for this to make sense. So, why should we believe in that one? Well, I think this is a mix of mostly like lack of imagination type arguments. Like, this is the most straightforward way to generalize the Born rule to multiple times. So, the Born rule says that probabilities are given by the trace of row. probabilities are given by the trace of rho with some positive operator. So this is just, which is linear in rho. So this is just a generalization of this. And if you're denying this, this is like the third point here, is that it would be reasonable to ask you to provide the alternative probability rule, right? The correct generalization of the Born rule that is non-linear. That is non-linear and that applies that two times. So, I mean, this can be done, like, this is what actually Bohmian mechanics would do. And finally, you can have a kind of a GPT-like argument for convexity that appears a lot in this type of works, where basically the idea is if the idea of that quantum mechanics is in some sense complete, so that the Some sense complete so that the probabilities pf1f2 only depend on the quantum state but not in the way that it was prepared. So basically you can prepare this mixed quantum state by flipping a coin and then preparing a state as a function of what outcome you saw for the coin. And then you can sort of import the linearity of probabilities into the into here. Into the into here. Okay, so I can already reach the theorem. It's that these three assumptions that I described cannot all be satisfied in the Wigner's French thought experiment for a general choice of the parameters A and B in Wigner's measurement basis. So the proof I just going to sketch the proof. It's not that It's not that complicated. So, the but it maybe is not going to be detailed enough either. So, the assumption P2, so this unitary quantum mechanics single-time probability assumption implies that the probability here would be like for the friend at time t1 to see this outcome, f1 being either up or down, can be computed using the initial state of the. The initial state of the spin and some positive operator that is basically the Heisenberg picture projector onto this outcome that we care about. So V1 is the isometry that brings back the state, the global state of the spin friendliness system at time T1, brings it back to T0. And there at T0, you take the trace. At t0, you take the trace. Similarly, you have the same equations, but with F2 instead for the observations at time t2. So we have now, okay, these V1s can be computed explicitly. So we have these explicit expressions for the probabilities at single times. However, P1 and P3, when taking together, so the assumption that the joint probability Assumption that the joint probability at the two times is linear in the initial state implies that there exists a POVM that gives the joint probability. So you have this collection of positive operators. There's four of them, one for each pair of up or down for F1 and F2, that gives you the joint probability. And furthermore, there was this requirement in P1 that you can. Requirement in P1 that you can get the single-time probabilities by taking the marginals. And this implies that there's the marginals of the POVMs, so that when you sum over the F2 outcomes for G, you should recover the E that was here. And similarly, for the one at time T2. And so this in the there's a theory of mathematical theory of joint measurability. Theory of joint measurability. And in that theory, if there exists a G such that this is the case, the POVMs E1 and E2 are called jointly measurable. And it's known that in this case, they are jointly measurable if and only if their commutator of the POVM elements is zero. Is zero. But we can, okay, I'm almost done, anyways. But we can also compute them explicitly using this assumption, and we show that they are not zero. So we reach the contradiction, which shows that all three assumptions cannot be true simultaneously. So I just, yeah, we'll give some sort of a table of how interpretations. How interpretations that are popular would deal with the theorems, like which assumptions they agree with and which they reject. So it's not exhaustive. Also, the ones with the question mark is not, I'm just not 100% sure that this is where they fall. So, yeah, for example, here in this column, we have many worlds in relational quantum mechanics. So, many worlds. Mechanics. So, many worlds, it's clear that P2 is true. It's essentially the content of the many worlds interpretation. But I don't think I have time to argue for this here, but P1 is false in the many worlds, so that you can only assign joint probabilities at multiple times in situations where there's enough decoherence, but not in general. And because P1 is false, this P3 doesn't. P1 is false, this P3 doesn't really apply. So let's say it's false also. Also, we have here collapse theories, so objective collapse or subjective collapse with cubism. And these theories obey P1, so they have joint probabilities, and these probabilities are also linear in the initial state, but because of the collapse, P2 is false. Is false. And finally, we have this Bohmian mechanics, which is a hidden variable model. So allows us to assign joint probabilities to the outcomes at multiple times, because there's a definite state of affair underlying everything. It's just unknown. And also, Bohmian mechanics is known to reproduce the single-time probabilities of unitary quantum mechanics. So it remains that only Peter. It remains that only P3 has to be false. And this is kind of known in Bohmian in other contexts in Bohmian mechanics. Then finally, so there's basically only five ways to put yes or no to these assumptions. And the final two are ways where both P2 and P3 are false. So this I call maybe provocatively, I don't know, quantum mechanics is wrong. I don't know. Quantum mechanics is wrong because if you don't have unitary quantum mechanics, single-time probabilities are not linear in quantum state, it's like what is left from quantum mechanics. And then, well, maybe P1 can be true or false. So these are all the ways to satisfy the theorem, all the ways to accept or deny interpretation. To accept or deny interpretations, not interpretations, assumptions. Okay, and if we forget about this for the moment, this means that all interpretations of quantum mechanics fall into like three families, which is kind of interesting. It allows to see differences and similarities between interpretations according to which of the assumptions. Of the assumptions they reject and which ones they accept. So, of course, there's other differences that are not captured by the theorem, but this is kind of one way to classify interpretations and might allow to see sort of unexpected similarities, at least for the purpose of this thought experiment. So, as sort of a for the listener, I encourage you to think. I encourage you to think of which one you find the least plausible assumption. And if you're like me and you don't really fully commit to any interpretation of quantum mechanics, which assumption do you reject? Because then it sort of will show you that you're more aligned with a certain set of interpretations than another one. So personally, I like all of them, so I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure. Okay, so I'm done. Just some concluding remarks. So I think what the Wigner's friend thought experiment in general and this paper in particular shows that it's not so clear how to apply the quantum formalism in situations where we have observers in quantum superposition. So it's not a situation where we have the luxury to just We have the luxury to just shut up and calculate. We have to make interpretational commitments to even be able to decide what we're allowed to calculate. Okay, what I just said in the previous slide is that this theorem allows to classify interpretations of quantum mechanics in three families. And here's more like speculative kind of idea, but maybe this A sort of thought experiment shows that something about persistence of identity in quantum mechanics. And maybe the way to account for this weirdness that we see here is by saying that the friend at time T1 and the friend at time T2 are not actually the same agent. And then we can sort of use, so that the friend at time t1 from the point of view of the friend at time t. From the point of view of the friend of time T2 would be just another quantum system which has no definite values and vice versa. And then it's not so problematic that it would not be possible to assign joint probabilities to what they see. But of course, it's kind of problematic to see yourself in the past as a quantum system and not as yourself. So it's, I don't know, something to think about. So that's it. So thanks for your attention. So, thanks for your attention. Thanks, Philippe. Yeah, we can thank the speaker with kind of the clapping emoji. Okay, so we have a few minutes for questions. So, yeah, let's begin with Rob. I see you have your virtual hand raised. Yeah, hi. Thanks, Felipe. Quite an interesting talk. So, my understanding of this is that if we believe in the state update rule, everything Date update rule, everything is fine. Is that right? Well, isn't that P2? P2 says you don't use the state update rule, if I remember correctly. Is that right? Yes. Well, I don't know if everything is fine because I think most people would agree that for the point of view of Wigner, if he wants to compute probabilities for Wants to compute probabilities for his own measurement on the joint system, he should use unitary evolution. Right, so that the state update rule, right, unless it's false, then actually there's actual collapse, then it's fine, but it's fine in an experimentally different way from what From what unitary quantum mechanics predicts. And if it's a kind of subjective collapse, then I'm not personally a cubist. I think there's kind of weirdness of trying to reconcile different perspectives, but I think it's probably a consistent, logically consistent way to see what's going on. But I'm a bit like that, like the friend makes two measurements where, where, sorry, not the friend. Where uh sorry, not the friend, which is the friend, the inside or outside? I guess the inside, yeah. So the friend makes two measurements, but Wigner makes one. So isn't Wigner essentially making, isn't, isn't that effectively using the state update rule at the end? Um, so actually, like if the friend isn't allowed to use this, maybe I didn't explain this so well, but uh, so the friend. So well. So the friend performs a single measurement at time t or just before time t1, performs this z basis measurement. It's just that here at time t2, the friend is remembering the outcome that occurred at time t1, but we're admitting the possibility that she's remembering. She's remembering a different outcome than what actually occurred at time T1 because Wigner performed this kind of very invasive entangling measurement on the friend's brain, essentially. So that it's kind of not unreasonable that the friend would think maybe my memory is wrong. No, maybe actually the past happened differently than what I remember it. Remember it. So it's kind of F1 and F2 are both referred to the outcome of the same measurement. And there are memories of this past measurement, but the same memory at different times. Okay, but then I'm still like, is Wigner using the state update rule ever? I mean, it would seem to me the answer would be yes if the measurement is. The answer would be yes if the measurement is invasive, wouldn't it? How does Wigner make a measurement if the state update rule is not used? That's what's confusing me. Well, for measurements at a single time, there's this kind of purification principle in quantum information, right? That you can either That you can either use the, you can always kind of represent any POVM as a unitary followed by looking at and then a computational basis measurement. So that since Wigner only has, or we're not really caring so much about what Wigner is doing here, but since there's only one time, like the time T2, where Wigner sees some outcome. Wigner sees some outcome. Wigner could use either the sort of purified description that is here, this one, maybe see, or the so this is kind of a unitary description of Fignus measurement, but we could have also just used straight-up Born rule and gotten the same probability. And gotten the same probabilities. All right, well, I'll think about that more. It just seems to me that somewhere the state update rule is being snuck in, but maybe I'm not right about that. Okay, thank you. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're going slightly over time. So maybe the discussion, we can have it either in Gather Town or also after the next talk because I also have a few. The next talk because I also have a few questions that you can do explore. So, yeah, shall we take a 10-minute break then in Gather Town? Actually, slightly less now because we're going over time. Shall we meet back at quarter past in whatever time you're at? I don't know, Robin, Familia, that sounds good. Yeah, that sounds fine. Quarter after. Yeah, okay, great. So, yeah, I think the link's been shared in.
