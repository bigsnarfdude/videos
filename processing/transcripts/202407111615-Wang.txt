So for the uh okay, you're right. What? Okay, sorry, I'm having some. Okay. Okay, so for the setup of the twisted region conjecture in general, we have two quadratic extensions, E over F and K over F of number field, and a skewed Hermitian space V over E. And then we can consider this inclusion of their unitary groups. And then the twisted GDP conjecture considers restriction of representation from the bigger unitary group to the smaller one. And it is called like twisted GDP because when E equals F times F, it is the Fourier Jacobi case for GDP. And so we have to have UV included into UV times UV. For my talk, I'm just going to focus on the case when E equals K. So, in that case, we are having restrictions from GLNE to the unitary group. And so, now I will state the twisted GDP conjecture in this case. So, in order to state it, I need some notation. Like, okay, we let sigma be the generator of the Galaxy group and write F minus, or that I mean, that not okay to use later, but F minus, and those are purely imaginary elements. And this conjecture also involves a vague representation of the unitary group, which depends on. Group, which depends on choice of characters. That eta is the quadratic character associated to E or F. So then we take a cosmetal automorphic representation of GLNAE and we define this period integral by integrating, yeah, for element phi of pi and element var phi of the v representation. Of the V representation, we have this period integral. This theta is like theta series, it's basically an element of the Vay representation. And this period integral gives a map from pi restricted to the unitary group to the Vay representation. And the global twisted GDP conjecture states that period integral p is a non-zero element of this Holmes space if and only if following two conditions hold. A following two conditions hold. The first one is obviously necessary, is that the local version of the Pollen space are non-zero at all places V. And the second condition is that this central L value of this Rankin-Selberg L function is non-zero. Furthermore, if we have that this L value is non-zero, then there exists a unique Hermitian, a skewed Hermitian space of B of dimension N such that the pure interval is non-zero. Appear in most non-zero. Okay, so maybe the second part works here if I put the local conjecture here, although I don't have much to say about it. I don't quite know what is the status of either, but so the local T conjecture for the equals K case is that for any irreducible representation pi B of G L N E V, we have this multiplicity one or like this. Yeah, this home space has this dimension and most one. And if pi B is generic, And if pi v is generic, then the unique v such that this dimension is non-zero is given by this epsilon factor and this formula here. Okay, so I don't have much to say about it, but today I will talk about the relative trace formula approach to the global conjecture, and I will explain the proof of this theorem in the unramified case. So, the theorem that I can prove is that if V is the split U-current. That if V is the split unit formation space, and also these functions conditions hold, so we have assumed that the extension is unramified everywhere. We also need to assume that pi B and these characters are unramified for all inert places B of F. We also assume that the extension is split at all Archimedean and even places, and we also assume that pi is supercospital at two non-Archimedean split places of F. Arc median split plates of that. And under these assumptions, then I can prove that pure integral is not identically zero if and only if the central value of L function is not zero. And the proof is a trace formula. And the fourth condition is used to simplify the relative trace formula. It should be able to be removed. Not that I know how. Okay, so before I explain the proof, I have some remark, I guess. That I have some remark, I guess. So, first of all, there's also a refined version of the global conjecture, which I won't actually write here, but there is a refined conjecture in the style of the chain and the theta. And also, just to have it here to look at the L functions in the other cases, like in the other cases, we define the period interval in the same way. And in the Fourier-Jacobi case, the period interval is related to this Rankin-Selberg L function as well. And in the function as well and in the general case when e is not equal to k and is a field then is the conjecture to be related to this twisted asylum l function and uh so the vessel case of global gdp has been proven using the jalas relative trace formula and the 4h equivalent case is now also shown and the relative trace formula for that is developed by yifeng liu and hang xi and uh so i'm just going to talk about the relative trace formula in this case I'm just going to talk about the rest of the first one in this case, and it's very similar to the 4A Jacobi case because it's a twisted version of it. So I will focus on some new difficulties that there exist in this case, which is why I have this very strong assumption of my theorem, because I don't know how to resolve these difficulties. Like basically, I, yes, removing this unramified assumption is I don't know yet. Okay, so Okay, so yes, the proof of the conjecture is via comparing two relative trace formulas. So on the one side, but we call the general linear side. We have a relative trace formula, which is related to the L function. And then for this trace formula, we take the groups G prime equals G L N E times G L N E, and we let H1 be the diagonal embedding of G L N E, and H2 is the graph of Gala. And H2 is the graph of Galois conjugation. Then I have an assortment of formulas. So for F prime, a compactly supported smooth function on G prime, we have this kernel function, which we integrate. And we also have for V prime, an element of the space of source functions on A, E, and N, which subscript n, just we use it as a row vectors, we have this right translation representation. This right translation representation called R mu, which is kind of like, it's like the theta representation for the general language. It's basically right translation multiplied by this character. And then we also have a theta series for this defined by this formula. And integrating against this theta series is how we get the Rankine-Selberg integral. Yeah, so we define this distribution. We define this distribution for the test functions mentioned before. The distribution if prime v prime is given by integrating over h1 and h2 of this kernel function times the theta series. So on the unitary side, we have like an analogous, or it's like parallel story. So on this side, in order to study period scroll, we're just going to have a groups that we're considering. So G is the G L N E. So G is the GLNE and H is the unitary group. And also we take a realization of the V representation by taking a polarization of the of V viewed as a symplectic space by taking the trace of the skew formation form on V. And then the variance is realized on the space of source functions of L and the distribution we use on. Distribution we use on the unitary side is for a compactly supported smooth function f on g and two elements of the V representation. Well, it's like similar. J. The distribution j is defined by integrating over h times h, same current function except for the group g. And now we have a product of two theta series here. So the reason that we do this, like this proves ggp. This, like, this proves GGP, like this kind of thing is used to prove GDP because both I and J have a spectral expansion and geometric expansion. And on the spectral side, I is related to the L function and J is related to the period integral. So, like, and then we use geometric decompositions to relate I and J. And the spectral side from what I did. spectral side for what I did is pretty standard so I'm not going to talk about that today and I will focus on the geometric decompositions. So geometric decomposition needs to compare the two distributions and basically we want to make them like pick text functions make them equal. So the geometric decomposition is going to look like this for certain nice test functions f prime, v prime, f v1, v2. This condition of nice has several things but one of them is has several things but one of them is the f and f prime having regular semi-simple support but uh whatever so the geometric decompositions look like this so i is a sum over some x of this product of orbital integrals and similarly for j and i haven't not defined the space x or this space y or these orbital integrals yet i would do that and basically the comparison the trace formula involves uh trying to like first of all matching these orbit spaces Of all matching these orbit spaces, like these, and then picking the test function so that these orbital integrals are equal term by term. However, like normally, you would want these orbit spaces to be like the orbit spaces of some group action. The orbital integrals would not depend on like the choice of the orbit representative. But because there is this like wave representation involved in these. Involved in these relative choice formulas, it seems like some trouble was caused, and I have to pick some choice representatives of the orbits actually. So I will now define this X and Y. And before we do that, we pick a set S of the representative of the regular semi-sample orbits of this H1 times H2 action on G prime, which is the easy to see. Which is the easiest to see. That's the same thing as sigma conjugacy classes in G L and E. And so we'll now consider S as elements of G L and E. And similarly, on the unitary side, we pick a set of regular semi-simple orbits of H times H action on G, F. And for some reasons, we actually only take a subset of those, but I won't go into it. So this is something that is not so good because we have to pick representatives. And I just want to say in the Fourier Club case, there's also a V representation. Representation. So, like, this kind of thing also does happen, but in that case, in the relative trace formula, like we would have G being UV times UV and H being just UV. In that case, there's a natural section of the map G to G mod H. So there's kind of a natural way to pick these representatives, and the orbital integrals do simplify and look like actual orbital intervals that don't depend on a choice of representatives if you pick those properly. But in this case, we Properly, but in this case, we kind of seem to have to pick them arbitrarily. And then we can define the orbit spaces as follows. So we also need to impose some extra conditions, but this is possible. So we can choose the representatives S so that for all gamma, these stabilizers are contained in the GLNF. And then instead of having a group action, we consider like an equivalence relation on S times Fn times F minus N. Fn times f minus n by having the stabilizer act on the second part. The second part is the thing that exists because of the like the orientation factor. And then the orbit space is just going to be the regular semi-simple equivalence classes of this X. Regular semi-simple, I also just made that X, X, Y is regular semi-simple with respect to this action of the state liner. And the orbit space on the unitary side. Space on the unitary side it looks totally the same. I mean, it's totally analogous. We also have this condition, and now the elements of yv are going to be elements of r times v dual. We actually like identify v dual with en later. So this is what we do. This is how we do the decomposition on unitary side. Oh, anyway, so now these are the orbital intervals. Anyway, so now these are the orbital integrals. I don't have much to say. They're just like the orbital integral for gamma xy is an integral over the sigma conjugacy class, but then there's this extra factor. And similarly on the unitary side, we integrate over this uv times uv orbit, but there's also this extra factor and involving the V representation. And also both of them have a partial Fourier transform in there that makes things kind of bad. Kind of bad. This partial Bory transform also appears in the Fourier-Jacobi case and it has to be there because, like, the value representation is not geometric. So we need to do something. I didn't come up with this. Okay, so yeah, if you look at it, like the thing is, like, if you change gamma here by some other signal conjugate, this factor is not this good. This factor makes the overline core not change. Makes the orbital import not change in any good way. So it's a problem. But even though we have to take the representative, we can, with the orbit, matching is still not really a problem. Like we can just match the orbits, and it's not really a new thing, but there's a bijection between this case X and this disjoint union of these Y's over all isomorphism classes of street information spaces V and the mass. And the matching is defined by having gamma xy matches zeta z if and only if this element gamma gamma sigma xy and zeta star z z star are conjugate by an element GL and E, which like this is what I mean by conjugate. And the star is just a dual with respect to the skew formation 41B. And yes, so all I have to say now is like we'll talk about the fundamental lemma. So for the rest of the talk, we're in a local situation, so we're over F and V or some place V and I omit the V for the notation. And we have a notion of smooth transfer as usual, kind of, by saying that test function f prime, t prime on the general linear side is On the general linear side, is the smooth transfer of a collection of test functions on the unitary side if the orbital integrals of these test functions are equal for all matching orbits up to some transfer factor, which can be written down explicitly, but which I will not write that because it's not nice to look at. And then I don't like, so this notion of two functions matching actually depends on. Two functions matching actually depends on the choice of representatives, since the orbital integrals depend on choice of representatives. But and I do not know how to prove that we can all combine smooth transfer in general, but we can have some fundamental lemma. So I will explain this. This is almost done. It's very short taught. Anyway, so for the fundamental lemma, we're in the unrealized situation. For the quantum television, we're in an unramified situation, so we assume that u over f, psi, and mu are all unramified. I assume that v is, or is the split speed formation space to be, and we also denote by v plus, and we denote the other Hermitian space speed formation space by v minus. And then the fundamental analytic says that these are ramified test functions match as expected. So the overall integrals for the characteristic function are GLNOE times GLNOE. L and OE times GLNOE and characteristic function of OEN is equal to the orbital integrals of a characteristic function GLNOE and this characteristic function of L O F. So it's equal to these if gamma x line matches with something from the V plus and otherwise for the V minus test functions we just take zero. functions we just take zero uh yeah so since i said that this the orbital integrals i mean this moon's transfer depends on twice the representatives um we need to put some additional assumptions on the representatives and one thing that you can do in order to make your life easier is or in this case it can uh make this fundamental element true is if we uh pick gamma and theta to satisfy these two And theta to satisfy these two conditions. First condition is that if sigma conjugate of gamma is in GLNOE, then the G is actually an element of GLNF times GLNOE, and this completely analogous condition on the unitary side. And with these assumptions, the orbital integrals reduced to the same orbital integrals as in the GK-RALIS fundamental lemma. As in the GK-RALIS fundamental lemma, which is what comes up in the proof of the Bessel case of GGP. And that has been proved by a lot of people. So yeah, then we can have the formula. In this case, we pick these representatives. Basically, these representatives just make the v representation factor OOA intervals. And it can be shown that we can pick these representatives globally. Pick is represented globally to satisfy these two at all the inert places, and the smooth transfer at the split place can be made explicit. It's not hard. So we can obtain a global result of an unramified case. But yeah, I don't know how to prove students transfer general. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Okay, very fun. So, where did that condition that you wanted to be super custom, like two places come in? Oh, it didn't. So, one of them is used to simplify the spectral side. I didn't go into that. I think it can be removed. I don't know how. I mean, like, there's work to this note, but I think. So two places, I guess. And the other place is this awkward condition of regular semi-simple support. I think it can also be removed. I also don't have. So like I, am I, what I did, like, I assume that F, F prime and F have regular semi-simple support at one place in order to have this regular semi-simple thing. I mean, in order to have this decomposition, and then there's like some non-vanishing thing that we need later. That we need later. Yes, something to do with the local distributions that I didn't write anything down about, but I think it has to do with this regular semi-simple support, if I remember correctly. And if the regular semi-simple support of these test functions, that and it relates to their local support basically, I don't know this. Because I think if there are these local distributions like. is like I or I pi that I didn't define like there's a local distribution like I pi v f prime v prime v and it needs to be non-zero and I need to choose f prime to have regular semi-simples cover and making that non-zero and I also I didn't prove that either I think I just cited from somewhere so I don't probably I think it can be removed but I don't know about it So is there a geno key that I conjecture? Yes, there is. I didn't write it down, though. There is one. I will do that. I mean, I can prove a refined version of this theorem in the ramified case, but like, I can't prove I mean like the main problem right now is I can't prove smooth transfer. Can't bruce move transfer. So, yeah, the same like the brush-phase point goes into
