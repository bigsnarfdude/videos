The organizer for the kind invitation. I'm very happy to be virtually in Oaxaca. I've been there some years ago, and for whoever is there, I know it's quite a nice place, but still, it's good even to be virtually connected. Okay, so what I'm going to talk about today is a joint work with Peter. With Peter Burgesser, Paul Briding, and Leo Matis. And essentially, I want to try to convince you that there is a ring structure on the set of zenoids, and that this ring structure has a meaning from the point of view of probabilistic intersection theory, which in this audience I think means from the point of view of From the point of view of integral geometry. Okay, so I'll just maybe start with a few motivations. At least these were the motivations for my study. So, wait a second, it should be like this. Okay, so I'm gonna show you just a couple of slides of motivation just to clarify what do I mean by intersection theory and the probabilistic intersection theory. Okay, so, but if there is anything which is unclear, Here, please interrupt me. Okay. Wait, I did something. Okay. So first, let me start with this classical example. So I pick n equations in n variables, polynomial equations. And I think almost everyone in the audience knows that n equations, n variables, the number And variables, the number of solutions generically. So, if you choose the coefficients generically, it's the product of the degrees of the equation. Okay, so this is called Bezou theorem, which I like to formulate in a projective space. It's slightly better for our purposes. So, I formulate this way. So, I pick hyper surfaces Z1, Zn in complex projective space. They are of degree. They are of degree d1 dn, and for the generic choice of these upper surfaces, the number of points of intersections, it's the product of the degrees. So, what I want to stress about this identity, it is that it's formulated in a ring. So, it is actually formulated in the homology ring of the complex projective space. So, what one do, what one does is to take the Poincar√© dual of these hyper surfaces, work Work with their Prancer duals, transform intersection product with the cap product in comology, use some multilinearity, and deduce that this intersection number is the product of the degrees. It doesn't matter if you are not familiar with this, the only thing I want to stress is that this operation in this moment is multilinear. So the cap product operation in the Comology ring is multilinear. In the comology ring is multilinear, okay? As we are in a ring, we take the product of a bunch of elements. If we scale these elements, we can use the multilinearity of the ring. It's an algebra, actually. We are in an algebra. So, let me tell you what do I mean by probabilistic intersection theory. So, of course, this part of the whiteboard makes no sense over the real. So, there is no generic configuration of reality. Generic configuration of real hypersurfaces. But instead, you can ask for random hypersurfaces. So you can not choose the coefficients from a probability one open set, but put a probability distribution on the space of polynomials, which in this case, I put a star here because I want to choose a specific probability distribution. And now every polynomial that you pick gives you a random hypersurface, and you can now. A random hypersurface, and you can ask for the expected number of points of intersections. And this is a classical theorem by Mike Schuben, Steve-Meyler: that the expectation of the number of points of intersections, in this case over the reals, is the square root of the product of the decrease. For instance, if you pick just one polynomial in one variable, the expected number of real zeros of this polynomial is square root of t. Of course, I should clarify what I mean by. I should clarify what I mean by expected. So, what probability distribution I picked? There is a very natural one, which is called Bombieri-Weil, for which this holds. So, question which motivates the original study, so this construction of the zonoid algebra, at least for me, there is a missing thing here. Question is already so this randomness. So, this is somehow some is distinct, for example, from from uh From acting by general putting a probability measure on the rotation group, for example. Yeah, in this example, I agree, it's distinct, but in some sense, it's connected. So let me clarify. The randomness I pick here is specifically this. You pick, I made a little note here, okay? You pick a polynomial and you choose, you put Gaussian coefficients in front of the polynomial. In front of the polynomial of a polynomial of a basis, so of this monomial basis. And you built a polynomial in this way. So in this way, every instance, it's a different hypersurface. So the topology looks different, okay? What you're asking, if I understand correctly, is if instead I pick one hypersurface and I start putting it in a random position using the orthogonal group in RPN, that's what you're asking, right? Yes, yes. You're asking, right? Yes, yes. Would okay. So, in that case, the answer would be the product of the product of the volumes by internal, right? And in some sense, I mean, they're not the same thing. I agree. So, there is an extra randomness here. Of course, this model I'm considering. I didn't tell you, but it's true that it's invariant by orthogonal change of variables. That something makes this model special. Model special. So the two expectations, the one acting by orthogonal change of variables, and this one, they commute in some sense. So you can first take randomness in this way and then rotate with the orthogonal group and the answer stays the same. Sure. But I can clarify a little bit more this point later. And I will clarify this a little bit later. In this moment, the hyper surfaces themselves are random, not just their position in space in this statement. Space in this statement. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. And still, my question is: Is there a ring where this identity can be formulated? So in some sense, this is the basic of the origin of my problem. So above, in the complex case, there is a ring where this identity is formulated. In the real case, question: Is there such a ring? And I want to convince you that there is a ring. Ring and I want to convince you that there is a ring, it's a ring of zenoids. Okay, that's uh what it will uh we will uh arrive at the end of the seminar. Maybe I'll show you another example which is a little bit more related to Joe's question. So this is an example from previous work with Peter Burgesser. So pick four lines in projective space, and now I ask you how many lines intersect. Many lines intersect all these four lines. Okay, so if you pick just one line, there is infinitely many lines intersecting it. Two lines, there is still infinitely many lines. So just one point and one point, you can join all this way. If you take three lines, there is a one parameter family of lines. And if you take four lines, there is a zero dimensional family of lines. So that's why it makes sense to ask generically how many lines intersect these four lines. And over the complex numbers, the answer is two. The complex numbers, the answer is two. Okay, so generically, if you pick four lines in projective space, there are precisely two lines intersecting all of them. So once again, this is a homological identity, which is formulated in the cohology ring of the Crasmanian of lines. And this number, too, it is computed using what is called Schuber calculus, which is the way cycles intersect in the Intersect in the Grasmanian. In this specific example, the cycle that we are intersecting would be the cycle of lines hitting a line. Okay. There is a message from Joe, but no, no, no, no, sorry. It's a type. Okay. So now, let me ask a probabilistic question over the real. Of course, I mean, over the reals, there are configurations of these four lines where there are no solutions and configurations. Where there are no solutions and configurations where there are precisely two real solutions. But now I want to randomize the problem precisely as Joe was suggesting. So I start acting with the orthogonal group on these four lines that you see on the picture. And I ask, so four copies of the orthogonal group, one for each line. And I ask you, what is the expectation of the number of lines hitting these four lines? In other words, if you want to see this problem from the point of view of integral, Problem from the point of view of integral geometry. I have the Grassmannian of lines. I have the cycle of lines hitting a fixed line. I take four copies of this cycle and I randomize the position of this cycle in the Grassmannian using the orthonacle. What is the expectation of the number of lines? Well, the answer is the volume of a convex body. And this convex body, this is what we computed in this paper with Peter, it's a tensor product. It's a tensor product of bolts. It's a convex body in the tangent space of the Grasmanian. It's a special type of convex body. It's a zoonoid. I will go back to this in a second. And the way we proved that this expectation is the volume of a convex body, it is essentially exploiting some special feature of integral geometry in Grasmanians. I don't know, well, I guess many people. I don't know, but I guess many people in the audience are familiar with the fact that, like, kinematic geometry or integral geometry gives exact formulas in projective space or in the sphere, exact formulas in complex projective space for complex submanifolds. But in general, there are no exact formulas when you perform kinematic integrals. But in the case of you are performing kinematic integrals with Schubert varieties, it gives in the Gasmanian. In the Gasmanian, it gives exact formulas. And these formulas can be phrased using convex geometry. That's the content of this line. And this expectation is the volume of a body. So what is the remark out of this slide? So, this was my starting point again: that this operation volume is multilinear. Okay, it is actually the polarization of mixed volume. Mixed volume. Again, is this identity that I wrote here formulated in some ring? So let me stress that this cannot be a comology ring precisely for the reason that the only way you can make these computations comological, at least in the Grasmanian, for instance, is working module two. So there is no generic number of solutions to this problem. Okay, so it's not a cohological computation. If it was a comologue, Computation. If it was a combinological computation, it would give the answer zero. Okay. So if it works, it should be another type of thing. But still, it's a ring, if it exists, where these probabilistic computations make sense. Okay, so maybe a quick tour in COVID's geometry, very fast, because I think that everyone knows what I'm talking about, just to fix the notation. So for me, So, for me, K of B of V is the set of convex bodies in a vector space. I freely denote Minkowski addition with this plus and scaling by multiple, just denoting lambda times a convex body. The space of convex bodies, once you fix a ball, once you fix a scalar product, it's a matrix space with the absolute distance. So, you take the distance between two convex bodies to be the infim over the epsilon. To be the infimum over the epsilon, such that the first is contained in an epsilon neighborhood of the second, and the second is contained in an epsilon neighborhood of the first. So in this distance, the set of convex bodies is a complete matrix space. It is isometric to a cone inside the space of continuous functions in the sphere. Okay, so what are zonoids then? So let me tell you first what is a zonotope. So a zonotope. What is a zonotope? So, a zonotope is just a Minkowski sum of segments. Okay, it's a very special type of convex body. I take a bunch of segments and I take the Minkowski sum. Like, for instance, in this example, I took orange plus red, plus what is it, green plus purple, and it produces this polytope, which is a zoomote. So, zoonotopes, they are not a closed subset of Subset of this matrix space convex bodies with the also of distance. Maybe the simplest example is the ball, which is the limit of sum of segments, but it's not itself a sum of segments. So just imagine you pick on the unit circle, the roots of the unity. You take the sum of all the segments with center at the origin and the tip one of the root of the unity, do one over n and send n to infinity. What you And send n to infinity, what you would get is the ball, okay? It's the two ball in this case, and all balls in Rn, all Euclidean balls, are sum of segments. Sorry, limit of sum of segments. What are zonoids? Zonoids are the closure of the set of zoonotopes. Okay, so a zonoid is a limit of Minkowski sum of segment. Just a piece of notation, I denote by Z. I denote by Z of V the set of zenoids in V. Actually, for practical purposes, now that I realize it, I prefer to take centered zenoid. Okay, so because I'm taking sum of segments and every segment is centrally symmetric, if you take the sum of the centers of these segments, that's a point, and this point is a center of symmetry. And this point is a center of symmetry for your zonotope. So zonoids, which are limits, have a center of symmetry. I just assume, I translate, and I make the center to be the origin. Just a matter of convention, just for practical purposes for this seminar. So zonoids, of course, don't need to be centered, but for me, they are centered at this moment. Maybe let me just tell you in case. In case that's the first time you've seen zonoids, which I don't think is the case for most of you, why are these convex bodies interesting? So, there is a problem which is called the zonoid problem, which I find quite fascinating. So, the problem is very simple. I give you a convex body, and you have to decide whether it is a zonoid. So, in two dimensions, it's quite a simple problem because it is a zonoid if and only if it is a central. If and only if it is a centrally symmetric, and that's easy to see. But in higher dimension, it is more complicated. And just to give a flavor of how complicated it is, here is a characterization of zonoids in higher dimension. Take your convex body K and consider the norm induced by K on the space where Rn leads. So let's assume that K is full. So let's assume that K is full-dimensional. Then K is a zonoid if and only if Rn with this norm is isometric to a subspace of L1. So that's a quite functional and analytic characterization of zonoids. It's not easy in general to decide again if a body is a zonoid, even if the body is as simple as you think. Is as simple as you think. So, for instance, if it is semi-algebraic, I do not know of an algorithm that, given a semi-algebraic convex body, meaning that the support function is semi-algebraic, decides whether the convex body is a senoid. Maybe I'll just make a comment about this problem, just a side comment, because I've heard in Joe's seminar talking about definable geometry that Geometry that what I just said, that I don't know an algorithm, it's true only, I mean, it's false, but only by a little, because what I can say, this is a parallel work with Leo Matisse, my student, is that if I give you a semi-algebraic convex body, I can actually, so I mean, let me phrase it this way, if I give you a family, a semi-algebraic family of convex body. Semi-algebraic family of convex bodies, semi-algebraic family of convex bodies, the set of zonoids in this family, it is definable in R and Exp. So it is definable in globally superanalytic and the graph of the exponential function. So it's definable in some minimal expansion of the semi-algebraic sets. So it's we don't get an algorithm to decide whether a semi-algebraic body is a zenoid just by a little. Okay, so if we were allowed, if we were. All okay, so if we were allowed, if we were able to perform integration of analytic functions, we would get such an algorithm. Okay, so this is just all I wanted to say on zonoids. And now I want to go back to this construction of the ring structure that I promised by insisting a little bit on this term that appeared a couple of times in the previous. A couple of times in the previous motivating slides, so multilinearity. So, the main observation is the following theorem. So, first, let me fix annotation. So, if you pick a vector in V, in your vector space, I denote in this way the segment. So, maybe I'll make a picture that's more visual. So, you have a vector B, okay, and I denote. And I denote by V under a line, the segment, so the zonoid, which is this, okay? So it is one half minus V V. So it is a zonoid, which is on the same line, the segment on the same line as V, centered of length, the length of V. So in some sense, inside your set of zonoids in V, there is a Zoids in V, there is a copy of your vector space. So pick an element V and construct this segment one alpha minus V V. Okay, by the way, notice that I could have as well constructed just a segment with tail at zero and tip at V. It's just not centrally symmetric, and I wanted just it to be centrally symmetric. Okay, so there is a copy of your vector space inside your set of zonoids. Okay. Set of zonoids. Okay. Now let me state the theorem, which is the basic of everything. So it's interesting, this alternative can have been observed already. So I give you a multilinear map between a bunch of vector spaces. Okay, so V1, up to Vk, and W. It's a multilinear map. I call it mu. And the result is that this multilinear map extends, in a sense that I will clarify. In a sense that I will clarify in a second, to a unique Minkowski multilinear and continuous map between the corresponding spaces of zenoids. And this map extends in such a way that if you evaluate this mu tilde on the zenoids which are corresponding. The zenoids which are corresponding to segments is the same as first evaluating mu and then taking the segment. Okay, so I don't know if this is clear. So I have a map, multinear map between vector spaces, and I claim that it extends to unique Minkowski multilinear map and C0 map, mu tilde from the set of zonoids between these spaces. And this is an extension in the sense that In the sense that if you evaluate this map on segments, it is the same as evaluating on the vector and then taking the segment. Okay. So maybe a couple of remarks about this multilinear extension. Well, one remark is that it is built using the notion of tensor product of zenoids, which is something quite subtle. Something quite subtle. So it's not clear how to define in general tensor product of convex bodies in such a way that nice properties are verified and that you get a convex body. But it is possible to define a tensor product of zonoids, which is still a zonoid, of course, and which satisfies very interesting properties, for instance, monotonicity, Minkowski mutilinearity, etc. Multilinearity, etc. Maybe an example of this map. So, as I said, multilinear map between vector spaces produces a map between zenoids. Simplest example is mixed volume. So, if you take as a map here the terminant, so you have the values r. So, if you take as a map, you take rn times times rn math with variance in the reals. Map with various in the reals, and you take the terminal, the terminant, it's a multilinear map. The Minkowski multilinear extension to zonoids is the mixed volume. Maybe one comment, of course, the target would be zonoids in R, which I simply identified with their length. So this identity is after taking length. So on the target, I get a segment, I take its length. Segment, I take its length, it is the mixed volume of the original stuff. So the mixed volume, it is the Minkowski-multi-n extension of two zomoids of the terminal. Maybe another example, this example should not be here, I apologize. Let me carry it away. Okay, another example: if you do the same thing, not with the termium, but with complex determinant, you obtain. You obtain another map which we call the mixed J volume, which has a nice property that can be extended also to polytopes. I have a remark here that I can make later if someone asks me about this. Another remark about this multi-on extension is that it gives a connection to the theory of. Gives a connection to the theory of random determinants. More precisely, and I'll just say one sentence: if you take a big matrix, square matrix with blocks which are independent random variables, so each block it is by itself, the the the block, the the the entries of the block are dependent, but uh block by block you are uh independent. You are independent. So, to each such block, you can associate azonoid. And also, these remarks should go later. I apologize. I don't know why I put them here. I apologize. So, let me, it should be just one page later because otherwise it's not clear what I'm doing. Sorry, I need to define first the ring structure. I apologize. So, here is now the construction of the Here is now the construction of this ring on the set of zonoids. So, first I take center zonoids in B and I want to turn this somehow into a ring. The first thing I need to do is to turn into a group. So it's not a group by itself under Minkowski addition, but you can just take formal differences. In fact, zonoids as convex bodies are cone. Convex bodies are a cone in a linear space, so you can take formal differences of this element, and I denote the formal differences with this hat. But if you don't want, you can just think that we are working with zenoids and we get a ring, so sort of like a semi-group with a multiplication. Then I take this sort of exterior algebra, so I take the direct sum of zonoids in the exterior algebra. Of zonoids in the exterior algebra, formal differences of zonoids in the exterior algebra. And now observe that before taking the exterior algebra, I have the wedge product. The wedge product, it is a multilinear map. Take the unique continuous Minkowski multilinear map extension using this theorem, the multilinearity theorem, you get an operation on this set. And this operation turns this set into a ring, into a ring where the product is defined in this way. So if you take two zonoids, one in the A1 exterior algebra and one in the A2 exterior algebra, their product, it is in the A1 plus A2 exterior algebra. It's a graded algebra. The only thing which is not clear is that it is commutative. Sounds a bit strange. Sounds a bit strange to see a wedge which is commutative, but it is. So we decided to give the privilege to the fact that this operation comes from multilinearity extension of wedge instead of stressing on the fact that the wedge on vector spaces is skew symmetric. This one is commutative. Can I ask a question? Yes. Could you think of formal differences of zonoids as something? Differences of zonoids as something like unions of oriented zonoids. Well, I mean, uh, orient. What do you mean by oriented? Yeah, I was thinking differences, like, would be, you think it would be like almost like endowing it with an orientation. Subtracting would be the opposite orientation, then the we could think about that. I've never thought about this in this way. Uh, we just need to double-check a couple of things, but uh, for Things but formally, if a zonoid plus minus its zonoid gives a zero, so that should be the thing to verify. But I think the best way to think about formal differences of zonoids, it is take zonoids, which are convex bodies. Consider the support function of a zonoid, which is a function of the sphere, right? Just take differences of these functions. Take differences of these functions. So it's a perfectly defined function on the sphere. It is a function defined as a difference of two support functions of zonoids. That's the best way. It's a vector space in this way. It's a very infinite dimensional vector space. I think for me, that's the best way. The good thing is that if you don't want to think about this, I mean, formally, you can use the Groton deconstruction, which always produces a group, except Except that in general, you just have to be careful that cancellation law holds in order to embed your semi-group into the group. In this case, it holds because cancellation law holds on at the level of convex bodies. So, this step. Antonio, briefly, so there's a couple of questions in the chat. Do you want to address those or perhaps later? No, not generalizing. So, general is anoids would be convex bodies, which are the Which are differences of zonoids. Here I'm considering formal differences of zonoids. So this might not be a convex body. Okay, so I mean, a generalized zonoid, I agree, it is a convex body whose support function would be a difference of support function of the noids. That would be a convex body. I'm considering what we call virtual convex bodies. So, really, Bodies, so really just formal differences of support functions. I don't know, Daniel, does this answer your question? Um, it answers the question in the sense that I know now that it's not a terminal, so I know it, but I don't understand what it actually is. Yeah, that's uh I agree. So, I have to be honest with you, I don't understand it either. It's a very strange set these. There. It's a very strange set, this set of virtual zonoids. And that's why I said at some point I wanted to build a ring, so I wanted also to have differences. But because in the end, we're just going to take product of zonoids with themselves, you can think of really not even generalized zonoids, just think about zonoids. That's okay. It's no problem. As soon as you don't blame on me that this is not a group, but. That this is not a group, but if you are okay with just staying with the semi-group, I'm fine. If you want to have this group structure, you have to pass to these virtual zonoids. But if you think of general sonic as difference of support functions, then this is a group, isn't it? Of course, yes. It's a cone. It's a semi-group, sorry. It's a semi-group. It's a semi-group. Semi-group, it's a semi-group, it's not a group, it's a semi-group. Because if you take the negative of this, it doesn't have to be if you take difference of support functions of the noise, the difference. Negative of this is not a support function. It's just a same, okay? It's a cone. You just want to have also the opposite, okay, the formal opposite. I think, like, in the language of convex geometry, I totally see why this has not been involved. Why this has not been investigated because it's enough to use cancellation law for inside the cone of convex sets. If you want to be able to add and take differences without being bothered that is this a convex set, just pass to the formal differences. But again, I think if you think about support functions, okay. Functions, okay. The set of support, so convex bodies embeds into continuous functions on the sphere through their support functions. Now, the support functions are a cone inside the continuous function on the sphere. Just take this Z at of V, whatever it is, it is the linear span of the cone of support functions of zonoids. Okay, I'm not sure it's still relevant, but one. I am not sure it's still relevant, but Juan Carlos is asking if you mean considering as currents. Can it be thought of as currents? Current, considering what as current? Sorry, I apologize, Juan Carlos. Can you ask again your question? Or maybe post it in the chat? Yeah. Perhaps in the interest of time, we can pick this up at the end. I'll keep going and yeah, okay. I'll keep going and yeah. Okay. Couple of remarks. So, first of all, virtual zonoids on the real line are just the real line itself, because all centered segments are just a multiple of a given segment, that then you are also considering the negative of a centered segment. So, it should not be surprised that these virtual zonoids in R is just R itself. In particular, this is an observation that I want to stress, which is important for us. If I pick zonoids Ki in the Ci exterior algebra, with the properties that the sum of the Ci's is N, so sort of a codimension condition, their product, it is a real number. So after taking this identification, the product of in our ring of zonoids. In our ring of zonoids, one from each element with the sum of this grading adding up to n, the dimension of the space, the product is just a real number. And moreover, if each zonoid is itself a zonoid in Rn, and I take n many of them, the product, it's a real number, which real number? The mixed volume between them. Now, let me see if that comment applies. There's a This applies now. So the intrinsic volume of a zonoid is one vertical factorial, the first intrinsic volume of its product with itself d times. Okay, so this is an element in this, it is a zonoid in the exterior algebra and its first intrinsic volume, it is the deed intrinsic volume of K. Intrinsic volume of K. There was another comment which I'll skip about expected determinant. Okay, I'll just leave it if someone asks it and I'll keep going. Okay, so with this terminology, now I can state sort of a meta-theorem, okay, which is the following. So just to give an interpretation of these ring structure at the level of intersection theory, as Joe was Theory, as Joe was asking at the beginning. So pick a compact homogeneous space M and call V the tangent space at E your favorite point in M. Now claim if you pick a nice, which I should clarify what it means, subset of M of codimension C, I can associate to this subset a zone. Associate to this subset a zonoid in the C exterior algebra of V. So, first part of the theorem, it is this: there is a way to produce from to attach to a sub-manif, a nice, whatever it means, sub-manifolds of M of a codimension C, a zonoid in the C exterior algebra of the tangent space at one point. Now, what is this correspondence? Correspondence good for it is good in the sense that if I give you a bunch of sub-manifolds with the co-dimensions that add up to the dimension of M, the expectation of the number of intersections is the product of these zonoids. Where of course now, when I write expectation of the number of intersections, I mean averaging over the group action, as Joe was asking in the beginning. So I have the sub-manifolds and And I just put them in a random position using the group, if you want. So, an operation on the left, which is just some sort of integral, it is a ring. It is an operation which is a computation in this ring. This is what I wanted to suggest from the beginning. So, your left-hand side is like one of these classical kinematic integrals. It is a kinematic integral. I agree. It is a kinematic. Integral. I agree. It is a kinematic. Yes. I don't know if it is classical in the sense that there are multiple copies, but yes, it is multiple kinematic integrals. Yes, it is a multiple kinematic integral. So maybe let me go back to that example. So we can be a little bit more flexible in this association in the sense that the sum manifold itself can have a little bit of randomness in it. Of randomness, Mita. I don't want to enter into details, I just hope that I can convey the ideas, but I'm very happy to answer questions later. So just to close with the original example that I proposed, so this sort of like probabilistic Bazoo theorem. Here is how the proof works. You pick as M R P N as Z randomized per surface of degree D, and the convex body that you associate. The convex body that you associate, the zonoid that you associate through this procedure here, which I didn't discuss, but it's not a God-given, it is a specific procedure. It is d to the one-half times the ball, the unit ball. Okay, so now let's apply our, let's compute in this ring, this probabilistic intersection ring, expectation of the number of points of intersections. It is just the product of these zonoids. Uh, zonoids, we use the ring structure, so multilinearity. Each of these d31 goes out as a factor, and then the product of balls, it's another computation, a side computation, it is one. And so, this expectation is the just square root of the product of the degrees. Another example: so, just to connect with the other example I put on the lines on. Put on the lines on Grasmanian of lines. In general, if the homogeneous space is the Grasmanian of K-planes in Rn, so a real Grasmanian, we have inside this Grasmanian the so-called super varieties, which are subsets of the Grasmanian, which are correspond to k-planes, which have some position properties with respect to a given flag. Properties with respect to a given flag. Let's put it this way. So they are labeled by Young diagrams and they generate the comology, the Z2 homology of the Grassmannian over the complex number. They generate a complex homology. But in this case, we treat them just as sub-manifolds. And what we called in that slide probabilistic Schuber calculus, it's just computation in this ring. So the ring. Computation in this ring, so the ring generated by the zonoid associated to these sugar varieties. So, and then in this sense, the expectation of number of line eating four lines, it is just the product of these four copies of the that super variety, which is just the volume of this convex button. I just have two minutes remaining, I guess. So, what I have actually, I think you have seven minutes remaining. I think you have seven minutes remaining. That's okay. How many minutes? Sorry, seven. Seven. Ah, okay. So I was rushing. Okay, I'll take it more relaxed. Maybe I'll answer questions then. I'll still go to the conclusions. So conclusions. What I wanted to say is this. So now, just to sum up, it is possible to put this ring structure on the set of zonoids. And this ring structure And this ring structure somehow gives it what allows to perform this computation in probabilistic intersection theory, which are not homological computations. However, when you pass over the complex numbers, so if you view complex geometry just as a special case of real geometry, so where complex sub-manifolds are real sub-manifolds of double codimension, let's say, you can still construct this theory. You can still construct this theory. So, there is a, I mean, it's, we don't see that something is complex or real in this theory. And in particular, that's one point one is more a comment, okay, which should sort of like be, at least for me, it's an inspiring idea, that this gives a connection between convex geometry and representation theory. Because now, if you try to do this example. Try to do this example too. Over the complex numbers, computations in the ring generated by Super varieties is a homological computation. And because it's a cohomological computation, which by the way, it is precisely given by Schubert calculus, as to say, intersection numbers are defined generically. So, and there is a Generically. So, and there is a well-developed theory, which, by the way, is connected to representation theory. And on the other end, these formulas, the identity, representation theory, so identity in the homology ring of the complex transmanion, through this construction here, the complex version, of course, correspond to identities in complex geometry. So, one question for me, which is very interesting, is For me, which is very interesting, is whether one can exploit this dictionary. So, maybe pass, for instance, give a convex geometry proof of Pierre rule. That would be quite interesting for me. Another comment that I want to make, it is that at least formally, a similar theory can be done over non-Archimedean fields. So, there is a previous work that I've done with. Work that I've done with Avinash Kulkarni, so Piadic Integral Geometry, where we essentially build the kinematic formulas over periodic manifolds. In fact, in the previous work, just over periodic projective space and periodic spheres. But this can be generalized much, much more just to give the Much, much more, just to give the complete analog with classical integral geometry, also in periodic homogeneous spaces. This is an upcoming work almost done. So, essentially, in periodic spaces, we have the notion of, let's say, we have a measure, okay? We have Ausdorff measure, we have a group acting, so we can ask the same questions and just Just to make it short, we get the same answer. So we get kinematic formulas which can be expressed in terms of matrix properties of the sets we are intersecting. There is no curvature in the piadic spaces. That's something quite interesting. But okay, so that's another story. Okay, I guess I'll stop here. Maybe if there are questions, I'll be happy to answer them all. Thanks for watching for a great talk. We can put a Talk if we can put a I'm going to put my virtual hand up there and uh other questions. Uh, I have a question. Uh, so uh, regarding comment number one, so um, that sounds a lot like, for instance, uh, the uh Tacier Kushner and Kovanski. I agree, or that does it's uh the I don't know who's asking the question. Uh, Dimitri, is that you? Yeah, yeah, I think. Is that you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I agree. It sounds like, but it's not. So let me answer this question in maybe it's quite interesting because the Bernstein-Kovansky-Kushnirenko, it is a theorem which connects and inspires this question because Bernstein-Kovansky-Kushnirenko says essentially that you can compute the homology ring of a toric variety using Using convex geometry. There is one subtlety, however, that the convex body that you associate to an hypersurface in a toric variety, it is of the same dimension as a same, it has a real dimension n. Instead, with this construction that I'm proposing, when you see a complex sub-manifold as a real sub-manifold, it has a real co-dimensional. Sub-manifold, it has a real co-dimension too. So the convex body that I get is not a polytope, and it is living in the second exterior algebra. So the convex body. Is it the Minkowski sum of polydiscs, the objector Tavio? No, I don't think it's Minkowski sum of polydiscs. At least I cannot prove it, but I think it's more complicated. And but so it's more complicated on the other end. So in this sense, it's more complicated, absolutely more complicated because big. Absolutely more complicated because BKK theorem is a theorem on polytopes, so it's very, very easy theorem. I mean, I'm in a conference, I'm chairing, but the advantage of this construction over the BKK construction is that this works for any co-dimension. So, if you look at this Bernstein-Komanski-Kushnerenko theorem, if you have a sub-manifold which is not a complete intersection, you don't Not a complete intersection, you don't know what convex body to associate to it. There is no, so you can only do it, you can only associate a polytope to a toric divisor. And in this case, you can associate a convex body to whatever submanifold. So that's it's not whatever, of course, it should be nice in some sense, but it is quite interesting because it also works with the higher co-dimensions. Maybe this answer is vague, I understand. I understand. I hope this is. We can discuss more if you want later. Thank you. Also, everyone, just unmute yourselves and ask questions. Sorry? Sorry, may I have a question? Yes. So does this construction generalize to LP zonites? Like if you consider LP addition instead of Minkowski? I mean, does this first theorem hold in this more general setting? I think these. Think these questions should be asked to Leo if he's in the audience, maybe knows about this. Leo, do you have a feeling whether this extends to LPs or not? So what exactly should extend? The short answer is I don't think so. But I didn't exactly understood what you were referring to, Jan. They mean costumulty and extension, I guess. Ah. No, I don't think so. no i don't think so because the lp sum is not multilinear yeah it's more it's more it's more product i agree yes that's the that's the short question yes further questions so is there a question yeah yeah yeah sorry so so i would like to ask uh so maybe i have just missed it but is it possible to understand in some simple Possible to understand in some simple example how so this map that you build how you associate to a sub-manifold of a homogeneous space some some some zonoid yes absolutely it's in fact uh it is uh quite uh interesting so essentially uh the first maybe let me just give the idea okay just the idea so uh what is So, what is a zonoid? You should think a zonoid of, I think that's one way of seeing it, as a probability measure on the sphere. Are you maybe at least vaguely familiar with this idea or not? So, the zonoids are convex bodies whose support functions are Of the form, say u tack times a measure on the sphere. That's a for the function of a zonoid. Okay. So where so in this way, there is a you can think of a zonoid as a probability measure, a positive measure on the sphere, not necessarily probability measure, positive measure of the sphere. So the idea is now to take, so you have your Take, so you have your sub-manifold, okay? You essentially take, let me do the case of a co-dimension one, okay. You co-dimension one sub-manifold, you take you have all these normals to the sub-manifold, okay, and using these normals, you build, as the normals vary along the sub-manifold, you build essentially a random back, you translate everything back to the origin. Translate everything back to the origin to your fixed point, which is maybe this one. Okay. And what you get is a sort of a random. So it's a measure. It's a map from the manifold, if you want, to the unit sphere in this sense. It's the Gauss map, you mean? It's, I agree. In this case, it's a Gauss map. In this specific example, it is a Gauss map. Yes, it is like a Gauss map. So in this way, you get sort of a random, now we are at this point of a random vector in the sphere. Okay? Like this Gauss map, essentially, as you were mentioning. It's not exactly, I mean, it is a Gauss map with respect to a fixed point in your homogeneous space. A fixed point in your homogeneous space, but yes, I mean, I don't want to object. And then, once you have this random vector, essentially I define the support function of your zonoids in this way of I call it Z at the point U by just the expectation scalar product between U and this random vector. So, this is the construction that you built out of the out of the manifold. I agree, it's not very visual in this sense. It needs some thinking, of course. In some sense, it's kind of you take all the normals, you brought at the origin, and you take a sort of a convex Al of this. It's not exactly a convex Al, okay, but sort of like this. So, if you are familiar with the theory of random. So, if you are familiar with the theory of random convex sets, it's precisely what you're doing. You take the normals, you view them as a random subset of your specified point, and you take this random vector. And the expectation of this random subset, expectation of a random segment is a zonoid. I'm sorry that the terminology I'm putting now on the... I'm putting now on the table, it's a bit advanced. Again, I'm happy to answer more questions, but if I need to, I need a little bit more time to say more details. Great. All right. Anyway, let's take a break here. Thanks very much again for this very, very interesting talk. And we'll meet again in five minutes with Juan Carlos.
