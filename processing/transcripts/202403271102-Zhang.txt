From different uh area. Um so uh this is this work with our rubber mechanism ranking. Um So first I will introduce the problem, monogamous problem, and I will provide a result of strong dual quality. And I will introduce the regularity of problem solution. And then we will apply the strong duality to the rotation lengths 2D model. We first verify their solution and we provide a new characterization as a free boundary model. So, yeah, so. Yeah, so this is one part of the principal agent problem in non-ninear pricing: that we have bi-level optimization. So, for instance, if you have a monarchist who likes to sell cars to consumers who has M attributions, and each agent would like to buy one car to maximize their utility, um so the two so y so the so the cars uh living Rn and uh in general M not equal to N. In general, and not equally, and they also consider the price. So, once the price is published, so each agent will choose their favorite product to buy, which depends on P. And after the product being chosen, then monopolists can calculate the function of pi, the total profit, which is a function depending on price. So, let's fix notation. So, assume X be the space of consumers and Y be the space of And why did the space of the products? So, or sometimes I call this a space of types and this is space of choice. So, we now assume some topological assumptions for x and y. So, x is a proper complex set with non-empty interior, and f is the proper density of both the agents. So, here we assume it's found below by a positive positive uniform measure of the. Uniform measure on X. And monopolists produce products and give a price. So for a buyer X purchase product Y and price C, we assume that it received a direct utility inner product XY subtract. It could be much more complicated in a sense like this is called biding here. So it could be an arbitrary function of XYZ. The arbitrary function of x, y then subtract the price, which is a positive linear end, could be even more fully money in your case. But today we only constrain, so we will only talk about this. And the profit from monopoly selling product Y at price that, we use a simple form of the price subtract cost, manufacturing cost, which depends only on the product. So here we assume that the cost max 0 to 0. Cost max 0 to 0 and it's non-active in C1 and 3K connect. So I'm also running a little by some hydrogen function. The most important constraint here is we assume an outside option, which means, so for instance, if monopolies are selling cars, each agent is able to choose not to buy any car and just walk. So he pays at the price zero. So besides this product, all the product can be, the price can be determined by the monopoly, except this. So this product, the price always zero. So the monopolist problem would like to choose the best P to maximize the profit, which is the summation over each little profit sell to consumer X. Where the YPX is the optimal choice for each type. Optimal choice for each type X, which try to solve this problem. We can see that if we call the maximum indirect utility, which is a function x, then it is a barometer dual for the price P. We have two constraints. First constraint is to ensure the maximum 10, and also P0 equals 0 is the non-participation constraint. Constraint. And if consumer X chooses outside option Y0 and pay the price zero, then they got utility zero. So unless it has higher utility, then it won't participate in the game. Okay. And so assume U, which is indirect utility, is differentiable. And then from the envelope theorem, we know that YP could be written as DU. So we can change the original problem to a function of indirect utilities, which is in this form. And where now it is no longer be bilateral organizations that u satisfies some constraint, which is non-active, convex, and the du under the image du maps x to the subset of y. Because of the title of the book. Because it's the title of the workshop, optimal transport. So I try to reformulate it in the flavor of optimal transport. Suppose we take a special case where C equals a quadratic function, and the capital C is just the half of the second loop of X. Then we know that because of the F dx is continuous with respect to the back matter, we can always have resistance of this optimum transport map from F dx. Transform map from F dx to nu, and we call this the set of optimum transform map by T. And we call the T2y as the probability matters of finite second one. Then the West and two distance could be represented in this form. We can expand the norm and we have factorized C. And then we can write our maximization. We can write our maximization problem as the minimization problem, where the first mean is the probability matter on the space of products. And suppose we know that the distribution of products will be chosen by consumer, all the consumers. And then we fix new, and then there is an optimal transport from FDX to new. And we're choosing the Vibrinia theorem and maybe. By Brinier theorem, and maybe there's people questioning the name, that there exists a convex function whose derivative is an optimum map. And we minimize among all such mu, which mu is called non-active, and minimize on this problem. So if you zoom up, so we are here on a non-linear price model. So it's a special case for principles. So it's a special case for transformation problem, which has so many applications, such as taxation policy, contract theory, and labor market signaling. So people in economic field would like to know a phenomenon called screening because most of us are flying to Calgary using Appa Air. So lots of us have been used by tickets from Airlines. A ticket for an airline. So, one trick for airlines to ask consumers who are richer to pay higher tickets is they will squeeze the legroom from the economic plant so that people who are more sensitive or less sensitive to the price will purchase a higher ticket in a better seat or in business class or first class. So, by doing this, squeezing the ledge room, or equivalently, by providing So, or equivalently by providing different kind of products to consumers that they can charge consumers on the choice on consumers if you choose a premium seat, then you pay higher price. So, it's also called productive differentiation. One question is: can the airline sell tickets to people just and charge them according to their salary? At that point. Sorry, in the example here, you have to specify the density too, right? Is it uniform or? Yes, sorry. Uniform density and the cost is quadratic. Thanks. And a particular example is 1D solution is that the screening is failed. So we are looking at a uniform measure on the space 0 to 1 that 0 to 1, that consumer of type from 0 to 1/2 will choose the outside option and receive whether it's 2 to 0. So that you cannot distinguish people who are not choosing the product from the ticket, right? So, so, and, but for everyone who is from one half to one, they can distinguish people. And all of them are choosing different products they will charge. Because if you choose this product, I can price this product higher or lower. This product higher or lower. So they can so for everyone from this interval, so they will have to pay differently. So this is a 1D solution. So for the multi-tool one dimension, so people consider, say, the type space is one dimensional, or the choice space is one dimension. The first multi-dimensional case, I call multi-dimensional case, like both of them. Like both of them have higher dimensions, is considered by, say, Armstrong that he says strict convexity of X, the domain X, implies there exists a positive portion of the summary type. So we will always choose the outside option, so we call it a non-prespatial region. And later, Joshine said they find a matter such that this non-prespatial region has matter one. So we cannot. So we cannot do screening of those people. But the question is: besides this non-distribution consumers, whether monopolists can perform a complete screening like this in multi-dimensional case. So the first result we present today is the the strong quality result. So recall that the monopoly problem can be written as the functional algorithm, the space of indirect utilities. Space of indirect utilities. So we first show that the maximization problem equals to the minimization problem where the C star is around the dual of C, the cost, and Sx sitting in this set, which is the intersection of all these sets satisfying this inequality. A benefit of having this, there are at least two benefits. One is we can write down the automatic condition comes from the computer. Comes from the complementary slackness. That assume U bar and S bar maximize and minimize this minimization problem, multipleization problem. Then the two value equal if and only if the second condition is one equality condition and the first condition is many equality conditions because f almost everywhere. You have this equality. And we can also see that the strong quality implies optimizer is unique. implies optimizer being unique. So since optimizer being unique, we can talk about this, like how smooth it is. The first smooth pasting theorem I found from the proof is by Kalier and LaShawn Lebette in 2001 that they said the optimal solution is differentiable and its derivative is continuous up to the boundary. In the economic meaning that says if you have a consumer X and you know its choice, then every consumer Know its choice, then every consumer in the neighborhood of X will choose a similar product. This result being improved by Caffarat and Leonz, that they said in the interior of X, that U-bar is not only differentiable, but its derivative is Lipschitz. And this is sharp, because we can have a counter-example that we just show explicitly in 1D that is not in C2. And Shu Bin Chen Shu Bin Chen showed the C1 regularity result for the quasi-linear program. So remember the function, the new function is quasilinear. And so our work with Roman Ken and Kel, we showed that for the quasi-linear preference, we have a local white regularity, which is also shown. So Roshet in 1998 provided a 2D example. Provide a 2D example, and I think it's a state of art result at the time. That I'm the first case, considering a 2D, highly dimensional case when X is the square in R2 and Y is the project. And here, F equals to 1, so this uniform distribution, and C being a quadratic cost. So the type space is a square a to a plus 1 square. And the analysis says the following. So omega or x is divided in three different pieces. And omega 0, which is in the left corner, that all the consumers from this corner will choose outside option q0. And everybody in Q omega 2 will choose a different product. So we can do screw. Product, so we can do screening at optimum. But however, for consumer from omega-1, so omega-1 consists of parallel segments which are perpendicular to the diagonal. So each consumer on segments would choose a single product, which would choose the same product that you have a so-called function, so consumer on one dimension would choose one point. One point. So, where the solution could be described is the following. So, at this is this is non-precipitial region, we have zero. And on omega one, the solution is symmetric by uniqueness, so you can write as solved by solve ODE, solve this closedly. And for omega 2, so they solve a PDE, a Poisson equation, with the Newman condition on the boundary. The Newman condition on the boundary of x and Newman condition and Dirich condition on the interface between omega 1 and omega 2. Because this seems like over-determined. So we want to verify whether the soul function is correct or not. The first verification is by Mirabo, by numerics. So it shows a very accurate picture that it also divides X into three different parts according to the rank of the hashing of U. So it has to be three different parts. Hashing of u, so it has to be three different parts. And omega one is the same as illustration on its paper, but sorry, omega zero. Omega one is no longer to be like consists of parallel segments, but rather the boundary between omega one and omega two is no longer a segment instead of some butterfly shape. And in the region of Y, so if you look at the distribution. At the distribution in the space of y when chosen by x. So it's also a little bit different from before that instead of a square and a line and a point, it's kind of stretching the corner of the consumer to the out. We also give a proof that if this solution, written down by rotation A, exists and admins of Omission is convex, then it is not optimal. Then it is not optimal. So, by integrating using Newton, sorry, Newton-Lebnin's law, and we can have this. Because of time, so I'm going ahead to describe a new characterization. So, in this characterization, we add this part, omega 1 minus and omega 1 plus. So, where each consumer, so there are a segment, each consumer here with Each consumer here with a segment which is the same trader, but this segment no longer be parallel to each other. So they start from the degree of 0.5 and up to here. And also, the shape between the interface between omega 1 and omega 2 no longer be a straight line. So we do have omega 1 zero part where consumers from the same From the same segment parallel to each other up to this boundary, and then the angle change. So, this part corresponding to consumers who choose the same product and receive the same information rent. However, consumer here, when they choose the same product, they no longer receive the same utility. Okay, so this theorem characterizes this axiom to divide by 3. X divided by 3 different regions, and this region are connected, which is not proved before. And as before, so for people from non-participation region, they always receive zero, utility. For people who sitting in omega one, zero, we can write and solve the ODE and write in this form, which is the same. But for people from omega 1 minus, because we Because we can write it as a foliation where each segment here is determined by theta, and theta is varying. And each point on this segment could be parametrized by theta and r and where the length for the fixed theta on the segment is called r theta, the capital R. So then we can write this problem as so As so in this form. So this u1 bar, so which was u1 minus, on this omega1 minus satisfied this constraint, so that it's actually linear in r. So we can write as m theta times r plus b theta. Here, h theta represents the height of this intersective function. So by solving and to second order ODE. Second order ODE, non-linear ODE, we can find with some boundary value, so we can solve M theta. And from M theta, one can solve H and B. So for fixed H double bar and R, so whenever we know the shape between omega 1 and omega 2, we can solve all the system ODA, and the solution exists and unique, providing some evaluity property. And on omega 2, we still have And on omega 2, we still have Poisson equation with both Newman and Dirichlet boundary condition. So in this case, still, not every solution will be coming from this R. So for any boundary between omega 1 and omega 2, we can solve U1. And this will give boundary condition for equation 8. For equation 8. So some boundary from omega 1 to omega 2 will inconsistent with equation 8. But we claim that there is one boundary that makes the system have a solution, which is convex. So, and suppose we have the solution exist and have a convex in our duality, we'll show that this solution is really the design optimizer. Optimize. So, I'm talking about the ongoing works that we show that the free boundary problem has a solution, and moreover, the free boundary is divisions in each case. And to answer the question about the screening, see high dimension whether the screening can be complete, which we have the following results. So, if A is positive, then omega 1. If A is altered, then omega 1 minus plus, which is at this part. So omega 1 plus minus. This part is always non-vanishing, so we always not have a complete screening. And for A large enough, we also have this part that is also not for future work in UMARCS, look, this is. Future work in numerics, this is 2D, and for high-dimensional, we like to know because in two-dimensional, if we don't consider people from the outside option, so we choose the outside option, so all the functions are during one-dimensional. So, consumer from the one-dimensional segment will choose the same product. If in high-dimension, say, in 3D case, will all the function sites be 1D segment or not? So, if you want to answer this. So if you want to answer this question, we'd like to investigate like a 3D cube model, which is the dimension case for dimension coordinator 3D. So one possible way of doing this is to use neural networks for remarks. And the so-called input convex note, we know that neural networks is a function. So input convex, whenever you put any parameter here, the function is always convex. Is always convex. So because we are searching on convex functions, we are doing some supremum of i, u, where u is convex, and since i is u is increasing. So we always have this constraint. In order to not worry about this, we want to, say, use some structure in networks that always generate the complex function. However, the question is, so The question is, so of course, input-convex numerical will always give you a convex function. The question is: how large is the class that it gets from? Or how dense is this function? The functions generated like this with a convex set of complex sets. So, okay, this is some references I have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Shankar. Were there any questions? Are there any questions? So if you look at these, I didn't quite catch these omega 1 plus and minus. Like, okay, so you have different angles for the bunching regions. But then do you get, I guess do the bunching regions, like for the same y, do they go through both omega 1 plus and minus? No, there is match. So there's. Yeah, yeah. So so this this only guides, so they'll choose the same y, but say uh you can see from uh from mirables the marks. So those points choose here, and this point is symmetrically choose. Okay. Okay. And it doesn't make it discontinuous on the end of the region as it hits the point, yes. Okay, yes, yes. So, okay, so the continuity doesn't apply to this. What continuity? The continuity of DU? Yeah. Yeah, it still happens here, but it will kind of, if you move from here to here, then we'll move from here to here. And it will split split. Fractions will split. There are other questions? If not, let's. If not, let's thank the speaker. So, our school of mathematics is hiring. So, if you have interest or if you have student interest, so please let me know. Thank you. So, that's it for today. We reconvene tomorrow at 9. But let me remind you: if you want to walk up Tunnel Mountain with us, we'll meet after lunch at 1:45 p.m. just in the middle. Lunch at 1:45 p.m., just in the lobby outside this. No, they give that permission from there.
