Chant, and studios Unam, the doctorado in established University of Ruchels, and actually working the University of California in Los Angeles. Muchas gracias, Silvia, yenida victualment. Gracias, gracias. Este bueno, pues gracias todos puestar. A problem that is very important to the type of things that are in very queer groups, and final however, the problem is minimizing the number of directions determined by a finite point. So I want to minimize directions and that. Minimizar directions and that significantly. Puedo pesar conjunto de puntos. You have no point, not necessitating general position, nada de nada, tengo nu points, yora vía translas lineage que un pointos mi conjunto. These lineage lineage connectors, there the tien allas. Ah, the entire state. And what I think is grouped by lineage for linear lines. So here we have a total of other directions. Tenggo las lines that have horizontal lines or vertical and linear tenpendiente uno o meno yo four directions. The lines that have two Tendenpendiente 2, 2, llevo train 2, and you have the linear understanding a medium, or a media. Tengo yes, mislinas en total other direction, especientes. In this case, pod other pendants, so that with points determined other pendents. So the problem is what we have minimum. And what passes that there with this aquí. There have been a little meeting. So, there are trivials, what we have trivial, like this. So, I want to determine the number of directions generated by points of this and not all coordinates. I will say this condition of not all coordinates because when all points are collinear, especially a connector, and a direction, but. But here the points were linear, many directions. Tengo de directions. There have a point in the linear point, in one, and you have the linear queen, these are in directions. So, you're caso because it is a case very special. This is a direction, and when it cases for it. And And myself, with that case, now one notifantes the question of optimization, but what the maximum number of directions, but with the plan, but also that the maximum is not interesting because if the general position is not for collinear, so that is determined in the direction. And so much. So, the problem is with the minimum problem, but have excluded this case. So, if you have these mechanisms to do in the case, and that is the case in podo have a direction. So, if you have to do it in, if in par and their directions, if the parameters are not in the direction, In esimar, and one mastard in 2015, we demonstrate confederate. And that is to be in points in the plan of any direction in their masks, but in the candidates, and that is my facility adaptable to the case in a direction that we have. So, the question of minimizing this totally echoes. And this totally contextually, but we are pregunta de la classification. What is what are all the confuent points that are in points in direction? Enemy are directions when they start, and the voyage configurations critical or in points and directions when they spar. That are the configurations that for some critical. Critical queen to the par, but a related effort can be in the parases that I have criticized. But for their example, then this configuration here when it comes to a configuration critic, not critical to impart, but a little bit, aqueous examples, other two examples of configurations critical. This area. These are the vertices of a regulated. This are vertices, this is a arithmetic progression and their copia in vertices. This are two directors for the copy for the arithmetic progression, also in points, in directions, in par and if the central configurations in a centroid. Symmetria in those critics because it is a direction, but a point. So, these parallel impacts. So, now the problem is classification. What are the things? This area of configuration critical configurations or critical configurations are all. And that is the problem if you're going to be able to do it. It's in some cases, but if there were interests, what are all configurations critical? Now, honestly, in 1990, the demonstration utilizing circular uses. So, this is the same thing that we have in our results that are in circulation. Well, if you have a conjugate point, without it. If you have a juntos with what is a circle, circulation is necessary, but it is a unit of distributed process. It is a circulation that contains all the points, project all the direction, the direction that is important, is more utilized to control the tires of my points. So, in the parents who have the So, in the order of the parents that have the projections in this rectangle, the numerous cases have rectangle redoors of the circulo, also the circulo, and the order in the projections. And I'm going to change the certificates. And that is what changes order, no voyage grab in what they have to do circulation. So, when you see my circulation, how can we How can people tell two of the projections? And especially vance laza, the linear vaccine. When the linear sietee sebuel perpendicular. So, just the order of the change. So, now here we go, because we also change here, it is changed in the 5, so first of all 5, and the. So, in a here tengo, the circular aquí esto was the first ordinance that changed the change, it is changed. And with all everything circulated, and it will be here a change, and that is what you will see my circular society. Now, this queen here is what we are doing in the circular society because. Circular because you can see the circle, and pods are queas, and also the circular in the sense, in the sense of the medicine of religion, and so in more things that works. So, that is a society that is double infinite and periodic. And what we have semi-periodic, when a piece with points of unloading, and changing totally. So, this is how the circular and tengo varios exemplifies circular algunos with this trivial. When we say that, when we say the voltage circulo, only one once when all my. When all my cuandos my point is when the projection is the same for all the points there change and that circulates a point all colonial and the other conjugate que lengthenes that here this here have when  Has criticized because they have directions, and this is the tengo aquí, all my points here, colonialism, two affluent and entrance symmetric. And so this conjugate association circular and the number of English queen here, the first loop can see how it is. That is the number of directions. The three doses and the changes between significance that are directed on parallels. And that can see that historic entonces. Enpiece here, and the repente lazos and parallels. Parallels. These two y sixteen, like pora summon, separate them, and change. So that is directed on parallels, it is a solar direction, and only these directions and direction. And the same for when many, for example, here that the projections or case y que siman las projections of one two four is one direction that. Direction is the number of directions that implement the number of regulations here. One of the three. Ten other points and other directions. So one configuration casy critic. Well, this circular separate generalization, what complete is that necessito me with? What complete is that? What complete is that in pieces with other countries with the numbers of it? And change the champions, and the unique need is that eventually 5. And the change that we are between consecutive positions and passing, 2 pas 3, one 24 passes. 24 passes 85, 30, algo 3. And I think I can create susception circular, but not necessarily the conjugate points, and what is what number of English queen of what is going to decir with a little notation here. Unpu here in notation here. Empiece with the permutation one in order, in order to increase. Enpiece one two three four inquisitions. That is what. And semi period, what is that these indicators voyage semi period? In the city permutation that this here. In the cada permutation that is here, you will be completely reverence regulations. That is, to pass a permutation of the performance, have elements in consecutivas, and only because the interchange only between this position and the ultimate position that will be like the Ache vase la position permutation. So this is what can happen that I see here interchange between consecutive elements that are in order. So, for example, change the three, one of the three, the pop change can be, and what. People who are igual and here change the cinco cuatro, one cuatro 5 están or enclair, los pu chambiar puedo chambiara quí al puedo chambiar al 3 al 2s, because no están ordin totalmente 30, but chambiari el 6 el 2 y logo podi a chambiar el 6 el 3 y el 5 y el 2 ya porque 4. And because the four uno is note, we can change and change the simple three, but example to make sure that we can also order, and also with change in chambers. There is like, I mean, all notes. England and all North. So this here is not society with points. So implement the way permissible. In the succession circular, we have permissible. The yes, if you do the reglas, vaccine points, but what is these points and one two three four directions? Society as well. Poquito comozar, gridi esta es una configuración critic, casi critic, because the number of points is my problem of when they are toddling the successions permissible, so maneros can bear with one that gave. Luno Lene, I gave any type of change with the children, in esactamente en paso, sila en espar, and esactamente enemos un paso si la enemos un espar. That problem, and that problem is much. So, we have our first queues that change together. Chambio sagam para llegar di camos del uno sél se luno al ordo d universe, siempre var al menos en ernlones, oenemenos humo en el caso en unpar. That is what we say because the objects. And what we have is contrary to complenes. So that is what it is. In the cupro, one of our Jamie are demonstrating that they are four families that are criticized. This para impart. If embargo dierona, Jamie son, dieron catalogo decent configurations poradic configurations that do not have these four families, but your todaz are not cuatros of especially. Sodamente 4 de llas non central symétrical y es destiny for aquí. This are the unicasquat that are not symmetrical. Yes, they are also demonstrating that if the points are general, then the lung conjunto que es critico es conjunto de verticesión poligo regular. Thank you. Aquí conjuntes a political regulated policy par and their center. That is a means to this with a conjunto depuntos with directions and directions. That is, with the conjunto depuntos of vertices. Funtos of vertices, a polygon regular polygon parse or some transformation. Because the transformations preserve linear parallels and co-linearity. So what transformations of regular part. So we have, we are attracting to these conjectural concepts and this result. We are And this result we could more general position, and only study to the configurations in central metasymmetrics and verse que pas. We vercipo demos está conjectura or llegar alguna classification. So, our two conditions are a little more evil that position general position and the definition and The definition and symmetry central symmetry with central symmetrical centers. Not the sense of very rapid quality of the emission of their conjectural. The first, the regular aquís tengo, tien points and directions, and the directions that are por color, the roja, are all these changes, are paraguas departments. They are parents of parallel, and all of them are changed, but they are here, and that is ranglones. The varitas simplically are representing the antipoda, to the central symmetrical, this logo, that is the center, central symmetrical center. This uses public energy including the center, when including the center, this clitico, if the centers casually clitico. Centres casiclitic. Other families are the doubles, aquí estasión circular estes la lineage que pasportos estos points that are collinear and obstasparegitas that are the lineage that vandalism of these points to the linear segunda familia. The terse familia is a queenalization of this. This are two rectas para leases. Parallels, or two arithmetic progress for progress. And suggestion, this is two columns or by columnar arrays in English, and this are three columns. This is the finalization of the two columns. So, here you have three parallels, here for For the las yet for a rimetic progress, also, but not that of the motamine, but also central symmetric. And if they are other diseases, points, disease, anglions in position because central symmetric is the terror family, the interior is contending in this. And the family is what we have to do exponential. This circular session, This circular session, and what satisfaction is that this is a geometric progression, and the other are implemented rotations in integrated geometric progression. They are copies of this geometric program. This is more crucial exponential. These are families. Police regular columns and cruises. Columbus and exponential. So we trust ours, well. Lasimos simit central que erotación deciento symétria 10. That symmetry central symmetry. When Adlamos de Los Ancioles, the digits that the varitas implementes are. Varitas implementation reflexed 50 rotation of 50 others or the symmetric with respect to centroid. At all the lines that pass for the center of my conjugate lines connectors central connections and to say our results need to define these two costs, general position no central position. This is a version of the position because allow this more. The FIRMA Central Face is implemented in Medicine. The central implementation. So, for example, here, have these central lines of cadence of the central city, so I decided that they have central 3, how to rotate continuum with the aquí tiene 1 point of cadalado. A point of cadalado del centro, so grabo aquí el uno, y logo sigu otro uno, otro uno, y logo sigu un 2. So one two y logo sigu notros 31 ya termine. So that is the central firm of this conjugate. So misline central lines, when one two three. And well, we the unique things that have two points, the more solament for them. So, that is here the results. We have a Tennessee una classification completa de la permissible, which is critical or quasi-criticas. That is central meta-symmetric methods and positions general non-centric position. Otherwise, we can see two points where they pass the center. And in reality, this is super interesting that if you have a conjugate, one cyclist. A encyclical between positives that could the central configuration so cyclical between positives exist a succession circular, a permissible source that is central symmetrical conditions that are central meta symmetric conditions in general central position. Position general, centrica, and casy critic. Because we enforced studies about the parents, because central symmetric center aggregate central, but all the critical toes, all the critical. We have a classification total, and the impression is that for firm or possible firm existing permissible. Permissible that is critical, paragraph conditions. Let's say. Well, that is for permissible, but not all permissible, it is necessary. This needs to be a society to a configuration of purpose. I know that there are more permissible queue configurations of purposes. Configuraciones of points, so here you are as all the usions permissible, and I have a como queen of points, with points. So it is necessitated also also the classification for geometric classification. So what we can do: all the permissions, that are critical, that are positional and central symmetric, what is here, what if corresponding. What if correspondences with it? Yes, that is only the tiene of the type, firm central type, one, no, no, no, no, or when two central lines, or the tien three lineage central, but two tienes only a point of calado, son viñas queam, two points, or this two. This two. And we have to see that with the corresponding central center and here they have the unique conjugate critical apoyando la conjectura descot or resolving the conjectural descot in this case the regulars that have one of the families that one of the The doable queer of the four families, the cruise exponential queer of the four families in these cases. Two entradas can be a number with one, that is the double, or what do you enter, that is the exponential, or can these three, but two, on the regulars of three. On the regular columns, but like the science that are two of the columns, two columns in two points and the other columns of the medioty, the maps. Or this configuration is porous that there is catalog, operating the unique case that is the conditions of central symmetry and position general non-centric. That is configuration here, this paragraph. So, y a para terminar, the por exemplary here, all the optimos central symmetrical in general central general, or general position in all the septo quiz for the linear center, and with points. The political regular exponential, all these are exponential, these three, these doubled, and this regular columns. And that gracias. Mucha gracias. Mucha gracias, Silva, por esta Linda, Charla. No sesi, ay preguntas can el publico otamíena ka en el zum. Amanda, tien así sé si mes muchasilva. Ah, mucho na saspre. Siempre me gusta muchísimos platicasime. Siempre mejaspicada y m inspiran. So, yo que a certenamas two questas. Yanu intendínu intended. Yes, no, distractions, the central symmetry that the characteristic geometric characteristic is clearly in the successions, so this is how the exact tradition central in the world of first. And the second section is good as philosophical porphyry. Because the family of points with central films, because in this family, can log in classification concrete as it is. Aver, the first, the symmetrias don't want to decir, the symmetries entrancing. Symmetry central energy circular symmetries with respect to this directory, the multadity. So, well here, like the antipodes, the first, and prime, etc., and what movement of the discernment has to do with the other. So, for example, if you have the siete vara 3 aquí, you have to have the 3 variety of the traditional, it is the type of symmetry. So, that simete. You symmetric, named with where there are no other symmetries, that the symmetry is present in the chambers because change here will see the right and here can see independently of the points, the movement, the interchange, are exactly with. Son symmetric with respect to this linear aquí. So that is the symmetry central symmetry. The position general is not centric, what decides that everything does not include the lineage of change of two elements. So that is here one. So, here change this and this here is erected. In the example of the political, all changes, thereof, acacia, this is not position general central because there is two great. Because there are two grand queen. This newspaper in our classification is here because it is positioned generally because the unica grandeur through the center. That is what changed to travel center. All of them general positions, change of solament of two points. And because we are two characteristics, So, if we all the central metro symmetric centers come from the conjecture, the unico que se falta es demos. Is demonstrating that what was four configuration optimism is entrmented symmetric. So, if you are, and this with our result, well, I have another condition, but if we demonstrate all the symmetric entities, then it demonstrates that symmetric, but all these chequitos are central. So, that decides in the central symmetry. Of the general position because there possible and general positions, because it says for general position, that is only one of the four families, not more. No, if you want to speak, so we don't generalize that what we don't. General queues what we are not for all the symmetric, but what is the most y result that we are interested is that the problem in the circular and in the geometry is different, different families of susceptions that are geometric. But also that are unique. Gracias, Silvia, alguna, aquí el sum ah, som commentarios. Well, we semos travelles. Asilia, mucha glacias.
