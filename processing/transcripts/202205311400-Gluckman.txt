We're going to talk about ARDS mechanical ventilation and the unfortunate consequence of ventilator induced lung injury, which you really don't want. It's going to make things much, much worse. So I'd kind of like to go at these barriers to implementation in kind of application of lung protective ventilation through three areas where we've identified these unmet needs. The first being identification of injurious ventilation, which nobody has really. Which nobody is really sure of. And second is identifying and classifying ventilator disynchrony, which is poorly timed patient respiratory efforts while you're being mechanically ventilated. And the third being trying to optimize lung protective ventilation for any specific individual, which to me is the most interesting one. So when Bruce and I were talking about this, we came to the idea that we're both sad that all of these masses. That all of these macro-scale models that we have really have no underpinning in the underlying processes. And when I first started making models of the lung, I was utterly convinced that was vitally important. And the more time that I've spent under days corrupting influence, the less I'm concerned that that's vitally important. The reason behind kind of my shift in thinking is that the data availability is just miserable. Availability is just miserable in the lung, as I'm sure it is in the brain, too. You can't probe every neuron, and we can't probe every alveolus. I mean, much. Much you told me to go first. That's your fault. So it's not even that we can't measure every alveolus. We actually could if you put an animal in a synchrotron CT machine, you can measure the dynamics of all of the alveoli, but they die 15 minutes later from radiation poisoning. Radiation poisoning. So it's not super helpful in the clinic. The other problem is we can't measure all of the relevant variables in the same subject. So if you think we're trotting the rat, then you can't measure surfactant function. If you measure surfactant function by washing out the surfactant, we've along for morphometry. So to get a detailed measurement takes repetitive analyses in different subjects that are definitely not feasible at the clinic. And the data we do have available, let's say pressure. Let's say pressure and flow from the mechanical ventilator, frequently in the clinical case, is not going to probe the nonlinearity of the system. So the lung is going to get much stiffer at low pressures as things are collapsing. It's going to get stiffer at high pressures as you're overstretching and it's being constrained by the structure. And if you tried to measure all of those things, you'd really want to collapse the lung completely and slowly re-inflate it and then take it back down to a collapsed state, and in which case you probably would have killed the patient. And in which case you probably would have killed me. So on top of the data availability is this complexity. We've got a huge, huge system where each of the tiny little alveoli here, if someone had made a beautiful fluid structure interaction model of that alveolus, would be a really well-received paper on its own. So my prediction in terms of model So my prediction in terms of model complexity is that we'll have a colony on Mars that is fully staffed before someone makes a full-scale model that is patient-specific, and there might not be life on Earth anymore. So I don't think we have time to wait for this. On top of that, there's the patient-ventilator interactions, the respiratory efforts, the ventilator desynchrony, and I myself focus mainly on the lung, but a lot of these consequences are extra-pulmonary. You ventilate poorly, you get systemic inflammation, and you get kidney failure. Inflammation and you get kidney failure, and then you die of kidney failure. So, all of this is rather overwhelming to someone who wants to model the lung structure and function. And the allure of simplified models sings a siren song. So, coming back to the things that I feel like are kind of addressable goals. The first is identifying characteristics of the ventilation that are markers of ongoing gas. Are markers of ongoing damage, or as I would call them, a villi cost function for ventilator-induced lung injury cost function. This, I think, the importance is pretty clear. We want something that is an alarm for when you're doing something bad, so you have a metric to guide your decision-making, whether that decision is being made by the clinician or we've handed off control to the computer. Currently, well, let's go in the order of my points. So, you know, we have these complicated waveforms. So we have these complicated waveforms. This is from a mouse, but we've got inspiration here, a little peak that's due to the flow resistance, a period of no flow, and then expiration. And, you know, in order to categorize these waveforms, we're probably going to have to reduce these into a manageable quantity of data, reduce the dimensions, so that we can phenotype these things. And I will just pause for a second. That the word phenotyping ventilation, when I heard this from Dave, really confused. Heard this from Dave, really confused me for about a year because I thought we were talking about physiologic phenotypes. And the phenotype of the ventilation is going to be governed both by the physiologic phenotype, the condition of the lung, and also the settings on the ventilator. So once we got over that, I was doing a lot better. As an example of one of my many failures to people to explain things. I don't even want to hear about my failures explaining physiology. And just to tie this back in to And just to tie this back in to the human computer interface, the goal here is really to keep doctors from making silly mistakes. So, the current approach is real simple waveform properties that you could look at either directly as a scalar quantity on the ventilator or look at the waveform and pick this out. Probably most well-documented and proven is tidal volume. That is like the one clinically demonstrated lung protective thing you can do, is keep the volume of each breath. Do is keep the volume of each breath, the title volume, low. This is confounded by the baby lung like we talked about yesterday, where if you have a totally open lung, you give that a volume of one. Distension is going to be much less than if you collapse half of it. So the amount of injury caused by a given tidal volume is going to depend on the other underlying lung condition, not super. The other that's pretty popular these days is driving pressure, which is a difference from the end expiratory pressure to that plateau. Respiratory pressure to that plateau right there. And this really intertwines the ventilator settings and the lung condition, where if you have a low tidal volume and a stiff lung, you're going to have a high driving pressure. If you have a high tidal volume and a compliant lung, then you're going to have a relatively low driving pressure. So I had originally made this talk. What time am I done? 20? Okay. I had originally made this talk as 15 slides of alt text. Is 15 slides of alt text whining, and I thought it would be more fun to include some results showing why these areas need further study. And here is one of our investigations from a couple years ago showing why driving pressure is not that great. What we did is we took groups of mice, we gave them either no injury or a lavage injury to wash out the surfactant, then ventilated them with safe ventilations down here and higher driving pressures going in this direction. And what really discussed And what really disturbs me about this as a billy cost function is that the controls with the same driving pressure have much less billy than the lavage injured group. And here we're measuring the amount of injury as protein in the airspace of the lungs. So measure of leak, how much we've disrupted that blood gas barrier with alveolar injury. It's worth mentioning that there are basically no real measures of damage in the clinic. In the clinic, and Brad's talking about driving pressure, because that was the one that people were hoping or would think of using as a marker of damage. And this is an example of as a coarse measure. I think it's good. Like a high driving pressure is almost always going to be worse than a low driving pressure. But I think as a guideline for like a threshold kind of marker of injury, it's not so great because, you know, as we see here, same driving pressure, different amount of injury coming out. Different amount of injury coming out. And it's much easier to calculate accurately in mice than in people. Well, the waveforms are a mess. And in mice, they are ventilated with a piston. So the waveforms are much cleaner. And they're chemically paralyzed. And they're all the same size. Yeah. 200 days of colour. Yes, cousins. They're all cousins. Okay. Okay, so one of these that I really liked because theoretically it seems like it makes logical sense about why this would be bad is mechanical power dissipated over the breath. And for us, this is easy to calculate because we measure pressure and flow. But it's a bit more of a challenge in clinical ventilation where we don't necessarily have access to those variables unless we go through this huge rigmarole, which I've been working on for a year and a half, still don't have the data. Still don't have the data. And what I like about this, right, we've got a nice correlation between our cost function and this entry metric. And it's the same for both of the groups. You know, there's a little bit of an offset here, but that was not significantly different. And it's also sensitive to small changes in villainy here. We're even seeing a little bit of difference in one of our safe ventilation groups, which is a low tidal volume and a reasonable peak. Um, so where I think we need to go with this, which kind of brings up some of the limiting factors, is first of all, this was one simplistic injury model. So, in the animal studies, we need to expand on that. And hopefully, I'll have time to get to my slide about the limitations of animal studies. And the other kind of limiting factor here is that we've studied relatively unrealistic ventilation patterns with the urge of getting these things on and off the ventilator in like three hours instead of sitting. Instead of sitting there for days at a time trying to take these measurements, so you know, does this variable that we've calculated for a really high inspiratory pressure still hold at low pressures? I don't know. And also, we were pretty coarse in our evaluation. This is super easy to measure. It takes like three minutes. So we want to expand this out into lung structure, which is super tedious, and better assessments of lung mechanical function. To port this into the clinic, so as Tell mentioned, Clinic. So, as Tell mentioned earlier, we're working to take a device that sits in the room and unifies signals from all of the equipment. It's a capsule technology gizmo. It's like the size of an iPad. You plug all the stuff into it and it pipes stuff off into a central server. We're trying to take ventilator data from that, pipe it through the hospital's firewall, which was challenge, to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. A Google Cloud Storage bucket where it's then de-identified by an honest broker and given back to us. I started on this a year and a half ago. We're almost there, I think. Dave told me this, and I was like, ah, you're kidding, Dave. I'll have this in a couple of months. You're right again. So once we have that in our pause, it's really going to open up, I think, some fun data sources for analysis. But one of the things that's going to kill us there, as we've been hearing about this morning, That's going to kill us there as we've been hearing about this morning is the complexity of the medical record and all these confounding factors. You know, you might flip a patient from back to front because of improved outcomes with that, and that might get logged in the medical record two hours after you did it, and it's going to cause a huge change in mechanics. The other huge problem is there's a big lag between any injury caused by the ventilator and any measurable effect. So we might be giving these repeated insults for six hours, but for those to be reflected But for those to be reflected in the stiffness of the lung or anything might take another six hours, and we don't know how the long lag is. So, some real challenges there. And Jake, who works with Dave, is going to be presenting, I think, a really cool method that they have developed to go at this analysis that's not mechanistic, but I think holds a lot of promise. All right, so metalator desynchrony. Current approach to Current approach to diagnosing this mistiming between patient effort and ventilat is really to just watch the patient in the ventilator, look at it with your expert opinion, and say, ooh, that doesn't look very good. We should do something about this. Takes a lot of expertise. Like, I'm pretty sure if you put Dave and I in a room, we would watch the page and be like, I don't know, you think that's good, Dave? I don't know. What's of limited use and I really like is esophageal manometry, where they threadable integrated. Where they thread a balloon entire esophagus and you can measure the pressure in the chest cavity outside of the lungs. And that will give you a dip in pressure here on that esophageal manometer when you take that inspiratory effort and it pulls open the space around the lungs and drops the pressure. However, it's not widespread because it's kind of hard to do. And the balloons deflate themselves, it's hard to interpret. So that is not the standard of care. Not the standard of care. So, what we'd like to be able to do is algorithmically detect and phenotype these desynchronous breaths so that we can go through the work, which is not done yet, of determining if, in fact, they are bad. There's a part of me that thinks that dysinchrony could be lung protective by stretching the type 2 cells and releasing surfactant. And this is a matter of debate. There's been some kind of correlative studies that have shown associations with poor outcomes. Associations with poor outcomes, but I remain unconvinced. So there's some methods that Peter Sotiel and Dave, a couple other people, have put together, as well as some other groups. And hopefully we'll be able to use those to detect and classify. And in the future, maybe predict what we can do to reduce harm. And as we know, we'll have to explain why. I think we've got five minutes. I think we have five minutes. All right, so real quickly, you might recognize this good-looking man. This is Deepak, postdoc, who put together this model, which is an additive way of looking at the pressure and volume waveforms. So what we would do is start off with a little square, then add components that are limited in their time support. So, like this shape A would describe the inspiratory profile, B would describe the expiratory flow. Describe the expiratory flow profile, and taken together, they would give you the breath. That's a grossly simplified version of this. And due to that limited support, it's actually identifiable, which is shocking because it has like 20 parameters. I was surprised, actually, how well it worked. And just kind of a little summary of the efficacy here. So we've got a normal breadth with a measurement. Normal breadth with the measurement in green, and I don't know if you can make out the gray line, that's the model fit, so quite good. And for a disynchronous breadth, flow-limited breadth, we've got the model in gray and the breadth in blue. And again, pretty good fit here. And these over here just kind of summarize how much better it is than a simple compartment model. So we're still working with this, trying to extract the values of these different parts of the breath. These different parts of the breath and associate them with either causes, you know, what did we do to the patient to cause those signatures in the breath, and effects, what did those parts of the waveform mean for an outcome. And here we're just shown a couple of the time profiles for different patients with characteristics of those waves that we, using expert knowledge, associated with the presence of ventilator disynchrony. And I think the cool thing here. And I think the cool thing here is the temporal heterogeneity. And I'm super curious what Peter did to this patient at hour two to kick off this wave of desynchrony, what they did at hour three to make that stop. You know, what's causing this dissynchrony? I think that's going to answer an interesting clinical unknown. So, this is really what got me into this area: this idea that the ventilator control system. Ventilator control system could be improved by giving some guidance or even just determining optimal settings. And based on kind of my history in physiologic modeling, I viewed this as a simple control problem where we would identify a model for the patient and then run that a bunch of times and figure out which one caused the least injury. The challenge with this, right, is we've got innerpatient. With this, right, is we've got inner patient differences. You know, you might have a 300-pound obese man with a chemical injury and a 90-pound thin woman with bacterial pneumonia, and their lungs are going to be much different. Optimal lung protective ventilation settings are going to be much different. They hopefully will change with time as they get better. They might change with time as they get worse. So, this is going to be, need to be continually updated. We've talked about the system complexity. And this kind of gets back to the first point: we don't know what's Gets back to the first point: is we don't know what's bad. It's hard to solve an optimization problem if you don't have that target for optimization. All right. So I think I'll skip. So this is a blast from my postdoc past. Actually, no, this was while I was a professor. So we were kind of going at this model with the goal of understanding some of the pathogenic mechanisms of injury. Mechanisms of injury, but I thought I'd share it because it seems like a group that likes models. And what we did here is cause acute injury in rats with a bleomycin, which is like a chemical direct injury to the lungs. We had controls one day after, three days after, and a treatment with surfaced replacement. And for the model, this is way too complex to be usable, but really kind of matches the physiology nicely. We have the alveolar ducts as one compartment, and we can vary the width of that to account for the closure and opening. For the closure and opening of duct units. So, this represents recruitment and derecruitment of the ducts, and then a whole bunch of alveolar compartments, each of which can recruit or derecruit with a pressure and a latency. So, if you give it a sufficient pressure, I'll stop saying Dave, it'll wait a little bit and then pop open. So, we can get some fun dynamics out of this. And we parameterize this. And we parameterize this using a suite of measurements you would never get in a human. These measurements of lung function over a wide range of pressures, and morphometric analysis of the number of alveoli that are open, the volume average of those alveoli and the total volume, and the volume in the alveolar ducts. And from this, what we did is predicted the response over a range of end expiratory pressures, the volume of the alveoli, and the things to look at. Of the alveoli, and the things to look at here are the black control and that red day one injury. And in a subsequent experiment, we ventilated rats with a peep of one, so right down there, or a peep of five, so up here where we have a lower alveolar tidal volume at day one. And lo and behold, we might have actually been right. I think that this higher pressure ventilation, this higher peak, was more low. This higher peep was more lung protective than a peep of one, as our model predicted. So I will stop there after saying we can't use this model. We need something better. Excellent. Awesome. Awesome.  Yeah, wait for it. We got it. There's two mice the brain. The rating. I'm going to not worry about it. So I'm a mechanist, which means to some extent I really, really like to understand why things happen and where they come from and what our measurements mean. And that's been a continual problem since I started doing neuroscience-related things. And I didn't realize that when it started, but yeah, I have like this penchant for history things. We've been interacting with brain with electrical things since before we understood what electrical things were. And I think. I think brain and the nervous system. History goes back to words, put them in the right order, to Galvani's work in the 1780s, trying to figure out why he could get frog's legs to move. It's frog's leg. Anyway, and you know. You know, the history of this kind of goes through. If you're interested in history, you'll know that Galvani's nephew Altini did some gruesome experiments with freshly decapitated heads. And not only that, Galvani got into a fight with Volta, by which Volta didn't believe that Galvani understood where the electrical signals came from. Electrical signals came from to stimulate frogs, and so he went out and developed the battery, the voltaic pile. And then Aldini picked up on Volta's galvanic piles and decided, hey, I can create this electrical force, whatever it is, right? And I can stimulate brains. And he tried it on himself. He thought it felt really bad and decided that was really good to maybe treat his psycho. Treat his psychotic patients. Anyway, history goes through lots of different places until you get all the way to 1875 where Richard Canton just discovers that he can track brain electrical signals, so signals right from the surface of an animal's brain, and that they changed based upon the animal's state. Upon the animal's state. Fast forward just over 50 years later, Hans Berger, in his efforts to try and prove that there were paranormal capabilities in humans, discovers that he can measure electrical signals from people's heads and that they change with brain state and gets recognized as the originator of the East. The originator of the EEG, the electroencephalogram. And so I bring all of that up because there's this like built-in function. I told you yesterday, others have talked about the idea that we understand that neurons function basically with a circuit-like electrical model. Model. And so there's this jump that then goes that says, well, if I measure electrical signals from brain, that's measuring activity. And it's a good measure of activity. All right, so that's statement number one. Cecilia mentioned that there are lots of different flavors. Mentioned that there are lots of different flavors of models. I have to build this in because I'm going to come back to this. This is my experimental model for epilepsy. I create epileptic rats by sticking a little bit of tetanus toxin deep into their hippocampus. Tetanus toxin kind of gets retrograde, transported, picked up by the neurons, retrograde, transported, meaning picked up by their Picked up by their picked up in one place, transported toward their dendrites, passed across the synapses to the axons until they reach the inhibitory output synapses, synapses from inhibitory neurons, where then the toxin breaks apart into two pieces. One of the pieces One of the pieces cleaves to the SNAP complexes. These are the complexes that are involved in synaptic vesicles linking to the membrane, to the synapse, and then releasing. And so it cuts down on inhibitory output from the inhibitory neurons to the excitatory neurons. And so I've been playing with this model since since 20 plus 20 almost 25 or so years early recordings of seizures look like this these are measurements from electrodes stuck in the skull of an animal during a seizure and this is from from inside their hippocampus and this is roughly I don't know a minute minute plus long seizure and all of this stuff is And all of this stuff is big activity, where normal signals would be small, of lower frequency, and would evolve in different ways. Make sense? Oh, yeah, I don't care about that. This is just a more recent recording that I've made with a different recording system. Roughly the same kind of behavior. I'll just point out. Of behavior. I'll just point out that sometimes we get seizures like I showed before, or and but sometimes we get these events where all of this was part of the same event. It's just that somewhere in here, the activity went away, as far as we could record. And we'd see that for a long time. And we'd say, oh, you know, my students would say, what do I do with this? It doesn't look like two sets. This. It doesn't look like two separate events. I say, well, you know, it's all part of the same seizure, and it just went somewhere else than where we were measuring. And move on, because that's not what we were interested in. So from the mechanistic standpoint, let's look at the details of where electrical signals come from. So we know that the brain has these things, we call them neurons, they're different shapes. Neurons, there are different shapes of neurons, and in detail, what's happening is that there's another picture of a single neuron, and this is one of these, what we call pyramidal neurons. So these are the big excitatory output neurons. And they have these dendrites. The dendrites are the places where signals come in. So another neurons, axons, will come. Axons will come, come close to this, create a synapse. And so when the presynaptic neuron fires, sends a little neurotransmitter across, and the postsynaptic side, you get a little bit of current in. And if you think a little bit about the physics of that, the current is through the membrane, right? Charge is conserved, so you're taking a little So, you're taking a little bit of charge from the outside, putting it on the inside. That charge on the inside distributes, but the opposite side charge distributes on the outside of the neuron. So far so good? And so you get current through the inside of the neuron, and you get a countercurrent going on the outside of the neuron. And so, what we measure. And so what we measure in terms of electric activity is the distribution or the result of that countered current. Here's the way I explained it in class. We're driving current from the dendrites into the soma. It gets added up in the soma when it goes gets across that threshold. It fires an action potential, sends it out along the axle. But all those little synaptic inputs create this current, and you get an external current on the outside that has to basically conserve charge across this plate. That gives you a little bit of a dipole signal, and that dipole signal distributes over the continuum of the outside. So you're measuring each of the little inputs before the action potential. The action potential? No, no, no, no. This is all conceptual. All conceptual. This is just what happens. So far, so good? And so when we measure the electrical potential at some position here with respect to somewhere else, we're measuring the sum of all these dipole moments that are coming from these kinds of currents. Approximately. Approximately. So, all of this is, so if you stick electrodes into the parenchyma of the brain, these are things we call field potentials. It is a dirty, dirty measurement of activity. It's not, on the one hand, it's not the activity of this neuron. It's basically some funny convolution of all of the input of the signals coming. All of the input of the signals coming into that nerve, of which add up to the output of this nerve. That's already one problem. It gets worse because these things add up in nonlinear ways because the currents through the dendrites depend upon also the currents coming in at other parts on the dendrites. And whether they're positive or negative, or where on the dendrites they come from. Dendrites to come from. And so there's a wonderful paper about myths and missing understandings about local field potentials by Oscar Herreras from 2016. What's the spatial averaging like on one electrode? How big of a cube is that moving? Yeah, all kinds of great questions. All kinds of great questions. For that really big pyramidal neuron in a human, that's maybe a couple hundred microns tall. And wait a second, it's in this figure. It could be as much as, you know, two miles. Actually, this says it's like two millimeters tall, right? But if you look here, that's this kind of layer five. That's this kind of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. But there are lots of smaller pyramidal neurons, and then there are other neurons that are the inner neurons, and they have different shapes of their dendrites and worshippers. It's messy. It's all very messy. Scalp recordings are worse. This is what. Because guess what? Your brain is really well insulated. And if you wanted to... Really well insulated. And if you wanted to design an insulator, an electrical insulator, what would you do? Well, first you'd make a layer of like that's non-conductive, right? But if you really want to be really good, you make a layer that's non-conducting, you put a layer that's really conducting underneath it, and another layer that's really conducting outside of it, and that's what you got. This is from an MR pseudo-estimator of Of tissue impedance, and you see actually the bone itself is a pretty good insulator, but most of the skull has three layers of bone, good conduct, I mean good insulator, less good insulator, meaning better conductor, and then good insulator. It's got this layer of CSF on the inside that's really On the inside, that's really, really good conductor, and it's got a layer of skin on the outside that's also a pretty good conductor. And so, this damps out almost everything and damps out a lot of our ability to send electrical fields into your head. So, that's stuff. I won't go into some of the measurement problems with trying to measure electrical potentials in tissue because it's an ionic environment and so. Environment. And so converting, you know, charge from solid to liquid is a pain to the butt and fraught with error. But just believe me that almost everybody never measures true electrical potential inside a tissue. What they measure is some version of a filtered version of it, and they go even further and they high-pass filter. Even further, and they high-pass filter it for reasons I'll tell you in a minute. But this further AC coupling of the recordings changes everything. In the way that you see, if you've got these big DC, you know, big, low frequency or almost DC values, they go away. You just get the higher frequency stuff. And you've missed all that DC stuff. And, you know, and that's a And that's enforced by instrumentation hardware. So sometime in the 90s, we converted to 16-bit analog to digital converters, and there's almost all instrumentation is stuck there. If you do some back-of-the-envelope calculations, so you say, oh, you got to be in the couple of microvolt range to Volt range to classify brain death. And so, if you're going to build a human EEG recording system, invasive recording system, right, so you've got to be able to measure in the sub-microvolt range with your least significant bit. You multiply that by 32K, right, and you get up to 8 millivolts is the maximum potential you can measure, and you're shocked. That's right, so now you've got a squeeze. So now you've got to squeeze all of your dynamic range into values that go between just under, you know, down in the sub-microvolt range to eight millivolts, which means you have to high-pass filter because there are potentials that are bigger than that just due to things like slight changes in chemistry. All right, so. Alright, so let's get back to my instrumentation and my experiments. Here's a picture of one of my subjects. We put a, you know, we build a hat, a box on their head. We stick this amplifier that I designed and built with off-the-shelf chips in it. But the magic of this is that this guy is a 24-bit pre-amplified, you know, analog, you know. You know, analog, you know, by a potential converter. And so now, if you look at this thing, this is what's really happening. From all of these signals, you get this ginormous, big 15 to 30 millivolt shift that persists for 20 to 30 seconds. It's way out. Seconds. It's way outside of the high-pass filter range and out of the digitization range if I just had a 60-bit recording system. Alright, so. We have like three minutes or something. Oh, excellent. That's because I was futzing with trying to get my computer to look at. All right, so I'm just about done. So when we talk about measurement, right? Right by the way, this event is a so this stuff is that is this seizure event, right? And by the way, these guys are down in the hippocampus. This is a picture of the hippocampus. It shows where I was recording. The seizure spreads almost immediately. This thing spreads approximately from here, from red to black, simultaneously to To black, simultaneously to purple, and then to whatever cyan and this other magentaish color, right? That's kind of convincing that it's kind of going this way. It's spreading really, really slowly. And everything about this is not consistent with it being a seizure itself. It's this other event called spreading depression or spreading depolarization that was discovered by Liao back in the Wileyow back in the 1940s and is mostly thought about in the context of traumatic brain injury and in migraine. This is why migraine auras slowly propagate across the brain. Alright, so the last thing I want to tell you about is a little simple model of the way people Model of the way people think about seizures. People think about seizures as somehow coming from an excitatory inhibitory environment. And then somehow that would lead to hypersynchronous activity, and that's why you get these really big signals. Sounds really good, doesn't it? And so what they're talking about is if you look locally, you've got inhibitory neurons, you've got excitatory neurons, excitatory neurons. Excitatory neurons. Excitatory neurons take signals in from everywhere else. They connect to each other. They also connect to the inhibitory neurons. And the inhibitory neurons give them negative feedback and tamp down their activity. And so if somehow you unbalance this, then the excitatory neurons can fire off lots more and send a signal to their neighbors and that can spread as a seizure. Sounds like a great model. Sounds like a great model for epilepsy, right? I'm not sure how to get to that from microscopic slight changes. And I don't know how to answer the question I asked you yesterday, which is, if this thing seizes, this thing's going to hold seizures. Why isn't it seizing all the time? That's the question we'll talk about tomorrow. Do we coffee break or do we break into groups? Yeah, so like in the broad plan, I guess we just break into groups from now until four.
