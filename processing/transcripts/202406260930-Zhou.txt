Thank you, Professor Bajrecht, for your introduction. I'm going to talk about the construction of second-order price-dependent partial differential equation and applications. My talk is based on the preparing paper worked with Professor Tang. My talk includes three parts: Part 1, Part 1, Part Dependent PD. Part 1 participant PDS. First, let's introduce the participant setting. This is standard way that capital lambda t denotes the space of our continuous function defined on the interval yellow t with a uniform norm. And we use this lambda capital lambda t as the unit or capital lambda s as Our capital lambda s s belong to capital belongs to interval t capital t gamma t is the element of our capital lambda t and gamma t L denotes the value of gamma t at the time L we give a give the definition of we introduce the metric D infinity like this here gamma t plus h is defined like this it is defined like this then capital lambda t d infinity is a complete matrix space and now we consider the following fully nonlinear part dependent partial differential equation equation one the partial t weight plus f gamma f gamma t weight gamma t partial x weight gamma t partial double x weight gamma t equals to year with equal to zero with the terminal value with a terminal condition with gamma capital T equal to f gamma capital T clear partial t partial X partial double X are the partial wise derivative will be introduced in the next as this equation arrives initially in many applications for example the the equation associated with stochastic control problem With stochastic control problem with no mark of differing under the equation associated with the stochastic differential gain with no mark of dynamics. The major result I will retalk is that the existence and using our vertical solution to the equation one. Technical conditions. As in the data-dependent case, As in the data dependent case, the technical conditions are standard. Item one, F is continuous. Second one, we assume F is decreasing with pair to the second variable. I demonstrate, we assume F is increasing with pair to the last variable in resistance. Here, X and Y are the symmetric matrix. As a symmetric matrix. Item 4, there exists a local modulus continuity rule such that for any beta continuous zero and for all xy satisfying this inequality, we have this inequality hold true. Item five, we assume f satisfy linear growth condition. Satisfy a local deep condition with pair to the last two variables. The condition are standard. Some of the other venture works. With Google solution for past dependent PDS, Professor Peng Yin ICM 2010 firstly introduced the notion of The notion of the PVDS and point out that a normal micro BSD is a PDS. Professors Akzan, Kayla Ture and Zhang 2014 introduced a new notion of vehicle solution for the semi-linear PDS in the term of non-linear expectation. And so that is the existence and the user. That the existence and the union of vertical solution, then they extended the new notion to free non-layer case, when F is uniformly non-degenerate. My paper 2023 also studied the fully non-layer path-dependent HGB equations. I understood that the existence and the uniqueness of the solution with the coefficients. When the coefficients only satisfy the deepest condition and the uniform norm. For the zoom sum, let's look at the different game. Professor Fleming and Suzanne Edison first studied the Yellow Sun SDS. Then Professors Bokodan and Professor Di 2008 extended. 2008 extended the above result with the help of theorem, with theory of PSD. Professor Fem and Professor Zhang studied the path-dependent SDS in the weaker formulation and showed the existence and uniqueness of vehicle solution when the coefficient is non-degenerate and the dimension is either. Dimension is either one or two. Professors Posomaji Ture and Zhang 2020 also studied the past dependent SDS in the weak formulation and so the existence of with solution. Professor Zhang Fu 2 studied the past dependent SDGS and so the eggs of The exodus of our game values. We know that since you know the studies are called solution. Part two, we consider solutions. Before giving the definition of vehicle solution, we need to introduce the pathways derivatives. Let T be fixed. If F belong to C EuroP, that means F is continuous and growth in. And growth in a polynomial way. And assume that there exists partial TF, partial XF, and partial WXF, such that for all continuous deputy process X, which is a semi-martin gal on the interall T capital T, we have this functional U2 formula hold true. Then we see F belong to C12P. C1 to P. Here, this xs denotes the value of X at time S, and this Xs denotes the who he pass over X from time S to S, from 0 to S. The partial TF, partial XF, and partial double XF are the partial Y derivatives. They can also Derivatives. We can also give their definition in the two-pair sense. We know that they are coincide. With puzzle-wise derivatives, we can give the definition of what we call, which is introduced in my paper 2023. Continuous functional A continuous functional w is called a with concident subsolution to equation one if the terminal condition w less than or equal to phi is satisfied and when error phi belongs to a plus gamma s w with s less than capital T, we have this inequality or true. Here, A plus gamma S W A plus gamma s w is the center of the functional phi, phi belongs to C12P and W minus phi get ATS maximum at a gamma s. Similarly, we can give the definition of the supermarket of the super solution. If W is both a visicosity subsolution and a super solution, we say it is a visicosity solution. Is a vehicle stated solution to equation one. That's a definition of the vehicle solution in the Krandolian sense. To get the existence and the uniqueness of vehicle solution, we need to introduce two tools. First one, x and bone price where is no principle. We know that the matrix base capital lambda d infinity is not D infinity is not locally compact. Then, a functional defined on this matrix base, we cannot get it to the maximum point. To overcome the difficulty, we need to use this variation. Before giving the variation, we need to introduce the definition of our git function. Let the ED be a complete metric. be a complete matrix base. A continuous functional capital Open Telta is called a k-type function if the following two conditions are satisfied. First one, capital Open Tilda XXA equals to Yelzo. Second one, if capital Opson Tilda X Tilda XY converts to Yazoo, we have DXY also convert to Y. X and point price variation. X and point press variation pre simple. Let W be an upper semi-continuous function bounded from above, and capital Opsen theta is a get function. Now we cannot get W's maximum point. However, if we give W a small perturbation, this is a small perturbation, which is constructed by the GitHub function. GitHub function capital Open theta. Then we can get it as a maximum point, x head. So X line bone press variance simple is used to get the functional maximum point. Okay, the second one is the smooth functional. We notice that the supermove norm is not smooth. So we cannot apply functional unit formula to it or use it to prove. Or use it to prove the compression principle. To overcome the default, we need to construct some smooth functional, which is equivalent to the supermodel norm. Now we want to spend a little time to explain how to construct the smooth functional. We define f as the square-hour supermode norm, and we defined supermode norm minus. Supermonormal minus as a supermonorm or norm of gamma t s as less than s greater than or equal to zero and less than t eta is y rate to such that partial tf always exists under equal to zero in this case and this case how so this case, partial xf exists. However, in this case, in this case, the normal or terminal value is equal to the supermodel norm minus. In this case, parcel xf does not exit. We notice that so f is not small. However, we notice that However, we note that only in this case, only in this case, f is not differentiable. So if f is multiplied by a functional which is equal to years in this case, then the functional maybe become differentiable. However, the term is not a differentiable. term is not differentiable so we need to replace this functional by this functional square our v term this function node this function node first order derivative partial x exists to gene sum it second order derivative exists we need to reply two by three This functional is most. However, it is not equivalent to sixth power of supermodel. Because here, we minus the terminal value. To insert it is equivalent to the sixth power of supermonorm. We need to plus this functional. Unfortunately, this function. Unfortunately, this functional is not small because of this term for the power of a supermonal. So this functional should be divided by this term for the power of our supermodel. Then we get this functional, which is equivalent to quite our supermodel and it is the first order derivative partial x exists. exists. Also, however, by some technical requirements, in the proof of our comparison principle, we need this even number greater than or equal to six. So we reply two by six. That's our small functional capital Osler. We also note that. We also notice that all the unit numbers greater than or equal to six are all k. So we define the smooth functional capital Opusland like this and define the capital Opusen theater like this. Defined overline over capital Opsen like this. In my paper 2023, we get some properties of this functional. Number one, capital Oslo belongs to C12P. Capital also belong to C12P and it is it is a pathwise derivative satisfy this inequalities and capital epsilon is equal to sixth power of the supermodel. Finally, our line of capital epsilon is a get up function on this matrix space. So we can use this smooth functional and the Both no and the excellent point price value is not simple to prove our results. The exit is the applying the ex-and-boint press variance principle and the smooth functional capital of strength. We can get the following lemma 2. Let F be continuous and let A be a family of with concrete subsolution to equation 1. And suppose the inequality 5 holds true. And define the U like this, the supernormal of W, W belongs to A, and let U star is upper semiconductor envelope of U. And assume that U star less than infinity, then U star is a because it is subsolution to equation one. Now let's say it is. Now let's say it is proof. Notice that in r2 get that u star is a with conceded subsolution. By the definition of subsolution, we only need to solve that. If phi belongs to A plus, gamma hat T hat U star, we have this inequality hold true. Now let's say if phi belongs to A plus by the inequality five. The inequality file we have this convergence hold true. We notice that inequality file I use to get that T n greater than or equal to T hat. We define gamma n like this, u n minus phi minus overline over capital over sl we cannot get it as maximum point, but by excellent point. But by X and point press, variation point is simple. If we give gamma n a small perturbation, then we can get it as a maximum point, gamma height n, t height n. Also by the lemma one, the O line or capital O son belong to C one to P and the small as a small population also belong to C one to P. Then if we define the percent like this, Find pursue one like this, then pursue one belong to A plus, gamma head n t head n un since un belong to A, that's u n is a viscosity subsolution to equation one. By the definition of subsolution, we have this inequality hold true. Then by our assumption that we assume f is continuous. F is continuous. So if we let n converge to infinity inequality 8 and use the convergence 8, convergence 7, we finally get this inequality hold true. Thus we show that u star is with Caucasus subsolution to equation 1. Thus we use the x and point press where x and point is simple and the smooth function. As most functional capital O3, we prove this lemma 2. Then, by the battery lemma 2 and the standard passage method, we can say the Kwando Yishen Leon 1992. We can get the exit in theorem 1. Let hypothesis 1 item item 1 and item. item item one and item three be satisfied and the comparison principle comparison hold true for equity one and suppose that and and the line over u is uh we consider subsurface and the all line over u is a subscription to equation one and assume that and the line will u equal to all line with u at gamma capital T and O line will u star less than if Overline will use star less than infinity, and underline will use star greater than minus infinity. And suppose that the inequality 11 holds true, which is similar to inequality 5. And we defined, if we defined u like this, supernormal or w, w, where is it or equal to, underline with u, and the lesson or equal to all line with u. Or equal to all and we and W is uh we consider suppose version two equal to one under size five inequality 11 for the same row and uh capital delta what is then year then u is a viscosity solution to equation one that's the exit zero we know that compare with the data dependent case we only add the case we only add this uh condition we we we only add this uh inequality that's the exit exit theorem for the compression theorem also by the example impression variance in price simple and the smooth functional capital of the and using the standard method introduced in my paper 2023 we can get the comparison uh theorem Zero. Suppose hypothesis one or two, and let w1, w2 be the viscosity subsolution and supersonic to equino one. And just suppose that w1 w2 grows in a polynomial way and satisfy local division condition under the supermodel. Then we have that W1. Then we can set W1 less than or equal to W2. That's the conference theoretical. That's our main result. Part 3, applications to path dependent SDGS. We consider this controlled data equation for chin. Here, U and V are the controls under gamma t. Other can choose and the gamma t is the essential value. We defined the low value functional or underline over weight like this and the upper value functional or line over like this. Clear, where is the solution of this BSD? Windows data we can send as a path-dependent SDS in the formulation. We also We will solve that and the line over is unique. We go solution to equity 18 and so that similarly we solve that overline over is a unique vehicle solution to equity 19. Here 8 minus and 8 plus it defined like this and this and 8 it defined like this. They are standard. They are standard. The technical conditions for the coefficients. We assume that the coefficients B sigma Q phi are continuous and satisfy linear growth condition. We also assume that they satisfy uniformly EPS condition. These are all our conditions. So there are some features of our case. Features of our case. The first one, positive pin case. Second one, volatility control. That means sigma can include some more controls. Third one, sigma can be degenerate. The major art. By the functional ut formula and the dynamic programming principle, we can suit the exit in the drum two. Suppose the hypothesis two holds. Hypothesis two holds then overline and underline over is a we consolution to equation 18 and similarly overline will v is a reconstruction to equation 19. That means underlying in 15 and overline will weight defined in 16 as a visual solution to We go solution to equation 18 and equation 19 GPT. We notice that under the high plus 2, it is easy to z minus and it's plus satisfy high plus 1. Then by the about x exiting stage 1 2 and the compression stage 1 in part. Pressing theorem in part two. We have the unique theorem. Let's high pressure two hold. Then underline weight defined in 15 is a unique. We go solution to 18 in the class of a functional satisfying 12 and 13. That means functional growth in a polynomial way and satisfy local lipis condition. Similarly, we can. condition. Similarly, we can solve that overline over defined in 16 is a unique vehicle solution to our equation 19. Finally, we give a remark. If Isaac's condition, h minus a equal to 8 plus or true, that means if h minus a equal to 8 plus, then the equation 18 and 19 And 19 coincides. Then, by the unit theorem, we get that. And the line with u equals or line with u, which means that the participant intern SDGS has a wide functional. The associated apartment IDG has a wide functional. That's all thankful for authentic.
