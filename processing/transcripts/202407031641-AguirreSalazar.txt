Okay. Welcome everybody to my talk. Thank you so much for being here. I am going to tell you about an auto Kawasaki model set on the space. As Daniel was saying, currently I am a limited term assistant professor at Lakehead University in Barrie, Ontario, and I will be heading to Texas AM. So, okay, now this is joint work. Okay, now this is joint work with a couple of people. One of them is Xin Yanglu from Lakehead University, and the other person is Jiang Cheng-wei from the University of British Columbia. My presentation consists of various parts. There is a land acknowledgement first that is very brief. Then I tell you about some problems from the calculus of variations. Then that leads naturally. That leads naturally to talking about a model from quantum physics called the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac von Weiss-Current model. Then I tell you about the Ada-Halosaki model, which is a model from material science. Then I finally get to introduce the model I am interested in, and then I have the conclusions. So, much of what I am going to talk about today concerns Talk about today concerns what I did during my PhD with Leah Bernsard and Stan Alama at McMaster University. Thank you so much for the invitation to come here, to the organizers. I really appreciate the opportunity to connect with people and to spreading the word and getting to see some interest in my research, maybe hopefully. We will see. I want to go with this one. Okay, so here's a brief land acknowledgement. Bears in Bath is located on the campus of Bath Center for Arts and Creativity, which in turn stands on Indigenous territory. We acknowledge the past, present, and future generations of nations who help us steward this land, as well as honor and celebrate this place of creativity, collaboration, and learning. Wherever you are, I invite you to reflect on. I invite you to reflect on the peoples that have been in the land before you, and that's all I will say about the land. Okay, so here are some problems from the calculus of variations. So in the calculus of variations, we're often interested in minimizing or maximizing certain energies. The first problem I would like to tell you about is called the classical isoperometric problem. This problem concerns minimizing the perimeter of Minimizing the perimeter of sets. Those sets are subsets of the space and they have a fixed volume. Is anybody familiar with this problem that is not a mathematician? A little bit. Okay, good, good, great. So maybe you will know much of what I'm going to talk about. So this problem is a very famous problem in mathematics and some physicists know it. Some physicists know it, and some people from other fields. This problem has been fully solved by DiGiorgi back in the 1950s. And it turns out that balls are minimizers and minimizers are balls. So you have a minimizer if another if the set is a ball. Alright, the next problem from the calculus of variations I would like to tell you about is called the problem. You about is called the problem of the equilibrium figure. And the problem of the equilibrium figure concerns minimizing an energy. And since we have physicists in the audience, I am going to make an effort to provide some interpretations. So we are minimizing the total potential energy of a self-gravitating fluid body with a fixed volume. And we have this Columbic looking. We have this Columbic-looking energy, and this problem has been fully solved. The math physicist who solved this problem fully is Elliot Lee. That was back in the 1970s. And it turns out that no matter what M is, the volume that is fixed, the minimizer to this problem is a ball. So once again, balls. So we have that balls are important. So, we have that both are important. Okay. Next, we have the liquid drop model. The liquid drop model is a model from physics that was conceived by Gamma back in the 1930s, and mathematicians became more interested in this model some time ago as they were studying the Ada Kawasaki model. This model is about describing nuclear structure. So, the idea. So, the idea is that nuclei are to be thought of as fluid bodies that are incompressible and uniformly charged. And the purpose of the model is to predict the shape of nuclei, to predict the existence of nuclei with the least energy per nucleon, and to predict the non-existence of nuclei with too many protons. Mathematically, we are minimizing this energy that we have right here. This energy that we have right here, we're adding the perimeter with that term that was coming up from the problem of the equilibrium figure. So there is something very interesting going on here, if you've noticed. There is a competition for dominance, and that is hard. So here we have the perimeter that is minimal. Perimeter that is minimized by balls. But in competition with this term that is maximized by balls, remember that minus this term was minimized by balls. I'm so sorry, I don't even know how to use this thing. It might have to be switched on. Oh, there it is. Okay. Now I can stop pointing at the thing. Okay. So the perimeter is minimized by balls, and then in contrast, this thing is maximized by balls. Thing is maximized by evolved. So there is a competition of terms going on here. This problem has been studied a lot by lots of mathematicians. I guess business as well. I'm more familiar with the mathematics. But what we have is a situation that is different from what we had here. So here we had existence of many misers for all masses. Here we had existence of many misers for all masses. Many misers were balls. Here we have existence of Here we have the existence of minimizers up to a certain point. For small values of the volume of the mass, we have existence of minimizers. Then we don't know what happens, and then there is non-existence of minimizers. When the mass is sufficiently small, the perimeter term is the one that dominates, and this corresponds to surface tension. And when the value of When the value of the mass is sufficiently large, this non-local term that favors splitting is the one that dominates, and we get non-existence. Moreover, we can say that minimizers are balls when the mass is sufficiently small, but there may be an interval of m for which the minimizers are not balls. It's not clear if it's moles or not. So there we have three examples from. Have three examples from the calculus evaluations. Okay, now let me tell you about the Thomas-Fermi direct fund bisophere model. I'm going to refer to it as TABW from now on. I did my PhD on it. My whole PhD was about the TSDW model. So Model. So, no surprise, the contents include quite a bit of the TODW model. And I'm going to try to show off and show you some results I got during my PhD. So, I hope you enjoyed this. If not, I'm really sorry. But this is going to take a little bit. All right. So, the TFDW model, what is that even about? In the background, we have the many We have the many-body Schrodinger theory from physics. There are lots of physicists here, and I'm not an expert in physics, so I'm not going to go into what exactly it is and how it's posed, and so on and so forth. But what I know from doing a PhD on the TADW model is that that theory is very precise but complicated for practical purposes. So, a lot of approximation theories have been developed, and the TMDW model is one of those approximation theories. Theories. The TFDW model is a density functional theory. That means that properties of atoms and molecules and bodies in general are encoded in the electron density. In this model, the electron density is modeled by U. U is going to be a function in W, in H1, sorry, the set of weakly differentiable functions, functions that are in L2. Functions, functions that are in L2, and whose derivative is in L2. And in general, chemical and physical systems are usually found in their most stable state, and that corresponds to the lowest energy possible. So it makes sense that we're minimizing an energy. We're trying to find the minimum of certain energy. So here we have this energy. And this energy corresponds to the energy. Corresponds to the energy of a system of M electrons interacting with one nucleus. I have focused on working with one nucleus just because it's simpler, but I could generalize this to working with molecules. But for simplicity, I've just focused on just one nucleus of an atomic TAP dollar model. Okay, now Now, again, because we have physicists in the audience, I will try to make an effort to tell you why the energy looks this way. I understand that these first terms are kinetic energy. This term right here with the 8 thirds is exchange energy. This term right here, the z u squared over the absolute value of x, Absolute value of x corresponds to the one body attractive interaction between electrons and the nucleus. And then this term right here, that is a non-local term, Columbic interaction, corresponds to the two-body repulsive Columbian interaction between electrons. Electrons try to repel one another. And here we would have to adjust constants C1 and C2. Constants C1 and C2, those are positive constants, in order to get to approximate Schrodinger's many-body problem accurately. But for the math, we don't really care. For the purposes of math, we don't really care about those constants. And I'm not going to care too much about those constants. Here, Z, the Z you see right there, corresponds to nuclear charge. In other words, the number of In other words, the number of protons. Sorry, I just want to. And U is real, because this is just the ground state. Correct. U is going to be electron density, so electron distribution. So we're thinking of functions that go from the space into a set of real numbers. And everything here is real. Everything here is real. Absolutely, everything here is real. Absolutely, everything here is real. At no point, I need to talk about complex or anything like that. Okay. So you might be wondering why somebody would do a PhD on this. Right? I don't know. People do PhD on different things. And during my master's at the Tefnion with Professor At the Technion with Professor Itai Lefir, I worked on a problem that was a PDE system of equations that involved existence of solutions for values of the mass up to certain point, non-existence for large values of masses. And this problem kind of looked like that. We are going to have existence of minimizers for m up to a little bit more than z and non-existence of minimizers for m. Non-existence of minimizers for M large enough. So it was kind of natural to work on a problem like that one during the PhD. That's what we thought. And yeah, I think this is a very interesting problem. I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about it. So anyways, now in terms of physics, I understand that the existence of mini-misers has to do with the existence of atoms, with the number of protons. With the number of electrons not being too far from z. And the non-existence is related to something called the ionization conjecture, the non-existence of arbitrarily negative atoms. Okay, now I'm going to tell you what my plan was for the PhD. Once I was presented with this problem, and sure, it made sense to work on it. And sure, it made sense to work on it because we had this critical math and then the non-existence result. You know what I wanted to prove? I wanted to prove a conjecture. Take, instead of an atom, take a molecule. Prove the ionization conjecture for the molecule. I wanted to prove that during my PhD. It's an open problem. It's an open problem. And actually, during my PhD, people came up with the proof of the atomic case, so that was kind of a disaster. So, okay, but there were still things to be done, right? I had to do a PhD. I still had to get results. So let me talk a little bit more about those results. Okay, now this is turning a little bit more mathematical at this point. At this point. As a function of M, we can say a lot about this infimum that we have right here. Mainly, we have subadditivity of the energy. We have that that energy is negative, strictly decreasing and continuous. We have coercivity of the energy. With the problem from the calculus of variations, we can talk about an Euler-Lagrange equation and minimize. Lagrange equation, a minimizer satisfies an Euler Lagrange equation that is a Schrodinger's equation. It's all elliptic. I'm not thinking about the dynamics here at all. A minimizer is going to be radial for M up to Z. In terms of physics, I understand that what that means is that the electron distribution depends on the distance to the origin. And And a minimizer is not radial if m is too large. And then we have some asymptotic behavior of the energy without any z. So imagine there is no nucleus. I guess that doesn't make a lot of sense in physics, but it turns out that that energy at infinity, we call it that way, is very important for the model. And we have some asymptotic behavior for the energy when we have a nucleus. As the number of electrons goes to zero. Okay. Now, even though you might be thinking, okay, does n really go to zero? Can we have m equal 0.5 electrons? Well, for the math, we don't really care about the values of m. n can be anything, any positive value, and z can be anything greater than or equal to 0. So for the math, we don't really care if we have integers or not. Good. So now, from the mathematical point of view, when we work with a model like the T of D W model, we care about minimizing sequences. But the T of D W model is not easy to work with because we have an energy set on the whole space. That's bad. That can ruin compactness of minimizing sequences. Also, the energy. Also, the energy is not convex. That also ruins a lot of stuff. The energy is non-local. I mean, the Euler-Lagrange equation is a Schrodinger equation. There is an eigenvalue there that we don't know a lot about. What could be worse, right? So it's a pretty difficult model to work with. But it turns out that there is a mathematician who studied compactness in the whole space, and that mathematician is Pierre Louis Lyon. I'm sorry for my pronunciation. I'm sorry for my pronunciation. And it turns out that when we take a sequence of minimizers for the TMDW model, we get three options. Either the sequence converges, up to translations. I'm not going to talk about translations a lot. Let's suppose that the sequence converges. We have vanishing of the sequence. We have splitting of the sequence into at least two parts. And that's it. For the TMVW model, vanishing cannot happen. Vanishing cannot happen because the energy is strictly negative. So we have either convergence or splitting. And it turns out that to get convergence, we can characterize convergence by using this sub-additivity condition with a strict inequality. So here's my first result from my PhD. It's a very nice result. And it's about the structure of generic sequences of the TMD download. Sequences of the TFD-W model. So if you take a minimizing sequence of the TFD-W model, then that sequence either converges to a minimizer or that sequence splits into finitely many pieces in this sense. So the sequence is going to be roughly the addition of finitely many functions, and this is in H1. Those pieces are moving infinitely far away. Moving infinitely far away. The full mass is accounted for by this splitting. So the addition of masses of those functions, those bumps, is M. We have the decomposition of the energy into an addition of energies. And this is a nice picture that can tell you a little bit about how this splitting happens. The mass of this central piece, one of the first pieces not translated at all, is at least Z. Okay. Now let me tell you about the TFDW model with other background potentials because the Newtonian potential is not the only potential one can choose. One can choose, for instance, a potential that decays slower than the Newtonian potential. One does something like that, it turns out that this term right here is going to be the dominant one, the one that keeps things together. Remember, this is the Keeps things together. Remember, this is the attraction. And we're going to get existence of minimizers for all m. Then I say, okay, then what happens if I have a potential that decays slower than the Newtonian potential, but approaches the Newtonian potential? What happens in that case? Can I say something about the minimizing sequences? And it turns out that that was the next. And it turns out that that was the next result of my PhD. So when we take minimizers of the regularized TMDW, what happens is that we get a minimizing sequence from the TMDW. We get the splitting we got on the previous page. The mass of the piece at the center is going to be greater than Z. And that kind of makes sense because, in the theory of atoms, and physicists understand this. And physicists understand this a lot better than mathematicians. When you have, say, an atom with nuclear charge Z, so Z protons, you expect to attract at least Z electrons. Does that make sense? Right, so there it is, and the piece. And the pieces this the minimizers split into can actually be localized. That's the new result, the new part of this result. Can be localized and the localization of those pieces has to do with a power of Zn, the Zn that was coming from the regularization of the TMD-W model. And we can localize those pieces, they are infinitely far away. Pieces, they are infinitely far away, they're getting infinitely far away at a certain rate, and these points have to do with minimizing an interaction energy. So that's very nice. Okay. Yes. That makes sense. Did you mean neutrons instead of electrons? I guess I meant electrodes. You have the protons at the center, right? And then you have the electrons around. And then you have the electrons around, you hope to attract at least definitely true. Yeah, okay, so I definitely meant. So I said something totally wrong. I'm so sorry. No, you were absolutely right. But yeah. Okay. Now I'm going to tell you about the third result of my PhD. So I had three results in total that accounted for two publications. And if you look at my page, my website, I have websites. Website: I have websites like I have an account on LinkedIn, I have an account on ResearchAid, and I have an account on GitHub. Then you're going to see those publications right there, or you look wherever you look for it. The third publication is very nice. It's even nicer than the other ones. And it got published on a journal that is even better than the previous one. So it was a very nice publication. It made it great, and it had a great impact on my CD. So now I present a result that connects two models from quantum physics, the TFDW model and the Liquid-Drop model. The TFDW model, remember, is a model for electron density. The Liquid-Drop model, remember, is a model for nuclear structure. How could they be related? Well, it turns out that mathematicians have often treated the liquid drop model as a toy model for the TMVW model. As a toy model for the TMVW model. But an analytical connection had not been established. This result is about that connection. And that connection happens through gamma convergence. A gamma convergence result that is not exactly the same as a usual gamma convergence result because we have something that it's spaces. But it's a gamma convergence result combined with concentration compactness. So it's going to be really beautiful. That. So, what we have is we introduce a length scale parameter epsilon. So, here we have a bunch of TLDW models. We add a term here to the background potential just so that these energies are going to be bounded below, so this doesn't go to minus infinity. We have the usual Newtonian potential. We're going to consider those models on the set of functions that are weakly differentiable with a fixed. Functions that are weakly differentiable with a fixed L2 mass, our usual setup, we just introduce epsilon there. And guess what? As epsilon goes to zero, that's what we want. We expect this term w of u to be zero. Because this term is getting penalized right here. So in the limit, we're expecting this term to be zero. This term to be 0. This is 0 when u is 0, or u is positive or negative 1. So the limiting space is going to have to do with 0, positive, and negative 1. Also, we expect in the limit to have the same kind of norm. Here we have this. And just as with the pan-Helier problem, we expect. We expect this whole thing to converge to something like this. Here we have the total variation of u. So the limiting space will have to do with the functions of boundary variation. Here we have the infimum of the epsilon problem with the T of the W. Here we have the infimum of the liquid drop problem. And there is a problem at this point. It would be nice to have convergence of the TNDW to the liquid drop model. Of the TABW to the liquid drop model. But wait a minute. Remember, we have problems with compactness of minimizing sequences. Well, it turns out that the gamma limit, because there will be some issues with the spaces, will have to incorporate the concentration compactness structure of the TMDW and the Lucantrop model. So the right limit is going to be this thing, and it looks horrible because it has a series in it. Because it has a series in it. But life is hard sometimes, right? And that's the way it is. And the limiting space is going to look like this. It also looks horrible. But we had to incorporate the concentration compactness somehow into the space. And this is what we get. This is the gamma convergence result. It's pretty long. I'm going to save you time reading that. It's just essentially the same thing as the gamma convergence, right? You have epsilon going to zero. You have epsilon going to zero, then you get a subsequence that converges to something in the limited space, and then the splitting right here. Components are getting far away from one another, and then we have this lower bound. And then, given a configuration in the limiting space, you can find a sequence that is going to converge to it, up to sub-sequence, up to translations and all that stuff, and then the upper pair. Stuff and then the upper bank. And there are some consequences of the gamma convergence result regarding minimizers in the interest of time because I think I have about how long do you have that? 20 minutes. Oh, okay. Now I have time, so I can still bother you with some more results. There are some consequences of the liquid of the gamma convergence result in regards to minimizers of the liquid drop on the TF gamma functional. For that, I'm going to talk about generalized, the concept of a generalized minimizer. Okay, so here we have a generalized minimizer of, and this is the liquid drop model, it's a finite set so that each of those functions has a minimizer. Has a mass that adds up to m. Each of the functions attains the minimum of this is the liquid drop model, and this is the liquid drop model without any potential at all. And then the energy can be split into this way. Now, if we take an epsilon that goes to zero, and a sequence of epsilons that goes to zero, for which the infinimum of the epsilon problem is attained, and this is the And this is the one for the TNDW problem, then there exists a sub-sequence and a generalized minimizer, the sequence converges to, and then we have this equal. And then another result we can talk about based on the gamma convergence result that has to do with minimizers is that if we take an M that doesn't go too far from Z. That doesn't go too far from z. And if the epsilon problem is solvable and the inferior is attained at a certain function, don't worry about this notation. This means that this isn't a positive, this is a positive function. The functional is unvariant when you change the function. u minus u, that doesn't really matter, so we just restrict ourselves to positive functions where it is non-negative. Then we have convergence to the set, the characteristic set on a ball. Characteristic set on a ball. This characteristic set in a ball comes up because minimizers of the liquid drop problem, remember, are balls. And that doesn't change when we work with the background potential V. And then when M goes a little bit beyond Z, then we can actually construct a sequence of minimizers of the TFDW model that is going to converge to the ball. Is going to converge to the ball that is the minimizer of the Liquid model. And we don't really get the mass exactly equal to m for this sequence of minimizers of epsilon problems, but that's an open problem that we have. This is the end of my thesis. So some problems that are still open, and I have worked very hard on them, but I just don't know what to do with it. Them, but I just don't know what to do with it. Is how to get that the Lagrange multiplier from Liola Lagrange equation associated with the problem is strictly negative. No? We have the splitting of many mising sequences. How are those masses characterized? We don't know. Given masses and functions, can we construct a sequence of minimizes of the regularized version of the problem? Minimizes of the regularized version of the problem. We don't know. So, there are lots of open things here. Okay, any questions so far? That's perfect. I hope some people are following you. And this is making a little bit of sense. Then I have a question. Yeah. You mentioned those numbers. You mentioned those numbers C1 and C2 or I forgot the names. I suppose they should be related to your computer. Are they related to the W? Yeah, for this, when we set this up, we choose C1 and C2 in a way that we get this particular equation. Ah, yes, they are. And that makes it really messy. I also forgot to mention that even though we have the splitting into many pieces and those pieces are moving infinitely away from the origin, they share something in common. Those pieces satisfy the same equation with the same With the same Lagrange multiplier. You mean in the limit? In the limit. Okay. I guess a follow-up question was the GRADU term had a different exponent in the two different theories and the side we were just looking at. FTW and liquid drop, right? From here to here, right? Yeah. So, how does one fancy the film? How does one family connect to the other? Right, that's a great question. So it turns out that it comes from trying to bound this, trying to play a little bit with this epsilon. So if you look at the Modicamoto paper, the connection is right there. Essentially, this term right here is going to be bounded by, like, you use the Boulder's inequality, you take this. Inequality, you take this norm squared. This norm is less than or equal to epsilon times the norm squared plus one over epsilon, and that's going to come from the Maudicomoto. I'm hoping I'm remembering, you know that very well, Peter. Please save me. Those first two terms in 3.1, you have to get an equipartition of energy there. And when the gallops out, that's basically a squared plus b squared is the. Basically A squared plus B squared is the same as 2AB. Thank you so much, Peter. This corresponds to the total variation of the function u. u is not necessarily a smooth function, it's just a BP function. So comparing that directly is not exactly the way to go. It's more like comparing this term right here, this whole thing with epsilon, with this. This whole thing turns into that. Whole thing turns into that. And then this remains the same, and this remains the same. Okay. Switching gears a little bit into a more material science kind of thing, because at this point you might be wondering, like, why are they even giving a talk here? I mean, they haven't talked about materials at all. There's the Adakawasaki model. The Adakawasaki model. The Ottawa How Island model is a model coming from material science. And here we have this model that has an interpretation. So I'm going to read a little bit just because I don't remember the interpretation by heart. The idea is that we have an open set omega and which is the domain occupied by the material. Epsilon is a parameter that is proportional to the thickness of the transitional regions between. Thickness of the transition regions between the two manomers. G is a Green's function, and the function U, the scalar, is a scalar order parameter. And this value M right here is the background charge density, which is prescribed. The function U is the difference between the average densities of the two monomers. So U takes values between minus one and one, and U. And one, and u equal to plus or minus one means that we have a concentration of a single monom. This is a model for material science. We're thinking of monomers, and in particular, we're thinking of two different phases. And there, I have, let me just look at the time. How much time do I have? 12 minutes. Oh, that's too much time. Okay. 12 minutes. Oh, that's enough. So I can tell you some more stories. So, okay. So, there I was. I finished my PhD. I did my PhD on the TFDW model. And I had studied the Arakawasaki model a little bit because I also wanted some publications on it, right? Why not? More publications is better. But then I started thinking: okay, what should I do with my knowledge on the T of the double model in conjunction with? In conjunction with the Atakawasaki model. And I started wondering: okay, the Atakawasaki model is set on a bounded set. Is there an Atakawasaki model set in a space? First thing I thought about. Does that even make sense? Well, at that point, I didn't care. I just wanted a publication. So I'm going to ask you if that's going to make sense, right? But I understand. But I understand that when you try to think about materials and you zoom in and in and in and in, you kind of get your space stretched. So maybe thinking of a model on the whole space is not such a bad idea. Right? Making a little bit of sense? Good. So I started thinking, okay, how should I can we think of an Arakawasaki model setting the space? Kawasaki model set in the space? How would such a thing look like? Well, here is my model. So finally, at this point of the presentation, I get to show you what I'm going to, what the title was about. This is my proposition of an Arakawasaki model set in the space. So here we have a minimization problem. There should be an infimum here. I'm sorry about the typo, but it's not really a typo. Typo, but it's not really a typo, it's a mistake. So, there should be an infirmum right there. We are minimizing this energy right here. So, here you have some things in common with the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac and Weissenker model. Here is a background potential, here is a non-local term, and here is a non-linearity. That was the same one that I showed you with the Ada Kawasaki model. By the way, I didn't tell you a lot about the Ada Kawasaki model, other than that was the model. Other than that, was the model. There are many misers all the time, no matter what m is, because we're setting a bounded domain. So that's really simple. Okay? So I started thinking of this problem and I started thinking, okay, how can I justify adding this term, this term, this term, this term? Well, this kind of looks like a combination of the Tiavidawi model and the Arakawazaki model. This term is very important. This term is very important, this background potential, because if I remove it, this function becomes the zero function. So this term right here is very important, and I get a competition of terms. It turns out that there is a competition right here. And let me tell you about what I found out about that model. So that's going to be my next publication. I hope we have submitted the work. We're just waiting to hear from the people that are checking. The people that are checking on it. Okay. There are some properties of that functional as a function. We can say that that function is negative, non-increasing, and continuous. That was the same with the TFD-Dalby model. We have coercivity, so minimizing sequences are bounded in the corresponding space. We don't have an Euler-Lagrange equation because we have an obstacle problem. So we lost that. Lost that. That's a big problem because obstacle problems are hard. They are harder, I guess. I think at this, it's been harder for me to work with it than with the TAV-DABI model. But we do have a sub-additivity condition. We have by using a concentration compactness method that all minimizing sequences converge if and only if this sub-additivity with strict inequality holds. And this model is somewhat closer to the TF-DA. Somewhat closer to the TF-DAVI model and the TF-DAVI model, which are approximation theories that were developed before the TF-D-DAVI model. The TF-D-DAVI model comes from improving a lot of stuff from the Thaumas-Fermi model and Thaumas-Fermi-bound bicycle model. In regards to existence of many misers, we get existence up to Z and maybe a little bit more than Z, and we get non-existence of many misers. We get non-existence of many misers for masses that are large enough. And in terms of asymptotics, we get this behavior near m equals zero. We don't know a lot about the Arakawasaki model set up in space other than exist and non-existence and then the behavior near n equal to zero. Near m equal to zero. We don't know what happens with the existence of minimizers between when the existence we got is and where the non-existence starts, just as with the TMDW model and with the liquid drop model. We don't know a lot of qualitative information about the minimizers. We don't know if asking for u greater than or equal to zero is very important. And we don't have numerics at all. So I need help. So I need help. Clearly, I do. So, okay, so this is the conclusions. I've told you about a model that is the Ada Kawasaki model set on the space. Before getting to talk about the Ada Kawasaki model, I told you about the TFDW model and the Arakawasaki model. Those are mass-constraint problems that are non- Mass constraint problems that are non-local, non-trivial. We have for the TFDW and auto-caworp type model, compactness may be lost due to splitting. Vanishing doesn't happen. For the TFD-W model, convergence of splitting into finitely many minimizers to subproblems was something I showed you. There is one centered at the origin with mass at least Z, and the others are moving infinitely far away. For the TMVW model, it is possible to look. The TFD-W model, it is possible to localize pieces if the minimizing sequence comes from regularizing the TFD-W model. There is gamma convergence of the TFD-W model to the liquid drop model with background potential. So there is an analytic relationship between the TFD-W model and the liquid drop model. That's very important. Also, the Auto-Kawasaki type model is simpler in structure because the energy at infinity is just zero. Zero, but the proofs are not so easy for some reason, and that's why we're getting a publication on it. But the autocarzacy model, the energy is strictly decreasing and eventually becomes constant. I didn't tell you that. I should have told you that. It is strictly decreasing and then it becomes constant. For the auto-causacity type model, the income limit is attained for n less equal to z for sure, maybe a little bit beyond, we don't know. And not attained for large masses, not sure what happens in the middle. Open questions. In the middle, open questions, and we have the asymptotics of the Adakawasaki type model when M approaches you. I appreciate your attention. I try to cover everybody's language here. So, thank you, Melxin, gracias, salamat. It's possible. Next one is Hori. Yeah, for you. Okay, graci. Gracias. Graphics. We have time for a couple questions. So I'll ask the first. So if we go back to the OK model, the original one or the original. Right, so you showed us this, yeah, this picture of a dibloxyl polymerase. Of a diblockopolymer system. Well, this is a hard question because it's about material science. Correct. So I mostly understand the connection between the equation and the picture. And then we go to your modified version of this model. So I didn't follow what, if any, physical system this models, and also what why. Why adding terms is helpful in going from a bounded domain to R3? Right. The answer to your first question is: I have no idea there is physical significance. Okay. And I would open the question to all of you, is there physical significance? I don't know. As a mathematician, I tend to not care about certain things, but I actually care about the significance because that could make my paper better. Well, not my paper, our paper bitter. So, yeah, I just have to be honest. I have no idea about how sensible this thing is for something actually real, real, right? Now, regarding adding terms to the energy, as I was saying, having this term right here is very important because if this term is not here, then this energy is just zero. Having this contrast between the attractive term and the dispersive one is very important because that adds to the complications of modalizing this problem. And we already had that constant contrast in the TMV-DAMI model. And this comes from the kind of TMV-DAU model kind of structure. Okay. Any other questions? Let's thank our speaker again. We'll be back here in two hours, right, for the student talks. I'm going down to the right. No, I'm just saying. So that's what she said.
