And uh this is uh based on uh several jobs for during my uh supervisor Professor Ricku Poff. This is uh online. Uh so I will first introduce the Manuel fielding equation, especially work with low regularity temperature and multiplicity, and then I will focus on two kinds of market methods, first is the cap streaming method and then uh the international integrators and the international integrators and the special idea I will first I will show the I read this for the first order tangential integrator then I will extend this I ran this to a recently proposed explicit and inaccurate actual integration and finally we'll start moving uh okay uh here we've uh considered the boundary cognitive fielding equation of the power so we construct all the boundary conditions uh here size a complex biofuel Uh here size a complex value wave function uh with uh real value natural and the infinite is time independent. And uh here the non-marriage takes the formal non-marriage and here f is uh also real value and it's a function in terms of the density. And if we all know that the non-shot equation conserves both mass and uh energy compass the scale of uh two mouse energy defined uh the way it is. And that may be stressed during the time evolution. And but here we are focused on the case that the potential and the nonlinearity may be of low regularity. So here I will basically we will work on the assumptions that the potential is only assumed to be at infinity. So we cannot take any derivatives of it. And then the non-linearity, here we consider the typical example that this power may be non-integer. So, but it can. So but it can, all the results can be generalized to some narrative that is locally admitted. So also this kind of summary for the artist, I think almost the weight is done to ensure the well-crossedness of the original keys. Okay, here I want to introduce some applications of this kind of low-rank large analogy. So I will start with the So I will start with the low regularity linearity because I think it's not that this application is not very well known to market. So the first application is in the so-called Vipolyau traction of the Nuclear energy and in this case the non-narrative takes the form in 1D and 3D. The power N is D over 2. So it is not integer. So it is not integer, so the regularity of the non-deal here is limited. And in QD, there's a logarithmic function here. So also it can be built as close to the top of one item. So it's still of limited regularity. And also, and here I saw an experimental result that this is the result about content droplets and my type of And my type of model to describe this photo drop that is GTE with this kind of people. And here we can see that in the middle part, this kinetic can remain, actually there is no external potential here. So the kinetic still remains self-bounded after a long time without like here it expands like gas or here it drops. So this is called uh like a literal drawdown, so it's called permanent drawbacks. So it's called Polymer drawdown. And another application from like the shifting of portion of Xabar model P of the non-element takes a power one over T. P is a spatial dimension. So in 2D and 3D again, it's all even lower, the power is even smaller than in the fraction. And then for the another modeling magnet, here's model for the first Fermi mixture, here the also the non-integer problem. For low-right potential, I think this example is more well-known, like in quantum mechanics, this kind of discontinuous function. Or in some applications, the potential is also some kind of integer power law function. Or example even more simple is the so-called random tangent. But here we deal with random potential, you have deterministic ways, so not So it's not the potential to be infinite without dealing with extra parts of P. Here are some existing numerical methods for this, for the rate, for the cubic laminar shielding equation with small temperature. So first it's actually how to prepare this page by very carefully because actually most of his works in the literature are done by In the literature, are found by participants of this workforce. So, first is the final different method and also time splitting method, the utensil of the metals, and also some the recent proposed low regularity methods. Here, at the PD level, so under the low right direct sampling of tension and higherity, here the there is still well posted in H2. So, let's Will posted in F2. So that means if we have initial data in F2, the solution will remain in H2 for some time. So that means we can still work with F2 solution. We don't need to go in feed into lower FLAC provide a lot of math. We don't need to HS, which is less than one, DOO2. But here but we have to deal with the low-regularity for the potential, so we lift Tangular than linearity. So in this case, although the bilinear estimates like for actually estimates that's greater than u or the bilinear estimates still hold, but the low radarity of length and the non-linearity prevents us from deriving aero ethnics in some child or so technology. And this makes the many classical aero math techniques for aero ethnics failed. And here I here I also want to mention that Yeah, I also want to mention that for all of these results, I think only one is the paper by Professor Penny and Professor Kibson that you did grab some convergence order for infinity. And later I will focus on this some three methods and central integration. But before I before go to the error administration, I want to show an example that if the center like that if the tanger like is taken as a square web tanger, then there is indeed some numerical issues in the use of the time splitting method. If we don't have any uh knowledge of the behavior of the screening method and historic regularity setting, then there will be some so yeah uh we can say uh initial we take a smooth initial We take a smooth initial data, but when we use strong speaking, and when there is discontinuity of the potential, then we see that the energy here. So the energy is supposed to be conserved or to be approximately conserved, but when the loss of discontinuity of the potential, we see that there is a numerical smoothie. The energy of the numerical switching, the error is very large. So this means this is So, this means this is looking totally incorrect. So, there are indeed some issues in the implementation of the classical method when the potential anonymities of low regularities. And so, we start with the time splitting method, and I think it has been introduced many times yesterday, so I just very briefly provided. So, here we use a standard splitting, like we split the uh free fielding part. Free fielding part and the change of linearity into two parts. For the free fielding equation, it can be solved exactly in phase space. For this part, it can be solved also exactly due to that the module of this wave function is conserved due to this sub-probe. And by different combinations of these two steps, we have first-order detrital splitting or second-order strong splitting. And for the splitting method, under the smooth setting, But under the smooth setting, it means if we consider cubic non-linearity, smooth tangential, and then the convergence order, the convergence order of the green method is understood very well. I think the first error method is proved by Professor Ruby, and he proved the second order convergence of the strong splutting. And uh in this paper the convergence order is generalized to some fractional order, but the splutting still needs to be first. They only need to be more regular than H2. And the data by progress of the convoyance order can be shown for initial data, for any initial data in HK for K greater than 0. And also got some work in hell dimensions and for fully discrete strings. But here, but the pleasure and opportunity is of low regularity. Regularity, we can still obtain the same local structure of the controller splitting, and I think this is also the boring since the work by Professor Jung and Professor Lupin. And here we can expand the exact squuji into this form and with a remainder of order tau square, but it also requires some regularity of the this. Gravity of this derivative of the potential and the nonlinearity here. But this can be founded like in L2. The nonlinearity is those three VGs and the potential is in L infinite. So this time is not introduced by any programs here. And for the numerical solution, we can also expand it by Taylor expansion here with a remainder term of all the cos square and the recommended. For square, and the regularity requirements is only on the operator B, which is here, and this one is also good. But the problem happens when the arrow here. Here, the arrow takes the form of a commutator. And in the commutator, we say that if we want to bound the commutator in L2, we require that V is in H2, the solution is in H2. the solution is in H2 and the nonlinearity or the composition of the nonlinearity this nonlinearity we need it to be h2 so we roughly we require the non-linearity to be twice differentiable and so from this result it seems uh the speed method cannot deal with either low regularity potential or low regularity linearity so the other first step uh we only consider the low regularity linearity here and we Here, and we it seems impossible to derive first-order error bits, so we first derive a fractional order error estimates for the speed answer to find the non-paradise from the current. But to obtain this result, there's a feature that we don't have any, if we can only do error estimates in L2 mode, then we have no control of the numerical solution. We don't have L infinity control. We don't have L infinity control of the entire weekly, so then we cannot control the constant in the stability estimates. But here there is an important observation that when sigma is small, we can obtain a stability estimate with a constant here depend on the minimum of the infinity amount of V and W. And this means if you just, the dependence, it takes this form of a minimum. Dependence, it takes this form of a minimum. Then, usually in the average attributes, one sphere we is associated to the exact split gene, W is associated to the numerical squares. Then, we always have control of the exact switching because we can assume that it's initial two and it will prove that the Pd level. So, this means this constant is under control without any control of the numerical switching. So, it looks like an unconditional severity. Sir, can I ask the why it's minimal instead of maximal? Uh yeah, so I say this so this is uh a very tricky argument. So uh so this happens when sigma is small. And if you do some, like you just carry out the calculation, you will find that uh why so this means uh so uh if you take like take a derivative here, there will be something about like minus one and you will in the di in uh in the and you got in the in the denominator in the denominator you only agree you agree you have maximum of something one over something and in the denominator there's a it will be minimum you have maximum of one over something which is one over the minimum of two so there is a minimum in the denominator and uh but also some symmetry property another minimum we are cutting the denominator Nominator and it cancels finally that's a minimum. I think this argument is I don't prepare the detail of this calculation. But this happened only when sigma is less than one half. When sigma is greater than one half, we no longer have this unconditional stability. But when sigma is only greater than one half, now it is still. The non-narratives there are remains low regularity. So, at this case, to control the matrix region, for example, the R-infinity norm, the matrix routine, they use emotion inequality, so we have to go into a fully discrete case. And in this case, if we use emotion quality, we have to introduce some coupling condition between the time set and match set. But this is quite weak, and it only will only meet this me dimension two and three. Dimitri 2 and 3. Here, now we here are two numerical examples. So the left is the convergence, the arrow in L2 now. So in our error estimates, we our error estimates predict that the sensor order reduction by sigma is better than 1 half. But in our numerical experiments, we see that there is a variety of first-order convergence, even when sigma is only 0.1. Maxima is 0.80.1. So it seems our error at this is not optimal. But I have to say this result cannot be obtained by standard error at because in this case, if we estimate the local error, it is never optimal. So in general, if we want first order convergence, global error is first order, we need second order. Is first order, we need second order local error, then we use discrete one in positive to obtain local error. But in this case, if you just estimate the local error, it is the local error is never optimal. It cannot be second one. So then to obtain this global first order error estimate, we need to use some different techniques. And also this means there is cancellation during the propagation of the local errors. So the global error is like the source, some kind of mapping. Some kind of summation of local errors, but in this summation, there is cancellation. So, in order to prove this first order conversion, you must be able to estimate this kind of cancellation. And so, actually, we inspired by the idea of regular computational observation. Yesterday we were doing that in the estimate uh in the analysis of long time dynamics. Analysis of long-time dynamics. Here we have we are able to estimate this error concentration. And here we write the error equation here. And if we iterate it, like this is a one-step error equation. If we iterate it, we see that the local error contributes to the global error in this way. So the local error at the case step contribute to the global error. To the global error, by here, we need to act a reference group. And there is cancellation in this summation. So here we use a summation by path argument to estimate this summation term. And by using summation by path, we first sum the this free filling of room, like this way. It's like a geometrics. Geometric series, and if we use the summation function for it, we use the summation formula for it, we found that there is in the denominator there is something like one minute or minus I call the project. And here we found that if we require some times by size restriction, which means we can afford this transition, we assume that the most has already been truncated, so the La Tachi is a bounded operator than square. So we assume that the top La Dajing is small. We can approximate this denominator by total. Approximate this denominator by total touching. So here we see that there's a lot touching in the denominator, and the fact that this lattice in the denominator will transfer the lataching in the local error. And by doing this analysis, we obtain improved error bounds. And actually, the I the final idea is that originally in the in the commutative term, we need to bound the partial of this central function and the non-minority, but Standard function and the non-linearity, but by doing this kind of analysis subject to the time stat that we exping, this Laparachi can be replaced by the partial T. So first, the Laparachin is the second order differential operator, partial T is the first order. So we reduce the regularity requirement on the dominant band one order. And another thing is that the standard function is assumed to become independent. So originally it will require two trace refrangible Trust refrainable of the potential, but here, if we take time derivative, there is no requirement of the potential. So now we can attempt first-order collisions at the fluid influx level for this infinity potential and the local influence of linearity. But we need to impose this time-step and restriction. And here, in our numerical experiments, we can clearly observe this restriction, which means here the Which means here the markers are put out of place roughly at all equal to h squared over time. So we see that if the time size restriction is not satisfied, weight means the red part of this arc and there is all the reduction the matter for the edge. But when the time set is satisfied, which is the left part of each bar curve, we can observe very clear first-order convergence. So this means this time set. So this means this time subset restriction is necessary and optimal. It cannot be removed. It cannot be improved. Okay, so this is for time-speed method. And then later we consider the extension integrator because after the the analysis for time-speed method we we think that it seems the extension integr integrator may be a better choice on the this more regularity setting. So we first consider the first order intangible integrator, which is also called the expansion or string in the liquid field. We just, the exact routine, use the family formula to extend the exact routine and we approximate this. We only approximate the function size here, without approximate the intentional function. And when you integrate this intentional function, exactly without tension side. We are tensor 514. So, for this scheme, first we look at the local error, it is automatically only requires first of the time derivative of the tangential linearity here. But to obtain global error, we still need some control of the micro solution. And this is to do this, we need to, we cannot only work in the L2 setting, we need to obtain the hell of the. We need to obtain the hell order estimates. But for the differential equator, it is possible because first we can obtain this kind of local error in alpha norm for alpha greater than 0 and 2. And also for the stability estimates here, we can obtain some coupled stability estimates. Which means here, the non-RTL detection of the operator B is not in ideal traffic, but this five-month function can increase the recognition. Five-man function can increase the regularity by two orders. So we can still obtain the stability estimates in this high-order solid spaces. And by combining these two and following a coupled induction argument, we can obtain this global error estimates. And in particular, here we can obtain uniform H2 control, the micro solution. Here, our environmental solution is only H2, and we can also obtain uniform H2 button of the normal. Tell you from the attributable but not the numerical solution in this case. And this is for the semi-discrete case. We can easily generalize the error admin to fully discrete case without any proper condition between the time step and the match size. And here is the result. I use the same tangible function as for the split method and here, and use a very small mesh side. We can see our first order convergence in your two-month method. First order convergence in a two-norm and half-order convergence in a tri-mode, which confirms our estimate. And however, for this first integrator, in a smooth setting, I think no one will use this to solve the Matrix Scholarly equation because it does not preserve any structure. Like, it is not mass conservative, it is not energy conservative, it's not time-symmetric. It's not time symmetric, it nearly does not conserve any property of the original equation. So then we try to extend, we try to design some new typical integrators that can preserve some of these properties. So this is a recent work. We propose an implicit and symmetric integral operator. And here, the idea is that we still start with this to have a formula. With this to Hammer's formula, and with the first step, is we multiply this three shooting group to the left of this equation, and we take the 10 steps forward and backward. So we take this literally to be plus minus top, and we substitute one from another, we obtain this equation. Then, in the approximation of this integral, we use some, it's like an expansion mid-point to approximate this integral. Midpoint to process this integral and we obtain this scheme. And for this scheme, it has properties that first it is implicit. But it's a two-step method. It's also one-step. Here we have n plus one and minus one. And this is symmetric. So if we exchange n plus one and n minus one and replace top by minus. And reflex torque and male torture, the scheme remains unchanged. So it is time symmetric. Also, another very important property is that this two-step method is unconditionally linearly stable. But this means the stability condition is independent of the match set, but we still need some smallness of the time step in terms of the potential and the non-linearity to ensure the stability. But this panel is This pattern is independent of the mesh size. So because it's almost unconditionally stable. And for the first step, we have several choices. So in the smooth setting, if we want to ensure the time symmetry of the first step, we can use the stress muting to compute the first step. But a low-regulated setting, it seems the first-order EWI is a better, more suitable choice. But also, if you think the first But also if you think the first step is not good enough, we can use some smaller time steps to compute the first step more accurate. And here we obtain the similar error estimates for this screen. Here is the second order converting, the first order converging, and this one is the same as the first order technical integrator. And also we can pay the Azure technique with some modification to obtain this improvement. Modification to obtain this improved here. The improvement I think that we can further weaken the regularity requirement on the non-linearity. And here I showed the benefit of being time symmetric. This is we can get this neural conservation, long-term neural conservation of mass and energy. So the left here is the mass. We compute it from 2.0 to 2.500, and we say that even in this variable, And we say that even in this very low regularity setting, the mass is nearly conserved, the energy is nearly conserved. And actually, we can observe that the sense that this mass energy converges at an order of tau squared, even for this low regulatory, very low regulatory tensile. But here, we still don't know how to rigorously analyze this. And here I show some comparison, long-term comparison with other things like the first of. Other things that the first of the kind of emergency the strong splitting with different kinds of time facts. So this one means the time step restriction is not satisfied. This one means it is satisfied. But in either case, the SWI is the best one. And here we see that if the temp star is restricting and not satisfied the energy of the strong spleen, actually the relative energy is like immediately goes to Immediately goes to beyond the 10. So, this means the switching is totally incorrect. Okay, and also here is another test problem which is posed from the paper by Professor Spenny. And here is the interaction of two solutions. And here, even for the smooth problem, actually, our symmetric interaction is curved. Actually, I cannot say it can beat the extra speed in a smooth setting, but it still still has advantages under certain circumstances. Okay, and here is a conclusion for the error elements of different methods. So, and here we can see that the symmetric W has the most regularity requirement on both tension and non-linearity, and also it is structured regularly. And finally is the implementation each. So in all the previous error estimates, we use Fourier spectrum method with space. But in practice, if you use Fourier spectrum method, we need to compute the projection of this kind of term, like weight times function. But here is the projection, so we need to compute exactly the Fourier configuration. That's just used as. Coefficient that of you just use FFT, which is the interpolation approximation of this term. Usually, in a smooth setting, the error of this term is very small, but here, if we is like only of infinity, the interpolation and the projecting of this term has a very large error, and actually the spatial error of the Fourier pseudo-spectrum method is the spatial convergence is very low. So, we have to use the Fourier spectrum method to obtain optimal spatial convergence, but the implementation. Organs, but the implementation is easier. So, here we propose a way to compute this term very efficiently by using FFT. So, here we make the observation that the projection of this product terms is equal to, we can truncate the potential function to QN frequency. And these two are exactly the same. Then, if we truncate the potential function, then both this phi and this. And this P2 finite frequency, the product of them is at most 3n frequency. Then we can use the 3n interpolation operator, which also produces the exact result here. And then we compute this interpolated function, and we can, which means for this part, we only pre-compute this P2LV and then we just use FFT for an expand. FFT for an extended match, we can obtain this regard for different. Okay, that's the conclusion. So we obtain error methods for time-free method, first some fractional atoms, then we improve it to optimal. And we also obtain optimal error bonds for the potential indicators. And here we have some future modes to deal with other dispersive equations or single data and the non-linearity. Narrative and the volatility. I think we can also talk more about this symmetric extremist symmetric scheme. Okay, thank you. So, questions? Marks? I mean, the obvious question, does the sign of the nonlinearity play a role? Um our analysis it doesn't matter so Mass it doesn't matter, so as a positive or negative result. So for your second order scheme, you start from the first order to update for the first step. So you need to use a small time step or? No. So only for the converted order, for the first step, the first order method is enough. Because we only use the first order method. Uh if we only use the first order method for the first step, it will not uh influence the global hybrid to be second order. But uh for the first uh here, the completion of the first step here uh so if you want to ensure the better symmetry of the first step, so you if you use the first order data, the first step is not symmetric. But if you want to ensure better symmetry of the first step, you can use smaller constants to compute the filter. Kind of stuff to compute a few times to obtain the first step.
