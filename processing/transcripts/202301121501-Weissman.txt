Schedule arrangement at the last minute. I'm going to talk about some stuff that's actually kind of related to some of the things we talked about today. But the part of the reason why I was supposed to go on the last day is because I gave a very similar talk at the Mexico Burrs very recently. So I added a little bit of extra stuff to make this more distinct. Make this more distinct. So, this is going to set the stage a little bit. Simple question that's going to be a bit of a background for the SARS-CoV-2. I have a simple question: how many viruses start into infection? It's often called the transmission bottleneck. It's just a simple counting question, nothing to do with evolution, but counting is hard because viruses are really small. You can't see them. Genetic sequencing is much easier. So maybe we can use genetic sequencing to count the viruses. To count the viruses. Okay, so I'm going to talk about a very simple method that I came up with with Katia Cola, and then we improved on it a little bit with Chris Illingworth. But mostly I'm going to talk about stuff that other people have done mostly since, particularly Adam Loring, Catherine Schway, Jesse Bloom, and then Mike Martin and Katya applying our method. Our method. The really basic idea is that we can just estimate the number of viruses that were transmitted from one host to the other by the change in the frequencies of any variants from the donor host to the recipient host. So if we've got a pair of individuals, the donor, someone who's originally infected, who we sequence, and the recipient, someone that they infected, who we sequence also. Who we sequence also, we can look and see: okay, across the whole genome, all the polymorphisms in the donor, what were their allele frequencies? And then look, hey, are any of those present in the recipient as well? And if so, what are their frequencies? And if the two frequencies match perfectly, then we must have had a really good survey of that initial viral. Of that initial viral diversity, we must have had a huge transmission bottleneck. And if they have nothing to do with each other, then a very tight transmission bottleneck or a noisy server. And you can do math on it. It's very simple. There's really no more to it than that. Okay, so what do we see? When people apply this method to both flu and SARS-CoV-2, it's very noisy. There's nothing close. There's nothing close to the line. So it looks, you know, it's really nothing close to the line. In fact, everything is piled up on the edges, which says that it's really just a single variant that is responsible for founding the new infection, as far as we can tell. With a caveat that when we originally tried this, we tried it on some messed up sequencing data, and we got a really wrong number. We got a huge bottle there. Okay, so you got to really watch out. And then the first time someone tried to apply Someone tried to apply it to SARS-CoV-2, they also got a huge number because they're like, look, perfect transmission. Not paying attention to the fact that these are super low frequencies that they're looking at. And then if you zoomed out and looked at the whole thing, you know, they're stuck at the edge. Doesn't really make sense. So this is just your few percent sequencing error. And surprise, surprise, you run on the same sequencer, you get the same errors at the same frequencies in your original batch in the next batch. So you've got to watch out for that too. Out for that, too. Oh, please, yeah. Do you just look at neutral mutations, non-revisitations? Because otherwise, I guess there might be some effects of. There might be, there might be. I mean, in practice, it hasn't been an issue. But yeah, if you restrict us, I mean, you get you get one whether it's synonymous or not synonymous. There's just nothing there. Do you sample from sites, likely sites where transmission occurs from? Transmission occurs from? Like, yeah, the nose, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. So, I mean, one natural question is: like, yeah, wait a second, maybe you just did the swab differently. I mean, how much noise do you expect here? Actually, I should have shown this data. So, the macronadol study is nice because some of these patients with flu, they do the same patient multiple days. And there you see something that's a finite bottleneck. You see, it's a bottleneck of about. You see, it's a bottleneck of about 30, 50 over the bottleneck. So, effective population size within hoax of 30, 50. Still a very small number, but nothing like this. Plenty of continuous allele frequency, intermediate frequencies. So that gives us some confidence that this is not all just some noise in the sampling process. This is actual noise in the transmission process. Okay, so one variant. What does that imply? Okay, so we were very disappointed because we were hoping that if there were transmitted minor variants, you could do like contact tracing just from sequencing. Each transmission chain would have its own fingerprint. We have a preprint up that argues that this also implies that this idea of variation is probably unlikely. Is probably unlikely. This idea that just being exposed to a very small dose means that, oh, maybe you'll just get a mild illness. Because, you know, as far as we can tell, all the severe illnesses descend from a single virion that infected the new host. So probably you have a, if you get infected with, if you get exposed to a very small dose, you probably have a much lower chance of getting sick at all. Probably your immune system will handle everything. You'll never even notice it. No viruses will make it in. Make it in. But then, you know, conditional on infection, I am skeptical of the idea of whether your case is much more likely to be mild. But I just refer you to that to read more. And then setting the stage for the rest of the talk, this should make it somewhat harder for the virus to adapt because almost all the lessons it learns within a single host get thrown away. Within a single host, get thrown away and unlearned by the noise in the transmission process. Question? So now it's the stuff that I talked about a month ago. But I tried to make it a little bit clearer this time. Okay, so the motivation for this was that we, I and my former student, Mahan, now at Oxford, were We're getting troubled by the pattern of VOC emergence. That you had this long waiting time at the beginning of the pandemic where there was almost no adaptation, just D614G. And then, you know, boom, boom, boom, three VOCs in a row. And on top of that, as a Andy. As Angela pointed out on the first day, they all had tons of mutations, many of them shared across the VOCs, that were not circulating in the population before. So out of nowhere, we get these aliens coming in and taking over. And I really didn't want to work on COVID because I felt like everyone was doing it. I'm not very fast, so I figured someone else would do it before, but no one was doing anything. And then on it, And then Ani Kupchak, who a lot of you know, asked us to submit to a special edition she was doing on predicting bioreevolution. I was like, okay, fine, we'll do this. So what we want to do is find some model that can actually match that. One possible factor that we wanted to include in our model was chronic infections. This was motivated by the fact that we saw these really tight transmission bottlenecks, and that suggested to us that us that the advocation by acute infections should be kind of blocked by these frequent collapses in genetic diversity. And it was also moved by the fact that people have seen some of the same mutations that were in the VOCs in other chronic infections. Another possible factor, we wanted to include fitness landscapes, both because that's just kind of our background, but also because But also because there was some experimental evidence that there were some interesting interactions among the VOC mutations. And basically, what we wanted to kind of contrast was, was it straight uphill, each mutation building on the rest, just contributing roughly additively to the increase in transmissibility? Or was there something where there's kind of a plateau where maybe they helped a little bit at first, but really you needed But really, you needed some, like, a larger combination of them to get a substantial advantage. Oh, sorry, yeah, VLC is variant of concern. I'm sorry. Yeah, alpha, beta, and gamma, and then delta and omega. Okay, so what are going to be the kind of key ingredients that we're going to try and fit? All right. We want three VLCs by March 2020. By March 2021. All right? We want to match this long waiting time for the first DOC. Let me write it in. I want to match this long waiting time. And then we want to match the time window in which we see all three. So three numbers. And then we also want something consistent. Something consistent with the mutation picture where there's a bunch of mutations and none of them show up earlier at high frequency in the population. So that's it. Not a ton of features that we're trying to match here. All right, what should go into the model? Okay, clearly population size. So at the for acute infections, we can estimate those from deaths. Those from deaths. How many of those are chronic? Who knows? That's going to have to be a model parameter that we'll estimate. The advantage of the VLCs, that you can fit to data, no problem. Mutation rate, very roughly, it's known, but not all of these mutations are point mutations. And do you need transversions? Or transitions? Okay. All right. So there's some whim. Okay, all right, so there's some waver room there. We're gonna have to explore some values there, but rough estimate we know. Daniel, sorry, can you talk about the generation here? Is that a cell infection cycle or is that an infected host? Infected host. Yeah. Okay. Weirdly, really not that different. Yeah. The actually wait, oh, is it 10 to the minus 5? I believe that is. Oh man, I may have that wrong. I know in our model it's generation, but when I wrote the slide I may have put the wrong number on it. I'd need to double check. I was just wondering more about your definition of generation than the exact number. Like if it's generation in any phenomenology? In the model it's one infection, like one person's acute infection. So five days. But that number looks like it's for a single cycle, right? So I may have used the wrong definition of generation. I may have used the wrong definition of generation on the slide. Yeah, thank you. I'll double-check that. And then we just heard Oscar talk about this big unknown, how much stochasticity is there in transmission, which reduces our effective population size. He said, if you look at the people who measure kind of direct super spreading, they'll say it's not so bad. So bad. If you look at his estimates from allele frequencies, it's quite extreme. So, we're going to have to explore a wide range of values there as well. And we parametrized it by this reduction in effective population size. So, if k is small, that means there's a lot of stochasticity. Effective population size is way lower than census size. Okay, so those are kind of our minimal ingredients that we need. This one is like a nuisance parameter that gets in the way of estimating these things that we really care about. Things that we really care about, where chronic infections are important, and what's the fitness landscape. All right, I'm going to run through a series of models here. The simplest one, we say no epistasis, no chronic infections, just vanilla. Then let's add in epistasis to the plateau. Then go back to no epistasis, but add in the chronic infections, and then put in both ingredients. And then put in both ingredients just to see what can match. Okay. Simplest of the simple would be to say, actually, there was just a secret single mutation out of all those that are seen in the chronic infections, in the VOCs, that was sufficient for the VOC phenotype. Unsurprisingly, that does not match the dynamics. These plots are kind of confusing, but what I'm going to show a bunch of times is I'm going to show a histogram over multiple simulation runs with different parameters. Multiple simulation runs with different parameters of how many VOC lineages we see. And what we want to see is three. So this is bad. This is way too many VOCs. This is a population where it's just a single mutation. Way too easy. This one, a little too few VOCs. You can see the difference as we've turned the super spreading way up, turned the stochasticity way up, driven our effective population size way down. Population size way down made adaptation harder. Okay, but if we tune it to the right value of stochasticity, we can get a nice peek at the observed value. Then we have to match the timing. So here, for every simulation running to the dot, we've got that first time, the waiting time for the first VOC, and we've got that spread between the first and the third VOCs. We've got T0, and we've got delta T. Delta t. And the numbers are not good. Most of them are off the plot. It's very hard to match the timing. Why? Because basically, either if we have a small mutation supply, and then, yeah, sure, you can match that long waiting time, but you can't get the clustering three at once, or three in quick succession. Or we can have a more We can have a more moderate mutation supply. Oops, that's supposed to be an NE there. A more moderate mutation supply. And then, yeah, you can get the clumping, you can get the clustering, but you can't get that long waiting time. They should have come up way too early. Oh, from earlier, but is the population size growing through this year? Yeah, but it actually, sorry. It does not matter. It absolutely matters. But if you look up here, it actually gets high really early. It actually gets high really early. So it's it's yes. So just the fact that there's not that many cases explains why there were no VOCs in March. But then even this waiting time causes problems. Just a sanity check. So if I was to model this three consecutive variants emerging, just assuming that they emerge at constant rate during this period of time, would that be inconsistent with your data? With your data? Yeah, that's almost exactly this model. We tried this kind of null model, and this is kind of null model. This is that null model up to this caveat that Christina just raised, which is that the rate is slightly non-constant because of the initial increase in population size. Yeah. So that's effectively what we have here. So no surprise, the simplest known model does not work. Okay, but yeah, exactly. It was just a sandy shape. So okay, slightly more seriously, let's say there's multiple. There's multiple mutations necessary. You know, that's what we believe based on the molecular evidence. How about now? Now, okay, yeah, again, here I'm going to show some plots that manipulate the number of necessary mutations, which I call big K. And here, when we say there's five necessary mutations or four necessary mutations, we can get peaks, you know, that are, or we can get substantial mass at the right number of. At the right number of VOCs. And some of these actually can do a reasonable job of getting the timing right as well. You notice actually the only one that we can get both the number of VLCs right and the timing right is k equals 4. So 4 mutations. Hey, no problem. But all right. But alright, here, I lied. We're going to look at one more statistic. What's the spread of those mutations ahead of time? And the problem is that you would have seen single mutants coming up super early in January or even maybe April. And then you'd see even double mutants coming up, maybe even triple mutants coming up. This is showing the frequencies of all those different intermediate mutants. And they should not have waited and then all come in together. And then all come in together. We should have seen them come in one at a time. So, this model cannot fit the data either. The fact that all the mutations appeared together. Okay, so let's add in the epistasis then. Let's say what if these mutations couldn't spread individually because they had no advantage individually, only when they worked together. Then we can match, you know, we can get a reasonable match. Match, you know, we can get a reasonable match. Some things have three VOCs, some simulations, and we can get, eh, it's not common that we get the timing right, but it's not crazy. You know, you can't rule it out. So maybe, but it really only works if you say there's no more than two mutations necessary. If you start saying it needs three mutations, like Sebastian was saying in our meeting, that not everyone was there. Meeting, but not everyone was there, it just can't work. It takes too long, it's too hard to find a triple combo. So you can't match the observed numbers of mutations, and even the timing is kind of iffy. Okay, so really, we don't get a good match for anything without chronic infections. Okay, so let's bring in the chronic infections. Okay, so. Okay, so chronic infections, but no epistasis, no plateau, straight uphill. We can get good match for total number of VOCs. We can do decently, you know, for timing. And remember, the problem with this model before was that those intermutant mutants started really spreading the population. Here, they kind of spread, but not too bad, 1% frequency. So that's. Frequency. So that's maybe, you know, that's troubling in the UK where they had very good sampling. You probably should have seen that. So I would call this one a borderline model. Maybe, but I'm not totally sold on it. So let's do it. Let's add in all the ingredients, put in the fitness plateau and the chronic infections. Yes, this is the most complicated model, but it matches everything. But it matches everything super easily. You can get a perfect peak at the right number of VOCs, you can get very high numbers in the right simulations in the right timing, and of course nothing spreads individually because it's a plateau. I don't think this is definitive by any means, but I think it's suggestive. Okay, so I think I Okay, so I think that our little piece of evidence, in addition to the other piece of evidence that people have marshalled in favor of chronic infections, makes me very confident that yes, the VOCs came from chronic infections. I think we can add that you need multiple mutations. I think that there's strong epistasis among them. That's a little bit more uncertain. I think that the same holds true for delta and omicron, even though I haven't shown. Even though I haven't modeled it here, the key thing is it would explain why they do not actually descend from the previous VOCs. It's particularly striking in the case of Omicron. Delta had taken over the entire world for months. Right? And yet, Omicron does not descend from Delta. Why? Because it was evolving inside a chronically infected patient that whole time, someone who got infected before even alpha had spread substantially. Substantially. I should emphasize, yeah, so in our models where we have the chronic infections, to explain the data, we need these VOCs to be evolving in the chronically infected patients for times on the order of that T0, on the order of six months, nine months, long time. This suggests maybe since all the VOCs so far came from chronic infections, we should be trying to catch these chronic infections. We should be trying to catch these chronic infections after like two or three months, you know, and treat the people really aggressively. Maybe we could shut down adaptation. I don't know. Maybe in the future it's not going to come from chronic infections, but worth a shot, I think. But there's a big puzzle, which I'm just going to touch on in the last couple minutes. Why would evolving in a chronically affected patient increase transmissibility? That is the one selection pressure you're definitely not exposed to, right? It doesn't make any sense. Right? It doesn't make any sense, which is why I was very skeptical of this at first. Okay, so let's actually look at a chronically infected patient. Here's someone who came into Emory, had COVID for about three months before dying of it. And here we were part of a very large team led by Aaron Scherer and MPN Todosi. In the initial analysis, In the initial analysis, and I'm going to talk about a follow-up that involves me and Katya and our student Brett, who is now a postdoc at UT. So here are our samples, the consensus genomes for our, oh, sorry, I should say. Here are the four times that the patient is sampled. Here are those consensus genomes on a tree of On a tree of all the circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Georgia at that time. And you can see they all clustered together nicely, suggesting: yes, this is a real chronic infection, no reinfection. No, it's not crazy. There were close relatives around in Georgia at the same time, but this was one single lineage, or one single population that persisted in this individual over this time. But if we look deeper than the consensus reads, we see that there's a lot of diversity in the patient. So here we're looking at different eye SNPs, different SNPs. On the right, over time, and you can see their frequencies go up and down. This is frequency on the y-axis. And on the left, over the genome, and you can see there's a big cluster of them in the Cluster of them in the spike gene, which is consistent with what you see in VOCs. And other people have seen also in chronology infected patients. Strikingly, some of these things go up and down. What's going on there? And also, okay, wait a second. All these polymorphic alleles that coexist cannot be independent. They have to live on genomes. How are they interacting? They are interacting. So we tried to put these into genomes. Oh, yeah, please. Sorry, I mentioned something right. You have four time planes from the remote samples of each of those time planes? It's one deep sequencing at each time point. And then this is, this is, and the day zero is phylogenetic influence. Sorry, yeah, the from what body say? All from all from nasopharyngeal. Yeah. Okay, and we find that we can explain all the allele frequency dynamics with no recombination if we build genomes in this way. This is a Mueller plot for those who are familiar with that. What we basically have here on the y-axis is like a representation of the whole population in a cartoon form, time on the x-axis, and the height of these different colored strips is supposed to. Colored strips is supposed to represent the frequency of a particular haplotype at that time. And yeah, this is all these events are mutations. No need for any recombination. And the molecular details I don't understand, so I'm not going to talk about them at all. But we didn't need any recombination, but what we did need were these reservoirs, hidden reservoirs. We see this haplotype. This haplotype is clearly. This haplotype is clearly the ancestor from the phylogenetics. And yet, in our first sample, oops, this day should be over here. Sorry, my bad. In the first sample, it's not there. Then in the future samples, we see it. So it was hiding out in that first sample somewhere else in the body, and then it reappeared with additional mutations. And then the stuff that we see in the first sample, And then the stuff that we see in the first sample disappears, it's gone, and then it comes back in the last sample. So it looks like these lineages are fighting out in the body, they're evolving as they hide out in reservoirs. Apparently, there are multiple reservoirs or multiple coexistence. And so this suggests that there's strong within-host spatial structure of the type that Allison was talking about. And if I Talking about. And if I can go really crazy with speculation here, to me, this suggests something possibly about selection and how it could be selected for increased transmission. Because if these things are maybe spatially structured, like living in one pocket of the lung, and then they have to kind of get breathed up into the upper airway and then settle down in another part of the lung. And then you have this constant process of them fighting it out by kind of. Process of them fighting it out by kind of like invasion dynamics this way. That looks kind of more like being transmitted to another person than just like pure cell-to-cell transmission. But okay, this is no evidence whatsoever, right? Just wild, wild speculation. Okay, so conclusions. The infections are founded by single variants. I think we're very quite confident about that. Chronic infections. Confident about that. Chronic infections, driving global adaptation, I think that also we can be very confident about. And we see both rapid adaptation and these multiple languages, diversity in chronic infections. I think the evidence on that one is quite strong as well. All right, thank you. I have a question about the the last two models you presented and in particular Two models you presented, and in particular, the proportion of chronic infection that you could infer. My first question is: Do you have similar results between the two models having a chronic infection as a scenario? And my second, is it a relevant number that you or a range of numbers that you get from so we only so the the tricky part there in that model is we can't really infer the frequency of croc infection. The frequency of chronic infection. All we can infer is the compound parameter: frequency of chronic infection times probability that a chronic infection will evolve into a VOC. So, you know, probably that second number is quite small. So, yeah, we get tiny numbers of chronic infections that evolve into VOCs. It's like three, right? It's a bit more. There'd be some that would have evolved into VLCs, but they got out-competed by alpha, beta, gamma. So, Mohan has followed up on this work, though, and using data from the U.S. And using data from the UK, I think he's finding several percent, maybe 5%, 10%, I've got it written down somewhere, of infections lasting for at least a month. It was quite high, actually. It must be 5%. I'll double-check that, though, and get back to you. I wondered about the spatial structure you mentioned in the last part. In the last part, and you talked about the lung, but how about just the nose? I mean, did you, for example, take different swabs from different places, and how much overlap was there in terms of the genotypes of the virus? We didn't try that. I mean, yeah, so we really don't know. All I can say, you know, in flu, that data, you know, there were swaps from different days were Swaps from different days were fairly consistent with each other. And those were done by the patients themselves, not nurses like these were. So you'd think that it would be more variable, but of course a totally different virus. So I have no idea. You made this point about that it's unexpected that you evolve towards higher transmissibility, which I totally agree with, but I mean that still just can be. I mean, that still just can be a rare event, and that you often see sort of this accumulation of mutations. And a really rare event is that it somehow happened in a few cases. Yeah, but okay, so just if we were saying that, yes, it's like a single mutation to turn into a VOC or two mutations to turn into VOC, I would agree. But if you look here, no, look at these. No, look at these mutations that are consistent across the VOCs, right? And even some that are sort of consistent, right? Many, many specific, exact nucleotide substitutions that are the same across the VOC. This one doesn't count, this one's already there. So that is suggesting me a very limited target size and having to hit multiple targets. Having to hit multiple targets. And so that you become exponentially unlikely to do that by chance unless these same mutations are also conferring some kind of advantage within host. Well, you know, these chronic people are constantly spilling out these these these um variants with lots of mutations and uh and there's just the the few that happen to have this pattern that actually deny. Well, also, okay, well, let me emphasize again. Part of our motivation for this was that not only are these mutations seen in the VLCs, they're seen in other chronically infected patients who have nothing to do with the VLCs. Okay. Some subset of these are seen repeatedly in other chronically infected patients. Yeah, no, sorry, I didn't emphasize it. I'm sorry. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Do you have data on the to on the effect of humidity? on on the the effect of individual mutations to test the idea of the plateau from there is some ex there so there's there's some experimental um evidence in vitro experiments that measure I want to say um binding to ACE for different combinations of these mutations and I believe it's these two show positive epistasis in these very crude measurements. These very crude measurements here that you wouldn't necessarily expect to pick up on the kind of subtle things that might matter for transmission, but it's already there. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything. So, if I understood correctly, you're basically saying that the competition is still variants due to these computations. Somehow beneficial. Could it also just simply be that those mutations are in some other way? The most environment, not just because there's competition. Okay, thank you.
