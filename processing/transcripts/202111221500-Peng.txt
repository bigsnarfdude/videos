About symmetries and Nerders conservation laws of semi-discrete equations. Okay, thanks a lot for the introduction. And I mean, at the beginning, I was intended to join the meeting in Bank, but finally, the situation here is not a very idea. So I decided to give the talk online. So in fact, now it's at the So, in fact, now it's, as I said, it's 7 a.m. in the morning, so I'm still quite sleepy. So, today I'm going to talk something on semi-discrete equations. In fact, this is recent work with Peter Haydn. And I think some of you were there in Massey in 2018, I think it was, that I gave a talk on a relevant topic. And finally, I think we. Topic and finally, I think we can solve that problem totally. It's about symmetries of semi-discrete equations. So some very simple, I'll say very brief review on symmetries of difference equation and finite and semi-discrete equation. So we know that, I mean, this is according to my personal knowledge, that the first paper on discrete. Paper on discrete, very simple discrete equations, I think Hamiltonian equations, was studied by Maida in the 19, sorry, in the 1890s, in the 1980s. And he considered the Norton's theorem, in fact, in his paper. And we know that many people contributed in the study of finite difference equations. Equations, I mean, from the semi-point point of view. And for semi-discreet equations, I think the work was firstly studied by Dashanevi and the Power of Internet. And also, Yaminov, they started in the 1990s. And there was one problem that they also realized later that this so non-computer community, sorry, competitivity program. Commutativity problem regarding the pronunciation of symmetries. So, in a later paper in 2010, that they tried to solve this problem, they used this semi-continuous approach by comparing the semi-continuum of the semi-discrete version with the continuous version and the derived new formula. And I started. And I studied this problem a little bit later. I was interested in the Noto theorem because I will also give you this motivation later in the next page. That's why I was trying to, I mean, why I was trying to understand this problem. And then firstly, I studied the regular case I caught in this paper and it was not fully understood at that moment. And finally, that with Peter, which Peter had... With Peter, with Peter Hayden, that we can solve this problem totally. This is still preparent. We try to finish it by this workshop, but I think it will last for, maybe it will be available in the next week, perhaps, hopefully. So as I said, the motivation for me, in fact, is this system, this so-called interconnected mechanic system that during my time in Waseda, that I was. That I was studying this problem with some professor from mechanical engineering. And this system, in fact, it's a system from electronic engineering that the system is constructed from, also it can be constructed from variation principle. And of course, there is also constraints, the interconnection constraints, and also other holomic constraints. Holonomic constraints and the system will be a system of semi-discrete equations. It's somehow similar to the total lattice if you choose the potential function properly. So it is said that the momentum of the system is preserved. So when I was studying this problem, so I was wondering what is the symmetry related to this momenta conservation. So I was searching in the literature about So I was searching in the literature about a Norton theorem for semi-discrete equations and I found that there's nothing about it. So I studied some of the original papers on semi-discrete equations and I found that there's in fact a big hole there on the theory itself. Okay, so we know that what is the symmetry? I think all of you are familiar with it. So it's something keep the structure and change. Keep the structure unchanged or keep the shape unchanged. So, what I'm going to give this from the very simple example is, for example, if we consider, I mean, because we are focusing on continuous symmetry, so let's consider this a unicircle, or just say a circle. So we know that it's SO2 invariant. So if you rotate it by any angle, it will be invariant. So you look at it, it looks like exactly the same. I mean, the shape is always the same. I mean the shape is always the same. You can write it by using the SO2 group, by multiplying a SO2 matrix in this way. And so the important thing is that the shape of the object is invariant mathematically. It's the formula itself. It's written in different coordinate system, but it looks like the same. I mean, the equations also look like. I mean, the equations also look like the same, but they're written in different coordinates. So, if we go to differential equations, this is also similar. This is a simple example I took from Peter Haydn's book. So, if we can see it a very simple Ricardo equation, take this transformation that we see that in the new coordinates x2 and y2, the equation, the ordinary differential equation will also look exactly the same. So, the essential So, the essential is that the equation should look exactly the same after the transformation. But here, the important thing is that we have the transformation on X and Y, but how to prolong it, how to extend the transformation to derivatives is quite important. But we know for ordinary differential equations, we can just simply use the chain rule to do it. But for partial differential equations, also, we can do it by using. Can do it by using the Jacobi matrix. Okay, so if we know how to prolong the transformations or equivalently, if we know how to prolong the corresponding infinitesimal generator, the Lie algebra, then we can systematically calculate symmetries of here I consider very simple ordinary differential equation, but of course in general, you can also consider it. You can also consider a general ordinary differential question or partial differential equation. So, you can use either the TEL exponential approach or using the infinitesimal generator. So still, the important thing as I said is what is the pronunciation for this one. So here, we already know that then you can use this one to calculate the tail expansion, and then you will obtain the mineralized symmetry condition here. Symmetry condition here. So the blue part and the red part should both vanish. That's the linearized symmetry condition. Of course, this constant part is just the original equation. Okay. So we know that the pronunciation is very important. And for differential equations, we already know how to do so. And this is the pronunciation. Is the pronunciation of the transformation and equivalently the pronunciation of the infinitesimal generator, which has a very beautiful evolutionary representation that we know from Peter Over the Book, right? And so for semi-discrete equations, for DDEs, for differential differential equations, so as I said, that's a problem there. And in this talk, that I will simply consider one plus one dimension. simply consider one plus one dimensional case, so one dimensional discrete and one dimensional continuous. And also just take u as one dimensional, which is the dependent variable here. Okay. And some notations will be used. So u, so u0 for instance, sometimes people write so will be uxn, uj will be the shifts, the sub-indices will denote the shifts and superindices will denote the Superindices will denote the derivatives. So, this, as I said, the non-commutativity is, it comes from here, in fact. So, if a transformation or if a transformation or a symmetry is given, so if we have some transformation on the, so there is a lead point transformation on the dependent variable and the independent variables. So, how to calculate the shift. So, how to calculate the shifts? So, how to prolong it to shifts and the derivatives? So, this was not understood, in fact. So, for instance, what is the first shift of U2? So, is this one or the other one? So, in fact, according to the first paper of Navy and Winternees, they naively shifted first and differentiate later, and then they didn't of course. And then they didn't, of course, they didn't analyze the approach, they just thought that it will work, and then they used this pronunciation formula from the continuous case. But of course, if we use that approach, the first thing that there is no commutativity in the new coordinate, in the X2 and NU2 coordinate, the total derivative and the total shift. The total derivative and the total shift they are not commutative anymore. And also, if you use that prolongation formula, that it is not equivalent to an evolutionary representative, in fact. Okay, so let's consider a very simple example. So this is just a translation along the independent, the continuous independent direction. And we keep the dependent variable in one. Then we have that if we calculate the U1 dashed, so which means first shift and first derivative. So if we calculate first the differentiation and then shift it, we will get this one. But if we shift it first and then differentiate, so that's a little bit different here. That here we have SUX, but here it's only UX. So apparently that in the new So apparently that in the new coordinate, this commutativity property is not called anymore. So which one we should choose? So in my first published in 2017, so I was thinking that we can pass do either approaches. So we can do in this way, but we can also do it in the other way. But in fact, that's a unique way to do so. A unique way to do so. So I'm putting both approaches here. So one is I call it an analytic approach. Another one is, in fact, related to Peter Hayden's talk in the morning. So it's the geometric understanding of it. So the very important thing that although n is invariant here, but we should somehow consider it as the independent variable, which is invariant though, but not as a parameter. though but not as a parameter in understanding the sorry and in in considering the transformations so uh let's consider this uh example again so in the original coordinates we have the s d so the shift and the total derivative and in the new coordinate although n tier is m but we still take the s to it and d tier according to and d turt according to the total shift about n tier and d tiot according to or which is the total derivative about x tier so in the because they are the they are the new coordinates so they still they are the competitivity property still still hold but the so the calculation of the uh the prongation you know of of course in fact Of course, in fact, to calculate this one, you have to calculate the shifts and the derivative, the first shift and the first derivative first. Then you can calculate this one. But in fact, then how to calculate it by using this continuity. So you can first shift it and then differentiate it. Or you can first differentiate and then shift it. For instance, you just do so and by using this invariant substitute inside. And when you calculate. Inside. And when you calculate in the new coordinate, you have to use the new coordinate. So you have to substitute inside and then do the differentiation, do the shift in the new coordinate. And then afterwards, you will get this new or say this same U1 dash from the right-hand side. You can solve it from it. But of course, this approach still is implicit. But fortunately, we can use the infinitesimal generator to do so. We don't have to use. Infinitesimal generator to do so, we don't have to use the transformation, we can just prolong the infinitesimal generator. Okay, so now you see that there seems this S and S tier is a limit. So we have two shifts. So this is in fact equivalent to the geometric setting that Peter introduced in the morning. So we have two different types of shifts, not say shifts. Shifts, not say shifts, one is the shifts of the functions, another one, in fact, is the translation, as Peter introduced. So this is maybe a little bit complicated that I can't explain in very simple words that this is still similar to what people introduced, but the different thing that even on each slide, that you only that so you only you only you don't only have the shift but you also have the derivatives simultaneously so every time you copy the this the same fiber from n to n plus one you you don't only copy say u but also you copy all its derivatives so that's the idea but anyway i will leave this part so the the differential structure is nothing but the so when you fix n this is nothing but the jet band structure and the Band structure and the difference structure so it's nothing but what P what Peter introduced in the morning. So the ordinary differential case was already given there and the partial difference case was introduced here morning, here in the morning by Peter. And here because I just conceded the one plus one case. So in fact, it's just an ordinary difference case. And the very important thing is this T case. And the very important thing, this TKD translation, which looks like this. So when you pull back a fiber from one, for instance, from n plus k to n, so then you will get the value of u, the shifts of u at the phi power n. So you've got all the values of u at a given point of n. So that's the important. n so that's the important thing here so this t k star in fact somehow corresponds to the to the s tuot here and the s is the shift so that's somehow the the the correspondence between them and the by using the differential structure and the different structure then we can get this uh semi-discrete or say dd structure so this is a it's still So this is still very similar to the difference case, just as I said, that you just prolong everything. Sorry, not prolong, you just translate everything rather than translate only the U itself, but also its derivatives. So this sub-index, sorry, super index is the derivative. Okay. And then we have also the total prolongation space here, which is nothing but which is nothing but lots of copies of the total jet spaces. So as I said, the important thing is also, as Peter introduced in his talk, that we can use the translation, also use this translation to pull back any function defined on another fiber back to the fiber n and then this by and then this by putting back this function this will give us the shift operator okay but this t k and s k they are the the difference of them gives us the difference in fact the difference between the s and s2s i introduced in the uh in the advert approach so it doesn't it doesn't matter which approach we concede that the very important result is that if we conceive it from the geometric point of view And if we concede from the geometric point of view, that what we can obtain is that all structure-preserving transformations will be regular transformations only. So what are regular transformations? Which means that the transformation along the independent variable is independent from the n and functions of n, which means that the transformation of x only depends. Of x only depends on x and the parameter epsilon, of course. So, if you wanted to preserve the structure, so this geometric structure of the semi-discrete, so the total perlongation space, then all transformations have to be irregular. Okay, but of course, according to the algebraic approach, we start from general transformations. So, it doesn't matter if we start It doesn't matter if we start from the geometric point of view or the algebraic point of view, that even if we consider the most general case of transformations, that we can get the prolongation of the vector field, prolongation of the infinitesimal generator in such a way that which is evolutionary, which is equivalent to an evolutionary representative. And this Q is Representative and this Q is similarly called a characteristic. So, this can be analytically proved because the evolutionary representative is very important for us to construct the Norton theorem, in fact. Okay, and of course, that we can use the nearest symmetry condition to calculate symmetries of semi-discriminate equations. And this is a very simple example of the total lattice. We know that this was already studied in the first paper by Nevi and Wentnis. And by using our results, by using the prolongation formula, we can get all its Li-point symmetries, which is four-dimensional. And this one, I mark it as red because this one is a little bit different from what they obtained in 1991. In 1991, that they also obtained this f should be an arbitrary function of n, but in fact, this fn dx is not a symmetry of the total lattice. They also realize this problem that it is not a symmetry of total lattice, but they try to caution this out. They manually concede that they just study regular symmetry. They just focus on regular symmetry. They just focus on regular symmetries at the very beginning rather than to concede what is the reason behind it. And in fact, that we calculate many examples, we see that many examples only admit regular symmetries. But in fact, also this is similar to what Peter introduced in the morning, also already included in Peter Heinz's book on symmetries of finite difference equations. Of finite difference equations. There is special types of semi-disc equations, which are the partitioned DDEs. This is a very simple damper. For partitioned DDEs, the symmetries can be non-regular or irregular. So this is a very simple damper. This is also very similar to the example Peter gave in the morning. So you can see that one and two, they are corresponding to each other. And two, they are corresponding to each other, and three and four, they also correspond to each other, and five and six, they also correspond. They are pairing with each other, so which means that, in fact, you can somehow cut the lattice into two copies. But here it's two copies because it's only depending on n and n plus two, so it can just cut into two copies of them and partitioned DD. So, this is very similar to the partitioned finite difference equation. That the equations only depend on variables at the, for instance, the first and the second and the fourth fibers. And we can use these to calculate grouping one solutions or say the similarity reductions of Reductions of DDE. So, this is already studied even in the first paper, Beneri and Wentzin. So, I'm going to skip it. And for the volteter equation, you can also assume, so we can also get all obvious Lee point symmetries. There are two of them. There's two-dimensional, and you can also use it to construct the most general grouping invariant solution. And next I'm going to introduce the Notes theorem. In fact, both Notes first and not second theorem about semi-discrete equations. So we concede, so this I mentioned quite formally. So we concede a semi-discrete variation problem and then the invariance property, so invariance of the variation program as a Invariance of the variation problem of the functional is still very similar to the continuous case. Of course, because we have the evolutionary representative of the perlongation of vector fields, then this is the most general divergent symmetries of semi-discrete virational programs. And the Euler-range equations can still similarly calculate by using the all operator. We define the all operator in this way. find the all operator in this way. So this is all joint of the total derivative and S minus L is the adjoint of SL. So this is also somehow introduced by Peter in the morning. So it saves a lot for me. And the construction law, let's assume that in fact, maybe I have to say it may depend on the property of the oral equation, but let's assume that it can be written in a characteristic way. So the divergence. So the divergence, the semi-discrete divergence, the total derivative passed total shifts equal to the characteristic times the Euler interface. Because now I can see it first, sorry, one-dimensional dependent variable. So it's just nothing but a multiplication. So if it's multi-dimensional, then this will be the inner product. And the Notes-First theorem can be immediately proved, in fact, because we have the evolutionary representation. have the evolutionary representative so to prove it it's nothing so this is the evolutionary so the equivalent here evolutionary representative of the pronunciation formula so to prove the notice first theorem is nothing but summation and integration by pars okay and this can also extend it to to higher or higher order symmetries the symmetries equally. So in fact, there are many examples which are variational. For instance, as I introduced in my motivation, that the interconnected system is also variational. But of course, there is polynomial constraint. But of course, if you focus on a sub-manifold, then the constraint can be removed. Can be removed. And there are many examples which are variational from integral systems. I gave some of them in my previous paper. And here, let's consider maybe one of the simplest examples, the Watelli equation. But for the Watelli equation, that we have to introduce a new variable, so we have to introduce a change of variables. So from the original U-coordinate to the V-coordinate. coordinate. And in the V coordinate, so if you write the equation in the V coordinates, it will be evarational and this is the semi-discrete Lagrangian. And so if evariation symmetry is known, but here of course this is maybe some special variation symmetries. Maybe there will be other more. And there are two of them. By using those two symmetries, we can get Those two symmetries, we can get the so, of course, firstly, you get the conservation law of the equation written in the V coordinate, and by using this transformation, you can move back to the U coordinate, in effect, finally. So we get conservation laws of the Watella equation itself, not for the equation written in the U coordinate. But in fact, for semi-disquisit equation, in fact, the general inverse theory is not Universe theory is not yet available, I think. So, if a equation is given, how to determine if it's variation or not, I think it's still an open question at the moment. So, similarly, there's also not a second theorem that if we concede the infinite dimensional variational symmetries, so which means that the symmetries depend on some arbitrary functions. Some arbitrary functions, you can get a or say you can get here, of course, differential difference relations among the all-element equations. So this D, in fact, differential difference relations, which means that they can be differential operators and they can be different operators. So they also can be a combination of them. This proof is also also. is also very straightforward as we have the evolutionary representative of prolongations. So at the end, I think I'm going to give this very simple example. I think we can call it a gauge symmetry preserving symmetry disgruntlation. This example was already, I think it's a well-known example from physics. well-known example from physics and we have the space-time coordinates so we have t at the time and we have x1 to 3 the three-dimensional space and the dependent variables are the complex valued wave function and we have the real valued a mu so mu is four-dimensional so you have four of them okay and the metric is the minkowski metric here so So this is the continuous setting that the Lagrangian is giving this way. And the functions f and the f are given here. And mu and mu, of course, run from 0 to 3. And this nameline mu is the total dbt plus complex. The total dbt plus complex part, and we can get the all-arm equations by just by using the all operator. So we got, in fact, four, sorry, six equations, okay, two of them, and you have four here. And there's a gauge symmetry that it depends on an arbitrary function, lambda, which is a function of the independent variables. It's arbitrary and it's real-valued. It's very important that it should be real-valued. Very important that it should be real-valued because otherwise, it's not a symmetry at all. And then, by using the gauge symmetry, that we can get the differential relations of the all-element equations here. Okay. So the fully discrete counterparts of this example, so the fully discrete discretization, the gauge seemed preserving, fully discrete. seemed preserving fully discrete fully discrete equations were already given in this paper and also Peter and Lise started it by using the not a second theorem in their paper. So here, so simply we just discretize time in this talk. But in fact, of course we can also discretize the space. Space, but it's a little bit simpler to concede just discrete time. And we choose the time step as h and the Lagrange, the same discrete Lagrange is written in this way, but the different thing is that the F, the definition of F and the definition of this namna is a little bit different. Because we discretize time, the first, for So the first, for when mu is zero, so you see that time is the index for time is zero. So when mu is zero, f00 and f0 mu, they are different from the continuous case. They are using the total shifts, so therefore the different operators rather than the total total derivative. Okay, and also the And also the lambda mu, so the continuous statement was like this, but the discrete part is replaced by this one, the total shift. It's still the correspondence plus the other part looks like this. And we can calculate the 70 screen all around equation just straightforwardly, just using the all operators, then you can get the all-argent equations, 70 screens. Same discrete. Forgive me that I use the same notations, the E for both the continuous case and the same discrete case. They mean different things in different settings. And also we have the gauge symmetries. Now, of course, the same discrete for the same discrete Lagrangian. So lambda is still an arbitrary function. It's again arbitrary and real values a function of the independent variables of the Of the independent variables of the discrete part and of the continuous part, and this part is still similar to the continuous case, but this part is a little bit different that we have this total shift. And this minus sign comes from the Minkowski metric, in fact. You can see here this summation. In fact, this is also summation, but because it's diagonal and only the minus sign appear in the first corner, they got the minus here. And we can also go to And we can also get, I should say, the differential difference relation among the all-armat equations of this typo here. And this part, the first two parts are still similar, but this part is different. That's here. In the continuous setting, this is the adjoint of the total derivative. Here, in fact, is replaced by the adjoint of the total shift. And this part is still the adjoint of the total derivative. Of course, the adjoint with the minus sign. Of course, the adjoint with the minus sign, again, this minus sign comes from the Mikovsky metric. So I didn't write it here. If I write eta 00, then this can be positive. And this dagger is the adjoint of the total shift operator. And this calculated by summation by parts, as also introduced by Peter in his talk. So I think I'm going to summarize our Going to summarize up so basically, so finally we could solve this non-commutativity problem for seven discrete equations and we can show, or say we can prove that every transformation can be prolonged, how to say, every infant seismic director can be shown to be equivalent to a evolutionary representative, which is Representative, which is very essential for us to construct an auto theorem. Also, in fact, that's in my talk, I only include this first and second theorem, so the finite dimensional case and the infinite dimensional case. In fact, there's also this intermediate theorem that was included in Nautz's theorem that when you have infinite dimensional variation symmetry, it's but those Those arbitrary functions are constrained. So, in that case, you can obtain conservation laws of the Olivant equations. In fact, this, I think Peter called 1.5 or intermediate theorem. This was also proved, also this is also proved in our paper that we're going to put online very soon. And in fact, this is the moving frame coming from. The moving frame conference. In fact, we are also considering if because we have the general, say, the theory for symmetries of semi-discrete equations. So in fact, this can, of course, can be used to construct the moving frame theory for semi-discrete equation, in fact. So I think I'm a little bit fast, so thank you very much for your attention. Are there any questions for Ling Yu? From the audience or from online? It seems that the answer is no, so Dana, thank you very much, thank you, for your talk. Thanks a lot.
