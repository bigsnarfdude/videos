David Stewart from the University of Newcastle, and he'll talk about the Jacobson-Lovozov theorem and characteristic two. Thanks very much. Thanks for the opportunity to speak. I'll kick off with some. So, this is joint with Adam Thomas. I'll kick off with some notation. GAC. Um g, a simple algebraic group over a field K and the characteristic of K will be P and I better say K is K bar. And G is going to be the Lie algebra of G. I suppose I could say that most of these results will hold in the more general case where The more general case where my group is reductive, but I'm going to, it'll be a bit easier to state things if I just say it simple. So MathFrac G is going to be the Lie algebra of G. And in this particular situation, if the characteristic of P here is bigger than zero, if the characteristic A is bigger than zero, then Okay, bigger than zero, then we get a little bit more structure on this Lie algebra than just the Lie bracket. We actually get what's called a P map. So then G inherits a P map, which makes it restricted. So that's what the definition is. Is so such that what does this p map do? Well, if you take an element x in g, then you can raise it to this pth power. And then bracketing another element with this x to the p is the same thing as bracketing that element with x p times. And any Leo. And any Lie algebra that has this property is called a restricted Lie algebra. So, i.e., g is restricted. So that's a useful notion, which I might talk about a bit later. I might talk about p subalgebras, so a Lie subalgebra. H of G is a piece of algebra if H is closed under the P map. The nice thing about having this P map is that you can immediately define. This P map is that you can immediately define what it means on a restricted Lie algebra to for an element to be nil potent. So in fields of characteristic zero, you don't have this PMAP. What you have instead is a theorem about preservation of Jordan decomposition for semi-simple Lie algebras, which tells you that no matter what representation. Which tells you that no matter what representation you're in, an ill-potent element will in one will map to a nil potent element in another. So you may as well just look at the add, may as well define an element to be nilpotent if it's add nilpotent. It's a bit more, a bit simpler in many ways in the fulfills of strictly positive characteristic because you can Can because you can use this P map. So an element X is nil potent if right, okay, I should click that so the Jacobs. So the Jacobson Morozov theorem says let E, so this is over over the field being complex numbers originally. Let E be an element of G, E a non-zero nil potent element. Then, Then E can be embedded into an SL2 triple. So then there exist H and F such that H on E is 2E, H on F is minus 2F, and E on F is H. And these are, of course, very famous. These are, of course, very famous relations, and they tell you that EH and F generate a Lie sub-elder isomorphic to SL2. So i.e., EHF is isomorphic to SL2. So it's an interesting theorem, I think, in itself. Take any nil-potent element, you can put it inside an SL2. Can put it inside an SL2. But it does have some probably surprising uses that I don't imagine would have been immediately guessed by Morozov or indeed maybe even Jacobson. Here is one. So this an application. So, again, because we're over the complex numbers, it follows from SL2 theory that you can write the Lie algebra G as being something in the image of add E, so something that's a commutator with E, plus something that's in the kernel of add F. And that gives you a complete decomposition of the space. And if I just take E plus the kernel of add F, so it follows that E plus the kernel of add F is a transversal to the orbit. Of G on E. So of course, G is acting on the Lie algebra via the adjoint map. So this sub variety is going to give you a transversal to this orbit at B. And then this has some interesting representation theories. Representation theoretic properties. So it's related to finite Wausels. If you take the coordinate ring of this object called a Sodavy slice, then you get the associated graded algebra to the finite W algebra associated with the nilpotent element E and And working over all the possible nil placement elements, this tells you everything that you want to know about the representation theory of the universal enveloping algebra and therefore of G. So there's an application. Right. There were some other things. There were some other things that were proved about this. Notably, Costant showed that F is unique. So the F that you can put the E with to create an SL2 triple is unique up to conjugacy by the centralizer G E of E. Of E in G. So take two SL2 triples, EH and F and EH dashed and F dashed, then we can conjugate the F to the F dashed by the centralizer of E, which then of course implies that the H dashed can be centralized by the same element to the H can be conjugated by the same element to the H dashed. Similar to the H dashed. So this process is essentially unique of putting things into SL2 triples. Again, this is over the complex numbers, and this is not true in general over fields of positive characteristic. The Jacobson Morris of theorem itself was extended to good characteristic. Characteristic. So, this is just the extension of E into some SL2 subalgebra. So, this was extended to good characteristic by Pomerani about 1980. What's good characteristic here? Well, it just means that you ignore a few very small primes. So, the worst case is in E8 and you have to ignore the. You have to ignore the primes 2, 3, and 5, but otherwise, you may have to ignore 2 and 3, apart from if you're not in E8. So it's only a very small number of exceptional characteristics. And Costant's theorem was extended to positive characteristic. Positive characteristic by first of all Springer and Steinberg. And I think the result they had was that P had to be bigger than 4H minus 1. And then by Carter, who reduced the condition to 3H minus 3. So Adam and I came across this theorem, because we probably knew about it, but we realised that it was actually sort of what we were working on behind in the background when we started thinking about G-complete reducibility for. For Lie algebras and trying to get some explicit results about it. I'll say something about G-complete reducibility immediately after this, but let me give you the theorem that we proved. So the theorem, let's insist that p is bigger than 2 for all of this. I will say, obviously, there's p. I will say, obviously, there's p equals 2 is in the title, and I will say something about that afterwards. But just for p bigger than 2, we proved the following. So to try to make this as precise as possible, I'll describe it this way. So the map that takes an SL2 triples. Under conjugacy by G to nilpotent orbits, which takes a triple EF and I'm putting the H here, aren't I? So EH and F to E. So I suppose I'm really this is sort of O of E, an orbit containing E. So, this is a bijection if and only if p is bigger than the Coxter number. So, we can see kind of how this improves the theorem of Carter. If g is e8, then h is 30. And so this number. Is 30 and so this number is 87. So this takes 87 down to p bigger than 30. I think, though, actually, this is stated in a slightly different way. It stated that there's actually a bijection between conjugacy classes of SL2 subalgebras and nilpotent orbits, and we can get that in a slightly better situation. So the map constantly. Conjugacy classes of SL2 subalgebras, two nilpotent orbits, which takes a subalgebra or a conjugacy class of subalgebras, just say C to the orbit of largest dimension. So the nilpoten orbit of largest dimension meeting C. This is a bijection if and only if p is bigger than b of g and b of g is a number which is seems to have turned up um uh in in some work of um Work of Giovanna Carnavale as well. It just insists, so you don't want any AP minus one Levy sub-algebras in your Lie algebra. So B of G is the largest A R is the largest R. R such that A R minus one is a Levy subalgebra of G. There's particular weird things that happen if you have an AP minus one subalgebra. So it means that you've got an SLP sitting in there, and you can put in your SL2 subalgebra in any non-restricted representation. Algebra in any non-restricted representation. So that explains why you would need this condition. Okay, so one more thing. And furthermore, the Jacobson-Morrisov theorem itself holds unless Unless so this means that you can embed any nil potent element into SL2 triple unless G is G2 and E is the exceptional orbit, which is normally labeled with tilde A1 with a sort of three like that. Like that. So that's a sort of complete answer for P bigger than or equal to 3. I suppose some of the things I'm kind of mentioning here, it's probably worth saying that, so G has finitely many orbits on the nilpotent cone. So there are only finitely many nilpotent orbits to look at. Finitely many nilpotent orbits to look at, so that it is possible, and in fact, we do need to do this at various points, just look very carefully at what the classification of those nilpotent orbits is in order to be able to prove this theorem. Not so much this part here, but when we need to look at the possible SL2 sub-algebras you can get, that is Knowing the nilpotent orbits precisely is quite important. So we need to use various aspects about the centralizers of them. Right. I should say I was going to say something about G-complete reducibility and how this is. Complete reducibility and how this is related. Perhaps I'll just say what else we proved in the course of this. I'll just say that a sub-algebra H of G is called GCR, and this is a definition due to SER if whenever H H is in a parabolic sub parabolic subgroup or subalgebra, I should say, a variabolic sub-algebra of G, then it's in a levy sub-algebra of that part of that parabolic. I don't have a huge amount of time to dwell on this, but I could probably say that in the group case, just consider the case where G is G L N. And a parabolic subgroup is a stabilizer of a subspace of a natural module. So, what this then would be saying if to have a subgroup of the module of the module Then would be say if to have a subgroup being GCR would be to say if I'm stabilizing a subgroup, then I have to be in a levy of that stabilizer and that and being in a levy of that stabilizer is I also stabilize a complement to that subspace. So therefore, in the case of GLN, this is really saying that I'm acting completely reducibly. Completely reducibly. So I suppose if I then said that if one knew that all of one's sub-algebras were completely reducible, were G-completely reducible in this sense, perhaps that might suggest why there's a better correspondence with the of milk. Of nilpotent orbits and SL2 subalgebras. So if you're completely reducible, and again, let's just take the case that G is GLN, a nilpotent element will have some Jordan block structure on the natural module for GLN and being And being completely reducible, you would know that precisely what the representation is, because you know the lengths of all of these of all of the sort of chains of weight spaces that E is moving between. So you can write down precisely what the representation is in terms of height weights. So that tells, and of course, then two representations. Course, then two representations being equivalent would be the same as having the two sub-algebras conjugate. So, hopefully, you can see that there would be a reason to suspect a connection there. And the theorem that we proved, and this is for p bigger than or equal to five, if I take h as a simple sub-algebra of exceptional g Then either H is GCR or there are some exceptions. So this is the case which is showing you that something funny goes on when P is less than Cox number. So H is of type A1 and so isomorphic to SL2 in other words. Isomorphic to SL2, in other words, and P is less than H, or there are some other exceptions, which include other exceptions. So in characteristics, P is five and seven, either involving H being W one or G two or B two. Or B2. What's W1? You ask? Well, this is one of the weird sub-algebras, one of the weirdly algebras that you get in characteristic P, which is not anything to do with an algebraic group. So here, W1 is the set of derivations on the truncated polynomial ring, like this, and W1 has a basis of elements. Of elements where you either differentiate one of these polynomials or you differentiate and then multiply by x or differentiate and multiply by x to the p minus one and then of course take any linear combinations of those. So that was a sort of for reasons I don't have time to go into any further was a very useful reason to well Reason to well very useful result in proving what we did about the Jacobson-Morozo theorem. Right, characteristic two. This starts to get very arbitrary in that there are three possible ways to go here. Ways to go here. If I stick, so I want to take Milk Odin elements in characteristic two and embed them into three-dimensional sub-algebras. And I could ask myself the question if I can do that just with the embedding into an SL2 triple with the definition that I gave earlier. So what would that say? So, what would that say? So, one question is: can we embed an ill potent element E into a triple E H F where, well, this is still the same. We're still asking that the bracket of E and F is H, but now I want the bracket of H. Now I want the bracket of H and E to be 2e, but 2 is 0. So I actually am asking that H centralizes E, and similarly minus 2 is 0. So I'm asking that H centralizes F as well. So, and we can call that an SL, we still call that an SL2 triple. So that's one thing you can do. So that's one thing you can do. But of course, a Lie algebra satisfying these relations is no longer going to be simple. H is the center here. And I've got two elements that when I take the commutator, I map into the center. And then that obviously is the only non-trivial bracket up to, you know. Linear things. So this is in fact a Heisenberg Lie algebra that you may have come across before. So this is a Heisenberg Lie algebra. Or I could do the same thing where instead of taking an SL2 triple or something isonor SL2, I try and find something ison orthodox. I try and find something isomorphic to PGL2. So, in characteristic 2SL2, the Lie algebra of SL2 and the Lie algebra of PGL2 are not the same. And one is the other way around from the other. So I get this time I want an abelian, a two-dimensional abelian ideal. Ideal, so generated by E and F. And then an element H which acts on the two things as a sort of simultaneous derivation. Okay, so that's yet one more possible way of trying to complete E to a three-dimensional sub-algebra. And yet, one more is If we insist that all of these things are kind of just one, wherever they would have been, coefficients are one. So I'll call this S and we're going to say E and F is H. We're going to say H on E is E and H on F is F. Normally, you can't do this. Do this, it only works in characteristic two. But if you do it in characteristic two, you do get, in fact, a simple Lie algebra. And this is a, we could, well, we can, there isn't a sort of particularly common name for it. One name that I have heard in the past is fake SL2. It's not received. It's not restricted, which you would expect, because it's not the Lie algebra of any algebraic group. So let's just observe this is not restricted. This is not a restricted Lie algebra. So how do I know when is something restricted? Well, if I do add each If I do add E squared and apply it to F, so that's take the bracket of E with F first, that gets me to H, and then take the bracket of E with H again, and that gets me to E. So this is E. Right, so that's something. If this were restricted, I would be able to find some element e to the power of square. To the power of square brackets two, which took me all the way from f to e in one step. But clearly, there isn't anything that does that here. So, but no element E2 such that add E2 on F equals E. So, in particular, this is certainly not. So in particular, this is certainly not the Lie algebra and algebraic group. Okay, which probably given that we're calling this fake SL2 is not dreadfully surprising. You can always put any Lie algebra you like inside. Any Lie algebra you like inside a minimal P envelope. In this case, if you stick, if you add in the elements, the elements E and F, which precisely do these things. So with the property that add of E squared on, sorry, add of E squared on F is the same as add of E on F, then I do get a restricted. Then I do get a restricted Lie algebra, but one that's now five-dimensional. So it's minimal P envelope. So E E H F F somehow. You might be asking if this is just a feature that applies to SL2. In fact, not. You can, if you start. you can if you start with the if you take any Cartan matrix which has a column divisible by P which only happens in one case in the case that you have you're looking at B n Cartan matrix type B n it turns out the last row is divisible by two and if you divide it by two and then you form the Lie algebra that you would do from those Algebra that you would do from those coefficients, you do get a new simple Lie algebra in characteristic two, which is again not restricted, but can be proved to be simple. So slightly more generally, but not hugely, we get fake BNs. So O2N plus one, I put a sort of hat over it. Of hat over it. So, one could certainly go and ask questions about how these fake ON2N plus 1 sit in the kind of sub-algebra structure of various Lie algebras as well, although we have not yet done that. Now, am I going to say? I think I'll just say something just slightly to try and motivate. And motivate why this might be aside from its interest in putting elements into fake SL2s, why this question might come up. In both, so sort of another remark, in both cases, Both cases of where you're putting your element E into a PGL2 or a fake SL2, you need an element H such that HE equals E. And so, what we're doing is we're asking about whether the normalizer Normalizer, if asking for the existence of this element, is about asking whether the normalizer of Ke i is the normalizer in G of the line Ke. So these are all nilpotent elements. If this over the centralizer of E is dimension one or zero. For the group, the normalizer of this line is all over the centralizer of the element is always dimension one. So for the group, the normalizer of G of K E, this line over the centralizer of G of E, is always Always dimension one. And the reason for that is this. This is a subspace of the nilpotent cone. There are only finitely many orbits on the nilpotent cone, so one of them must intersect it densely. So that means that I can send E through the action of G to infinitely many points on this line. To infinitely many points on this line. And all I'm doing is just changing the scalar at the front here. So I'm really mapping through the multiplicative group. So, and if I have an infinite subgroup of the multiplicative group, then it must be the whole thing. So I must map through some co-character to act on here, and therefore, this must be doing. This must be doing a dimension more than centralizing. But it turns out that this is not always the case at all that you can find this element. So given the fact that there is a disparity here, you're actually saying something about the smoothness of centralizers that you can get, which is a sort of a very common theme throughout the subject. So it does seem to. Out the subject. So it does seem to have some interest from that point of view as well. Anyway, in the last four minutes, I shall give you a statement of the result. Just for the sort of fake SL2s. What we want to do, because it's by no means the case that all nilpoys and elements. That all nilpotent elements embed into fake SL2s. So, what we want to do is to say something inductively through a system of sort of easily described sub-algebras of the group, of the Lie algebra itself. And the notion that we're going to use here are going to be generalized subsystem sub-algebras. Algebras. So a generalized subsystem subalgebra is one that you get from Borel tits. Sorry, not Borel tips, the Borel de Siebenthal formula algorithm. Algorithm or a particular case of where you have B M B N minus M minus one inside D N. So up to isogeny, this is SO2N. And if I split this up into an odd 2n plus 1. Odd 2m plus 1 and then the rest space, then I get another subgroup. And we'll say an ill posing element is eminent. So the idea for being eminent is that it's even more than distinguished. So an elbow element is eminent. Element is eminent if it's in no proper generalized subsystem. Then the following theorem after dealing with an extension to kind of reductive groups is the following that E That E extends to a fake SL2, so an S subalgebra, if and only if one of the following holds. So G of type A N and end not equal to one mod 4 to B N with n not equal With n not equal to one or two mod four dn with n not equal to two mod four g2 any type although there's only one that's that's eminent f4 and e has to be here of type with a label f4 or f4. With a label F4, F4A2, anything in E6, and there are various labels in A8, seven different types. Can I say a bit more about that? Probably not in the time. I think I'll stop there. Thank you. Thank you very much for your talk. If not, I'll just go ahead and ask something myself one more time. So you had this in this result about conjugacy classes of SL2 triples being in bijection with important orbits. Dijection with important orbits. I think the assumption was that the prime is supposed to be bigger than the cost number. Yes. Is it possible to say roughly where that assumption is coming from? Well, that was the condition that we needed for everything to be G-completely reducible. So you're saying that whenever you're in a parabolic sub-algebra, that you're actually conjugate to the you're conjugate to something in the Levy sub-algebra. That's very strong. I mean, there's a few results that come into that, but one feature that you know is that if you have a distinguished element, which it would be in a, if it's in no problem. A, if it's in no proper Levy subalgebra of something, it will be it will be distinguished in something. If you also know that your SL2 is in there, then any other SL2 triple that will differ from it, you'll have an F and an F dashed, and the difference will then be in the centralizer of E. And you know various things about the structure. Things about the structure of the centralizers of nilpotent elements when they're distinguished. So, first of all, so there's a grading given by a co-character and you only get even parts of the grading. And also, you know that it doesn't go up very high. So, the grading cuts out at about two times the Coxland number. So, if P is bigger than, if P is odd, So if p is bigger than if p is odd and it's bigger than the coxton number, then you won't get any other parts of this grading. So the centralizer, there's no part of the centralizer that your element could, that this difference could live in, and therefore you have to be the same. So it's that basic idea. Okay. Yeah. So it doesn't like there's no direct relation with the existence. There's no direct relation with the existence of regular weights because when I see peak with an age, I always think of like alcohols with that GR2 groups being having containing elements of the weight letters. That's a good point. I couldn't immediately tell you what the connection with having with the zero weight being. With the zero weight being in the inside of the fundamental alcove is, it could just be a sort of coincidence, I suppose. All right. Are there any any more questions? If not, let's thank David again and thank all the speakers of the morning session again. Because this is, I believe, this is the end of the morning session, and then things will continue at half past one bunch of time.
