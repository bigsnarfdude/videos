Thank you. So, I'm going to talk about some unusual suspects, the X chromosome. I don't think it has been mentioned once in the talk so far. And also, another aspect is using simple linear regression rather than deep learning and a different perspective on how do we deal with this complex X chromosome issue. I will discuss both recent advances and new challenges. And new challenges. And on the left side is some formal and current graduate students involved in the work. And on the right side are my long-term collaborators. Okay. So how do I oops, this one is not moving. Oh, yeah. Correct. Okay. So I think most of us know this 2013 paper by Wise and a colleague. So at that time, roughly only one-third. Roughly only one-third reported GWAS included X chromosome. So, how are we 10 years later? Roughly still 10fold positive of GY signal on the X chromosome. So, X chromosome, roughly 5% of haplotype genome, but roughly 0.5% of the associated SNP reported in the catalog is on the X chromosome. So, here I make a link between chromosome 7 and the X chromosome. Between chromosome 7 and X chromosome, because they are similar in size, roughly 160 million base pair. Okay, we all know S chromosome research is difficult and the male has two copy, a male has one copy and the female has two copy. And then we also have the PAR region, pseudo-autosome region, and then non-pseudo-autosome region. And then the X chromosome also has this phenomenon. Chromosome also has this phenomenon called X-inactivation, called dosage compensation. I will explain also a little bit more detail in the next slides. You have random skewed and no X-inactivation. Additionally, this true X inactivation status at individual level cannot be derived from the GBAS data. So all we have is at the population level assumption. So the most known and consuming challenges so far, and I will point out the So far, and I will point out the additional challenges later: is the X inactivation in female. So, equalize the expression of the genes between sexes. So, you have random. That means you randomly silence one copy of the, you know, two copy of X chromosome in a female, and then maybe not a random, preferentially silence one copy that will be skewed, and some gene escape inactivation. So, you have no inactivation. So, what does that mean analytically? So, what does that mean analytically? So, if I choose little A as a reference allele, big A is an alternative allele. So, you code the male. Here I'm talking about the non-pseudo-autosome SNP, you code 0, 1. But for female, now you have to make a decision. If you assume no X inactivation, 0, 1, 2, if you assume random X inactivation, 0.51, how about skewed? Okay, and so there have been actually some advances on how to deal with this. Advances on how to deal with this X chromosome inactivation. So you can try different models, pick the minimum P, you can do model selection, and you can do like we have done in our lab, it's Bayesian model averaging. So most of these methods are reasonable, but computing intensive and somewhat ad hoc. So now let's step back a little bit. What means X inactivation? Okay, so that means. Okay, so that means the effect of a particular allele may be different between male and female. So that means there's a sex-ratified genetic effect. Statistically, that is a G times sex interaction. So what means skewed X inactivation? What effect of the population in your sample, right? The heterozygous will not be the average of the capital and the double A. That means dominant effect, statistically speaking. Statistically speaking. So, now what does that mean analytically? If I try this simple GIM and I will do this two degrees of freedom test, that means I'm going to test the additive, the traditional additive coding. I will put a dominant term. Remember, this dominant in this particular case also represents skewed inactivation. And I'm also going to put a G times sex interaction. Then these three different. X interaction, then this three-degree freedom test, in fact, is invariant to your X-inactivation assumption. If you don't believe me, you can code your data 012 or 0.51 for your female data. You run these two degrees of freedom test, doesn't matter you do score, word, or bio-visual test, your test will be numerically identical. So there's a theorem when in the paper, give your theoretical justification why that is the case. We also spend a lot of time. The case, we also spend a lot of time on discussing: do I have to worry about a lot of power loss due to this increased degrees of freedom? So, I will not spend more time on that. So, now seem to be all good, but that means also the various X chromosome genetic facts are confounded, not really interpretable. So, GWAS alone cannot identify the underlying true X chromosome genetic. X chromosome genetic model because they are somewhat mathematically equivalent to each other. And at the same issue at genetic API last year, there's also empirical study to show that the SNP coefficient estimation of bias, if you model something is incorrect. And what we are seeing theoretically is that you cannot actually determine what is the correct genetic model. Okay, so the message so far is that if we are just So far, that if we are just interested as chromosome association testing, then seem to be okay. But effect size estimation will be problematic. So, what does it mean for our downstream various analysis, including polygenic rescue? If you want to do X chromosome inclusive polygenic risk, there's a beta head there. What do you plug there? We don't know. So, maybe one kind of pragmatic approach is just let's just do sex stratified. Just let's just do sex-stratified analysis and get the beta in that version. Okay, so now I'm going to go upstream. And how about the quality of this chromosome data? And I think we all know the question of that, you know, the answer to that question mark, right? Was all the variants calling imputation kind of bioinformatic were specifically designed for X-chromosome, or you just, you know, directly apply autosome pipeline? Directly apply all those on pipeline with some, you know, quick fix. Okay, so for example, quality control, right? Testing for Hardywomber equilibrium, testing for Hardywomber disequilibrium is booting it down for autosome. How do we, you know, do we do that for X chromosome? How do we do that? And also, let's ask even a simpler question. Do you think the LED frequency would differ between male and female on the X chromosome? Okay, so here I should. Okay, so here I show you a contrast between X chromosome and chromosome 7, similar in size. These are y-axis, just a female minus male map. Okay, the mining idea is defined by the combined sample. This is 1000 genome P3 data, and we only look at the common variants, presumably to be high quality. And then the light gray is part one, part three, and the part two. So there are no typo here. Three and the part two, so there's no typo here. Part three is in between part one and part two. Okay, so we're going to discuss also the you know population issues because here we know in the wensing genome project we have multiple superpopulations. But clearly, there's a difference between X chromosome and autosome. So, these are just direct contrast of the map. And you can, you know, do a statistical test that gave a p-value. So, left side is the phase three, and then we move on to. Side is the phase three, and then we move on to high coverage. And the top panel is still the direct contrast of the math between male and female, and the bottom is a kind of Manhattan plot. But for SD math testing, I will discuss that in a few minutes. Okay, so the red line, actually, we went with the conservative genome-wide significant level. So there's a lot of things going on here. So let's look at another data set. So here, the left side is So here the left side is nomad, non-Finnish European sample, and the right side is the African and African American sample. And here the p-values you can see is still significant, you know, kind of everywhere at the bottom. And the top part kind of shrunk a little bit because of a bigger sample size, right? That is kind of also highlighted the discussion about the p-value. P-value depends on the sample size. The sample size. But clearly, the kind of pattern stays. So now our current hypothesis is the two reasons for SDMF. Genotyping error, because we actually don't believe the pipeline, the bioinformatic pipeline was specific designed for X chromosome, so probably some genotyping error that would lead to false SDMF. But the early literature in linkage also points out that at the NPR and the PAR boundaries, maybe Maybe there's some biology there that actually we expected to be male and female different. So here I show you the zoomed in plot of part one, power three, and part two. And you can see the power one and then in between power one and pass three would be NPR, right? In the boundary seem to be a lot of SD map. Maybe it's true, but we don't know. This is just our current hypothesis. So now I'm going to talk about actually how do I get I'm going to talk about actually how do I get that p-value, right? So, the test is quite straightforward, especially in the numerator, right? The female math estimate the head minus the male, and you square them. And then the top, the first equation from the paper is sorry, for the non-pseudo-autosome region. So, male, you can see only one copy, and then the bottom one is for the autosome and the pseudo-autosome. There's also The pseudo-autosome. There's also this delta, it's a Hardy-whember disequilibrium measure, right? The frequency of the genotype minus the product of LU frequency. And this one you have to be careful with the population kind of consideration, right? Because even each individual population is in high-winberry equilibrium, but when you pull them together, it may not be. So there's some discussion there. And the variance. Uh, yeah, and the variance of this test has to incorporate this Hardywop describing. So, I'm gonna skip these technical details. So, now I'm gonna actually come up. So, in the paper published, we kind of just come up with this pretty reasonable test. So, now I want to actually come up with a rigorous approach, and we went with linear regression. Okay, so I'm going to walk you through these busy slides. First of all, the G, so now we are not talking about the That the G, so now we are not talking about the effect of a G on the phenotype, right? So G, I'm gonna code 0, 1, 2 for female for male, depending on the CNIP is in the pi region or NPR region, I'm gonna code 012 or 02, such that the expectation of this G will be two times the map. That's my, you know, on the left side of the regression. And then the expectation of the G map depending on the sex. map depending on sex population sex times population interaction so this beta s has a if you test that it is essentially test s d m f okay and then this beta subscript p in fact you can use it to to find and find out the the where the aims are the ancestry informative markers and then if you are interested well whether the the sd map in the european sample and the african american sample whether they are different well that you can tell Whether they are different, you can test that beta S P and the interaction. And obviously, you can also join the testing beta S and the beta S P interaction. So that join the testing multiple populations. And you also notice that the G is categorical, but I use a Gaussian model. Well, there's a literature justification for that. We're doing hypothesis testing, not a parameter estimation. Parameter estimation in that case, actually, you can actually use a linear model if it's gonna work. And another note is that this variance-covariance structure is a little bit different from the usual linear regression, has to be depending on the sex and population because this variance also depends on the map. And we are interested in map being different, right? So, you want to have that in place. And we already have a result to show that if you use this. If you use this kind of simple linear regression, you actually can get a pretty sophisticated SDMAF aim and difference in SDMAF between population. Okay, so there's still some open questions. How does SDMAF impact various X chromosome inclusive analysis, right? The, you know, obviously the association test. And I think association test will be okay because association, you include the sex as covariates. So I think that that's going to work. I think that that's going to work. But have we thought about the PCA? Have we thought about even LD? How do we define LD, right? For X chromosome. So there are a lot of work. And I also mentioned the PIS. And also, I emphasize there's two hypotheses, right? And the one is true as being math, the other might be false. You know, like, how do we differentiate that? And if it's true, I might want to leverage that. And if it's Might want to leverage that, and if it's a false, I want to have a way to find like to test, right? And now I'm going to switch last five minutes. I'm going to switch gear to the quality control part based on testing for Hardy-Wanberg disequilibrium. Okay, we know this testing, a Hardy-Wanberg equilibrium testing, important part of the GWAS equality control for the autosome at least, right? Severe departure from Hardy-Wamber equilibrium is an indication of a genus. ABM is an indication of a genotyping error. So I emphasize also severe here. Okay, so now let's refresh our memory. I give you this, you know, three genotype counts. How do we do a Pearson chi-square based test, right? And observed counts minus expected counts under the Hardy 1B equilibrium, but you don't have that LU frequency, right? Given. So you use your own data. So you p-hacked your Your data, your data judged, and therefore the chi-square, the degrees of freedom is one, not two. Otherwise, when you have three cells, it's two degrees of freedom. Okay, so just a note on that. And there's a just for kind of a data selection. Okay, so this autosome, what do we do with the exponential and particular NPR, non-pseudo-autosome? So I give you this real data. So, I give you this real data counts, right? And RS 1996225. And so, female is the, you see, the math estimate and the male, they're not drastically different. Okay. So, I can do female only party one equilibrium test. That would be my p-value. It's not generalized significant, almost there. And then there's already a literature saying, okay, how about I leverage the male data? I, you know, use. I use this combined math estimate. Not only that, I will actually use everybody. So you have a female component, the first three elements in the expression, and then the male component. Male counts minus the male, other male counts for the two genotypes and compared to the expected. And this works because you use combined. This work because you use combined, right? So, this one actually turned out to be generally significant. So, that just because you have small p-value doesn't mean the method is better. Because you can ask this question when you use the combine the math and the joint analyze the male and the female, are we jointly testing highly member disequilibrium in female and SD map? And also the PS and chi-square test is well known, but how is the exact Well known, but how is it exactly connected with this delta, right? The measure of Heidi-Member disequilibrium. So I want to have some insights. Okay, additionally, I want to look like more broad, right? What happens if I have a pedigree data related to individuals? What happened if I want to analyze sample from different population? Maybe I want to adjust for age, right? And because if I analyze a SNP that has actually a pretty severe effect by time you Pretty severe effect by time you collect your data, you lost some certain genotypes, right? So, uh, can we have a unifying the framework to do all of about okay? And let's just look at these autosome counts, right? Guess what's the solution we come up? I'm gonna come up with a linear regression, okay? So, how do you have a regression to do a hardware dissecretive test? So, I'm gonna go back. So I'm gonna go back to autosome and X chromosome parage, right? So from one genotype to two alleles. So for the homozygous is quite easy, 0, 0 and 1, 1. But for the heterozygous, you're going to have to toss a fair coin. If it's a head, you sign 0, if it's tail, sign 1. So that's if you assign exactly half of your heterozygous to be 0, 1, the other is 1, 0, then it's statistically incorrect. Incorrect. So, this is discussed in this fine metrics paper come up last year, and we actually was trying to generalize a little based genetic association study. So, now I'm going to do the following again linear regression. Okay, I have five minutes left. Okay, so you're going to stack the LU vertically. And when we think about what we mean by Hardyworm disequilibrium, it means the mean by Hardyworm disequilibrium means the correlation between two these ideals right so this row in the variance covariance matrix capture that so if I test that row equal to zero and that's my TRA reverse you know or robust you know allele-based regression and how is that connected with the Pearson but you do a little bit mathematical manipulation and this statistic actually is a literally identical okay so I now actually can Okay, so I now actually can do a Hardy-Wamper equilibrium, generalize a Pearson chi-square based Hardy-Wamber equilibrium test using a regression, not only regression, a simple linear regression with intercept only. So now, so I'm gonna skip for the X chromosome, it's actually quite straightforward, right? If you want to only use the female, you do this. If you want to You do this if you want to use a male, you're going to have to put the sex as a covariate. And then, if you test this rho and gamma jointly, then you can actually derive the Graufferman and the Wales statistic is actually numerically partitioned into two components. One is like a cardio number equilibrium testing in female, and the other is a kind of testing. In female, and the other is a kind of testing for SD map. So, they actually, if you use a combined map and using this top panel that tests, essentially you are doing both Hardy Weber equilibrium test and SD map test. You may not want to do that. Okay, it's just this offer insight to it. Okay, so then now we are going to just end my talk. I have an invitation to the whole deeper learning community, community in general. Community in general, I think as common research remains challenging and interesting. Okay, and particularly by informatics, folks, can you fix the quality of the data? Because I don't know what to do. Thank you.
