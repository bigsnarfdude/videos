Okay, so up next we have Pierre Jitsu, who will speak about trees, fixed points, and open armor. Point level primary. Okay, so this is joint work with Anne with Anne Longjo and Christian Pure. So they could not come here, so I took the liberty of representing them. And I think we put everybody who wanted to give the talk on the schedule, but if we forgot about somebody, or if you But if we forgot about somebody, or if you change your mind, let us know. There is still a free spot on Friday, it will still turn one of the discussion sessions into a talk. So, if we forgot about somebody, let us know. Our idea was to give everybody opportunity to talk. So, for this talk, here is the main concept that we'll be using. We will say that the group action Action on a space called the space X is decent if for any finitely generated subgroup G of the whole group acting. If every element of G is fixes a point, fixes a point of x, then the whole g fixes a point, and g has a And G has a global fixed point in X. In our paper, we add one more assumption, but for the purpose of this talk, this is what we will call to be a decent action. And I think most of you know this exercise that if t is a tree, let t Let T be, say, a simplicial tree, so a bunch of vertices connected by edges, etc. Then if you look at the whole automorphism group of the tree acting on the tree, then this action is decent. And if you And if you don't remember how to prove this theorem, this exercise, let me remind you what is the hint. Here, we look at a finitely generated subgroup G, so let's call its generators G1 up to the n. And each of these generators fixes a point. So let's look at the fixed point set of this generator. It's a sub-tree. Generator, it's a sub-tree. So let Ti inside of the tree be the sub-tree fixed by the I generator, GI, and then prove that all these trees intersect. So it was the first step to prove that each GI intersects. Each Ti intersects Tj and the way to do it is to do it by contradiction. So say we have this fixed point set Ti and another fixed point set Tj for the other element. If they are disjoint, you look at the shortest path. Joint, you look at the shortest path between them. You look at what Gi does with this path, it moves it somewhere here. You look at what Gj inverse does with this path. And then you can produce an axis of the action of this, the composition of gi of gj, since otherwise The composition of Ti and Tj would be loxodromic. You would be able to find the orange axis on which this element acts as a translation, so it wouldn't have a fixed point. This would contradict the assumption on G. And then, once you prove that pairwise these trees intersect, then in a tree using some sort of Haddock theorem, you would. Some sort of Haley theory will prove that all these finitely many trees. Questions about this exercise? Okay, so now to upgrade this a bit, let me do a second exercise. The second exercise is now we are looking at the second tree. So we take our tree t and then we look at the second tree. And then we look at the second copy of this tree called this T prime. And now we look at the action of the automorphism group of this product of these trees on the product. And this will also be decent. So this is decent. So So, since we've been discussing Katzier cube complexes, okay, the product of trees is an example of the Katzier cube complex, and Sagif proved that for a finitely dimensional cube complex, indeed the action is decent. And even for infinitely dimensional ones, the ones where there are no cubes of infinite dimension, Z of one. Jean of Wai nonje also proved that the action is decent. But for the product, you can do it in an easier way. So, let me give you an explicit solution on how to prove that the action of the product is decent, not appealing to the fact that this is a cat zero cube complex. So, what is this automorphism group? So, this automorphism group is equal, well, you can move around the first coordinate, you can move to the second coordinate, and then you can switch the two coordinates. So, this is the automorphism of the product of these. Is the automorphism of the product of trees? And the notation we often use for that is the red product. So it's just the automorphism group of one coordinate and then red product with zero. And now for the hint, I could prove that here, given a finally generated subgroup of this automorphism group whose every element exists at one, I would prove that there is a I'll prove that there is a global fixed one. So say we have a subgroup here that's finitely generated. And let's look at the subgroup that preserves the coordinates, that doesn't mix them. So let G0 be the intersection of G with the plus the automorphism group of T times the automorphism group of T. Well, then we can look at the projection of the subgroup to the factors and well it has to preserve a point of this tree and also preserve a point of that tree according to our exercise one. So if If the whole group G is equal to V0, well this finishes the proof. So assume there is an element G inside G that does not belong to G0 and suppose now, so by one Now, so by one, G fixes, when we look at the projection to the first factor, fixes some point T of the first tree. And then the claim for me to verify is that if we take the pair, this fixed point in the first factor, and the image of this point under the map that switches the colour. The map that switches the coordinates will be the global fixed point. So you can not take just arbitrary fixed point on the second coordinate, but you have to take the image of the first fixed point under the element that switches the coordinates. So I'm leaving for you to verify that this construction works. This construction works. But this does suppose to show you that dealing with products is in some sense easier with dealing with general adzeric complexes. Except that in our work with Anne and Christian, we want to discuss now infinite properties. So this is the main topic. So, what kind of infinite products do we discuss? So, suppose we have an infinite family of trees. Let t lambda parametrized over lambda be a family of trees. We can assume all of them are isomorphic for it to be more interesting. Or it would be more interesting. And in each of these trees, we fix a base vertex. With base vertex, it's called an x lambda. And now, instead of just looking at the whole product space of these trees, T lambda, we look at the following subset that we call the restricted product. That is the sum sign for that restricted. Is there some sign for that restricted product? Let it be the set of all points in the product, so all points y lambda, such that almost all coordinates, sorry, it should be y. All points with coordinate y on the parameter lambda. y on the parameter lambda such that almost all coordinates are equal to x lambda. So with all but finite Finitely many y lambda equals x lambda and if you look at it carefully you will see that this gives us on this restricted product we have a structure of a cadio cube complex. Only that now there are ascending sequences of cubes that give you these cubes of infinite dimension. Give you these cubes of infinite dimension. And now the question that one can ask, suppose now you have this, call this the restricted product X and now on X if you you can look at the automorphism of X action. Automorphism of x-axis. So again, we can now move each tree around, but we can also flip the coordinates, and now we've got really lambda main coordinates. So this is a huge group, but we can also look at different subgroups of this automorphism group acting on X. So when is an action of X? An action of a subgroup of the whole automorphism group descent and take a small break to see if the question is clear. We have this infinite product, but we take in this product only points that are somehow at finite distance to the base point. Does this? Cut zero cube complex. Cat zero cube complex of with infinite dimensional cubes. And if we look at all the automorphisms, we can move each tree, but we can also fill the coordinates. We are interested in some maybe more reasonable subgroups than the whole automorphism group. And the question, where is it? When is it this? We have fine degenerated groups here fixing with all elements fixed points. When can we say that these groups globally expand? You mentioned that if h is equal to what x, then the actions are really decent? No, then it's typically too large. So let me give you an example. So if we take this h to be too large, then there is the following counterexample. Remark that the answer is no. No? Or even if you take a very silly tree, so tree just an interval, two vertices joined by a single edge, and h equal to the entire automorphism group and the parameter space lambda infinite torsion groups. Somehow, if you because now when you think about it, what will be our group it will be just the red product of z2. This is now the Morphin group of the interval, and now you have to take the red product with. Have to take the red product with the, yeah, you can take just take alta infinite, but once you identify that, I would in a torsion group, I can look at this would be a finitely generated subgroup of the whole automorphism group of X. So now G will be a finitely generated subgroup of the whole automorphism group of this infinite cube, right? This space, this product here, when we just will be the product of this. This will be an infinite cube. You will not have a global fixed point for this Q group acting, but using the fact that all the elements here are a Elements here are a finite order, you will be able, if you think a bit about it, you will be able to find fixed points, centers of finitely dimensional cubes for elements of this group. So it's another exercise, but the point is that you cannot take this group to be too large. Okay, but sometimes the answer is positive, and this is the domain theorem. So, the main theorem with that it's yes. The answer for the question is yes. Or we take the parameter. We take the parameter space equal to be the projective line over some algebraically closed field. But you can just think of with the complex numbers and this is the Riemann sphere. Is the Riemann sphere. Let's think of this anti-space Riemann sphere. And this group H, not the whole group of automorphisms, but the group that acts nicely on the parameters. So on the Riemann sphere, we have a nice group of projective maps. And we will take all the And we'll take all the elements in the automorphism group of this product that permute the parameter space using projected maps. So H will be the frame edge of the projected group, PGL2K, acting on the projective line under the Obvious map going from the holdomorphism group of the whole product space. So now the tree can be arbitrary, but the parameter space has to be this projective line. And we want to take only those automorphisms of the product that permute that permute the base space using projective maps. So we limit the ways we can permute the parameters. You can permute the parameters. Any questions about statement? Any treatment. This might be the next thing that you're going to explain, but is there an intuition of why this is a a thing to look at, the projected line? So this is the thing we needed for an application. And it turns out that here actually you can prove something. Actually, you can prove something. So, like the other end of this example, here you have a finite general detortion group, and here you have the group that satisfies the this alternative. Projective maps have north-south dynamics typically on the Riemann sphere, and we can explore that on the group. Okay, so let me now tell you what this theorem can be used to. What this theorem can be useful when you're interested in algebraic geometry. So now we change gear. So we consider the following surface. So that's the productive line times the projective line. And we look at the vibration over the second factor. Projection onto the second factor. With vibration up to the second half. So I will think about this product as just the family of fibers. And now we will look at Jonquier transformations of this product. So, what is the Jean-Chier transformation of this product? Well, it's a particular birational transformation. I will give you an example in a moment. Of P1 times P1 respecting that equation. So we are looking at strong gear transformations from P1 helmets P1. P1 times P1 to P1 times P1. S, as soon as you compose with this projection, we want it to descend to some element inside PGL2. So, on the second coordinate, this transformation has to be nice. For example, We can look at the transformation that maps x, y to, and now on the second coordinate, we have some projected maps, say y goes to y. And on the first coordinate, we can now put some rational function, say x over y. Let me tell you, draw a bit what this example does. So we have We have this product that can be drawn like that. And if we look at the points, all the points with second coordinate zero, so say that this I represent these as my coordinates with second coordinate zero. So now the Second coordinate zero, so now the second coordinate is not horizontal but vertical. So all these points get mapped to infinity zero. So there is this point, let's throw it here, infinity zero, and all of this gets squashed into one point. If only If only x is distinct from 0. If x is distinct from 0, we have something non-zero divided by 0, that's important. So all these points are squared to that point. And on the other hand, if you look at this point 0, 0, then it seems not well defined. It's 0, 0 goes to 0 over 0. And in fact, it's blown up. So the point 0, 0 gets blown up. 0, 0, gets blown up to the whole fiber. Because if you think about the inverse, the inverse would have here x. Instead of this, you would have x times y. So anything times 0 would go to 0. If you've never seen that, these birational transformations are not well defined on all the points, and as you see, they are. All the points, and as you see, they are not objective, but still that can be written using rational functions. So, this collapses all x0, x distance from 0 to infinity 0, but it's not defined on 00, and one can think that it's being blown up, blows it up. Blows it up with the entire slide. Okay, so these are the kind of transformations that we want. On the base space, we've got a nice productive map, y goes to i, but now on the first you can have some mixture. Okay, so now in order to state the question we want to answer in algebraic geometry, I need to say what it means for a group to be bounded. So for that, for the mind. So for that for the moment we will identify this product with using a virational transformation just with the uh projective plane so up to blowing up and these kinds of operations uh they are they are the same and now on the projective plane it's easy to write down all birational transformations using polynomials. Transformations using polynomials. So good by rational transformations can be written. So if you have any transformation F, definitely not defined, but now actually you can think of what I'm writing now as a definition. Of P2, you can all of them write as one polynomial, second polynomial, and third polynomial. These are polynomials in three coordinates. So remember, P2 can be defined from the three-dimensional space, it has three coordinates. Now we have three polynomials in three coordinates, and these define, it turns out that these define in general. So it turns out that it's defined in general by rational mark on this projective plane with no fi polynomials. And now the degree of a birational map is just the maximal degree of these polynomials if they are written in this irreducible form. So and now we say that f is algebraic if all its iterates All its iterates. So f is a map from here to here, or maybe under the signification from here to here. For example, the Jean-Kirt transformation, and we say this algebraic is all its iterates at n have polynomials as above of uniformly binded grid. So you iterate, but the grid doesn't grow. Uniformly. Money from the bounded digital So, for example, if here I would just say xy, and here I would just add to x equal to. I would just add to x a polynomial and y. This would be an example of such a bounded degree of an algebraic transformation. Okay, so now I can state the question of Favrea that we are answering. Suppose we had a group, G inside the whole group of birational transformations. Of the projective plane, or in other words, of this product. And this is what's called the Cremona group. So this is a group that we are interested in. And now, suppose we have a finitely generated subgroup. So you see where we are headed. Finely generated. And all All and such that all elements of G are algebraic. Is there so there's a uniform bound on the degrees of these polynomials that appear in the red iterates for each single element. Is there a global uniform bound for all the elements? We can bound for all the elements of the group. Is there a uniform bound for this decrease for this decrease of all Of all adding the group simultaneously. And so Cantard managed to reduce this question just to the groups that are subgroups of Junkier groups. So this is a huge reduction because the Junkier group is a much smaller group. Strong cure group is a much smaller group than just the group of just the whole cremoner group. But still, people were not able to handle this case of G inside the group of John Care transformations. Maybe let's call this group J. So, in the last minute. So in the last minutes I'll try to tell you how this question so we managed to pick a positive answer to this question, and I will show you how and solve this question using the theorem on these infinite restricted products. Any questions about statement? So the application goes to the construction of the appropriate product of trees, which you can think of as this cat0q complex. So let me define this product of trees, this cat0q complex. So what will be a vertex of this cat0q complex? That will be Cat zero Q complex, it will be either this original surface, P1 times P1, or maybe a surface obtained from it, a surface obtained from our starting surface, P1 times P1, by a sequence of blow-ups and in ups and inverses and low ups together with the marker. So let me draw here what can happen. We start from our base surface and it's mapped just to the base one. Here is where the parameter lambda lives. And now we can grab a point on one of these fibers and can can blow it up, replace it by a projective line. Replace it by a projective line. So after blowing up, we will get here all the fibers will be still lines, except there will be one fiber where you will have these two lines. This point got blown up to a line, so we have these two lines projecting to a single point in the base. So these are the kinds of surfaces we are looking at. But you can proceed. You can now say blow up a point on another fiber, or you can blow down, if you blow down the thing. If you grow down the thing you've just blown up, then you get back here, but now you can blow down this one. If you blow down this one, you will get like this. You will still get another. If you look at the marking, we look at surfaces, but together with the maps to the original one. So we think of this map as the marking. It's similar to the situation where we discuss markings, when we define the type of error space. Define the type from your space. Look at these surfaces obtained from the original surfaces, but some modifications with the marking telling you what you actually did on the way. So, but the thing we don't allow, we don't allow to blow up too much points on a single fiber. So we require we allow only to blow up one point. The only low at one point for each fiber is either just a single P1, just a single birth flow line, or P1 with a single point low map. That's either this or this. So really what how you can change the fiber is you blow up the point and then blow blow down exactly what you Exactly, what you that I think that was the fiber before, and then and then you proceed. And it turns out that you can prove that you never go back if you do the sequence of blow-ups and blowdowns, and then as you backtrack, you never go back, and actually you see a tree structure of the surface you can obtain from this operation. And that's how you obtain a tree in one coordinate over one lambda, and then when you start doing in the other fibrillation, you get another tree, and this way you can. You can get your key structure. So maybe let me just say that vertices are adjacent. Expect that if they differ by a single dull, that they differ by a single block and And as I mentioned, there is a lemma to prove that when you look at this vertex set and this adjacency defines your edges, so this gives you the skeleton, this one skeleton of Of the product of trees, where the parameter space is this base projected line. And now on this space, how does the Jean-Kier group act? Well, it's exactly like for the mapping class group. You have an element, Jean-Kier group acts on this original base point by By these Jean-Quier transformations, so you can compose when you have your marking and just compose it with the Jean-Churt transformation. So, this is how Jean-Cure group acts on this product, by here composing at the end of the marking, composing the action of the Jean-Cure group on the complex. And now, if you want to answer Far's question, we take a finitely generated group. And it turns out that being bounded, having this uniform bounded. Having these uniformly bounded degrees exactly corresponds to fixing a point. So now, if all the elements are algebraic, this means that all elements of the group fix points in this product complex. So using the main theorem, you get that you get the global fixed point. So the group is bounded. So this is somehow fancy algebraic construction, but it boils down to the fact that performing this construct. To the fact that performing this construction on and on does not give you a cycle, that you get in each of the fibers, you actually get a tree, and you can understand the structure of the whole set of surfaces you can get from this as this infinite restricted product. And this is how we can realize that this is only a theorem geometric group here that you need to solve not on general categorical complexes, but just these special ones. If you understand that from the If you understand that from the base space, and ground tier transformations do act as these projective transformations of the base space, as I explained then. Thank you. So, I mean, lots of groups has fighted in terms of rights, not just at least group, whatever. So there's some sort of whatever one can say about sort of... Yeah, so that's what Chris is working on in his PLD. For example, he's looking what happens when in the base space you don't have the GL2, but you have GL3. So right now he's thinking about GL3. He's thinking about trio. But it looks like it has something to do with the T saturn. But you have to go to the original proof of Ts. So that's the next thing to do. And there are other automorphisms than just the air transformation. Yes, but then they don't act. There are other transformations. Act, there are other transformations, directional transformations of this space, but then they don't preserve the vibration, they don't act on this complex. And there are some other spaces and some other complexes that people doing cremona would consider, and that's how they reduce to this case. Using these other spaces, they manage to reduce to this situation because somehow this group fixes a point of infinity of their favorite space, but they couldn't see. We're not able to see what these stabilizers of fixed points at their infinity do, and uh Esteemann constructed this new complex that actually picks up the information, breaks down the information what happens at infinity to precisely
