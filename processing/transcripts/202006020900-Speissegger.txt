Also, today we'll have the coffee sessions starting one by one with twenty minutes intervals. So if you wish, you can get to any subset of them. Also, I'd like to remind you that there will be a group photo at 11, so right after the talks. And the photo will be taken just in Zoom. So if you don't want to be there, you're free to leave. And also, the video is recorded. So if you don't want to be on the recording, So, if you don't want to be on the recording, please don't turn your camera on. So, our first speaker today is Patrick Spiceke. And he'll talk about ominality and Hilbert's 16th problem. Thank you very much for the invitation to speak. It's a very interesting setup that we have now. So, this talk is going to be mostly a kind of survey. A kind of survey of a particular problem and of how we are trying to use model theory to answer some questions in dynamical systems. And the problem that I chose is Hilbert 16th problem, which those of you who have heard of it before know is a notoriously difficult problem. I'm not proposing that I know how to. I'm not proposing that I know how to solve it. But, you know, I'll try to give a few ideas on how model theory could contribute to this endeavor. So this is joint work with Seynab Galal, my former student, and Tobias Kaiser from Passau. So the setup is quite simple. We fix a vector field on the plane R2, so real vector field. And we are interested. And we are interested in principle in describing the phase portrait of F, of this vector field. The kinds of things that tell you what the phase portrait can be, the kinds of things you're looking for, we already saw that yesterday in Elisanda's talk, are the following. So you can have singularities, meaning points where the vector field doesn't assign a direction. The direction, so it's zero. Those are the kinds of points that Elizanda was looking for yesterday. But other things may be what's called a limit cycle. So attractors or repellers. Those are periodic solutions that have no nearby periodic solutions. All nearby solutions either spiral towards that one or away from it, depending on the time direction of the vector field. Right, so you need to know these kinds of things before you can draw a full-face portrait. And well, here's an example about limit cycles, right? Linear vector fields are known not to have any limit cycles. I think you learned that in a very early class on differential equations. This is one of the first results that you learn about. Learn about. But that's really all we know. So, just to connect these notions to Dave Marker's talk from yesterday, so already here, these two types of things that we're looking for, the singularities and the limit cycles, they're actually quite different beasts. The singularities, those are the ones we can usually compute. Are the ones we can usually compute with, as we saw yesterday in Elisanda's talk, or we can find them more or less explicitly by solving equations, this equation f of x equal to zero. What this means in model theoretic terminology is to say the following, that if I look at the structure on the real field, so where we just have the structure from yesterday of the real field with the ordering and equal. Field with the ordering and equal and zero and one and plus and times, right? And you add one more distinguished set, namely the graph of the function f or the vector field here, the map f, then the structure generated by that contains the zero set of f. So it's definable in this structure. So whereas the limit side. Whereas the limit cycles are much more transcendental. So the set of limit cycles, even right, there's not an obvious expression for that, and in fact, it is not definable in that same structure. So looking for limit cycles, we expect to be a lot harder than looking for singularities. Now, what else do we need to know if you want to describe the face portrait? So So, well, it is possible. So, as an example, it's possible to have a C infinity vector field on the plane which has infinitely many limit cycles. How can we get something like this? I didn't draw a picture, but think of a vector field with a center singularity. That means that all nearby trajectories are closed and turn around this one singular point. Around this one singular point. Just think of the plane and the vector field defining the circles centered at the origin. Patrick, may I interrupt you here? Could you go to the previous slide? There are a couple of questions I think about it. Okay. So one question is by Alexei. Alexey, could you ask it in voice? Yeah, so does it still make sense to ask if your x is in complex numbers, not necessarily in real numbers? Well, there is no difference. Well, ask which question? Oh, f of x is equal to zero. Yeah, sure. You can look for the singularity in the complex plane too, yeah. And you restrict those real numbers, what's the reason? Well, because so C2 and R2, right, they have different real dimensions. So the kinds of things that I'm, well, what's the reason? The reason is that Hilbert asked the question for the real situation. So it's really, that's the reason. The problem is open in the real case. The problem is open in the real case. It's completely open as far as I know in the complex case. I don't even know if it makes sense to talk about things like limit cycles in the complex situation on C2. It's just a question about f of x is equal to zero, so it's a solution of system equations. Well, that's for singularities, yes. But limit cycles are not, like I said, they're not definable in any way, even with the vector field data around. Tada around. Okay. And when you talk about some web behavior, is it really exceptional or does it actually occur in applications? Which kind of behavior? Some behavior that you consider bad or exceptional. Some exceptional behavior. Well, I haven't gotten to the point there where I. I haven't gotten to the point there where I look for particular behaviors, right? You have example on your slides right now. Right. So this particular example, right, has what I would call somewhat bad behavior because you can construct such a vector field with infinitely many limit cycles. So and the question that I'm going to be addressing is whether in certain cases you can avoid that. You can avoid that. So let me continue, and then maybe you'll see what I mean by this, okay? So yeah, so we can get such a C infinity vector field from, say, the vector field that defines the circular that are all concentric at the origin, the circles concentric at the origin. And you can use the C infinity function e to the minus 1. infinity function e to the minus 1 over x to perturb the vector field in such a way to easily produce one with infinitely many limit cycles approaching the origin. So for C infinity vector fields we can have infinitely many and when you if you do accept that the question becomes is it possible that infinitely many limit cycles you know pile up somewhere in the sense of Hausdorff dimension or Hausdorff limit. Dimensional host of limit. And they do. So, in general, what one says is: if you would have infinitely many limit cycles piling up towards a set, these limit sets are called limit periodic sets. They're just a name. And the question is: what do they look like? Certainly, if there are infinitely many limit cycles, they matter if you want to describe the phase portrait. Okay, and so one example of such a limit periodic set is what's called a poly cycle, and so I'm now going to share a different screen with you to show you one of these. All right, can you see this? So this poly cycle, it's a Jordan curve which is made up out of singular points of the vector. Singular points of the vector field, so in this picture P1 up to P5, and they are connected by trajectories of the vector field that emanate from one of the singularities and finish in another one, right, in such a way that you have actually a directed Jordan curve determined by the vector field. So, right, these kinds of polycycles can appear. Polycycles can appear if you have infinitely many limit cycles, they can appear as the limiting set where they could pile up towards. So now one thing that Dulag proved in the 20s is that if I assume my vector field to be real analytic, which means it's local. Analytic, which means it's locally given by convergent power series. We know conversion power series in this case. And if you also, we said we had a vector field on the plane, but if you also, if it also is not too bad at infinity, so that really in the sense, I want to say that in the s sense that it extends to a real analytic vector field when we add the point at infinity or we go on the sphere as two. Or we go on the sphere S2. Under that assumption, every possible limit periodic set is actually a polycycle. So that's not obvious, but Dulac has proved that. So really, polycycles seem to be the kinds of things we also have to worry about if we want to understand the phase portrait of such a vector field, at least in the real analytics setting. Real analytics setting. So now maybe it's time to formulate the two problems that I will talk about. So there is Dulac's problem, the same Dulac who proved this fact, which is to show that if X does extend to a really analytic vector field on the sphere, then it can have only finitely many limit cycles. And the reason why he was And the reason why he was posing that problem is because he was trying to understand a slightly older problem, and that's Hilbert 16's problem on the list. In fact, it's the second part of Hilbert 16's problem. The first part is about semi-algebraic sets in the plane. So the second part is about limit cycles of polynomial vector fields in the plane. Fields in the plane. So polynomial vector fields are pretty much real analytic ones. And so he just threw out this statement saying not only do polynomial vector fields have finitely many limit cycles, but the number of limit cycles is uniformly bounded as long as you bound the degree. Yeah, it's an interesting problem to throw out there and it's completely. Problem to throw out there, and it's completely open. So we know the case where d is equal to 1. I mentioned that before, there are no limit cycles, so h of 1 would be 0. h of 2 is not known, not even known to exist at this point. Okay, so what I'd like to do is Do is a bit of the following. So, Dulac, he actually proved Dulac's problem, or well, almost. I'll get a little bit, say a little bit more about that as we go along. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to indicate how I think maybe model theory might help extend deluxe proofs. Extend the Lux proof to approach Hilbert 16th problem, to get uniform balance on the number of limit cycles. Okay, that's kind of the goal here. So in order to understand what I would like to do, I have to start talking about how Dulac proved his problem. Okay, and yes, there's a reason why I'm not quite stating this as Dulac's theorem, and again. Dudac's theorem, and again, as we go along, I will explain what that reason is. So, Dudac's proof, again, he's trying to prove that there are only finitely many limit cycles, assuming the vector field is real analytic, including at infinity. So, that means we have to somehow count limit cycles of this vector field, right? And again, Vector field, right? And again, how do I even define the set of limit cycles? It's very hard to do that. His idea is to reduce the counting of limit cycles to the counting of points in some sense. And this idea is actually an old one. It's due to Poincaré. And I'm going to show you a picture now of what Poincaré had studied. It's the same question. But in a special setting. So here on this picture, the black cycle is a cycle of the vector field. Now cycles are polycycles, right? They're polycycles with no singularities on them. So that's a special case. And what Poincaré was studying is the question, can you have infinitely many limit cycles of the vector fields pi? Cycles of the vector fields piling up towards the cycle, the black one. And in order to answer this question, here is what Proanque did. He introduced this line on the picture, a transverse line to the vector field. He introduced a coordinate, a single real coordinate on this line with zero at the intersection point of the line with the here, with of the line with the cycle. With the cycle. And then he defines the following map. If you start at a point P on this transversal, but not zero, but close enough to zero, you can follow the trajectory that goes through the point P. It will kind of stay close to the black one and eventually come back and intersect again the transverse line. Transverse lap. So the map that takes P to this next point, R of P, is called the point where it's first return map. So now you can see if R of P is equal to P, then I started on a cycle. So in fact, I can define cycles as the fixed points of this return map, at least near zero. And correspondingly, a limit cycle is an isolated fixed point of this return map. Which means if I want to count limit cycles near the black cycle there, all I have to do is count isolated fixed points of this return map near zero on both sides. Okay, so instead of counting limit cycles on the plane, I'm counting points. Limit cycles on the plane and counting points on the line. I mean the isolated fixed points of the return map. So this is Poincaré's example and in the case where the polycycle is a cycle as in is the case here in Poincaré's example, right? Well, Well, we do win somehow, right? We don't win because the problem with this return map is it's highly transcendental too. In general, the return map is not in any way related to the vector field. It doesn't even satisfy a nice differential equation. Never mind an algebraic equation. So that seems a little disappointing, but Disappointing, but it does satisfy something else, a much more transcendental condition, which is that it is itself real analytic at zero. So it's itself given by a convergent power series near zero. And if you have a map like that, you know that you can only have finitely many isolated fixed points near zero. So in this case, right, that's the proof. You cannot have infinitely many limit cycles near a side. Many limit cycles near a cycle. So, what Dulac then tries to do is to extend the exact same idea to polycycles. All right, so let me. Yes. Sorry, there's a question about whether return map is known to be differentially transcendental, or it's just nobody could come up with. There are examples that are known, yes. Examples that are known, yes. So it depends on the vector field, right? For a very nice vector field, it might be a very nice map, but in general, yes, they are differentially transcendental. Okay, thank you. So there are examples like that around. Yeah. What does it mean for a map to be differentially transcendental? Meaning it does not satisfy any differential equation over the same data as the vector field is defined over. So in this case, polynomial. So in this case polynomials with polynomial coefficients. Does it help? Well, maybe we can discuss it a little bit. For a map to satisfy. Right. So the map, right? This is a one-variable map. So it would be an ordinary differential equation. And it doesn't satisfy any in general. This is essentially a function. This is essentially a function. It's a function, yeah. It's a real function, right? I defined it at an interval near zero. The coordinate x on the trend, that's all it is. Yeah, it's a one-variable function. Make sense? Okay, I'll continue and maybe we'll see if you have other questions. All right, so. All right, so um yeah, I was going to share with you the corresponding picture in Lila's strategy for that um polycycle that we looked at earlier. So here is that polycycle um right same polycycle as before. So now what Deluxe does say is okay, let's draw this transverse line here, which I was drawing. Restoring is serrated. Same idea on this line. We have one real coordinate, x, right? We set it equal to zero at the intersection point of the transverse line with the polycycle. And now if I start near enough on the transverse line, follow the corresponding trajectory, sorry for the wiggly stuff, around the vector field. And until it comes back here, we get a return map, this time for the poly side. This time for the poly cycle. Okay, so let's call this return map R of X. Now, the difference between Proen-Carrier situation and this general polycycle situation is that in Proen-Carrie situation, the return map was real analytic at zero. And here, it's not going to be. So, most of them are not real analytic at zero. So, this is where the tricky stuff comes in. How do we mimic Poincaré's proof if they are not real energy at zero? And of course, they're still very transcendental, differentially transcendental. So, we kind of want to mimic this. So, remember that being real analytic at zero means that the Taylor series you see infinity at zero and the Taylor series converges and gives you the function back. And gives you the function back. Okay, so the function is determined by its Taylor series at zero. So Dillard was thinking, well, maybe the same thing is true for these functions. So he proved the following. And let me get back. He proved that indeed this return map for the Pulley cycle does have an asymptotic expansion, let's call it R hat. Okay? Our hat at zero. The problem, one of the problems with this expansion, though, is that it's not even a power series in general, and it's certainly not convergent in general. So what it is in general is that it involves powers of x as well as powers of log x. So now these kinds of series are called train series, but do like they're going to. Trained series, but Dulak didn't call it that. The ones appearing as asymptotic expansions of these return maps are now often called Dulac series. And then, just like in Poincaré's example, one would like to know that the map, the return map R of X is uniquely determined. Our Vix is uniquely determined by this asymptotic expansion. That's called quasi-analyticity. Okay, and you see, that's where the problems with why I didn't state this as Dulag's theorem before comes in. Dulag did prove part one, it's a very interesting proof too, he used a resolution of he developed a resolution of singularities argument for this that's still being used in many areas of ODEs. In many areas, 40 E's. But for point two, he just assumed if the asymptotic expansion happens to be x, then the function had to be x. So he assumed quasi-aneticity, did not prove it. Okay. And that was interesting, right? It was published in 1923, and nobody noticed this until Ilyashenko gave a course on that in 1981 and realized there's a hole here. There's a hole here. And so then he and independently etc. They filled that gap in the 90s, each one by publishing a book that is much longer than the original proof of Deluxe. So that's just part of the colorful history of this problem. Hilbert 16's problem has a much more colorful history even, but I won't even go there. It's long and windy. And windy, and it's still ongoing, too. But we now generally do believe that Dilag's problem is proved, and I certainly will assume it in this talk. Okay, so back to Hilbert 16's problem. So there is deluxe strategy, and now I'd like to see if I can somehow use model theory to well. To well make some headway on Hilbert 16's problem. So for Hilbert 16's problem, let's fix a degree D and look at the collection of all polynomial vector fields of this degree. This, by the way, is a definable family in the real field. It's not hard to see that this is the case. And the problem now is that The problem now is that if we have a family of vector fields, it's now not enough to just count limit cycles of one vector field near a polycycle of that vector field. Now we have to worry about limit cycles coming from nearby vector fields when you perturb the parameter a bit. And that makes a lot of things a lot more complicated. In fact, for example, there are more complicated limit periodic There are more complicated limit periodic sets than just poly cycles. But I won't even go there. There is not really all that much known about this situation, right? I want to stick to the situations where we know that the limi-periodic sets are still only polycycles and then focus on that. So, Hilbert 16's problem can be actually Right, can be actually reformulated in terms of counting limit cycles near these polycycles or limit periodic sets in the following way. So this is a so-called finite cyclicity conjecture due to Roussaille. And the reason why this works is how you can define the collection of all polynomial vector fields of degree. All polynomial vector fields of degree d, the parameter space of that definable family is actually compact because when you multiply a vector field by a positive scalar function, you don't change the phase portrait. So it's really a projective space that parametrizes this family. It's a compact parameter space. And again, all the polynomial vectors. All the polynomial vector fields, for a similar reason, actually extend real analytically to the sphere S2. So they're actually really a family of real analytic vector fields on the compact sphere with a compact parameter space. And so if you want to have a uniform bound on the number of limit cycles, you only have to show that you have uniform bounds locally around each point in the parameter space and around each Point in the parameter space and around each polycycle on the sphere. Okay, that's what the finite cyclicity conjecture is. Yeah, so the only question then is how do we actually count poly, well, limit cycles near a polycycle in the parametric situation? Okay, and there's a problem there. So just like in the picture from before, let me Just like in the picture from before, let me share that again with you. We have the limit cycle here. Now this limit cycle corresponds to a particular parameter mu, and we have the return map now r mu. The problem is if I perturb the parameter a bit, this r mu prime might not even exist. Why not? Not let's look at this picture. Same poly well, no. What happens to a polycycle? What can happen to a polycycle when you perturb the parameter is this. It could be that the polycycle breaks. And the poly cycle breaking means that even if I start with the trajectory inside here, after going around once, it might escape. So, the return map is not defined anymore. And this kind of phenomena can happen arbitrarily close to mu. This is called bifurcation phenomena. Now, for counting limit cycles, this is not necessarily a bad thing because, of course, when this happens, there can't be any limit cycles nearby. So, we shouldn't have to worry too much about this. And the thing is, we don't. About this. And the thing is, we don't if we do the following thing. Let me just show you one more picture. So, this is this I drew with computer help because it gets a little bit involved. Patrick, we're a little bit over time. Oh, see, yeah, I just wanted to show this picture, right? If you introduce all these extra transversal types as in the picture. As in the picture, you can decompose the return map into a composition of finitely many so-called transition maps that go from one segment to the next around the polycycle. In this case, in a picture, it goes from left to right, goes clockwise. And even though the return map may not be defined for permuted parameters, The transition maps are defined near pi for all parameters. That's the key point here. So I can use these transition maps instead to count the number of poly, the number of limit cycles nearby. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't get to finish this properly. This took longer than I expected. Yeah, so I guess I can explain more outside of this. Okay, thank you, Patrick. Other questions? Please just unmute yourself or if you wish to ask in the chat. I will post the slides and There will be additional opportunities during the coffee break. Sorry? There will be additional opportunities during the coffee break to ask questions. Right, yes. But okay, maybe let me just ask a question. So would it be possible to say in like two sentences why model theory is you think can be helpful in this particular problem? So how you Problems. So, how you understand that this problem is one you would like to tackle with this machine? So, just like in Poincaré's case, you reduce the counting of nearby limit cycles to the counting of certain points in a set. And so, what I get here is using these transition maps, I can actually define the number of points on any Number of points on any one of these segments that lie on limit cycles. And so, what model theory then does is, aha, so I have, I can, the number of points, the points that I'm looking for, they lie on this set, which is definable with the, if I use these transition maps as distinguished sets in a structure. Okay, and so then the real question is: knowing that there are only finitely many for each parameter of these things, does that imply there is a uniform bound on them? There has to be a uniform bound on the number of points in these sets, independent of the parameter. And that's the kind of question that model theorists are very. Model theorists are very good at studying, and in fact, the notion of homonimality that we saw in Dave Marker's talk is one of those situations where we know this to be true, that if you know every fiber in a definable family is finite, then you know there's a uniform bound on it. So that's how I would like to use model theory in this situation. Okay, thank you, thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Let's thank the speaker. Sorry if I not take enough time. We can talk more in the coffee session. So in the next talk.
