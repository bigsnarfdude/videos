Not theoret. So let M be an a three-dimensional manifold oriented with or without boundary and a link is an embedding of a bunch of circles into M and And one circle embedding is called a knot. And in not theory, we consider those links up to isotopy, which means the formations where you are not allowed to pass one piece of string through another. And historically, main problem of Note Theory was to distinguish between different links. For example, you have a trefoil, and you want to prove that this trefoil cannot be. Therefore, cannot be untied, cannot be the form to the unknot, nor to, say, figure eight knots and you can use algebraic topology for that with some success, but really the best invariants we have of links. Okay, so what are invariants of Links okay, so what are invariants of links? Well, the certain quantities, algebraic quantities, usually which we associate to notes or links and which are preserved by the isotopes. And then if you can associate to this knot and this not different quantities, then you know that they are different knots. And so the best invariants which we have of notes and links come from, are inspired by quantum physics. And perhaps the most basic example of that is. The most basic example of that is the John's polynomial, which you may have heard about. And I'm going to remind you guys in a moment what it is. However, I'm going to define a version of it, which is called the Kaufmann bracket, which will be more practical for our purposes. Okay, so this invariant is defined by a theorem of Kaufman, which says that Says that there is a bracket function on the set of all links in R3. Okay, so I guess I need to slow down a little bit. So first of all, for the purpose of the Kaufman bracket, we need to consider frame links. And that means that we are not embedding just loops, but annuli. binding just loops but annuli into into the manifold m i here is just the unit interval and so and this this framing frankly is just a minor technicality so which is needed for the theory but it is not really big deal so we'll i'm not going to spend much time about this anyway To spend much time about this, anyways. So let's maybe L of M be the space of all the set of all framed links in M and so that now the Cauffen bracket goes from L of R3 or S3 into the ring of Laurent polynomials in A. And it satisfies the following properties. Whenever Whenever you have a link and you see a crossing, then this crossing can be replaced by two types of smoothings, this one and this one, and they form the following relation on the Raufman brackets. Something like this is called the scan relation. And the second relation is very simple. It's very simple. It says that you have link with untied trivial components. Then it is just L. Well, okay, so the bracket of that is just the bracket of L times this factor. This is a strange-looking factor, but it's the only factor which is consistent with the first relation. All right, so Kaufman proved that such a Haufmann proved that such an invariant exists. And in fact, it's unique. Well, the uniqueness is kind of easy. And in fact, it's given by those Keynes relations that it's very easy to compute this invariant for any link. Yes, if you have any diagram, you can use the first relation to resolve all the crossings. And then the second relation allows you to assign values to. Assign values to loops, to collections of trivial loops. So, uniqueness in particular is also easy. And as I said, this is a version of the Jones polynomial. So, in particular, this the bracket of the trepoil will be different than the bracket of the unknot and different than the bracket of figure eight. I don't know how I wrote equalities. Obviously, they are not equal. In fact, this bracket allows us to In fact, this bracket allows us to show that they are not equal, they are not isotopic. So now with this simple invariant of links, it's natural to ask whether a similar invariant can be constructed for links in other manifolds other than S3 or R3. And this leads to the notion of scale models. Modules. Okay, so again, we have this arbitrary manifold M, and to define the scale module, I need to take a certain ring, so a commutative ring with invertible element A in it. So, for example, I could consider the same ring as here, Laurent polynomials in Z with Z coefficients, but it will be useful to consider. But it would be useful to consider other ones. For example, it would be useful to consider, say, complex numbers and A to be any non-zero number in them. And then, what's a scale module? Scale module of M Of M is well, it's just a formal, it's a vector space over R, so R module, three R module, with the basis given by all print links in M. And by the way, I want to include a link of zero components here. A link of zero components here, which is the empty set. So include the empty set here. And so we take this R model with basis given by all the links, isotopy types of links, and you quotient that by the scale relations which you see here. So the relations say that a crossing should be equal A times this moving plus A inverse times this moving and that the unknot. unnot should be should be equal this much okay in slight simplification uh yeah of notation you can just say this so you consider those formal this formal this consider this quotient of this model which has of course infinite number of generators it has It has infinite basis. All right, so this is the scale model of M. What is it good for? Well, now, obviously, we have an invariant, which we can also denote by bracket, going from all links in M to the scale model of M, where you send any link to its class, its class in this quotient, in the scale model. This quotient in the scale model. So it's a very simple construction. We have an invariant of links, but frankly, I achieve this construction by shifting difficulties because the invariant is very simple, only because its values are some object which is not very easily describable. It acquires its definition. It requires, this definition requires, of course, infinite number and widely number of generators and relations. So, of course, the practical value of this invariant is when, well, this invariant only has practical value when you can actually compute this k model. What does it mean? Well, when, for example, when you can prove that this model is free with certain specific basis, then you have invariant of links in M. And in general, this is a And in general, this is a very hard problem. Computing the scale models is a hard problem. To describe well to compute free, you just mean free over this column over R, yes. Yes. So Yes, so ideally you would expect that it would be maybe free and you find the basis and then you have very concrete invariance of things. But frankly, often it's not free. And so things are even more complicated, not to mention that it's very hard to compute. So, okay, so these are the screen models. They were introduced by Przititsky and Turaev independently a while ago. And the initial motivation was having invariance of links. Motivation was having invariance of links in manifolds, but these days we studied them because of their rich theory, connecting them to many areas of mathematics and physics, like geometric Langlands program, and the fear of holonomic systems and D-models and the cluster algebras and well, and also enumerative geometry. Enumerative geometry, and apparently also a theory of Higgs bundles and string theory through that. There is a paper by Pierre Boussaud, who talks about the connections to enumerative geometry of those K models and to Higgs bundles. Well, but now, because they're difficult to understand in this food generality, In this food generality, let us consider a very simple scenario to try to understand them better. And that scenario will be by taking maybe I should consider different boards, but not this one. All right. So maybe I can erase it. Maybe I can erase it. So, what would be a simple scenario? Well, when R is just, say, complex numbers and A is plus minus one. And then, when you look at those relations, oh, they are here. In this case, what relation do we have? Well, we have We have a relation which says that crossing is equal to plus minus one smoving, plus minus the other's moving, and that the unknot has value minus two. Bring it back now. If you rotate those pictures 90 degrees, then you see that other crossing, well, will be equal to this. Will be equal to this moving plus minus this moving. And now you can notice that there are two lines. Those two lines are really the same. So what does that mean? Well, it means that really you get a terrible invariant of links. For a equal one or minus one, you get a terrible invariant of links because you can pass, you can change crossings. So links are really now. So links are really now considered up to homotopy really by this relation. But even in this case, you know, it's a very interesting object, this K-model. So what's that? Well, first of all, I want you to observe that in this setup, this relation allows to define a product. So you can define now product of two links to be just a disjoint union of them. Union of them. In general, this wouldn't make sense in M because there's no really well-defined notion of the disjoint union of two links which are only up to isotopy, defined up to isotopy. Like, for example, you know, if you are in RP3, say, and I give you one link up to isotope and another up to isotopy, there's no canonical way to say. Isotopic, there's no canonical way to say what's their union. But if you are allowed to change crossings, it doesn't matter. You just take any disjoint union, and all of them are related by crossing changes. So this makes sense in this setup. So which means that by extending this product linearly, it means that this is really an algebra. Some, in fact, commutative algebra. And you can ask what kind of commutative algebra is that? Well, there's a theorem which I approve with Chititsky. And also, a version of it is by Bullock, which By Bullock, which says that the scale model, the scale algebra really depends only on the fundamental group of M. And in fact, this is the coordinate ring of the SL2 character variety of M. Okay, so this requires some. Okay, so this requires some clarification. So, what is that? Well, this is the space of representations of pi one of m into SL2C quotiented by the SL2C action. This quotient This quotient is in the sense of geometric invariant theory. So, I guess, you know, many of you would call it here, I guess, the Betty moduli space of representations of M. And for the experts, I should make one comment that this is in the sense of SER or Of SER or in the sense of algebraic varieties, well, algebraic affine schemes. And that means that this object may be non-reduced. And what does it mean? Well, it means you can consider this coordinate ring. This is the coordinate ring. And this coordinate ring may have nearpotent elements, non-zero nearpotent elements. And then there is this more naive definition of character variety. Definition of character variety, which I would denote by straight x. It also has a coordinate ring. So this is a nine algebraic set. And well, this coordinate ring is obtained from this one by quotienting by the new radical. But this is. But this is maybe important for the theory, but not really for this today's talk. So we don't need to worry about this. So Bullock Theorem was for the version up to nil potents. Yeah, so as you guys know, Yeah, so as you guys know, this is very important, of course, object in geometry, in physics, in quantum field theories, but it's also important in low-dimensional topology. Well, number one, by through this connection to quantum topology and also through, say, Kooler-Shayland theory. Okay, so I should perhaps explain at least how this isomorphic works, how this isomorphism works. How this isomorphism works? Well, on the left side, we have knots, but after crossing changes, so you can think of them as loops. So on the left side, you have loops. On the right side, you can associate to each loop its trace function. Yes. And this trace function will send each. Percentage equivalence class of rho to the trace of rho at gamma. Yeah, so is there any different agents possible? Yes, so the way it really works is it works better for the minus here. For the minus scale, okay. So, this small challenge here, yes, because you would want this to be two, and it's minus two. And also, there is a problem with the framing, which I didn't go into. And to avoid the problem with the framing, it's better to take minus one. And then you make it work by putting minus sign here. So, yes, there are certain details which I have hidden under the rack, but then you can use speak. Under the rack, but then you can use spin structure to relate the plus one value to the minus one value. Okay, we say without a spin structure. So without spin structure, you should take minus one, then you don't have problem with framing, because turns out that the framing is minus a to the minus third that, or maybe plus third, plus plus three. Plus three. So with minus one, there's no problem with framing. With plus one, it would be a problem with framing. Yeah, so the corollary of this is in particular. That the coordinate ring of the SL2C character variety of M is just the vector space of all multi-loops in M coefficiented by relation. Quotiented by relation that trigger loop is two. This is this is loop, this is not zero, and then a relation like that. All right, and this may look a little bit mysterious, but this scan relation, which has given you some intuition, I don't have time to go into details, but it's sort of reminiscent of this identity for SL2. Identity for SL2C matrices. Yeah, so one of the unexpected consequences of this theorem. Consequences of this theorem is that we get this geometric interpretation of character varieties, which is sometimes useful. And now moving on. A class of three-dimensional manifolds for which the theory of scale modus is particularly interesting is that of thickened surfaces. So now, so let M be M be a surface sigma cross I. Again, I is the unit interval. And then why this is interesting? Because there is a product on the scan model of that, where L1 times L2 is L1 over L1 over L2. Okay, this is our I. Okay, this is our I. So, this is also this joint union, but specific one. And because we have this I-bundle structure, this makes sense for any A. Remember, the previous one, the previous product relied on the fact that A is plus or minus one. This is for any A. And so you get in this way a non-cumminative algebra, which is called. Which is called the scane algebra of sigma and denoted by S of sigma. All right, perhaps it would be good to have some example. So the scale algebra Fetorus is the following. You take ring algebra over R in two variables. Variables, M and L, or Laurent variables, and they don't commute. That's why I use those brackets, but they Q-commute, or in our terminology, they A-commute. So they satisfy this property. And then there is an involution on this ring, on this algebra. The involution will send M. Then the Russian will send m to m inverse and l to l inverse. So, in fact, you need to take now the invariant part under this involution. Yes, and you know, this is called quantum torus. The stuff inside is called quantum torus in quantum algebra. And this invariant part is going to. invariant part is considered in people in non-committed people in non-committed with geometry consider this this whole thing and they complete it and they call it the non-cummutative torus so this is one of the one of the most basic examples of non-cumminative spaces in in non-cummutative geometry and how the relation works well the meridian goes to m plus m inverse and longitude plus m inverse and longitude goes to l plus l inverse and for higher genus surfaces well the scan algebra can be considered as what well as uh you know through this theorem which we discussed Which we discussed, the a equal one version or minus one version is the character variety. So, scale algebra can be considered as some sort of a quantization of the character variety. And yeah. Yes, so torus has, you know, you can consider the meridian and longitude on a torus, so two curves which form the basis of parasomology. Which form the basis of course homology and I'm making this isomorphism explicit so the isomorphism will send those two curves yes these are the two basic loops yeah oh yes yes um but now there's no point of me changing this because you got to clarify yeah so Yeah, so you can consider for higher genera surfaces, you can consider their scale algebras. Unfortunately, we don't know their presentations except for very specific cases. But you have those quantizations of character varieties of surfaces, which without going too much into the details, they are like seem to be the optimal models for quantum Teischmüller spaces. And there are some other definitions of quantum Teischmüller spaces. Definitions of quantum Techmoder spaces by one by Chakov and Fock, another by Kashayev. And those definitions are only for punctured surfaces. This one is for all surfaces. And they are very closely related in case of punctured surfaces. All right. And finally, I can add that at rules of unity. At roots of unity scan algebras are a of surfaces are closely related to the SL2 quantum invariance. Of notes, of links, and of manifolds, of Witten Rashetkin Turayev. We can define them non-rigorously, and then Roshetkin Turayev define them in a rigorous way. And so, and quantum invariance and the associated topological quantum fields theoretical so. So now one can ask whether this can be generalized to other groups because we have quantum invariance for all semi-simple groups. And it can be done. So let G be now, say, SLN or summa n. And so it turns out that. So, it turns out that in order to develop scale theory for SLN, we have to go beyond just links, considering links. And instead of links, we need to consider other one-dimensional objects, specifically directed graphs. And those graphs are called n-webs. So, what are n-webs? N-webs are a Colonel and valence directed graphs well so unlike in Emily's talk, this will be webs in certain manifold M. So directed graphs in M each vertex is either sync or a source. And loops are allowed. Okay, maybe I should draw an example. So let's say something. Let's say something like that for n equal three. Well yes, and I can consider a look extra look here. This needs some sort of okay. This needs to be perhaps like that. This needs to be perhaps like that. Okay, so this is this is a free valent graph, and this is a sink, this is a source, this will be a sink, a source, so they're oriented, directed. Yep, and I think that that should be all consistent with the definition. Yes, so I used to use. So I used I defined this concept of n webs for n and I defined the notion of a scale model for SLN which generalizes the theory which I explained to you so far for SL2. Yes. Clarify what valency is? Three. Oh very valency means that each vertex has three edges ending or beginning at it. Okay. For n equal three. For n equal three. And maybe I'm not going to define to you for the sake of time, maybe I'm not going to define the scheme, the SLN scheme model in detail, but I can define, I can state the version of this PRM for SLN. So the PRM says the following. The theorem says that the coordinate ring of SLN character variety of M Of M is this vector space with basis given by all n-webs in M and this would be up to homotopy so crossings don't play a role quotiented by well Quotiented by, well, we had two relations before, and we have two relations now. The first relation would be that the trigger loop is just n. And the second relation is that if you bring a source and a sink together, then this is going to be a sum of all possible. All possible braids like this. Okay, well, actually, all possible permutations like this. So here I consider any permutation of n symbols. You can replace this sync and SORs by those strings permuting according to sigma. And here you have a sign which depends on the length of sigma, and length is the minimal number. And length is the minimal number of transp elementary transpositions in a presentation of sigma. So this is the version of the theorem which I described to you guys for SL2. For n equal to, this language talks about two webs. So when n is equal to two, you will have a web which looks something like that locally. That locally, so it is a graph, it is well, it is a loop, really, but it has sort of a local orientation. But there's a way to deal with that and really bring it to back to the formalism of Kaufmann brackets. So, and by the way, both this theorem and the theorem which I set stated earlier for n equal to works not just for any manifold, but for any three-dimensional manifold, but in fact for any topological space space. Topological space space. I mean, those relations don't require really a manifold. And well, okay, and so to make sense of it, of course, we again need a product here. So a product of two webs, say alpha and beta, is any disjoint union of them. So this is a commutative algebra. All right, and then there is a way to quantize or queue the form those relations, and this will lead to a sellen sc module. And basically, you replace this n by quantum integer n, and you replace this relation. What is that? This is anti-symmetrizer in the group algebra of symmetric group. You replace it by anti-symmetrizer in the Hecke algebra. And yeah, and then also you need one extra scale relation, but perhaps it doesn't matter here. Matter here. Again, because links or websites are considered aptohomotopy, you can consider any union you want. And it's uniquely, it's well-defined. Well, and you can say any disjoint union, although frankly, it doesn't have to be even disjoint. All right, well, so. So those scale relations are so the scale models, the relations of scale models are based on the relations between quantum invariance of links. Yes, and those I mentioned to you guys that those invariants were defined rigorously by Reshad Kin Turayev and they did it on the They did it on the basis of the theory of representations of quantum groups. So, let me say something very briefly about that. So, for any so dream field. So, the ring field defined for any simple, say, or semi-simple group, well, Lie algebra G or Lie group G defined two objects. Well, maybe here, okay, maybe he just defined one. Maybe here, okay. Maybe he just defined one object. So defined the quantum group UQG, which is the Q deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of G. And then associated with that, there's a dual object. So, dually, one can consider O G or O Q G, which is the Q deformation of the Lie group corresponding Lie group G. And these are called quantum groups. They have very interesting representation theory and Theory and sorry, and so we have quantum groups, which through its representation theory, their representation theory define quantum invariance of links and those invariants. And those invariants and the relations between them lead to scale models. But now I want to tell you guys about an arrow which goes in the opposite direction. So for that, I want to extend scale modules and consider not only, well, extend Extend scale models in the sense that I want to consider webs not only well, let me just explain this: so definition stated SLN scan model. Actually, maybe it will be just scan algebra so. So, this will be letter S for stated of sigma of surface sigma is defined as before, except that now I consider webs in sigma cross I with ends in the bundle of sigma. So, we allow n's of webs to be in the boundaries of sigma. Those n's need to be labeled or stated by one of the numbers between one of one and n. So each n is stated by a number. And you consider them by the same scan relations, meaning by relations which Which quantize those relations, and there are some local boundary relations. And then the reason this is interesting is because now for any surface, You can consider so for any surface sigma and arc alpha in sigma, which is splitting sigma. So with the boundaries of alpha must be in the boundary of sigma. That is the sigma. This is the sigma. You can consider alpha. Then you can split sigma into two pieces. So this will be sigma minus alpha. And there's a homomorphism which takes the stated scane algebra of sigma to the To the stated seccain algebra of sigma minus alpha of the split of the split surface. So when you have stated scane algebras, they're bigger algebras because they are built of webs which have entered in the boundary, but they allow you to consider, to analyze scan algebras through Through by cutting them along arcs and now we can consider the simplest, perhaps the simplest interesting example of a surface with boundary. Let's take just a disk. Just a disk, but remove the top, bottom points. So this surface now has two boundary components. And let's take this stated SLN scan algebra of the surface. And so what's that? Well, you can prove, and this is a theorem of Le and myself, which is that this is That this is the quantum algebra of matrices of SLN. So this is this object, which maybe still is here. This is a quantum group, or if you like, the dual object of the quantum group of Greenfeld. And And this theorem allows to present, well, clearly, this quantum group in a very geometric or scan way through pictures, through webs. Yes, and for example, all operations of the quantum group of QSLN can be seen visually. So, for example, this is a Hof algebra. Is a Hoff algebra. So it has a coproduct. Maybe I'll just call it OQ. So it has a coproduct. How do you see that? Well, you can see it through the splitting homomorphism because the splitting PRM tells you that there is a homomorphism. Like that, and this is just a tensor product of two copies of that bygone. So this is a bygone, yes. And this is the coproduct in the quantum group. Quantum groups also have antipodes. The antipod here will be just given by 180-degree rotation with some scalar normalization. So this language allows for there's more to say about this, but we have no time for that. Other than that, this language allows us to interpret many abstract concepts in quantum. Many abstract concepts in quantum algebra geometrically through scan theory. Okay, so that's why I said here that you can go from scan models all the way back to quantum groups. I should mention that this theorem for n equal to was a theorem of Le and Constantino. Theorem of Flair and Constantino. All right, so perhaps not everybody cares about scale models or scale algebras, but this theory has some applications going beyond them. And so, in particular, there are There are famous canonical basis of the quantum groups UQG and OQG, canonical basis by Lustik and Kashivara Lustik. And so in particular, they gave us basis of this K modules, this K in algebras. And in fact, we can generalize that. So, I think that's a good idea. So, we have basis of these objects, this K and L G plus, which are the same as OQ, that can be generalized. Well, we generalize them with Tangler to canonical based. To canonical basis of stated scale models of any surfaces. Right, so and so I think those should be interesting even when Even when A is equal one. But maybe, yeah, this is still a work in progress. Maybe this is actually a good place for me to stop and. To stop, and I'm looking forward to learn more about the work related to Higgs bundles. Perhaps somehow it will be understand better the relations between that and other work in this area. Thank you. Thanks very much, Adam, for the great talk. Much Adam for the great talk. Do we have questions? You have so I don't know if this is kind of already covered by what you're talking about. When you have that diagram from quantum groups into, I guess, yeah, these quantum invariants and these sky modules, is there somehow like an extension that you can do if you like focus on like compact quantum groups? Like, is there a, or is it kind of just a similar picture or? So I don't know of any, I don't think there are quantum invariance of compact groups, and maybe somebody will correct me, but this path is already not there. And the scale models are based on those. So, yeah, this is, of course, a very interesting question. Interesting question: how to extend this theory, and what does it mean to consider quantum compact groups in the context of scale models? Yes? So you mentioned these canonical bases at the end. So do they have any kind of like positivity property? Meaning, if you. Um, meaning if you like, if you would write like the product relative to that basis, would it yes have positive coefficients? I strongly believe this is the case, but certainly it is not known. There was a conjecture about positivity of basis of certain basis for even for Kaufmann brackets K-models, which was just recently proven, but it was a very difficult statement to prove. Okay, so it's not true, but you expect it's true. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Also, yeah, so also those bases basically will give certain nice basis of character varieties of surfaces. When I say basis, I mean basis of the coordinate rings of their character varieties of surfaces. And what does it mean nice? Well, positivity, for example. Also, also Character varieties are syntactic manifolds, and so you have Poisson pairing on the coordinate rings, and this Poisson pairing should be quite nice in terms of those bases. Maybe one additional thought is that you know. Thought is it just you know thinking about invoking the non-abelian Hodge theory that takes you from the character variety to the Higgs bundle moduli space? I mean, there you have the C star action, the algebraic C star action that you don't have on the character variety side. Do you anticipate that has any interaction with this picture? Well, certainly I would like to see how other moduli spaces come here into play in this sphere. And right now, I certainly don't see it. Yes, so I don't see the C-star action. Yes, so I don't see the C-star action. Any other questions for Adam? If not, let's thank him again.
