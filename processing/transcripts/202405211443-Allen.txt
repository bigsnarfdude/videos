is based on a paper that came out a month ago or so uh of the same title and i'll um so this is a project about social meaning behavior that affects others uh on any organismal level so um we have vampire bats sharing food uh we can have dolphin pack hunting sardines um and there's been a number of different theoretical approaches to studying Different theoretical approaches to studying abroad and social behavior. You can study it at the level of population genetics, like Marcy did in fundamental work with Mark Feldman. So just look at a gene affecting social behavior. How likely is it to take over the population? Evolutionary game theory, as we've seen a lot up here, is a more phenotypic approach where you're assuming strategies kind of replicate directly based on how they do interactions. Inclusive fitness is a very interesting. Fitness is a very individual-based approach where you look at kind of individual incentives and say, well, if an individual affects the fitness of every other individual by a certain amount, you then multiply it by the relatedness of the actor to the target and add them all up. And that tells you whether that behavior is slight. And then there's multi-level selection, which is less of a concrete method, but has to do with tension between competition within groups versus particular groups. So, I'm going to try to integrate all of these in some sense, but also deal with the challenge of non-linear integrations. And I think Jeremy set this up very well earlier. In real world social behavior, especially collective actions among many individuals, fitness depends non-linearly on the actions of multiple. So, in a sociable weaver nest, they build these large communal nests that persist. Large communal nests that persist, but they need to do a certain amount of maintenance or the whole nest falls. Right? So that's just not just like one individual contributing some focus amount to another, it's collective effort, some threshold of effort that needs that is necessary to maintain it. Kind of more dramatic for me is the living ant bridge where they lay themselves down for others to cross. Half a bridge is not half as useful as a whole, right? So the whole So, the whole is not the sum of the parts. But these models are challenging to analyze, right? Nonlinearity is always more difficult than linear situations. And in particular, for inclusive fitness theory, there's a challenge of how can one define the fitness contribution of every individual, say every individual ant or bird to every other in a nonlinear situation where their fitness effect depends on the patrons of cultural products. Depends on the paths of multiple bodies. And for me, the inclusive fitness controversy has always been about this question: how do we deal with nonlinear interactions? So we want to model nonlinear social evolution. And I also want to add in populations. So the nonlinear, this is really, I think, a great preprint by Marco Arceetti and colleagues that really just argues all situations that we really care about. All situations that we really care about in nature are non-linear. We're going to title this The Non-Tragedy of the Non-Linear Commons. Great title. And I want to look at this in a lot of different situations that have been considered. So in terms of group selection or family kin relationships or evolution on networks or explicit space or more flexible kinds of social assortment, right? Can we Right? Can we come up with a framework that allows all these different varieties of specs? So, this is a kind of abstract framework that I've been developing through a series of papers. I want to briefly lay out here. So, we're going to consider two alleles, single genetic locus. And these alleles can live in places. These places are going to be in individuals. They might also have specific spatial locations. Locations. Every half-boid individual is going to kind of contain one site. Diploids contain two sites, their two alleles. And so we can just record which allele is occupying which site. That's a binary variable, one for big A, zero for little A, and collect them all together into a binary vector or a bit string representing a population state. So in this case, we have five genetic sites, and that's how we represent this population state. And then stuff happens, right? So there's a current state, there is any kind of ecological interaction, non-linear game, anything you might want to add. This is where all the spice goes in. And then you have a new stick, right? These hardware transitions happen. And what I argue is, no matter what complexity you put in here, you're always going to have a mapping from Is going to have a mapping from the new state to the previous one in terms of how the alleles are inherited. And even if you have a diploid model with you know asymmetric mating and stuff like that, you'll always be able to map the inherited alleles in the next generation to their parental alleles in the previous generation. And there might be some mutation that occurs that changes the alleles. But as a mathematician, I like to say, what's the abstract thing going on here? The abstract thing going on here. And so I'm going to forget that spice moment. Let's just say the thing that I care about is this map. So the new allele in each site down there is survived or copied from some allele in the previous site. I'll call that alpha of G. So this is a mapping from the set of sites to its sets. And then we also have mutations that come in. Also, we have mutations that come in. That's going to be a subset of sites that acquire mutations. And we say, well, if a site is not mutated in that transition, then it inherits the allele from the variable. So xg prime equals x sub alpha g. And if it is mutated, then it gets the opposite of. Good so far? Feel free to interrupt your questions, by the way. So this is the basic framework. So this happens every time step. So, this happens every time step. And the likelihood of a certain mapping to occur depends on the current population state. So, in every state, we get a probability distribution over the pair of heritage mapping and mutation set. And so, this proceeds as a Markov chain. There's one main axiom that just says, well, it should be possible for a new allele to take over the population. So, you can see like that big A. See, like that big A allele is introduced in time step one and is taken over by time step three. It should always be possible for this to happen, otherwise, you don't really have an evolving population. And we can formalize this axiom, but I won't go through the details. And I want to also introduce parameters for mutation and selection. So it's a selection parameter that when it's zero, if there's no selection happening, then this No selection happening, then this parentage mapping shouldn't depend on the current state, right? So it doesn't depend on what alleles are there, it's just you have a certain probability of inheriting your allele from there or from there. Then there's a mutation parameter. If it's zero, there's no mutation. In that case, we get two absorbing states, all big A or all little A. If there is mutation, we get a unique stationary distribution of these states. Distribution of these things. And so, if we're quantifying selection, I'm going to say that whichever allele has the greatest frequency in the stationary distribution is the one that will say it's fake. So, when I say something's being selected, this is the criterion I'm using. Is it obvious that there has to be a unique stationary distribution of visual mutation groups that follows from that axiom that I breezed over before? Is that like a primitivity kind of thing? Yes, yeah, it's a prepared for venius, yeah. It's um, yeah, so it's an ergodicy, and it's proven from that axiom of basically complete gene as well. Um, okay, so this is the basic framework. Um, the allowed spices, what we can include in this model, is any kind of population structure. So, I haven't said how these sites related to each other. It could be a network, they could be divided into groups. Dividable groups. They could be like these two could be together in one individual, one haploid, one diploid individual. Reproduction can be asexual or sexual, mating does not have to be random, and then any kind of nonlinear fitness interaction is allowed. What is not allowed in this iteration of the framework, we're not allowing population size to vary. We're not allowing the structure itself to change. Allowing the structure itself to change over time. And this focuses only on one locus, two locals. So, general in some ways, but still kind of rigid in others. Okay, so now we'll start going into results. I do have a measure of fitness. Apologies to Joanna. It's short-term fitness. I'm calling it a fitness increment. So, you know, avoid attaching myself too strongly to this term. But it requires. But it records the, you know, how well my offspring are doing relative to how I'm doing. And it uses these reproductive values. So it's the change in, it's the expected reproductive value of my offspring minus my own reproductive value. If I survive, then this term. Survive, then this term gets canceled by a term over here. How are these reproductive values defined? Well, oh, wait. There we go. I labeled the terms there. To define the reproductive values, I'm going to specify that for neutral drift, all these fitness increments should be zero. That then gives me a recurrence relation that uniquely determines the reproductive value of each site. Value of each site. So, for example, for the death-birth model that Poano referenced yesterday, each site has reproductive value that's proportional to its degree. Okay, so we want to allow for nonlinear fitness interactions. And here I'm directly stealing an idea from Jeremy's 2015 paper on short and long-term social evolution. Term social evolution, where I'm going to say, whatever, however, the fitness might functionally depend on the current state, I can always write it in the form of a polynomial, where these polynomial terms here are products of the binary variables across some set of sites. So essentially, this x underscore s is equal to one if all. equal to one if all sites in S have the big A allele and equal to zero other ones. So this is a unique representation of any function of a binary vector. And the C S G coefficients, essentially they tell you what's the effect of all of some set having the big allele on the fitness of some type G. On the fitness of some type G beyond any effects that are due to proper subsets of S. So we can quantify kind of any degree of synergy using these polynomial terms. And then the other ingredient that we need is a measure of genetic swarm. And so there's different ways you can quantify it. I wanted something that connects to how relatedness is measured in inclusive fitness theory and other fields. Theory and other fields. So, this is a relatedness measure. It quantifies, essentially asks: if this set has all a big A allele, what's the likelihood that site G also contains a big A allele? And how much more likely is that relative to any other site in the population to contain the big A allele? Right? So it's it multiplies, you know. It multiplies, you know, this is all of S having big A, this is G having big A, minus the average population average of A, and it's normalized by the variance of big A in the population. Average over the stationary distribution, then take the limits of mutation goes to zero. So this takes a while to define, but it gives us a nice quantity that agrees with things like siblings have lay missed one half. So it agrees with classical. One half. So it agrees with classical relatedness measures in the pairwise case. It also has a nice relationship to identity by descent probabilities and coalescence lengths. Turns out, so the key quantity, if you're going to compute these in the neutral case, you want to find a total branch length of the coalescent tree for your particular set. And you kind of normalize that, and that gets you fine. Okay, so putting these ingredients together now. So, if we have this representation of fitness and relatingness as defined in the previous slide, we get a condition for selection. And it's a sum over all sites in the population and all possible subsets, multiplying their synergistic coefficients by the relatives. And you can interpret this. And you can interpret this in a couple of different ways. So, you can, the way it's written here, we've kind of separated out the sum over sites. And then the inner term is like, what's the expected aggregation of all fitness effects on that site? Taking into account all possible subsets and how they affect that site's fitness. Yeah, so Dan. So, relatives is defined in terms of the equilibrium distribution, right? The station distribution. Oh, with the mutation of the question, too. Yes, sort of. So you calculated the R's under neutrality, is that right? No, weak mutation, but you have selection. Is there selection in the calculation of the R? In the general case, yes. For weak selection, no. Okay, so that's what I wondered because I wondered if the C's had a reason. Wondered because I wondered if the C's had to be small. Right. So, this result holds for any selection string. Okay. But I'll get to a weak selection in a slide or two. So, and then the other thing that was really interesting to me was that we can take an actor-centric perspective if we allow for collective actors. So, if we say, like, I'm going to consider this set S of sites as a collective in itself. Collective in itself, and say, How does it affect all possible sites in the population? Weight that by its relatedness to those sites, and add them all up. And that tells me, again, whether my opponent was selected. So what does this do? So this gives us a condition for selection under a lot of different population structures with any kind of nonlinear interaction, right? We can include any kind of polynomial term. I can include any kind of polynomial term in my selection and weighted by the appropriate relatives. Oh, I didn't want to do that. Okay, good. And if selection is weak, then I can compute the relativist under neutrality using coalescent theory, which is very useful. Otherwise, this thing is true, but very difficult to evaluate. And yeah, this suggests some kind of notion of. Suggests some kind of notion of collective inclusive fitness effects of every set, where you add up its effect on all sites and multiply by its remainderness fitness. This is speculative here. I'm still unsure of how useful this is, but I think it's interesting enough to say. Okay, so now specializing to some more concrete situations. Situations. So let's suppose we have, this is similar to the threshold game that Jeremy was talking about, but instead of a benefit being shared by a group of vectors, the benefit goes to a particular target that could be inside or outside of the group. So some collective S, they can pay a cost C divided equally among themselves to provide a benefit B to either a member or an outsider. And that benefit is only achieved if all the members of this set contribute. Otherwise, nothing happens. And with this, we get a kind of collective Hamilton's rule that this collective action could be cooperation, but also could be spite. It could be a negative benefit. It's favored if benefit. If benefit times relatedness to the target exceeds cost times the average self-relatedness of S's members. And you might think this looks like a weird term, but it turns out relatedness to self is not necessarily one when you compute it. So we do need a term there for self-relatedness, especially for diploids, right? It depends on who you inherit your alleles from. On who you inherit your alleles from. So, okay, so some other situations we can consider. We can suppose that instead of jumping into the river to save his two brothers, maybe Halleen needs to collaborate with two of his brothers to save three more who are drowned in the river. So that would be a collective action dilemma with diploid siblings and some large population. This is our collective Hamill. This is our collective Hamilton's rule there. These are the relatedness coefficients under neutrality. So, in this case, actually, self-relatedness is a half, and relatedness to sibling is one-fourth. And so then we actually recover the b greater than two c results. So, this validates the jump into wherever the state of two brothers, but also extends it to. Say of two brothers, but also extends it to two siblings jumping into, say, four brothers, etc. But what was interesting to me was that this actually applies to non-linear situations too. So it might be that, you know, all four brothers need to jump in to sacrifice themselves for those two. It's actually the same condition, which was a surprise to me. We can also consider games on networks. Games on networks of again this collective help or harm idea, where this collective they all need to contribute, and the help or harm goes to a specific target. And then consider the death-birth process where we choose some individual to be replaced and choose a neighbor to then produce hospital into that spot. We get a slightly more complicated condition here for collective. Complicated condition here for collective action where we have the benefits on the left and the cost terms on the right, but they're also weighted by the degrees of the vertices, right? Because remember, that was the retractive value is proportional to the degree of the same. And then the other interesting term is we get subtraction of, so for the benefit term, we measure the effect. Benefit term, we measure the effect on G, but also subtract by this term for G's two-step neighbors. Because when an individual is like, when a site is vacant, there, we have two-step neighbors competing with each other to reproduce the needs. So then results for various kinds of structures for a complete network. For a complete network, we get this condition, which is essentially B greater than MC. So the benefit must exceed the group size times the cost, with some correction for finite population size there. We also get evolution in spite to outsiders. It's a weak effect, so it becomes much, you know, it becomes linearly hard depending on the size of the whole population. But in small populations, you get evolution of collective space. Populations, you get evolution of collectives. On like a 1D structure, like a cycle, we can get the collective incentivized to benefit its boundary vertices and more weakly, the two neighbors of those boundary vertices, but really not any others, at least not in the large population. And then there's interesting structures we can consider here where. We can consider here where if we have a central H, then we can get evolution of really extreme collective algebraism, where this peripheral group here is very favored to help the hub node, where K is the number of kind of windmill blades here. And so the left-hand side rows as a number of windmill blade rows, whereas the right-hand side is constant. So on a large windmill, So, on a large windmill, we get kind of extreme collective altruism. And then, similar thing on this more complicated network where we have inner and outer nodes. In this case, one interest, we have an asymmetry where the collective is more willing, more favored to help its kind of inner node than its outer. And again, we have possible evolutionary spikes to faraway nodes, which is a very interesting point. A very interesting point. We can, on more realistic spatial networks, we generated them by Delaney triangulation, where you throw a random point in the square and connect them according to the rule. Mark Archetti used these to modern cancer cells and solid tumors, for example. And so we kind of used a community identification algorithm and said, Algorithm and said, you know, what's the incentive for this community to help both its neighbors and outsiders? Some interesting behavior here, where, for example, this community, it is favored to help all of its neighbors at some cost-benefit ratio, and that always occurs. But for example, this one, it's less incentivized to help it than it would be in a well-mixed population. So the spatial structure kind of has a negative. The spatial structure kind of has a negative effect on helping the more kind of interior members of the collective because those don't really help the cooperative behavior spread, right? They're less evolutionarily important. And we also see a lot of evolution of potential evolution of spike at kind of, in some cases, you know, reasonable cost-benefit ratios. So, like, you know, if you have a five-fold harm, then that can be, that can be. Harm, then that can be fielded by selection through a distance returns. Yes, reach one, these are cost-benefit ratios. They're also scale relatedness, as it's just children's on the at first. And yeah, so some statistics on that. So comparing to a well-mixed population, spatial structure mostly promotes health to community members, but not. To community members, but not always. Sometimes it inhibits it. To external targets, it promotes up 17% of the time. Usually to direct neighbors, in rare cases, to two-step neighbors. To more distant vertices, it almost or majority of the time promotes spite or harmful, costly harm. In some cases, does need it. We also looked at the spatial balance. The spatial networks of sociable weaver nests, where they it's reasonable because they offspring usually disperse within the nest, at least the male offspring do, and they're the ones who do most social behavior. And similar patterns essentially are found. I'm not going to go into the details on that. So, for the more conceptual takeaways, so one thing you may have noticed is that this condition. May have noticed is that this condition it looks elegant, but is really rather unwieldy in that. Oh, wait, I'm making a different point. So, okay. Right, so in principle, every subset of sites is a collective. That's exponential, right? There's two to the end possible subsets. However, and I claim that in real world situations, if we take a random set of alleles, If we take a random set of alleles from a population, they're very unlikely to synergize with each other, right? If it's someone I've never met, we're not likely to have synergic effects. And also, this relatedness will usually be negligible. So the non-negligible terms are going to be a small fraction of the exponentially many total terms here. The other question you might ask is: okay, so there's this idea that individuals, That individuals evolve to act as this maximizing inclusive fitness, right? Does that apply to this idea of collective inclusive fitness? And really, the answer is no. It's only yes under very artificial circumstances, which I'm not even going to get into. But the reason it's no, the reason collectives do not maximize inclusive fitness is that there's tension between the individual and the collective, or between over Or between overlapping collectives. So consider how these three nodes here, G, H, and I, might affect individual J there. If I'm going to compute that selection, I have to consider how all of these individually are related to J, and also how the pairs are related to the target, and also how all three of them together are related to the target. And selection aggregates over all of those. So we're not going to get any. Of those, so we're not going to get any kind of maximizing behavior from any particular collective and even from any individual, right? If we have non-linear interactions going on, that I would argue really destroys the possibility of inclusive fitness maximization. And instead, we really get more of like inclusive fitness compromise between individual and collective interests. So take a So takeaways. So we're nonlinear interactions. We don't have individual causes and effects, social behavior. We can extend the idea of inclusive fitness. And this, I mean, I've spent a lot of my career arguing about the limitations of inclusive fitness. So a lot of those limitations can be overcome, but the The actor-centric viewpoint, we can preserve that if we understand actors to be not just individuals, but collectives. And then we can have a kind of collective adaptation, which is not a maximization principle, but which is some kind of compromise over individual and collective interests. And then I've presented this framework for fixed population size and Population size and single locus genetics. I do believe this extensions to the more complicated scenarios are possible, but will just require support. And yeah, I think, I mean, nonlinearity, I would argue, is everywhere. Genetic dominance, for example, is an example of nonlinearity. And so we shouldn't expect kind of simple linear rules to accurately describe what happens in solution. Accurately describe what happens in such. That's it. I just wanted to sort of intuition check. So you said self-relatedness is not necessarily one. And is that just sort of saying that self-relatedness case single dip-load is like a heteropsychosphy? Or I'm not quite sure what it means when you say that. You say that? Okay. So I'll say that. For example, in a haploid well-mixed population, self-relatedness is one. So for diploids, I mean, it's a question of how we normalize it. So, you know, being a half means that you inherit your alleles from different places, right? So, you know, if your allelible is. You're allegable clonal, you know, then it would be one. So you could normalize it differently so that we would just say like self-related diploids should be one. But I wanted to kind of have a common definition that applies to haploids and diploids and use for haploid diploid societies. So that's why it's Sally. I think I blinked at the wrong time. I think I blinked at the wrong time. And I think for your, I really like the idea of these expanding sets, and that allows you to see what the benefits come from larger and larger collectives. But when I blinked was, so in that set, there can be genetic variation of controls all its own sites. And I do understand how you attribute it to each of their fitnesses. There's diversity within that set and what happens, because there can be things like underdominance or overdominance in the old cooperative behavior. In the old cooperative behavior? Okay. So the kind of simple answer is that: so all those effects can happen. There are always, no matter what effects are going on, there always is that polynomial representation of like there's some linear effects, there's some quadratic effects, there's some cubic effects. You can write down a polynomial that kind of incorporates all of that. Of a wheel frequency within the set, what's the polynomial of? It's a polynomial of fitness. Polynomial of fitness as a function of who has what allele. So it's not just allele frequencies, because it's the alleles are tied to specific sites in the population. It's not just, you know, how many have this allele, but does the, does where they are spatially, how they're arranged in individuals, things like that. That polynomial can be very complicated. It's not always easy to break down, but we know it always exists. Exists. So, one of the slides you said you were going to unify these different multi-level selection, inclusive fitness. So, this is a really nice result on the inclusive fitness side. But if you're looking at the power set of all individuals, then that suggests that in general, there's no hierarchical structure where you should be able to pass this in multi-levels. Is multi-level selection framework inherently more limited, I guess, than some sorts? Because it doesn't make it. Because it doesn't make it allow for these overlapping sets of actors. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that. Like, I think having overlapping sets and actors is important, or like, or just overlapping, you know, social associations, right? You know, that is important. And to the extent that multi-level selection models exclude that, I would argue that this is more general, those are limiting. I guess the integration part was, I think this can play well with existing. Can play well with existing models of multi-level selection. And you'll get like, you know, the terms for the specific levels will be meaningful when you write out these polynomials. Yeah. So do these approaches really nice. I'm curious. I'm trying to relate it to these sort of sortativity measures of relatedness. And what I'm seeing, I think, is that sort of, is that this would reduce. Is it you? This is this would reduce to those in the special cases where I was willing to delimit the sets that I was looking at. Is that right? Is that yeah, is that how that would be? So it is fundamentally, it is another kind of assortativity approach, but what it's doing is expanding beyond saying, oh, it's the assortativity between me and my neighbor, and that's the only thing that matters because of my coalition and my neighbor. I think all of these assortativities. These right, right. I think that's true. And the relatedness, it's a statistic of a sort. So it's defined in terms of basically, you know, identity by state. Yeah. Yeah. So do I say correctly that neither the C nor the R parameters depend on the mutation rate? We're taking mutation to zero in all and all the stuff I've shown you. It's at the limit as mutation rate goes. So the results are easy. Well, the results are mutation this zero. Yeah, I didn't consider non-zero mutation this work. I think I would know how to do that in a follow-up work, but I haven't. I haven't squared it. But it's mutually granted. It's not actually zero. There is enough mutation to maintain mutant liquidity. Yes. Right, right. So it's, yeah, we need some mutation to have a stationary distribution, but then Stationary distribution, but then, yeah, when you take it to zero, you know, again, that's when all these things are defined. Wait a second, you know, in the framework, you can't get, you know, it flipping which allele is favored by increasing the mutation rate. You know, yeah, altruistic behavior should become disfavored if the mutation rate increases. Oh, now I'm just saying because you're assuming the mutation rate is so low and below all that. Right, yes. Right, yes. Hi, so many last comments.
