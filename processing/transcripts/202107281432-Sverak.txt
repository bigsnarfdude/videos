Really great results in fluid mechanics. So, we're all definitely looking forward to his talk. So, why don't you take it away, Barney? Thank you, Jacob. And thanks for the invitation to speak at this great conference. So, I will be talking about joint work with HAL on and this time it And this time it will not be about regularity, but it will be about long distance behavior of the steady state solution. So in some sense, regularity is about high Fourier modes, right? We are trying to do estimates for high Fourier modes. This will be about low Fourier modes, about the behavior. About the behavior of the Fourier transform near zero, but you'll see there are still some interesting problems there. So we consider the steady state Navier-Stokes in Rn. F is supposed to be smooth, localized, compactly supported, or fast decaying. And we assume that all solutions which we consider are smooth. And up to dimension 15, I think it's possible to prove you have smooth solutions for this problem. And we will be focusing on dimension three. So let's start with something very simple, the linear problem. So this is the steady state Stokes, which is almost in the whole space. Which is almost in the whole space, so it's almost like the Laplace equation. The Green's function is explicit, it has the same decay, x to the power of minus n minus 2. And when you write the solution in terms of f, you can, just like for the Laplace equation, you can do this multipole expansion. So there's a leading term which for the Laplace equation. leading term which for the laplace is just constant divided by fun by x here it's everything is vector valued so we have three parameters in the in the leading term then you have the next order term and so on and these parameters here are given by the the moments of the of the function f of various order okay so so we have a clear picture here Here, everything is very explicit. And when we, at first, it's useful to look at the nonlinear problem just by moving the nonlinearity to the right-hand side. And we will immediately see that in this case, the higher the dimension, the easier the problem is, essentially because in higher dimensions, we have the faster rate of decay. Have the faster rate of decay of the fundamental solution. So, if we look at the nonlinear effects at infinity, and what do I mean by nonlinear effects at infinity? Let me go back to so these coefficients, say b, b j, b, i, b, j, k, they can be, of course, depend in a non-linear way on f, but by nonlinear effect I mean that that this function itself is influenced. function itself is influence right that that uh that you you will have uh say the i i would say that the expansion is still linear if you if you have this uh expansion with just the green's function maybe this coefficient depends non-linearly on f but the leading term is still just the green's function so if you if you want to check which is the first term which is not linear in this sense which i was you just need to integrate this guy from minus integrate this guy from minus infinity to zero and say under the worst case scenario. So in that case, you have this type of decay, minus 2n plus 3. You integrate it with respect to fundamental solution from minus infinity to sum r, you get this decay. So that's the first term which potentially can be affected by nonlinear effects in the sense that these functions in the expansion will no longer be just Be just the Green's function. And you see that, say, in dimension five, you have two linear terms, and then this will affect the term with decay minus five. In dimension four, you have one. And in dimension three, that's the dimension where it affects the nonlinearity, it will affect the leading term. So in that sense, the three dimension is three dimensions are critical. Three dimensions are critical for this type of problem, and two dimensions is much more difficult. So, I will not talk about two dimensions at all. I will focus on the three-dimensional case. And as I was mentioning, the issue is low Fourier modes here. So, we essentially want to look at the behavior of the Fourier transform of the solution near infinity. Near infinity. So there is a nice solution first calculated by Landau in the 1940s, which gives you an idea what this leading term of the expansion should be. One can think about it, for example, in the following way, that you take the steady state Navier-Stokes. It has the scaling symmetry. So you scale it as usual. You scale it as usual, like that. If you scale U in this way, the right-hand side scales in this way, and you see in three-dimensional, the scaling here is exactly the scaling which leaves the L1 norm invariant. So as we scale, the right-hand side is the norm is constant in L1. And if you go with lambda to infinity, you converge to a Dirac mass, to a multiple of a Dirac mass. To a multiple of a Dirac mass. So as lambda goes to infinity, this converges to Dirac mass times some vector. The vector is just the integral of f. And so formally, if you also assume that the functions, the vector fields converge, okay, those should be minus one homogeneous in the limit if you have convergence. Again, if you respect the scaling. So you will get in the limit this equation that the Navier-Stokes operator here. Stokes operator here is Dirac mass times some vector, right? So it kind of like almost looks like a fundamental solution for a nonlinear equation, but indeed you get a solution which satisfies this equation. That was calculated by Landau, as I was saying. So his approach, I think, was just: okay, let's look at minus one homogeneous. Let's look at minus one homogeneous solution. If you assume that they are axisymmetric, so you have the two-dimensional symmetry group, you are in three dimensions, so you should have an ODE, right? So your Navier-Stokes reduces to an ODE, and then surprisingly, you can solve the ODE explicitly. And this is the solution. And there is a, so I will use this parameter. So so I will use this parametrization of the solution. Epsilon is a parameter which describes the solution. There's a one-dimensional, if the force is along, say, the x3 axis, there's a one-dimensional family of solution parameterized in these formulas by epsilon between minus one and one. And there is the right-hand side or the forcing which Or the forcing which you calculate is a function of epsilon. As epsilon goes from minus one to one, the forcing which I denote here beta goes from minus infinity to infinity. There is a explicit but fairly long formula in terms of elementary functions, but we will not need the explicit formula. So that's the Landau solution. And this is what these heuristics Heuristics gives you as an expectation for the leading term of the behavior of the solution, at least for small functions. Now, I should maybe make two remarks. One is that this effect that when you have a scale-invariant equation, you scale it like this, and you will still converge to a nice. To a nice solution, it's not automatic. For example, if you do it for this equation, which is the semi-linear elliptic equation, which is here, it has the same scaling invariant. You can try to do the scaling invariance. You can try to do the same thing. But the solution this time will not converge to something interesting. It will converge to zero because there are some logarithmic terms in the solution. Terms in the solution, you can check that it converges to zero. So there's something special about Navier-Stokes or some other class of equation that it allows you to take this limit and you have a good solution in the limit for the right-hand side, the direct mass. Now, if the Landau solution itself has interesting connections to conformal geometry of the spheres. Of the sphere. So if you look at the tangent vector field in the Landau solution, okay, so the tangent to the sphere, it looks like this. It's a multiple of this field in cylindrical coordinates by some function of theta, and it's a gradient of a function. Okay, you can check it's a gradient field. Check it's a gradient field. And the function itself satisfies a well-known equation, which you get, it's a geometric equation, which you get when you express the condition that the Gauss curvature of a metric, something like E2, Ephi, is one. Okay, this is the equation. It's related to conformal invariance, I mean conformal geometry of the sphere. Formal geometry of the sphere. So the interesting thing is that this equation is in some sense contained in the Navier-Stokes. Navier-Stokes contains many other equations, but this one, maybe one would not expect on the f on the first guess that that you you are able to to have uh this equation, say, within the the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier-Stokes equation. And one can use these connections to conformal geometry of the sphere to show that the solutions which Landau calculated are actually the only minus one homogeneous solutions, whether axisymmetric or not. If you have a minus one homogeneous solution, it has to be automatically axisymmetric with respect to a certain axis, and it has to be one of the Landa. has to be one of the Landau solutions. So this was done a long time ago. I should mention some relevance to singularities. There is some connections to singularities, although not of the evolution equation, but about the steady state solutions. So we can, if you look at So we can, if we look at the steady-state Navier-Stok solutions and we look at H1 solutions or solutions for which the gradient is in locally in L2, then of course we have regularity. It's a subcritical problem that has been known for a long time. But we can look at weaker solutions, right? We can write the equation in this way, pull all the derivatives in front of the expressions, and then The expressions, and then the solutions are defined for the equation is defined for L2. And the question is: what can we say about regularity then? The standard regularity theory gives you that if U is locally in L three, then it has to be smooth. But L three minus epsilon, as far as I know, is not known. On, as far as I know, is not known, and one suspects that at some point you get counterexamples from convex integration that at some level of regularity, but what the regularity threshold is is not clear. And so the result about Landau solutions kind of very modestly says something about this. It tells you that for this very For these very weak solutions, you cannot have minus one homogeneous singularities. Unlike, for example, for semilinear elliptic equations, you have more or less the same results for semi-linear heat equation, semi-linear elliptic equation under some growth condition and some if the solution belongs to some LP space, it has to be smooth. And in that case, the And in that case, the scale-invariant solution gives you the exact threshold for regularity, right? There, you can say everything very precisely. So, here, if you try to apply the same philosophy, it doesn't work. The most or the simplest possible singularity cannot exist. That's the result for the regularity of these. Regularity of this very weak solution, which you can deduce from these Landau solutions. But let's get back to the long distance behavior. So what one can do is use a relatively simple perturbation theory to show that if, say, you have a small right-hand side. Right hand side and the solution of this steady state equation in R3, then the leading term at infinity is given by Landau solution. So the solution at infinity will look like a Landau solution plus an error which is slightly worse than norm of x to the minus 2. So remember that the second term in the asymptotic expansion is exactly Is exactly in the multiple expansion for the linear problem is exactly norm of x to the minus 2. So here in this statement, we lose a little bit, right? We have to sacrifice a little bit of this decay to get everything under control. And the leading term is given by the Lando solution. So, again, this was proved a long time ago. Long time ago. And with how we asked if one can look more precisely at this next order term. And as you will see, it leads to an interesting spectral problem. Problem spectral problem, which unlike many other spectral problems in fluid mechanics, you can calculate, you can do some more or less explicit calculations and get some answers. So, for example, the most natural spectrum problem in the context or The context or one of the natural spectrum problems in the context of what we are talking about here would be just to consider the stability of these solutions, right? So you have the Navier-Stokes operator is equal to F. Let's linearize, we get a linearized operator. What is the spectrum of that operator? So you can do that on a computer, of course, but if you try to calculate something really Something rigorously without a computer, it seems very difficult in this case. I don't know any calculation where one can do something other than prove that for small data you have stability or something like that. So the problem which we will be getting for our result is of a slightly different nature. slightly different nature and you will see you can do some you can do some calculations there so before before getting into the exact statement let's look once again at this multiple expansion for the for the linear problem this this in some sense will be This, in some sense, will be our basic object. So, our method, I mean, I can maybe say it right now, what our method is. So, we completely understand this expansion, right? There's nothing, it's just like a Laplace equation. So, you have some objects in this expansion. You have this function, then you have this power here, and so on. So on. And the method is to find the right objects in this expansion which you can perturb. Okay, so one has to find the right way to do perturbation theory. And for that, it's good to look more closely at the parameters. So the leading term is just The leading term is just this guy. It's the fundamental solution with three parameters given by this integral. And if you look closely at the Landau solution, Landau solution can be considered as a deformation of this fundamental solution, right? If you look at the formulas for Landau solution, you have this parameter epsilon there, and you see that as epsilon That as epsilon goes to zero, it's looking more and more like a fundamental solution, but the fundamental solution is deformed in a certain way. So what we will try to do is to look also at this second term and see how this second term is deformed when we adopt this approach. This second term has eight parameters. So Landau. Eight parameters. So Landau, the first term has three parameters. Sorry about it. I think I should go. The first term has three parameters. Here, just the integral of f is a vector. The second term has eight parameters. It looks initially naively that it has nine parameters, this matrix BJK, it's nine parameters, but because of the incompressibility condition and divergence-free condition, And divergence-free condition, you actually get eight parameters. So, this eight degrees of freedom, so to speak, in this term. And then you have the higher order terms. So, let me explain what do I mean by deformation of these solutions at a simpler example. At the example of Laplace. Of Laplace equation with a drift. So let's take Laplace equation with a drift term, which ultimately we want to think of this drift term as some minus one homogeneous function. That's the critical case is the drift term is minus one homogeneous functions. And we want to study how this drift term will affect the behavior of the solutions to infinity. We can just as well study just. Infinity. We can just as well study just fundamental solutions. The important quantity for us is just say integral of f and maybe it's first moment or something like that. So of course if b is fast decaying it will not affect the behavior at infinity. When it will start affecting the behavior at infinity is exactly when the b is minus one homogeneous. So first when we don't First, when we don't impose a divergence-free condition, then this is very easy. You just can think about deforming the equation by this guy here, epsilon times dr divided by r. So you just put epsilon to this term which you already have in the Laplacian, right? You can put epsilon here and deform that term. And you know that the fundamental solution of the Laplacian. Fundamental solution of the Laplace depends on the dimension in a certain way. The decay depends, it's like one over norm of x to n minus two. So when you are changing this epsilon, you're already changing the decay of the solutions at infinity, right? You see that at this level of perturbation, when you perturb by minus one homogeneous field, you're changing the decay of the solution at infinity. And this under This under the if you don't impose the divergence free condition. If you impose the divergence free condition, it turns out you cannot change the power of decay. So instead, the change is slightly more subtle if you look at what is happening for the free Laplace equation. So we have our Equation. So we have our usual expansion in terms of the multipole expansion, which I wrote in this way: that I write it as, say, A divided by fundamental solution. So we think about this A as a spherical harmonics, the first constant trivial spherical harmonics. Then you have the first spherical harmonics divided by x squared, okay, the next the quadratic spherical harmonics divided by x cubed, and so on. Divided by x cubed, and so on. And so, what happens when you go to say a vector field B, which is say minus one homogeneous and divergence-free field? So, one has to find the right deformation of this expansion. So, the right deformation in this case will be that this function, which was before constant, it was constant for the Laplace equation, it will change to a non-constant function. These functions, the linear spherical harmonics, will also be deformed to some other functions here on the sphere. But at the level of this quadratic decay, the power will also be deformed. You will change the power here a little bit. And for the linear equation, of course, you can in principle continue, but we will be dealing with the non-linear equation. So we will stop. So, we will stop here at this term. So, that's the idea: that you have the object here is this multipole expansion, and then you want to deform this multipole expansion in the right way. Okay, and the right way is in the multipole expansion, you have some functions on the sphere, which in this case are spherical harmonics, and they are eigenfunctions of some operator. Okay, and you have the powers here. The powers here, Powers here. The powers here you will see they are eigenvalues of some operator. Okay, so as you change from the Laplace to a more complicated operator, these objects will change, right? The eigenfunctions get deformed, the eigenvalues get deformed, but the expansion kind of stays. So you will have a new expansion where you replace the simple spherical harmonics by more complicated eigenfunctions. Complicated eigenfunctions, and these powers which are here will be deformed to new powers which you obtain from the eigenfunctions. Okay, so that's the general idea which you can illustrate already on this case. So what is the result of the calculation for Navier-Stokes? It was a little bit surprising to us. To us. So we expected that this, so we have the leading term is the Landau solution. Okay, that's no question about it. But so the question is, how will this second order term deform, right? So originally it was decay like x to the minus two and the quadratic, sorry, the Sorry, for the Laplace, it's just the linear spherical harmonics. So, for the Navier-Stokes, if you apply a similar philosophy, I will go into more detail how the calculation is done now. I just want to formulate the result. So, this quadratic decay will, this eight-dimensional Eighth parameter term here, the quadratic, it will split into four parts. So one will have the same decay as before, x to the power minus two. And we can, three of them are very easily explained. Three of them is just by shifting. If you take Landau solution, you shift it, right? That gives you a perturbation of the Landau solution at infinity. It's given by derivative. At infinity, it's given by derivatives, and that has x minus 2 decay. So, this is very easy. Three modes you explain just by shifting the solution. Then there is one more, one mode which still has keeps this decay, which you cannot explain by shifting. It's related to a pure swirl mode, which you just have to calculate. And then the four other modes, for four other modes, the rate of decay will change, but it will only go up. Okay, that was the surprise. Up okay, that was the surprising thing for us. We expected that it will kind of split. Some modes will decay faster, some modes will decay slower, but that doesn't seem to be the case. All the modes either will stay at the decay rate x to the minus 2 or the decay will be accelerated. There is nothing which decays slower than x to the minus 2, and you can calculate pretty explicitly how it is accelerated, at least in the It is accelerated at least in the perturbative regime. And then there is the remainder, which is one power before what we had before, right? So the error is of order x to the minus 3 plus epsilon. If you had a linear equation like the one which I had before, then presumably you can just continue. But for the nonlinear equation, it would be more tricky to continue. And we know exactly. And we know exactly because everything is obtained by deforming something which we know very well. So we can identify which modes gate accelerated, decay, which one is the most accelerated, which one is the second most accelerated, and which one do not change. So I just have written it up here. These are the linear modes which will have will have faster decay. So what's the idea of the proof? The idea is to look at these asymptotic expansions in the right way, so to speak, to express it in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of certain operators. And the already Already, if you do it for Laplace operator, one can one can see what one should do. So let's look at this, something which we have all seen. So we take just the Laplace equation and do the change of variables x is e to the s times y. y will be a coordinate on the sphere, s is in r. So in this In R. So, in this change of variables, essentially we take Rn minus the origin and think about it as a sphere times the real line, right? They are diffomorphic, so you think about it in this way, and this is the metric which you get. You see, it's conformally, the metric is just a conformal change of this metric on the cylinder and the Laplace. And the Laplace operator becomes this. And the key is to think about this equation as an ODE in S. So we think about it as an ODE in S. For a linear equation, it is easy because Laplace has nice, this is Laplace on the sphere, it has nice invariant spaces on the sphere. So it's really, you can think about this as a finite dimension. Can think about this as a finite-dimensional operator on some finite-dimensional spaces, essentially. So, it really is an ODE. And we write it as a first-order ODE, then we get some matrix like this. And we will be looking at the eigenvalues of this operator L0. And you can calculate, here everything is explicit, it's an easy exercise. Is explicit, it's an easy exercise that the say in three dimensions, the eigenvalues of this are exactly the integers, both positive and negative integers. And you can think about the usual expansion, the multipole expansion, you can think about it in the following way. So we take this ODE and now write the general solution. Okay, so the general solution will, there will be There will be a contribution for positive eigenvalues, also from the negative eigenvalues, right? The eigenvalues will be all z. So, this is the contribution from positive, this is contribution from negative. So, this is the general solution. So, the positive ones, these are just the harmonic polynomials. The negative ones, these are just the multipole expansions. And then, if we want to look at the solution with the right-hand side, we just Solution with the right-hand side, we just do the usual variation of constant. If we want the decaying solution, we have to integrate in the right way so that the growing modes, these coefficients go to zero. So typical thing, which is just the same as for the ODE. And that way you get your expansions. And so the spherical harmonics which you The spherical harmonics which you get, this yk here, these are eigenfunctions of your operator, and these powers which you get here are its eigenvalues. So now, for example, if we go to the linear equation, which I was looking at, so we have Laplace plus as perturbation, which is minus one homogeneous at infinity. You do exactly the same thing, you do this change of work. thing you do the this change of variables write it as an ode okay uh this is the the laplace which we which we had before but now you you will have from from this guy here you you will get some new terms and if you assume that b is minus one homogeneous you can rewrite again everything is operators on s2 so there is nothing uh no derivatives in s here it's just an you can think about this as an as an ode in s As an ODE in S. So it's essentially the same problem as before, except instead of the operator L0, which we had for the Laplace, you will have this perturbation of it, which you have here. But you do the same thing. You calculate the eigenfunctions, you calculate the eigenvalues, and you get an asymptotic expansion exactly as before. But since you have this operator here, the eigenfunction will change a little bit. The eigenfunction will change a little bit and the eigenvalues will also change a little bit. So, this will deform the expansion. Okay, and you can, for example, if B is divergence-free, you can check that, say, the eigenvalue minus one corresponding to this leading term, it will not change if B is divergence-free. But the spherical harmonics corresponding to it, which was constant before, it will change, it will deform a little bit. Change it will deform a little bit, so this gives you this deformation of this. Now, at the level of the second power, both the eigenvalue and the eigenfunction will change. So, the deformation will, I mean, this expansion will be deformed. So, that's essentially the approach. Now, one wants to do it for Navier-Stokes. So, for Navier-Stokes, the So, for Navier-Stokes, the strategy is you take the Landau solution. We know this is the leading term of the Landau solution. We want the next term in the expansion. So we write the solution as our leading term plus the next term. We get substituted into Navier-Stokes equation and we get this operator. If you do the results which were done before. Results which were done before the result where you just proved that the leading term is the asymptotic expansion, they essentially are of the same form, except the guy which you have here on the left-hand side is not this linearization at the Landau solution, but just the Stokes system. Okay, so you just there you just linearize at the Stokes system and everything is very explicit. Here we have to linearize at the Landau solution, okay? At the Landau solution. Okay, so that's the difference from what was done before: that we take the solution and linearize at the Landau solution. So the operator here, which we are inverting, is kind of similar to the model which I was to this one, right? If you linearize Navier-Stokes at Plandau solution, it's a little bit similar to this one. You have the Stokes operator, okay? And then you have. Okay, and then you will have stuff coming from the Landau solution. So we do that, okay, and then you just apply this philosophy of writing everything as an ODE in this S variable. So now I changed, we again changed variables in this way. In these formulas which I have here, I Here I have changed the power in front of s. So r is e to the minus s. How likes this change of variables better than the previous one? So this is what we use, but it's of course equivalent. So we write Navier-Stokes like this. There is one little difficulty which you have to deal with, namely Which you have to deal with, namely, before it was kind of trivial to write everything as an ODE in S. Here you have to deal with the difficulty from the pressure, right? Because you have when you have the pressure term, you have also a derivative in the S direction of the pressure term. So if you want to write everything as an ODE in S, you have some trouble from that. But there is a simple trick to deal with it, namely you introduce a new variable by moving. Introduce a new variable by moving this to the left-hand side, and then you can do it. So, we get this ODE. Okay, this is what we had before for the Laplace, you now get for Navier-Stokes. These are vector fields on the sphere, the variables, one vector field, okay, a second vector field on S2, there's scalar function on S2, scalar function on S2. This expression here corresponds to Expression here corresponds to this expression corresponds to the linear Stokes operator. And this is the perturbation coming from the Landau solution. So again, it's the same idea as before. We write denoting all this vector by, say, capital Xi. We have the ODE that DS of capital XI is a linear, this operator L of capital XI, and this is L0. Psi, and this is L0 plus K. L0 is the Stokes operator. And we hope that the Stokes operator we will be able to understand completely. Excuse me. If I could ask at this stage where you want, how do you know we can do all of these things while keeping the F small around the origin? Can you say it again, Alex? So you want to keep F, the whole thing is about F being small around the origin. How do you know when you make the choice of the smooth version of? Of the smooth version of the solution, like you choose the U that's smooth. How do you know that you can make these choices while not affecting the fact that F was supposed to be small? My question is basically, how do you, what does the F being small, how do you keep that to all of this? So so w one condition, for example, is that uh that you have some estimate on the solution at infinity. On the solution at infinity, right? That you know that the solution is below some c divided by modules of x, where c is small. So this is essentially what we need. That at infinity, you have this estimate that you can estimate the u, the L infinity norm of u, by c divided by x. But c is not small. But C is not small. C is small. This is for small F's. Yeah, this is for smallness. But you made the choice, for example, of U. You start with U and you want to smooth it out around the origin. Yeah, but we need the smallness only at infinity. Okay. Okay, thanks. Okay. So I mean everything can be formulated as a statement outside of a sufficiently large ball. Okay, that's another way to think about it, right? Here I formulate it as a statement in Rn, okay, where you have some f, but maybe it's better to think about it as a statement. About it as a statement outside of a large ball, and in that complement of the large ball, you have behavior C divided by a norm of X where C is small. Aha, okay, so okay, so that's nice. So that was kind of like the F beams. Okay, thank you. Yeah, it's a local essentially. You work locally near infinity. That's the method. Okay, so okay, so now what do you so when we when we want to understand this operator L0, what we get from the Stokes operator. So it is essentially similar to spherical harmonic, except there is more things to More things to track, right? I mean, it's a vector. So, in principle, everything is explicit. So, one way to think about it, you have this fundamental solution, which is explicit, and these multiple expansions you can obtain by taking derivatives of this explicit solution, right? And say, if one wanted to use group representation, you have the You have the action of SO3 on everything, you have some functions which you obtain by taking the derivatives, and you want to decompose everything into invariant subspaces. That's one way to think about it, okay? Or one can just go ahead and do the calculation. It needs some calculation to do this. And so ultimately, what one can do is to decompose these spaces of vector fields. These spaces of vector fields, which you have here, very similarly to what we had for the Laplace. For the Laplace, these operators which you have on the sphere, right, this guy, for the Laplace, eventually it just reduces to some finite dimensional operator on some finite dimensional spaces of spherical harmonics. So here you have the same. You essentially can think about, say, this guy as a gradient. Say this guy is a gradient of a spherical harmonics, this guy is a gradient of a spherical harmonics, this guy is a multiple of spherical harmonics, this guy is a multiple of spherical harmonics. And if you decompose this into these spaces of spherical harmonics, then you get finite dimensional spaces which are invariant under the operator. The matrices of the operator are given here. So you have several components of that, but everything is manageable. You calculate those and you get. Those and you get the analogy of the unperturbed situation which we had before. Now it's more complicated before, say each spherical harmonics was involved in two eigenvalues, one growing and one decaying, right? Now each spherical harmonics is involved in six eigenvalues. And there are some difficulties in that, minor difficulties in that. Minor difficulties in that before this decomposition was orthogonal with respect to suitably chosen scalar product. Now it is not quite orthogonal. In fact, there is some degeneracy there which you have to deal with. But these are relatively minor technical issues. And then you have to calculate to see what happens under this. Calculate to see what happens under this perturbation. So, this is a classical problem in perturbation theory. You have an operator, you perturb it a little bit, and you want to see what happens to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. So, the way this can be done, for example, you take this big space of these vector fields and functions there, and you decompose it as a direct sum of this eight-dimensional space of in the unperturbed case, you have the eight-dimensional space. Case, you have the A-dimensional space plus the complement. Okay, you have this. And then you are wondering how this decomposition will be modified when you perturb the operator. So the way to think about it is that this is, say, orthogonal, in this cartoon picture, you have the orthogonal decomposition before deformation. So there is this eight-dimensional space, there is this A-dimensional space E and the E and the orthogonal component there. And then the right object to think in terms of perturbation theory is this subspace, this deformed eight-dimensional subspace. And if it is close, you can just think about it as a graph over this A. So it's given by a good object, which is a mapping M from this A-dimensional subspace to Y. Okay, so you write You write the equation that things are invariant under this, and you get. I mean, I have some notation here, but I don't think the important thing is that you are looking for an A-dimensional invariant subspace. You get some fixed point equation, which if you go back to the variables, what you get is essentially what people do in quantum mechanics, for example, when they calculate. mechanics for example when they calculate perturbation of when they calculate perturbation of the spectrum right you get the the first order perturbation okay and then the second order perturbation so here it turns out that the first order perturbation is zero because of symmetries involved in the problem so you have no change at in terms which are linear in epsilon and the change becomes only at the second or Becomes only at the second order level in terms which are quadratic in epsilon. And that you can essentially take from any textbook of quantum mechanics, these formulas. Of course, the question is how to do it rigorously. And also another complication is that our operators are not symmetric. But essentially, this is just perturbation theory for linear operators. For linear operators. So we do the calculation. You have to, it's, I mean, it requires some work to do all this with the spherical harmonics. And the result correspond to what I was mentioning. You have this eight-dimensional space, it will split in the four-dimensional space where the eigenvalue will stay one and one additional space. One additional space where the eigenvalue will shift in a certain way, and another additional space where the eigenvalue will shift. And you can calculate it at this level of expansion. And this is the so we also did it numerically just to be sure that we didn't make a mistake. So one of these terms, for example, is from one mode, the eigenvalue is. The eigenvalue is say epsilon squared over 15. One of these is the calculation from our expansion, the perturbative calculation, and the other one is just pure numerics to calculate this eigenvalue without any approximation. I mean, just finite-dimensional approximation. And here is a global picture. You see, even if you go to relatively large epsilons, this eigenvalue. Epsilons, these eigenvalues, they don't really move too much. It seems like nothing too dramatic is going on. Okay, so that you do this at the linearized level, and then you have to close the estimates at the nonlinear level and so on. So that's additional work. That's where this estimate x to the minus 3 plus delta comes in, right? To be able to work it on nonlinear level, you need this free. Linear level, you need this freedom to have this little delta there to hide all the remainders under that. Vladimir, can I ask what is epsilon? Is the epsilon of the landau? Yes, epsilon is a parameter in the in the lambda solution. Okay, thank you. Okay, that's all I wanted to say. Thank you.
