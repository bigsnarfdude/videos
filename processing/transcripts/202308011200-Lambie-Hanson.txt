Yeah. Reporting in progress. Waiting for that. Okay, we're ready to get started then. So it's my pleasure to introduce Chris Lambie-Hansen. He'll be talking to us about condensed mathematics, extremely disconnected spaces, and forcing. Okay, so yeah, I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation organizing this conference. So I was here four years ago, and at the time I was speaking about what was then a very recent result with Jeff about a higher-dimensional non-trivial. Of higher-dimensional non-trivially coherent families, and what it has to say about vanishing of derived functors of the inverse limit functor, right? And I think a few days before this workshop started, we posted our paper on the archive. And that same day, we received emails from Dustin Plausen and Peter Schulze saying, hi, we're developing this new framework for doing mathematics, trolling density mathematics. Trolled condensed mathematics. And the results that you just proved are of interest to us because they relate to the sort of foundations of our subject, right? And so in a very real sense, the beginning of our engagement with condensed mathematics happened here at LaHatra four years ago. So I thought it was appropriate to give a talk now to say what we've learned about this in the last four years, what we now know about what set theory has to say about. What set theory has to say about this subject and how it can relate to each other. And to sort of, I don't know, advertise this as an interesting area of communication between set theorists and other mathematicians. All right. Okay, so I want to start by introducing Internet's Mathematics and Jimmy a very brief introduction. So I'll say at the outset that a lot of this talk is going A lot of this talk is going to be sort of at the level of a very basic introduction. There are going to be very few, what you would call new results by me or my co-authors beyond what I would call mostly translation work. Mainly today, I want to sort of expose the points of contact between this new field of advanced mathematics and what set theorists and set theoretic topologists know very well and sort of what they transfer. Know very well and sort of what they can contribute to this. So, first of all, what is condensed mathematics? Very roughly speaking, it is a framework that was first developed by Dustin Tilson and Peter Schulze, and now a number of more people are working on it. And the point is they want to be able to apply algebraic methods, especially homological algebraic methods, methods from algebraic topology, to the study of algebraic structures that carry topologies. That carry topologies. So, for instance, they're interested in applying algebraic tools to, say, functional analysis or complex geometry or various areas that so far have been largely resistant to the application of these methods. And part of the reason that these have been resistant to these applications is that the classical categories of such structures are generally very badly behaved from an algebraic point of view. So, there are some sorts. Uh, so there are some sort of very deep and sophisticated examples of this bad behavior, but I want to give a very simple, perhaps overly simple example of such behavior. That is, I think, is sort of the standard example to give at the introduction to advanced mathematics. So if we look in the category top ab of top-lossial abelian groups and consider this very natural map, the identity map from R with a discrete topology to R with the usual metric topology. Okay, this is a perfectly Okay, this is a perfectly good continuous map in this category. It's obviously not an isomorphism. These are very different spaces. But if you want to work algebraically, then you want the fact that it's not an isomorphism to be witnessed by some algebraic object, namely either a non-trivial kernel or co-curnal to this map. But in this category, this doesn't have any, right? The kernel and co-cernal are both trivial in the category of topological abelian groups. Okay, in particular, top up is not what we call an abelian category. I'm not going to define what this means. It basically means a category in which you can do algebra, a category that has all the nice algebraic properties of, say, the category of abelian groups itself. Okay. And we fix this, or Tlausen and Schultz have fixed this by taking these classical categories and embedding them in Richard categories, where you add In richer categories, where you add objects, for instance, a non-trivial prokernel for this map, and many more. Okay, so let's give a definition. A condensed set or abelian group or say ring vector space, et cetera, is a contravariant functor, say T, from the category of compact Hausdorff spaces to the category of set for sets, of Belian groups, for Belian groups, et cetera. Groups, et cetera, right? So, contravariant functor, what does that mean? So, it's a map, first of all, from the objects of the first cysteroid to the objects of the second, but it's also a map from the functions, the morphisms from one cystero to the other. And contravariant means it reverses the direction of these morphisms, right? So, if you have compact house store spaces S0 and S1, and a map F from S0 to S1, then T of F will be a map from S1. T of f will be a map from t of s1 to t of s0. And it's a contravarian punter that satisfies three properties. First of all, if you apply it to the empty set, you get the one-point object. So all of these punters, we really only care about how they're defined up to isomorphism. So it's enough to say, okay, there's a sort of standard one-point object in each of these categories. And then we map the empty set to that one-point object. That one-point object. T maps a disjoint union of two compact cal star spaces to the product of their individual images. So we want products to be defined in all of our sort of target categories here. Okay, and third is this. I think for the sake of this talk, it's not going to be worth your time to try to decipher what this is. I will return to this later. For now, let me say that if you know about For now, let me say that if you know about sheaves, this is essentially a sheaf condition, right? This is saying that t is a sheaf on a certain growth and deep site. Okay, we'll come back to this later though. Okay, so more concisely, this probably means nothing to most people. It means not much more than nothing to me. A condensed blank is a blank valued sheaf on the Pro ATAL side of a point. So one-point object is you mean like a running an object for a point? Does it mean turning a log for a moment? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Okay, so note that this definition is wrong. It's wrong because as I've defined these T's, they're proper class functors, and you don't want to work with a category of proper class size objects, right? But we're going to ignore this problem today, right? Where's that theorist? We know standard ways to fix this. You might not choose the same standard way that clouds and introduce it. That class and introduce it chose, but it won't matter for this talk. Okay, so I want to talk now about how we can see the classical categories that we care about living inside the categories of these condensed objects. So I first want to talk about what's called the sort of underlying object of a condensed object. Right, so given a condensed object t, we call t of star, so t evaluated at the one point. Evaluated at the one-point set space. We call this the underlying set or abelian group or et cetera of T. Okay. Now, T star can be endowed with a topology, right? So a priori, there's no real topology here, right? Where remember, our functor goes into, say, sets or abelian groups. But we can recover a topology from sort of the system of maps that live on the t side of this functor. Okay, so. This functor. Okay, so more precisely, we endow t star with the quotient topology induced by this disjoint union of all of these maps. Okay, let me say more precisely what this is. So more precisely, given any S compact hour star space, and any object X in T of S, this actually induces a map from S to T star in the following way. So I think your picture might be appropriate here. Appropriate here. So, what's our situation here? On the sort of compact Hausdorff side of this functor, we have the one-point set and the space S. And now we have a sort of U of S over here, X here, A of T star. And I want to. And I want to induce a map from S to T of star as follows. So for every S in S, this induces a map from the one point space to the space S that takes the point to S. Well, this map F S. Now our functor T turns this arrow around. T of F best is a map now from T of S to T star. And now, what can we do? We want to define this g of x from s to t star. We just evaluate t of f of s at our point x. This will be an element of t star. Okay, so this defines now a Okay, so this defines now a function from this topological space s to t star. And we just place the finest topology on t star that makes all of these bounds. So notice almost by definition, this topology is compactly generated, right? In other words, T star is what's called a K space. Okay, so now we can talk about how we sort of embed our classical categories into the condensed category. Into the condensed category. So, given a topological space X, one can define a condensed set, X underbar. Underbars will always denote things in a condensed setting for us. So X underbar is a condensed set, meaning we have to define what it does on compact calculus spaces S. And we define it by setting X bar of S to just be the set of continuous maps from S to X. And now, as usual, if we have, say, two compact half star spaces, S as S0 and S1, and a map from S0 to S1, this induces a map in the obvious way from continuous functions from S1 to X to continuous functions from S0 to X, maintaining this at contravariant functor. Okay, so first of all, this satisfies all of the requirements we had. Requirements we had on this slide, right? And now I want to talk a little bit about what this three is saying in this case. What this condition three is saying in this case is the following. So it's talking now, we have a surjection of compact half-star spaces, S prime surjecting onto S. And now what condition three is saying in this setting is the following: the continuous Functions from s to x can precisely be identified with the continuous functions from s prime to x that are constant on the fibers of this. Okay, and so this sort of embedding of topological spaces into different dense sets is very nice. Dem sets is very nice, especially if X is already a compactly generated topological space. If it is, and you take the underlying set of X bar, you just get back X. Moreover, when you restrict this embedding to the compactly generated spaces, you get what's called a fully faithful embedding of categories, namely it's bijective on hom sets, right? So sort of if action If X and Y are two compoundly generated spaces, then the maps between the condensed images of X and Y are precisely those you get from the real continuous maps from X to Y in the topological spaces. Similarly, we can embed topological abelian groups into the category of genetic abelian groups exactly the same way. Given a topological abelian group A, you define A bar by setting A bar of S to be a continuous. Sending A bar of S to be continuous maps from S to A. Now, since A is a group, this is an abelian group, just with pointwise addition. Again, this embedding is fully faithful when restricted, for instance, to locally compact abelian groups. I'll mention here that the reason that Klausman and Schulze first contacted us was that our work actually had some relevance for the extent to which sort of this last sentence can be. Sort of this last sentence can be expanded to larger classes of groups. They were asking: is this embedding fully faithful on certain larger classes of groups? Ultimately, our work showed that it is definitely not fully faithful when restricted to what are called pro-abelian groups, which are inverse limits of discrete abelian groups. Okay. So I want to talk a little bit more about specifically predensed abelian. About specifically condensed abelian groups, which means I'm going to have to talk about exact sequences. So, recall that if we have a sequence of morphisms, let's say of groups, if you want, F from A to B and G from B to C, we say this sequence is exact at B if the kernel of G is precisely the image of F. And we care especially about what are called short exact sequences. These are sequences of this form that are exact at all the points. And they're exact at all the points at A, B, and C. If you look at this in, say, the case of abelian groups, what does this really mean? It means that this map from A to B is injective, the map from B to C is surjective, and it's exact at B, right? In other words, say A can be seen as a subgroup of B and C as the quotient. So the category So, the category condab of condensed abelian groups is a very nice category. It is an abelian category, and moreover, a very nice one. And in a certain sense, being an abelian category means that short interact sequences behave as you would expect them to, amongst some other things. Yes, exactly. Yeah, so essentially it's just maps between the levels of the functor where everything. Levels of the functor that where everything commutes. Okay, so for example, let's look at what happens with our sort of motivating example. We had this map from R discrete to R. If we look at this now in condensed abelian groups, now all of a sudden it does have a non-trivial coternal, right? It fits into the shortage that sequence, zero to R discrete to R to this mysterious traditional spilling group Q to zero, where what is To zero, where what is q? So, q is a density alien group defined by letting q of s be the quotient of the continuous maps from s to r by the locally constant maps from s to r. Locally constant maps are precisely the continuous maps from s to this space. And now this is a non-trivial object, right? However, it's trivial on the one-point space, right? The underlying group. Right, the underlying group of this group is trivial because okay, all maps from a point to R are continuous. But this is non-trivial at, say, the space omega plus one. Okay, so I want to now talk to you about something that's probably very familiar to a lot of you, and this is extremely disconnected topological spaces. So let me remind you of one of the So, let me remind you of one of the many definitions of these. So, retrol a space is extremely disconnected. The closure of every open set is open. We're going to let ED denote the class of extremely disconnected compact house dork spaces. So I don't have to say that all the time. So here's a very nice theorem of Leeson. So the elements of ED are precisely the projective objects in the category of compact half-star spaces. So let me remind. Spaces. So let me remind you what a projective object is. So a projective object in a general category is an object E such that whenever we have two other objects, possibly equal to B, A and B, and an epimorphism from A to B. Epimorphism is the categorical version of surgery. And And we have a map from P to B. So if we're given this data, then we can always lift this map to a map from P to A that makes this diagram for you. Okay, so if P satisfies this property for all sort of instances of this data, then it's called projective. Sorry, epimorphism was that it has an inverse on the correct side. That's the right side. Epimorphism means that you can cancel. That you can cancel morphisms if they're on the side. Right. And so it turns out that if you do homological algebra, projective objects and their dual notions of injective objects are sort of the basic building blocks of the theory. So they're very important in any sort of development of homological algebra. Okay, so as most of you probably know, typical examples of ED spaces are the checkstone capacifications beta x. checkstone tractifications beta x of discrete spaces x right and in fact every ed space is a retract of such a space okay so now i want to i want to revisit the definition of condensed objects so i want to redefine them in the following way a condensed set or above group is a contramariate functor t now not from the full category c house but from ed to the corresponding category such that okay gen t v empty set is one point space T of empty set is one point space. J of a distro union is the product. And that's it. We don't need the third condition here. And why don't we need the third condition here? Well, the third condition, remember, talked about surjections of compact house store spaces. Now, if S is in ED, then we have a right inverse to this surjection. And if you sort of look at what the third condition said. Of, look at what the third condition said, it automatically holds if you have this section, it's right inverse, right? And so, condition three is always satisfied by functors that satisfy this. So that sort of simplifies our life. So, two observations are in order here. One is the one I just made. The other is that we've replaced Seahouse by ED, but this involves no loss of information. And this is because every condensed object in the previous definition. Every condensed object in the previous definition is determined by its restriction to ED. And this is essentially because every element of compact customer spaces admits a surjection from a set in ED. For instance, the beta acts as the underlying set of the space will work. Okay, and this is what I just said. Okay, and so if you're doing algebraic If you're doing algebra here, you're very interested in whether this category of condensed objects has projective objects. So, a category C is said to have enough projective objects if for every set X and C, there's a projective P and C and an epimorphism from P to X. So we just saw that compact house star spaces have enough projective objects. Abelian groups have enough projective objects. The projective abelian groups are precisely the free groups. Are precisely the free groups. So take an arbitrary above group, you can map onto it from the free group on its own-line set. And these condensed categories also have enough projective objects. So con has enough projective objects. And okay, so for sort of technical reasons, I want to talk only about the compact projective objects. Every element in these condensed categories is sort of generated by compact elements. By compact elements to be represented as a co-limit of compact objects. So it's enough to talk about what the sort of compact projective objects are. In condensed sets, these compact projective objects are precisely the images of the condensed, or sorry, the images of the ED spaces under this embedding of topological spaces to genetic spaces, right? As you might expect from Fleeson's theorem. Genetics abelian groups also has an Condensed abelian groups also has enough projective objects. These are precisely the condensed abelian groups, Z of S bar for S and E B. I'll say what this is in one second. You can think of it as sort of the free condensed abelian group on the underlying condensed set S-bar. Okay. Slightly more formally, if T is a condensed set, then Z of T in condensed abelian groups is defined by letting abelian groups is defined by letting Zt of S be the free group on Ts for all S and E D. Except this is not quite right because what I just wrote is may not be a sheaf. So you need to then sheafify this. Okay, whatever this means. So Z of T is the sheafification of the functor that sends each S to the free group on T of S. Okay, so I want to take a slight detour here. Okay, so I want to take a slight detour here, but I think it's an interesting one. So, this is a very nice theorem that Michael told me is probably folklore. If you have two infinite ED spaces, S0 and S1, then maybe initially surprising. What? Yes, ED means compact. Then S0 times S1 is not extremely disconnected, right? Extremely disconnected, right? As soon as S0 and S1 are infinite, their product cannot be extremely disconnected. What this means is that projective objects in compact aus star spaces, or by extension, condensed sets, condensed abelian groups, are not closed under products. And this is sort of an annoying fact, right? And especially for this development of condensed mathematics, this turns out to be a very annoying fact, right? Because you want to take products a lot and you care a lot about projective objects. You want products and projective. Objects, you want products and protective objects to be protective, but they're definitely not. If you've never seen a proof of this, it's a very nice exercise to try to prove it. I recommend it. I did it a few weeks ago. Okay, so this is what I just said. As a result, in these categories, the projective objects are not closed under products. But a natural question is, how far away are these categories from being closed under products? So, in any sort of abelian category, you can define the Category, you can define the projective dimension of an object X as follows. So you look at X and you start forming an exact sequence sort of ending at X, where all of the previous elements in the exact sequence are projective. You can always do this if your category has enough projective objects, right? Essentially, what you do is, okay, you start. Do is okay. You start with x. If you have enough projective objects, you can find some p0 that surjects onto x. Okay, now this map is going to have a kernel. Say this map is pi zero. Okay, and this kernel is going to be itself an object in the category. An object in the category. You can surject onto it from another projective object, V1. And now pile one is just the composition of these two maps. And you keep drawing. And a priori, you might keep drawing forever. But in some cases, you'll reach a point where the kernel happens to be projective. And so you can end there. And the projective dimension of the object. And the projective dimension of the object is sort of the least length of such a sequence if it exists. Okay, so notice that x being projective would precisely be saying the projected dimension of x is zero. And sort of the smaller the dimension, sort of the closer it is to being projected. And so the question that Dustin and Peter asked us is the following. Sort of, if you have projective gene-stabelian groups, how far away is How far away is their product from mean projective? In other words, if S0 and S1 are in ED, and you look at this condensed abelian group Z of S0 times S1, does this have finite projected dimension in condensed abelian groups? A positive answer to this question would make them very happy. I think a positive answer to this is very unlikely, though. I would expect this to have a negative answer. And I think this is a question where topological ideas. Topological ideas, set theoretic topological ideas, might actually have something to say and eventually lead to a solution from this. I will say that there's a stronger version of this question that they asked us that we were actually able to resolve negatively by using some theorems about the existence of certain non-trivial coherent games. Does it make sense to talk about like projective transfinite dimension like I dimension like um not that I shouldn't think of I like maybe there's a way to make that make sense but I don't see an obvious way to do that and I've never seen that before okay so uh I want to move to something that uh first will seem very unrelated how much time do I have left 31 perfect thank you um so I want to talk about uh the whitehead problem okay so this Okay, so you might have, you might think this has nothing to do with what we've been talking about so far, and you might be right, but I will try to convince you otherwise. So let me do a quick introduction or reintroduction to the whitehead problem. So it involves, unsurprisingly, whitehead groups. So an abelian group A is whitehead if it satisfies the following condition. For every surjective group momorphism pi from B to A, whose Whose kernel is isomorphic to the integers. This pi has a right inverse. There's a sigma from A to B, so the pi composed with sigma is the identity. There are many equivalent ways to say this. Equivalently, whenever you have a shortage at sequence of this form, zero to z to b to a, zero, it splits. Splits here means that there are maps going from A to B, or equivalently from B to Z. From B to Z, they make everything from U. Okay, in shorthand, this is saying that X1 of AZ is zero. You can think of this as just shorthand way of saying this if you want. Formally, X1 is the first derived functor of the HAM functor in abelian groups. Okay, so here's a fact, sort of a characterization of free groups, which drew Characterization of free groups, which goes back to what I said about the fact that free groups are precisely the projected objects in the traditional abelian groups. So a group A is free if and only if X1AC is zero for every group C, right? From our whitehead groups, ask that X1 of A Z be zero for the particular group of integers. Free groups, this is true when you replace Z by any group C. And all groups are abelian. All groups are abelian. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. All groups are abelian. Okay, equivalently, for every surge entitled homomorphism pi from B to A, it splits, right, has the right inverse. So manifestly, a free group is therefore Whitehead. So Whitehead's problem, first posed in the 1940s or 50s, asked whether the converse is also true. Another way of looking at this is Whitehead was asking, if you want. Whitehead was asking: if you want to test whether or not a group is projective, is it enough to test it on the integers? And so I won't talk about this today, but there's a whole sort of plus of questions asking similar questions about other algebraic categories of modules, especially, asking about projective test modules, for instance. But anyway, so his question was: is every whitehead group free? In other words, if you know that X1A. know that x1a z is zero, does it follow that x1ac is zero for every abelian group C? Okay, so this problem has a very interesting history. Shortly after it was posed, Stein proved that there's a positive answer in the countable case. So if A is a countable white head group, then it is free. The general case took another 20 years. Case took another 20 years and was resolved by Shala in what at the time was a very surprising way. He actually proved the answer is independent of ZFC. In particular, if V equals L, then every whitehead group is free. If, on the other hand, for instance, Martin's axiom holds L of one, then there's a non-free whitehead group of cardinality L of one. Okay, so I'll say this is irrelevant for what we say later. Is will be relevant for what we say later. In this v equals L result, really what you need here are lots of diamonds, right? You need essentially a diamond on S something like this. Diamond on the points below kappa plus of trophinality of kappa for all of kappa, essentially, something like this. Kapla, essentially, something like this. Maybe even, actually, probably you want this not just for this, but for all stationary subsets of this. But whatever, you've got whatever you need to know. Okay, and so I want to talk about sort of interpreting this problem in the richer category of tenanced abelian groups, right? So we sort of know what happens with Whitehead's problem in abelian groups. Has problem in abelian groups, but you can ask the same questions in this richer category of genomic abelian groups. To do so, we need to talk about a functor called the internal HALM functor. So if we look at abelian groups T0 and T1, then the HOM set of them, essentially the set of all natural transformations between T0 and T1. This itself is an abelian group. This is part of what. Abelian group. This is part of what it means to be an abelian category: is that all the HOM sets have the structure of an abelian group. However, for a lot of situations, it is desirable to have a bifunctor that behaves like HOM, but takes values not in abelian groups, but in the category you're working in. And we can do that in the category of condensed abelian groups. Okay, so this might. So, this might be a little bit opaque, and I'm not going to explain it too much. But trans stimuli groups have a tensor product and what's called an internal HOM functor. This is a bifunctor. I'll call it HOM underbar. That takes values not in abelian groups, but in condensed abelian groups. It can be defined in terms of this adjunction, actually. So, what does this formula say? So, what does this formula say? This says that if you take sort of the classical hom of T0 and the internal HOM of T1 and T2, this should be isomorphic to classical HOM of T0 tensor T1, T2. If you sort of squint your eyes and pretend these are all just sets and all the homes are actually just homes and not internal homes, then this formula should make sense, right? The morphism. Right, the morphisms from t0 to morphisms from t1 to t2 are the same as morphisms from t0 times t1 to t2. Okay, but it turns out that if t1 and t2 come from actual honest abelian groups, then we can say very concretely what this internal home is. So it turns out that if A and G are locally Turns out that if A and G are locally compact topological V groups, then this internal home of the image of A and the image of B is the image under this embedding from topological Belian groups to Trinevstabelian groups of the classical group theoretic HAM of Ag. Where, what's the topology placed on this group? It's the compact open topology on HAM AG. On hom Ag. In particular, if A and G are both discrete, which they will be in all of our settings, this compact open topology is just the product topology. And so this sort of very abstract algebraic concept defined via this sort of opaque adjunction has a very concrete realization in this specific case that we care about. In particular, this internal HOM is a trademark group, so we can evaluate it at spaces in ED or compact hostlar spaces. And what do we get? We get HOM AG evaluated at S is precisely the group of continuous functions from S to HOM AG, where again, this is given the compact open topology. This is given the compact open topology, right? So essentially, these are not like individual morphisms from A to B, but continuously parametrized family of morphisms from A to G. I think the best way to think about them. Okay, this internal hum, as you might expect, itself has derived functors, and they're called internal X functors. And so now this allows for a natural This allows for a natural sort of interpretation of Whitehead's problem in condensed abelian groups. So, first of all, before I state this, let me note something that this internal X, and this is true of internal HOM as well, sort of contains all the information of the classical X. In particular, if you take the internal X of A bar, B bar, and evaluate it at the one point space, then you get back the classical X. The classical X. This is a richer object, right? It includes everything about the classical X, and when you evaluate it at other spaces, it includes more. And so now when we formulate Whitehead's problem, not in terms of the classical X, but the condensed X, it turns out that suddenly the independence vanishes. This is not independent of ZFC, and it's not independent of ZFC because this internal X sort of This internal X sort of always captures the information a classical X might not. So, here's the statement, and this is actually recognized by Klaus and Schultz. Suppose that A is an abelian group and this internal X of A bar Z bar is zero, where both of these are thought of as discrete abelian groups. Then A is free. So, the independence phenomenon sort of washes away. So, their original proof of this fact was very slick. You can write it down in just a few lines, but it's very slick and short, assuming that you have gone through a deep structural analysis of the category of density abelian groups and a quite technical subcategory solid abelian groups. And that takes a lot of work to really understand, but I think I haven't fully understood yet. I think I haven't fully understood yet. And so it's also very inexplicit, right? So given a non-free group A, we know that it's not whitehead in the den setting. So there needs to be some space S for which this X1 of AZ evaluated S is non-zero. But their proof gives no indication for, say, what that space S should be even. Okay, so both of these things motivated us to try to find a more explicit, more commentatorial, maybe more set-theoretic proof of this pattern. Maybe more set-theoretic proof of this fact. All right, so to talk about this, I need to talk about sort of a slight reformulation of the problem. So given any group, an abelian group A here, we can form a short exact sequence as follows, zero to k to f to a to zero, where, okay, k is a subgroup of f and f is free, hence k is also free. There's a canonical. K is also free. There's a tranical way to do this, right? Just let F be the free group on the underlying side of A. And there's a tranical surjection. And K is just the kernel of that math. What is this concretely? K is basically the group of all relations in A. Now it turns out that A is whitehead if and only if this induced map is surjective, right? So if we So, if we have this shortage at sequence and we sort of apply hom.z to the sequence, hom.z is contravariant, so it reduces the arrows. So we get this induced map from hom FZ to hom Kz. It has a very simple description. What is this? This is just restriction. K is a subgroup of F. This takes the morphism from F to Z and restricts it to K. So A is whitehead, it turns out, if and only if this map is. Turns out if and only if this map is surjective. Another way to say this is every homomorphism from K to Z extends to a morphism from F to Z. Okay, so if we want to show that A is not whitehead, it suffices to construct a morphism from K to Z that does not lift to one from F to Z. And Shiloh's proof of the V equals L direction of the theorem. equals L direction of the theorem can be formulated as using the diamond sequence to build such a morphism, using the diamond to anticipate possible lifts of the morphism from K to F. There's a bit of work that goes into actually doing this, but this is the general idea. And we can formulate the problem in the same way in the condensed setting. So similarly, A is whitehead in the condensed set. is whitehead in the condensed sets if and only if this induced map from internal hom of f bar z bar of s to internal hom of k bar z bar of s is surjective for all s. Recall from a previous slide that internal hom of f bar z bar of s is precisely the group of continuous functions from s to morphisms from f to z. Similarly for k so to show that a is not whitehead To show that A is not whitehead in the genetic setting, it suffices to find some space S, some continuous map phi from S to morphisms from K to Z that does not lift continuously to a continuous map psi from S to home FZ. What would this mean? This would mean that for all S and S, psi of S extends phi of S. Right? So now to be whiteheaded. So now, to be whiteheaded in the nin sense, we're asking for more in the classical case. We don't just have to lift one morphism from K to Z to F. We're given some continuously parametrized family of morphisms, and we have to lift all of them in a continuous way. And this ends up being too much to be able to do if A is not free. And so, what we're able to prove is the following: if A is not free, then there is such a map. not free then there is such a map for the space s equals two to the kappa the product topology where kappa is the least cardinality of a non-free subgroup of a okay so there's a sort of uh continuously parametrized family of two to the katham many morphisms from k to z that does not lift uh continuously to f all right okay Okay. All right. So I'm not going to say much about the proof, but I want to give a slightly provocative sketch of the proof of this theorem. So the proof is essentially done by mimicking a version of Shalah's proof. Of Shala's proof of the V equals L portion of his theorem. We don't necessarily have diamond, but we have the following statement that can be seen as like a ZFC continuously parametrized version of diamond. And it's the following. So suppose kappa is a regular uncountable cardinal. Then there is a continuous map phi from 2 to the kappa to the product alpha less than kappa of 2 to the alpha, where everything here has the product. Where everything here has the product topology. So, what is this phi? This phi is a map from two to the kappa to things that look like diamond kappa sequences. It has the following property. For every continuous function psi, from 2 to the kappa to 2 to the kappa, so now this is a function that is outputting things that look like things that should be guessed by a diamond sequence. But conclusion is this is. But inclusion is this is just on at least one element of the domain space. There is x into the kappa such that the set of alpha less than kappa for which phi of x of alpha equals psi of x restricted to alpha is not just stationary, but we can actually look in kappa. And something like, I'm sure stronger things are true, right? You get much more. Are true, right? You get much more than just one X, you get at least densely many. Maybe you can say something more about it's large in some sense. I don't know. But for our purposes, even one is enough. Okay, so the proof of this proposition is very silly. You can define phi very easily, and you do it as follows. For every x and two to the kappa, and every alpha less than kappa, we need to define phi of x of alpha. It's going to be some function from alpha to two. What do you do? You just look at What do you do? You just look at the next alpha many elements of x. You look at x restricted to the interval from alpha to alpha times 2, and you copy that down to alpha. And that's it. This works. It's really not hard to check that this really does work. Okay. Good. So I want to end by talking about forcing. Some of you who are quite astute may have already noticed some. Student may have already noticed some hints that forcing might be involved. In fact, this proposition is really in disguise the statement that adding a Trollin subset to Troppa forces diamond of Trappa. It's the same proof, too. And there are other traditions of forcing that have been sort of hidden in the talk so far. One of them has to do with these ED spaces. So another characterization that I'm sure most of you know, ED. Most of you know, ED is precisely the class of stone spaces of complete Boolean algebras or of forcing notions. So here's another fact that I think is probably folklore. So suppose that B is some complete Boolean algebra and Y is some compact cal star space. Then there's a correspondence between B names for elements of Y and continuous functions from the stone space of B. Functions from the stone space of B to Y. Okay, now I should probably say what I mean by names for elements of Y, right? How do you interpret Y in some forcing extension? Well, there's sort of a canonical way to do this, right? So what are points in a compact halstar space? Points in the compact half star space are maximal filters of non-empty closed subsets. And this is something you can interpret in any outer model, right? So, in any forcing extension, you can sort of interpret why by starting with the same collection of basic open and therefore basic closed sets and adding potentially new points that correspond to newly added maximal filters of these non-empty closed subsets of Y. And this is an interpretation of Y that makes sense, and it's sort of the canonical interpretation of Y and force. Good. How much time do I have left? 10 minutes? Okay. So maybe I'll talk a little bit about the proof of this fact, and it's sort of instructive. All right, so we need to sort of go back and forth between B names for elements of y and continuous functions from the stone space of b to y. So first, suppose we have a b name y dot for element of y. We'll define this function f from the stone space of b to y as follows. Of B to Y as follows. Okay, so we need to define what F does on an element U of the stone space of Y. Remember the stone space or the stone space of B. Remember, the stone space of B is the space of all ultrafilters on B. So suppose we're given such an ultrafilter and consider the collection D of closed subsets D of Y, such that the Boolean value of D being in Y. Value of D being in Y bar is in that ultra filter U. Remember, Y dot is a name essentially for a filter of closed sets. Okay, so clearly D itself is a filter because Y dot is forced to be a filter. And we claim that its intersection is in fact a single point. And this just follows from Hausdorffness of Y, right? So suppose that Y0 and Y1 are distinct points and the intersection. Y1 are distance points in the intersection of d. You can find disjoint open sets separating them, and then you look at the Boolean values of saying that the complements of these open sets are in y dot. This is a finite maximal anti-chain in B. So one of the sets must be in U. And this will be a contradiction because one of the sets will exclude either y0 or y. either y0 or y1 from being in this intersection. Okay, this deals with contradiction. So then we just set f of u to be the point in this intersection. All right, and then check that this works. In the other direction, given some continuous f from the stone space of b to y, you define a name y dot as well as so for all closed subsets d of y, you let the Boolean value of d and y dot y dot the supremum of b and b such that essentially b forces that u is here right so for all ultra filters u if b is in u then f of u is in d right and you check that this works okay right sort of a standard exercise all right so so to finish i want to sort of draw genetian back to genetic sets Draw a connection back to condense sets. So, recall, as we saw in the first section, for a top special space Y, there's a corresponding condensed set Y bar, such that Y bar of S is just all continuous functions from S to Y, or S in ED. Therefore, okay, what if Y itself is a compact tower star space? Then the sets, continuous functions from S to Y. Continuous functions from S to Y are precisely the forcing names for elements of y with respect to the Boolean algebra of which S is the stone space. And so this sort of condensed version of Y is nothing more, nothing less than sort of an organized presentation of all forcing names and all possible set forcing extensions for elements of Y. I think this is a potentially fruitful way of looking at things. So, one sort of consequence of this is that sort of a variation of the proof in the previous section, combined with these observations, yields the following. So, again, suppose A is a non-free abelian group, and kappa is the smallest cardinality of a non-free subgroup of A. Then A is not whitehead in the classical sense after adding kappa-many trolling reals. And now, sort of applying this observation up here. Applying this observation up here and checking that things work. It's not literally just plug this in and do the work, you have to check some things. But this yields that instead of two to the kappa in the previous section, it would also work to take the space to be the stone space of the Boolean deflation of this troll enforcing. So internal F1 of A bar Z bar S kappa, where S kappa is this stone space, is also not zero. All right, so I've been. All right, so I think that there's a lot of potential in this direction of sort of exploring the connections between condensed objects and horsing, taking condensed objects and evaluating them at the stone spaces of natural horseing notions. I think there's some potential for fruitful collaboration there. Okay, so one final acknowledgement: all artwork in these slides by Rufino Tamayo, artist born here in Mahatra in 1899. So there is a UC Yeah, so thanks to the call for your attention   It is a stronger statement asking whether S0 times S1 is a compact object in the category of condensed anima, which is sort of the infinity category analog of homotopy types. Whatever. So if this were compact in this category, that would imply it has a finite projected dimension. Uh, finite projected dimension, uh, but it's much stronger, and so um, our results about sort of the existence of non-trivial coherent families on, say, a set of size alpha omega implies a negative answer to that question. I have maybe one more question about something that you didn't mention about this ultrafilters and the coherent families on ultrafilters. Where does that fit in? Ultra filters, where does that fit in? It's unclear. So I'm, yeah, yeah. So I'll say that part of the reason that this sort of interaction with these people has been very fruitful is that they've had lots of interesting set theoretic questions for us that we might not have thought of otherwise. And so there's this question that Michael is referring to that I think I won't state now, but I'm happy to talk about later about certain non-trivial. About certain non-trivial Traharo families indexed by ultrafilters. So, a very set-threaded question that ended up being of sort of foundational interest to them. It ends up being equivalent to the topology they're choosing being the canonical one, minimal one satisfying descent. In general, we had a negative answer to that question. And so, in general, the answer to that will be no, but there's still a To that, will be no, but there's still open things there. I think there is a question in chat. Um, let me move this over. So, what about free abelian topological groups over compact spaces? Are they condensed objects? Free abelian topological groups over compact spaces. Yvonne Sanchez. Three abelian topological groups. I'm not sure. Topological groups. I'm not sure exactly what the reabeling topological groups over compact spaces is referring to, but I would imagine that, yes, these should be embedded into a legend setting in the same way. I'd be happy to say more if there's flirtation. But yeah, I'm not familiar with that particular category of objects, so I'm just being same thing as three, but. Be the same thing as free, but rather than just embedding your set of generators, the embedding has to be functional, and then there is extension. Okay, yes, yeah, then sure, yeah, these can be embedded into condensed, so that's just fine, yeah. Thanks. Okay, other questions or comments? Can you am I audible? Is the microphone? Okay. That was a great talk. You talked about a fruitful interaction between the condensed framework and forcing. And focus for your discussion of this interaction today was Whitehead. Interaction today was Whitehead. And I was curious if you have thoughts about how to further explore this interaction. Would it be by way of other independence results or just anything in that direction that you want to say? Yeah, so I mean, yeah, one natural way would be looking at various independence results in set theory and asking: okay, is there a natural interpretation of these in the genetic setting and are they decided there? Are they decided there? One of the reasons that I think the Whitehead problem is so satisfying in this regard is that the sort of question is naturally motivated from the algebraic considerations of the genetic study, right? This internal access is something that's sort of internally defined and is of interest for the study of the genetics to be linked groups, right? This feels more satisfying than, say, taking an arbitrary result to be transformed. Taking an arbitrary result we care about and translating it in maybe a somewhat artificial way to the genem setting and asking whether it's independent there. I'm not saying that's an uninteresting thing to do, but I think that this was especially interesting because it's something that is was internally motivated as well. And so I think probably the most fruitful things will be of this form, right? Where you have statements, maybe known independent statements, but ones that have natural and meaningful interpretations already in the tendency. Interpretations already in the internet setting. I don't really have a compiled list of places to look for this, but I think in this general direction is the right place. Any other questions? Okay, if not, then let's thank our speaker again. And we have group work now, I think, until lunchtime, which is
