 Who's there? Okay, so welcome back from the coffee break. And now we have a talk by Otonier Noguera da Silve, the Universidad Federal de Paraíba in Gran Demigo do México. He's going to speak about invariance of map germs from n space to n space. Thank you very much for the introduction, Papi. Much for the introduction, Papi. So, I'm very happy to give this talk, especially in this important congress, this important meeting from Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. So first place, this is a joint work with Juan Jose Nuio Balisteiros. Jose Noyo Balisteiros and João Oliva Mazel. So, I would like to thank the organizer for the invitation. And okay, let's start. So, I would like to say some words on the setting of this work. And let's start with a simple plane curve. So, consider a complex irreducible curve, X, with a parameterization given by a map term F and the And the problem is the following one. So find the number of double points that appears in the stabilization of F. Okay, so this is better explained with an example. So let's take this the cusp with a parameterization given by T square and TQ. So it's very familiar for every mathematician, every singleist. Every singularist and a socialization of the curves is something like this. Here you have a note, and now this singularity here, it's a double point, is a stable singularity in the classical sense of singularity of mappings. Here we start with an unstable singularity. Now we have a stable singularity. And in this Syncratic. And in this example, we have just one double point in stabilization. So let's see another example. Here it's an image of the whole space. If you consider a deformation of T squared and T cube, you can see this double point in the surface, which is the image of the deformation. Information and right here we have the double point. Okay, and let's see another example. Here we have the curve given by the parameterization with the coordinated functions are uq and u4. And in this picture, we have two different stable stabilization of F. Civilization of F. And the first stabilization given by the picture A, we find the image of the civilization. We find three double points. It's a one, it's another one, and here is a third one. Another civilization is possible. The civilization of a map check is not unique. But when you consider another civilization given by the picture D, you look here in the image. Uh, you look here in the image of the stabilization and you count exactly three double points. It's an one double point here, in the middle, another double point, and right here it's another double point. So, this is important because a remark to do exactly here is that the number of double points that appear in the stabilization of F does not depend on the choice. It does not depend on the choice of the stabilization. Okay, so our problem here is well defined. Okay, find the number of double points that appear in the stabilization of F. So of course, this is an introduction. This problem is well known. We have a solution of this problem. It's a classical solution from the theory of plane curves. And the solution is the double point. And the solution is the double points, it's equal to the delta invariant. So here, the delta invariant, it's a classical delta invariant for plane curves, which defined as the dimension over C of the cochlet of the ring of the normalization, cochin by f star O2. Okay, well, so Now, let's start with the word. But first, Pepe said some words about my relation with Mexico. It's a very, very good relation. I love Mexico. But there is something in Cuanabaca with I have some memories, which is cofij, especially. Coffee, especially this coffee in Cuernavaca. So, in Cuernavaca, there is a coffee machine, so in the Partameto of Mathematics. When I was here as a postdoc, this was important in very moments of take a rest and you take a coffin and have ideas in very, very beautiful garden. And so Next to this coffee machine, there used to be the following writing on the wall. So, mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into fears. It's a very important statement. I like it. And what I mean with this observation of this remark: so, when you take a coffee of coffee, well, a mug of coffee, and when you like inside of this Like inside of this muggy, we find something strange. We find this behavior, it's an optical behavior. When you look inside of the muggy of coffee, you see again our cusp of something approximating, approximation of a cusp. And okay, so what in the moment of the In the moment of the coffee, we can look inside the mug and what's happening here. So you can start again with the cusp, with the parameterization, and you can make the question, what kind of similarities occur for different values of U? Of course, here it's not a complex variable. In this example, I mean a real situation. And the three situations that occur. Situations that occur are exactly these boxes. Here it's for the values of u less than zero. Here is the values when u is equal to zero. And here is the value when u is greater than zero. And when you return your mug of coffee, you see exactly this behavior. It's something interesting to It's something interesting to say. When you study deformation of curves, these deformations occur naturally as something which appears in the nature. Okay, it's a phenomical, optical phenomenon. Okay, after the modiocoffy, we turn off our Our lab, and you make the following question: What is the next case? So, the case, of course, is well known, completely solved. And the next case is a surface, but we would like to define or at least consider a delta invariant for surface, so we need to ask isolated singular. But we also need a parameterization. This means a smooth normalization. And these two things together does not happen in C3. So surface with isolated similarity in C3 are normal and does not have a normalization, a smooth normalization. So the first case is a surface in C4 with isolated signal A. With isolated signaler and a smooth normalization. More precisely, we will consider a map term from C2 to C4, which is an immersion outside the origin. In other words, this is the same of the definition of a finite map terms. And we can go away, say, we can consider the general case of map terms from Cn to C2N, which are To C2n, which are immersions outside the origin. Okay, and the problem is the same. It's a generalization of the problem of curves. So find the number of double points, df, that appears in the civilization of F. Here, we are in the nice dimensions of matter. So our civilization is well defined for this kind of maps. And the only stable singularities that Only stable singularities that appears in the civilization are double points, double points, transversal double points. So the situation is exactly the same, exactly the same the case of curves. But what happens with the case of curves? So, what you have? So, when you look to the literature, we have the governance works relating the number of double points to points to two other invariants segment number and cross-cap more precisely gaffing shows a formula he calculates the double two times the number of double points it's equal to the number of segreg it's a kind of number segment with an appropriated ideal of f minus the number of cross caps Of this composition, where pi is a genetic projection from C to n to C to n minus one. And it's not a direct informal. We need to calculate these two invariants to find the number of double points. But we have another formula doing Artinagata, which is the following one. Here, Artinagata calculates the number. Here, Arthur Nagata calculates the number of double points, two times the number of double points, by this complex dimension of this co-chain. This is the model. Here in this part, it's the ideal which defines the diagonal in C2N. And in the denominator, it's the pump. denominator it's the pullback of the diagonal by s and this also works well but but uh these two formulas are hard to calculate in examples it's not not so simple to to find the number of double points using these these two formulas so uh what is our contribution what what is uh what our solution to to this problem our solution To this problem. Our solution is to change this model here to a simple Arctenian ring, more precisely, the local ring of the double points. We can see this double point, this double point here, instability, as an appropriated analytic structure. So it gives by an ideal. It given by an ideal, and we can calculate the dimension of over C of this ideal of this local ring, more precisely. So the appropriated structure for the double point is the one given by mod for multiple points. So I will recall very quickly here, it's something technical. Here, it's something technical. What is the structure given by David Mohn for multiple points? Okay, so it is very general. It's worked from Cn, so CP with P greater than or equal to N and works out for not for double points, but for multiple points. Okay, so. Points. Okay, so I will define just for double points here. And the idea is the following. Here, we consider a set of pairs of the single points x1 and x2, such that the image of x1 and x2 are equal. And you consider the diagonals in this space and in this space, Cn times Cn and Cp times Cp. And now we And now we consider the ideals which define the diagonals above space. Now we build a matrix alpha as a solution of these systems. And now we define the double point space D2F as a complex space by this idea. By this idea, it's the pullback of the F times F star, it's the pullback of the diagonal in the target. When you make the pullback, this is another idea in the source. Not exactly the source, it's the OC to n, the source times source, plus the minus n times n of this matrix of. Of these metrics, alpha. It's something technical, but we need to give a precise and appropriate analytic structure for this double point set. Okay. So this is called the double point idea of map. Okay. So an example, when you consider this map term given by x squared, x cubed minus minus x times y. And the third coordinate is y squared. And the last one is y cubed plus x times y. So in this example, we can find the solutions of this system and you can construct this matrix. Now we proceed, you find the minors two by two. You find the minus two by two of this matrix, and we take the pullback of the diagonal, and you find the analytic structure for the 2F. Okay. And our first result is exactly this. When you consider this ideal as a complex, an ideal which An idea which gives the analytic structure for the double points. We prove, you find a proof to express the double points as the dimension over C of this local ring divided by two. So I will give some ideas of the proof. So it's not hard. This part is easy. We start with a study. We start with a stabilization. So we are in the nice dimension of matter. So a stabilization exists. And now we see that the stabilization, when you consider the stabilization with one parameter, it's a map jerk from C capital N to C2 capital N minus 1, where N is in the function of the N plus 1. The n plus one. Capital N is equal to n plus one. Okay, so in this case, D2F is one dimensional. Therefore, there is a result from Noy Balesiris and Jordan Hepedis that says that D2F is coimacolic. So the next step, it's considered the projection of the double point set. The double point set in the parametric space. So, since the double point set is Komakoli, this projection is flat. And so, we can calculate naturally the number of double points simply as the degree of this projection restricts the double point set. And by a classical result in commutative algebra, we have that this degree is This degree can be viewed, can be calculated as a multiplicity, precisely these multiplicities, the pullback of the maximal ideal in the local ring of C. And now you can show that this ideal, this pullback here, is a primary ideal in O D2I. D2F. And now, if it's a primary ideal and this ideal D2F is qui-Macaulay, so this multiplicity is equal to its length. And now we take the equality from 2 and 3, which is this one, this one. Okay, we have this result. So we know the next step is. The next step is to look for a particular case and try to find another formula for this case using this result. And the next case, a particular case, is to consider the quasi-mogeneous case. But first, let's see an example. The same example, here it's the matrix finding the last. The last slides is the same example. And when you use singler, we can find that the coordination of this ideal is equal 12, which is exactly two times the number of global blocks. Okay, so the quasi-ogenous case, now we will consider a map term Cn to C4, C2 to C4. C2 to C4. It's a measure notes of the origin, or in other words, it's an a finite map term. And if f is quasi-mogeneous, when here these notations means that double one is the weight of x and double two is the weight of y. And d1, d2, d3, d4 are the degrees of the entries of this map. entries of this map, the weighted degrees of the entries. So with this notation, we can calculate the number of double points of F by this formula. I will improve this formula in my presentation after to make some comments on this proof. I will show how this formula can be improved. Improve it at least the presentation of this formula. But let's look at an idea of the proof of this proposition. So to prove this proposition, we construct another ambient. So here we have a map from C2 to C4. So the idea here is to consider. So the idea here is to consider the double point E2 of F given by the matrix described above. And now we will do some another ambient to make a pullback after some considerations. So this another ambient, it's a ring of with 10 variables. With 10 variables, and I will consider something like the ideal mode, but it's generic. It's something with genetic variables. So you consider this ideal i as the minus of a matrix four times two matrix given by the variables. Plus another ideal E2 of plus these relations. So the idea here is we can consider a map term from C4 to C10 with the following property. When you take the pullback of I, this is exactly the ideal mode. The ideal of modes or the double points. And an important thing here is that this ideal is Koimacauli and the coordination of these ideals in the respective ambience C10 and C4 are exactly the same. Now, with these conditions, with these conditions here, when you Here. When you calculate a minimal resolution of this ring, when you take a pullback of this minimal resolution, we get a minimal resolution of this another ring, which is the local ring of the double point cell. Okay, but But remember that we have the homogeneous, quasi-mogenous case. And we would like to calculate to express the number of double points in terms of the degrees and then the weights of f. And this resolution, this minimal resolution, it's not graded. It's not a graded resolution. So we need here make a graded shift. And shift an appropriated grade and shift of this minimal resolution. And we can find the appropriated shift in each of the entries of the minimal resolution. And with the gradient shift, now we obtain another minimal resolution for the same local ring. But now it's a gradient resolution. Greater than the resolution. Here is the shift. It's a poor calculation, but it works well. And now the idea, the main idea, it's considered a point-ahead series of each of part of my minimal resolutions. And the idea here is the The idea here is the alternating sum of the Pocahontas series in an exact sequence of graded models is equal to zero. Now, I would like to calculate the Poincare series of this local ring. So, it's the same to calculate the Poincare series of each of these terms and take the alternate summary. Is exactly here. The Poincare series of the local ring R cochinate by I2 of F is something like this. And the last step is to consider the point I see at in one as the limit as t goes to one. When you consider this limit, you get exactly the formula. Formula. It's exactly this one. And now the proof follows by the previous proposition, which says that the dimensions of O4 co-chained by the mode ideal is two times the number of double points. Okay, so when you want to try to use the same technique in the case n equals to three, everything works exactly the same. Works exactly the same, but the calculations take something very, very broad, very, very big. It's a big calculations in the case. The calculations increase. And here's the formula for the case n equals 3. The formula starts here and finish here. This is a very big form. Okay. form. Okay, but now what can we found a closed formula? So instead to state this formula in this one for the case n equal two, we find a closed formula for all n. So here depends on n so we consider a map change from c n to c to n and therefore And the formula, a compact formula, it's a follow-up. It's exactly this formula. Here we have the product of the degrees. Here, we have a kind of weighted product of the degrees. And here, we have a product of the degrees of the weights of the map chair. And there is some relations about these powers. About these powers here. We present in our paper a proof in the case where n is equal to one, two, and three. This formula, in examples, when you try to prove, to test this formula for n equals to four, this formula works again, but works again but we do not have a proof in the case n greater than three because when you try use the same technique the calculations increase very very very quickly okay so finish this part I would like to to make a remark which is to consider another invariant So we see this invariant in the talk of Elenis, which joint work with Maria with Seginia, so a paper of Elenis and Sejina. And in this paper, they define the delta variance for this class of objects. But here we have a natural question. If n is greater than or equal to 2, it is true that the number of double points is equal to the df, because this is exactly what happened with plane curves. So it's natural to do this question, to consider this question in a general case. And the answer is no. It's no. So when you consider this map germ, it's an example from the paper of CG. From the paper of Segina and Elenisi. When you calculate the number of double parts, it's equal to three. But when you calculate the delta invariant, it's equal to four. So we note here that the delta invariant is greater than the number of double points. So another natural question is, it is true that the delta invariant is greater than or equal the number of double points in the general case. Double points in the general case. Now the answer is yes. So we have another proposition. When you consider a map term from Cn to C2N, which is an immersion outside the orange, it's possible to give a convenient analytic structure. I will skip the description of the analytic structure for the image, but it's not a redocible structure. Let me see. Let me see some few, some words. Here, the analogy structure for the image is something like a Gaffney definitions for multiple points. We consider a civilization of this map. We take the image of the civilization, which is CN. It's a virus. A variant with dimension n plus one, and we take the reduction of the stabilization of the image of the total space. Now we cut this total space with t equals zero and we return to our original map. But now the special fibre of the The special fibre of this total space, which is, as I said, the same as the image of the F, but it may have no reduced structure. Okay, and this proposition shows that with this non-reduced structure, the delta F can be calculated as. Can be calculated as the number of double points plus another invariant introduced by Croyl, which is defined as the dimension over C of this model, the radical of J over J, where J is the appropriated analytic structure for the image. Okay. So to finish my talk, I would like to say some words in the next. I would like to say some words in next in LED theory, more precisely in with nexing lead of map germs from CN to C2N. And let's start with our first result about this subject. And we proved that when you take, when you start with a map check from Cn to C2N, which is finatic. Which is finitely the term of germ, and we consider one parameter unfolding of this germ. Then the following statements are equivalent. So the first one is our criteria of exingularity. So f is with an exingular, if and only if the number of double points and all polar multiplicities of every Polar multiplicities of every index are constant, m0, m2, and 4. And this is equivalent to the number of double points in our polar multiplicity of all the ints are constant. Okay, the idea to prove this theorem is to use the very famous paper of Gabli, which gives conditions. Which gives conditions to control the widgets in length of map terms from CN to CP using the polar multiplicities and the stable types. But to break this case in two cases here and the equivalence of B and C, we need to prove this proposition. We need to prove this proposition, which says that we have an alternating sum of polar multiplicities. So we can sum all the polar multiplicities in an alternative way, and the result is equals one. Okay. And the last result, which is a simple corollary, it's a simple consequence of this. Of this result, it's that we can calculate the order obstruction of the image of a map germ Cn to C2N. Here we have another case, but in fact we prove the case P equals to 2N. And the other section of the image here, the image image doesn't matter which this analytic structure of f of scene you can consider the reduced structure and this is given by we consider the image we consider a hyperplane a genetic hyperplane and you cut your our image of f with this hyperplane now you take the prey image and Gray image, and it's not hard to see that this variite is an issue, isolated, completed intersecting vertex in the source in CN. So we can calculate the immunon number of these issues, and with this formulation, this is exactly the Euler obstruction of the image. And this is all. Thank you very much. Any questions, comments? No question, no comment? I have one question. Okay, yes, please go run. Yes, please go on. Yes, I can I can see yes, yes, please. Hi, Daniel. I don't know if the people listen to me. Okay. Can you repeat the question? Can you repeat the question or the comment? Okay, I'm not saying the question. Okay, hi, Elena. How are you? Hi, Elenis. I have one comment. I have a doubt with respect to if I understand very well your talk. When you prove your formula for the number of double points, For the number of double points in terms of weights and degrees for quasi-mogeneous from C2 to C4, use a proof that perhaps is so specific for this case. No? Yes. And here, do you have a closed formula or is an expectation for in the general for n greater than two? Okay, okay. This is this is not clear in my talk. Not clear in my talk. Okay. No, it's for me, perhaps. For me, it's not so clear. Okay, quickly, let me explain this better. Okay, when you start our study, we do not have this formula yet. So when you compare the two case, the case when you consider n equals to 2, we have this formula. We have this formula. When you try to find the formula for the case n equals to 3, we find this another formula. It's a very big formula. But we can express this both formulas in this compact way. And now, when you try to prove this general formula for n greater than 3, yes, we. Yes, we having problem, have a problem here because when you use the same technique, these minimal resolutions increase. And so the calculations may be something crazy is. And so this is a open problem. So we expect, there is something. There is something expected that this formula is true for n greater than 3, but we don't have any proof. Okay. It's because in your hypothesis, do you need the condition that the germ is afinite? Afinite, exactly. Because if this germ is monomial, is a current one map. Because our results from C D and I, if the jar from C n to C P is a finite and monobial, it's in this case, this map is current one, and you have a closed formula for Vf for current one maps. And perhaps you can recover this in your formula here. I don't know. I don't know if. know i don't know if you understand yes yes we we we we make the the the comparison or make an analysis and when you you you have the crop case and this problem generalize the cron case this works for for any chronic and in the difference in the cron case is when when you have a map germ in the A map term in the with correct work correct one. The double point set is a complete intersection. Now we can use an appropriated statement of bisoup theorem. And with this theorem, the bisoup theorem, we can find a closed formula. But when you When you consider the general case, the double concept is not a complete intersection. And so the number of equations is not clear and we have some problems to use the same technique in the equal case. Yes, okay, I understood. It's because if I know that for you have. That's for you have other examples of a map that's not current one, a finite, and not current one. This map F is not monomial because we don't have current one maps. Monomial, A finite, only this map are monomial. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Monomial and A finite F is current one. f is current one ah okay okay with this with this if you want to if you want to obtain an example of a map in these dimensions that is a finite of other correct that's not one this map is not monomial it's not monomial ah this is cool it's cool well congratulations very nice talk Very nice talk. Thank you. I can't hear something is. Something is saying something. In your Whitney equisingularity, so you characterize Whitney equisingularity in terms of the double point. Of the double point, the number of double points, and the pair, the multiplicity of even or odd number. So have you tried to replace the double points by the delta invariant? Ah, this is a good question. Yes, in the case when you have n equals equal to equals equal to two and current one case we can we can replace the double point the constants of the number of double points and the constants of the polar multiplicities for the delta area yeah so it's it's something uh something similar to to happen with with plan with plane curves plan with plane curves uh no no uh with with curves we have a result which gives a characterization of within x singular which it's a mu non number the constant of muon number and the constant of the multiplicity we can reproduce this case when the coronque is one when is the corona is one we can change here by the delta invariant and we can consider only the And we can consider only the multiplicity of the. Yes. Well, I think we have one example in the paper with Elenisi, but I don't remember the dimension in which we showed that the delta invariant is not an invariant for Whitney equisingularity. So it would be interesting to look because then this says something about the Groyos invariant, right? Right. Right? Right. So let's make a remark here. When I say delta variant here, you are right. It's because this is the classical delta variant. So we can introduce another kind of delta variant, which is the groyous delta variant, which relates these. Which relates this with a no-reduced structure. So, to make this theorem works well, replace the double points here by the delta variant, we need to consider the groier's delta variants. Okay, yes, yeah, sure. Thank you. Welcome more questions or comments? Not here online? No? Okay, so let us thank Atoniel, the speaker again, please, for this beautiful talk. Yes, yes. Thanks, Attoniel. It was very clear and inspiring, I think. Okay, so before we go for a break, let me see. The next talk will be at 1145. We have scheduled another speaker who unfortunately cannot speak. Speaker, who unfortunately cannot speak. So instead of her, we'll have a talk by Agustin Romano. Okay.
