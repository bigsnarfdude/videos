Second, so it's a pleasure for me to introduce another Brazilian friend, Maxo Cabal Canchi, Pederal and Pala Goes, and he'll talk about the stability of KDD breeders on their health line. Thank you, Marcel, for that. Thank you, Luis, for the presentation. Thank you to the organizing for this last invitation, Claudio, Miguel, Lucasia. I'm very happy to be speaking here. It's nice to come. He is speaking here. It's a nice conference. I'm very happy to do this. This is, I usually join to work with Professor Miguel Alevo Dankosho. This is the outline of my talk. I split my talk in three parts. The first part, I will comment about a few about the modified KDV equation. In the second part, I will comment about the semi-results associated to the breed. Results associated with the bridge solutions. In finally, you intend to speak about the arbitrary stability of bridges for the modified KDV equation on the half-line. So, in Italy, this is the model we will talk today about the modified KDV equation. It's a type of KDV equation with this two-linear non-linearity. And this equation is a well-known comparative. Equation is a well-known complete integral model with infinitely many conservative quantities. Yes, with table X-PA formulation, the vessel scattering theory has been applied by many authors in order to describe the behavior of solution in generality and originally describing shallow water wave dynamics and therefore appear as a good approximation of different physical problems. Well, on the context mathematically, this equation, the modified equation, appears small as A pair of small eyes in this form is a Cauchy problem with the initial data generally is considered in the classical solid space 8S and they have the key solution of this model have a finite number of conservative quantities. I put here three of them here. The mass is conserving the energy. Also the second ordinary energy estimated. And as you estimating is concerned. Okay, my focus in this talk is to comment about this model on the half-line, but before to motivate our study, I prefer to comment a few about the MICADEV model on the real university. And I put here only a sample of the results. For example, CATO objecting the local poses in the energy. In the energy, the space cannot hear you. Mars, something happened with your phone. Marcel, are you there? Are you there? Right, you connect your phone again. Put it out. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Let me. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. Okay. I'm sorry, maybe isn't the connection. Can you hear me well now? Can you hear me well now? Yes, yes. Okay, let me put me. I'm sorry. Okay, this is the semi-result about the Emica Desi equation. On the realigning, first cut orbitality in the energy space, S equal to one, can possibly improve the results for more low regularity. Assumptions call it out in Tau Beta, Global Posiness in this. In this set of irregularity. And finally, Wu and Tishimoto obitanidic global posins in the sharp index of regularity. Another question is this is the regularity index is the sharp. The answer is yes, because of this result of chemical severe that they prove that the net cannot be uniformly contained on EHS for SLS one over four. Okay, let me. Okay, let me talk about the semi-particular solutions. The certain solutions is very new with this form, with this profile. There is an exactive form with this former. And this is the picture of a soliton. It's localized on the space and moving to white toward sizing of the line. Sizing of the line, and there is some results, interesting results concerning the solutions for the Mikado V equation or the quote history of the line. I point you one example of the A21 stability of Mikadiv equation. Also, I put here some autos that study the L2 stability of caddy sultans and moot sultans. And finally, I put some results of the asymptotic stability of saltons for the M-Caddy V equation on the The MDV equation on the contest of the full line. But in this talk, the focus is the instead of the Bridge solution and the British solutions, especially solution I would definitely ask, but it appeared in the paper of Vadak in 1973, where he studied the equation by using aggressive scattering. And in particular, was obtaining for the first time a new family of the solution load as. Of the solution of ice breeders. After Kenny Ponce Vega using this special solution to get to prove that the method that solution is not uniformly continuous for this set of regularity. The using of breeding solutions was essential in the proves. And here's the definition of the breeding solution is more sophisticated if you compare it with the. Is more sophisticated if you compare it with the solid or battery. You cannot detect in the second line of this definition, the special waiver, you cannot detect there is a part of the solution, the multiplier of the function here is a localized function. And if you come, if you notice the variable y, you have a function periodic on the timing and localized on the space. This is the principal, the principal character. The principal characteristics of these solutions. It's important to notice these parameters. The parameters delta lambda is very important to us, which depends the original parameters of the breeders, because differently of the sortos, the breeders can move leftward or rightwards differently of the surface. For example, the pages of the choose of the parameter. Of the choose of the parameters alpha and beta. This is the picture of the breeders moving left toward, localizated in a portion of the negative half-line in this context. Here, when I say before, this is a solution which is periodic variable y and localizating in variable y2. In variable y2. Also, note that these parameters are different. If these parameters are different, then we have these arguments always different. It's very interesting. It's important to note also we consider the special functions, the two important directions associated with partial translations. For example, if you consider a burial solution, these two functions. Two functions is very important because there are the durations of instability of the breedings in this context. Now, another question is if the breeding occurs, for example, for the KDV Casco KDV module. If the answer is not, because of this recent result of the Claudio and Gustavo three years ago, they proved that if They prove that it's impossible to get to obtain breeds for the model if they discover the type equation for this kind of non-linearity. In particular, for square nonlinearity, f equal square of u, it's impossible to get a breakdown solution because it's not possible to obtain an ultra-real solution. Time and not in your solution periodically while the time satisfies this condition if you assume this context. Then it's very interesting that we can see now that the breeders don't occur in the Cadive Casco model. And also, other interesting results obitanity semi-year ago was obitanity by Miguel and Claudio that they proved that brilliant solutions of the Divergent solutions of the focusing immigration equation in all lineage are globally stable in a natural 82 topology. Our first gradient in this proof is to get the brain solution satisfies this ODE. It's very important, these results, because after this, it's possible to define it a lapon of control because the using of this ODE. Of this ODE. A more recent result concerning British solutions is the Salton resolution projector obtained by Shelley Qing and Liu. They prove that the Salton resolution for the focusing Mechanivi equation on the real line was obtained that you can split the solution as the sun of Senators moving to the right and Britain traveling through both directions. And Britain traveling through both directions in a large dataset term. Then, because of this, in the previous result, we cannot the importance of these particular solutions in order to describe the dynamic of any solution in this context. Now, you explain the model that we work in this talk. We consider the entire equation of the half-lines. Of the half lines. First, we consider the Cadive equation of the positive half line in the context of mathematics appears as the initial boundary value problem. You can see the initial data in the sublive space and the boundary data general in this space. This index depends on the index of S. This number is coherent with the, for example, the smooth. For example, the most affected type of obitidi bikini postive. Then, if you are not considered this problem, was studied for many authors for Connecticut, for example, obitani de local posing. In this pebbularity, myself and Carlo obitany distability of solvents posed initially far away from the origin it were for the cast occasional equation. For the classroom caddy equation, the right half line assume homogeneous boundary conditions, and more recently, we obtained the asymptotic stability of sultans in A21 for the Casco Cadiv. Not that here I took the modified Cad V and the two results are in the Cadiv equation, is for the Cadiv equation, but the problem does work well if we consider the supercritical non-linearity for the type Padding equation. Also, there is other problem, not that this problem on the negative half line is different because you cannot affect boundary condition with other level of regularity for this boundary data. And it's very important to consider these other conditions because if you don't plot this condition, you probably will be kill positive in this context. You positive in this context, then you can see the crucial difference between two problems. In this talk, I will consider the MEKADV MIOS, this problem, IBVP, with intentionally study stability of breeding only for this model. Okay, but it, as far as we know, has not yet resulted of existence. A result of existence, the local poses for this model. One for the model on the positive graph line. But it's not complicated to get this result sign sheet. It's possible to use the approach of Paminski combining it with the Neutralian estimates. And not that in the context of Half-Line by using the Borgian approach, it's extremely necessary to work with the semi-adaptive Borgian type space for Bell as well. In type space for bel as one over two because the both terms, but it's not so complicated. And for example, myself in Chikwani orbital some time ago, the local posiness in a similar linear estimate for the Kakahara equation. Then, because of this, we believe that it's possible to get the robustness for this model. Integral fairy is In the global theory is easily obtained for more particular boundary conditions by my big semiplar estimates. Okay, let me explain about the dynamics of the solution for these models. For example, here, we consider breeders in the negative half-line. It's natural to define it as the history of the breeders. Restriction of the breeds, complex breeds, or the negative half-line. Note that this definition induces a natural trace. The trace function is the trace of the breeders. The second trace is the trace of the derivatives of the brain function also. Then we consider in this work, in these talks, I won't consider these border functions. Also, the principal results of the time by myself, Alejo, and Kosho was essentially accept for publication. If you consider are restricted breeders, when I say before, assuming that not that in this context, apparents are particular conditions of the coefficients there in alpha differently of the phase. Differently of the paper of the Alejo Emoise, where it's not necessary to assume this, but unfortunately, in this context of outlining, I paired semi-restrictions in this result. There is three parameters that are the original parameters of the breeders, such that for elegator, which implies that the breeders are located so far from the origin in the negative. The origin in the negative size of the half-line. Consider the initial condition in this space, this is a natural space to get stability if you consider the steroids paper. And if you consider the initial condition closing to the breeders, then there exists a continuous function O1 and O2 in R such that the solution keeps closing to the solar. I'm sorry, it's not. I'm sorry because Dr. Perry, but what he has here is that the complex solution, UT minus this breed, with the new correction terms, keeps causing yet of the solution. Not that our results, we assume that the homogeneous boundary conditions H equal H1 homogeneous. Equal, as you were homogeneous. It's very natural because we have these traits of the breeders, but these traces are very few if you consider the breeders so far from the origin. Okay, let me and I will try to comment about the principal points in our proof. First, our proof involves an almost conservative labor of functional despidi in the phase. Despite in the paper of Familia Agriculture, for which we have to quote also boundary terms, also some contributions that occur because the HC breeders is not an exact solution for IBVP and MICADV minus. In order to control these therapies, we use the argument used by myself, Claudio, in the past concerning the KDV equation and the study of the sort of solutions in this context, the stability of solutions. In this context, the stability of social solutions in this context. Well, some points deserve to be enlightened. For example, a natural question is the necessity of these assumed. It's very important to assume this because in the energy estimates, we will find some embedded rates, higher pinchers, which are the fundamental gradients to construct the almost intranol. Another question is if it's approach, does it work for the right half line, but unfortunately does not work since the case of the ABVP on the right half line are changing up in problem. This problem imposes a very new conditions with respect to. Very new conditions with respect to the left half-line case, as for instance, that the breach is speed on that we cannot post a second boundary condition to the corresponding IBVP, then we cannot assume this. And because of this, our construction of the Lyapunov functional is not possible in this context. Well, let me explain about how to construct this concept Lyapunov function. Construct this concept the apology functional, we consider the three classical functions of mass, energy, and second or the energy terms, which are well defined before solution in this space. In this case, when I work in half-flunic, differentity of the complexity lining apparent trace terms, you cannot get this. You cannot bet these terms will appear, but if you consider the condition, a lot of these terms will disappear. For example, how can you see now in this lemma? In this lemma, you cannot get the in general, it's not conserved, the mass, the energy, the second order energy estimate. It's not conserved, but you can see that, for example. You can see that, for example, if you work in this particular homogeneous boundary conditions, we have that the mass in the second or the energy estimate is concept appears a different sign for the inquiry of the energy. But if you assume the alphabet, a particular numbers, it's possible to construct the alphabet. To construct our the apology functional. Note that also it's possible by using this, the mess in the second order analyzing, it's possible to show that the local solution of our problem with initial data in this space, homogeneous conditions, can be extended globally in the time. It's important to us because we want to study the dynamic of the zoom. Note that it's important to note that in the case of the right half line, only by use the homogeneous boundary conditions of the F that the element of the right half line, we only need to assume, we assume by assuming only this appears this term on the traces of the second energy estimate term. Because of this, our construct of Lapolar's functional. Construct of Lapolar Protonal does not work. And this is the main reason to not address the case of the breed is moving right towards breeders. Also, now the pre-staring gradient of our probe is based on the work of FIMI GLE Cloud, where we define it very strictly the upgrade infra. Note that it's important to see this term because This term, because of our lemma, we have this equation energy. But by choose better alpha satisfying this condition, we can see that the function of H is well-defined in the financial condition U0 in this space and homogeneous model conditions. Therefore, H has the flow amount of property, which is very important to get a future result. That are full-time results. And not that this hypothesis is coherent with this first hypothesis. Not that this hypothesis means that the breed is moving leftwards, but because of this, the apology inferno, we need add this additional, more restrictive conditions of the parameters. Okay, when work with this functional affairs, this operator, the natural operator, L is well, this operator was well studied by Alejui Muyois in the context of full line, also appears the quadratic form associated with this operator given by this forma. Egypt is interesting, it's not complicated to get from the ideas of Claudio and Guel. The perturbation of the breeders satisfies this identity, not that after some bad terms. Here we have the quadratic form that we can use in the modulation in order to avoid the directions of illustability. And we need also to contribute to these traits. Also, to contribute to these traits to get the time stability. Also, there is this term, but this term is not important times we have this estimate. Then this part can be absorbed for the other side. In this case, the proof of the term, it's an argument of a bootstrap. We can assume the specific hypothesis of the theorem. The fairing. We assume that the initial data is closer to the breeders. We will choose after this parameter at zero. We consider the global solution in this class with homogeneous boundary conditions. We define the maximum timing of the stability defined by this former. With arguments of contradiction, we can prove that. Of contradiction, we can prove that this time of stability is not finite because it's possible to prove that if time is finity, we can improve this inequality. And this modulation is very important. It was also does work well because with this modulation, we can choose appropriate functions, O1 and O2, such that we To such that we can venture the body directions of the instability of the buildings. And note that here we can put the values of Ho Chu in this setting. It's very important to is because this localizes the breeders. It's very important in order to don't break out the stability. The breeders keep The breeders keep so far from the breeders in this situation. Because of this, we needed to control the values of then this worked well by using the implicit push on theorem and the classical way. And also it's possible because of this well, because of this very much, it's possible to control the traces. Also, we can control the air hole, it's very small. Is very small. And finally, the final statement, the proof of the theorem consists of making a sweet extension of the spectral problem to the whole line. In the experience of myself in Carlo in a previous paper, because if you consider the operator L in the half line, it's very complicated to orbit the spectral properties, but with semi-appropriate tensions, the control of the semi-thermals. Of the semi-terms, it's possible to control to get the coefficient of this operator. The results of IT9 in this talk is this, which Alejo Adan used the ideas of this paper, also of its paper. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Omasu, for the talk. Any questions or comments? Hi, Marcia. Hi, hi, Fabio. When you consider those conserved functionals, okay. The term that you call tau, tau something, tau something, tau. Tao something, tau something, tao something. Tao you remember the terms tau the tau terms, Marcio. Ah, okay, okay, the trace, the trace. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, okay, there, yeah, those terms. So, um, is there any possibility? Um is there any possibility that you can choose uh your boundary condition in such a way that some of them are good? Or you do questions about if it's possible to host their other boundary conditions yes instead of homogeneous, yes, I in my opinion is very complicated because uh it's possible, for example, to show that the Possible, for example, to show that this traces is well defined for any timing, but these terms, these functional traces, for example, can be increased a lot, for example. I can see how to control globally these trace. It's well defined for any time because of these factors, the space of the traces, but I cannot see how to control. How to control in a general way if we consider more general boundary conditions. Okay. Any other question? Let's thank Marcel again. Thank you.
