Okay, thank you. Today we have Jeremy on who will be telling us about odd primary analytics of real orientations. All right, well, thanks very much for inviting me on the course. And I'm going to be talking about some joint work with Andrew Sanger and Dylan Rosen. So Andy is a graduate. So Andy's a grad student at MIT. He's going to be graduating next year. So he's going to need a job. We should hire him. You should invite him to give talks at your seminars. I think he's excited to go out into the world a little bit more. And Dylan, Dylan's right there. He's also sort of the godfather of everything I'm going to be talking about. So accept all the errors. So yeah, he's going to. He'll also need a job in two years. He needs no more. He needs no. Alright, so pardon me, I'll start a little bit slowly and just remind you that there's a complex orientation. So a complex orientation of some homotopy ring R is a map from the suspension of C p in 2 to sigma 2 R with a special property that restricting to S2. Restricting to S2 gives the unit map. And such a thing of some homotopy ring R exists whenever pi two star minus lambda r is zero, and that's just because Cp infinity has even cells. Okay, so there's some C2 equivariant analog of this notion, so-called real orientation. And that's something involving this rho sphere going to sigma infinity, C infinity r with its complex conjugation action, going to sigma rho r. So again, we require that this be the unit. This be the unit. And that is something that exists for C2 equivariant rings. And that exists most commonly when pi star rho minus 1 r is 0. And again, that's because of some kind of cell scale. Cell structure on this Cp infinity R, which refines that cell structure, but we're remembering some complex conjugation action. And so this notion of a real orientation has proven to be quite useful. So real orientations lead to computations. of homotopy fixed point spectral sequences, especially the fixed point spectral sequences that arise in chromatic homotopy theory. So this is a fact that was probably first really spelled out and exploited by Hugh and Creesch, and then really took off with work about Golf with work of Phil Hopkins Ravenel that used wheel orientations to solve their career in variant one problem. And then many of you know how this story continues much better than me. So for example, some names that did some homotopy fixed point spectral sequences, Danny Xi, Zhou Li Zhu, Guojin Wang, Leonard Meyer, Agnes Baudry, Irina Bakova, Vesna Stojanovska, Drew Hurd, Guchuan Li, Kichlu, Wilson, Lorman. Teacher Wilson Lohrman. So many of you are in this audience. I apologize if I missed anyone. But I just want to say that this notion has some legs to stand on. It really seems like a useful thing to have around when computing homotopy fixed point spectral sequences in chromatic homotopy theory. And so the sort of dream is to make a similar theory. But let's make this theory useful for understanding Cp actions in chromatic monotopic theory, in particular, when P is greater than P. Alright, so this is a dream that I and several others have had for and several others have had for many years. It seems always a weird situation that we have these powerful tools at the prime too and we just don't understand analogous tools at odd prime. But maybe after a few years the dream becomes sort of a siren song. But I want to say a few things that we can say, right? And most of the things that we can say come from a certain construction. Right, and the point of course is that when you first consider this, you don't really know what to do. Complex conjugation is something that doesn't really have some obvious generalization. There's only one sort of nice field automorphism of the complex numbers that we will talk about. But then you meet Julian Wilson, and he tells you this sort of marvelous construction, and if you're anything like Andy and I, you get hooked. Andy and I, you get hooked, right? So, what is this construction? So that CP and the UP is not the fiber of the CPF. So let's say it's the study should be called a multiplication map. This map from C p infinity crossed p times reaches one copy of C P infinity, which takes a point in here represented by P tuple aligned bundles to the tensor. to the tensor product. So if we give this the sort of cyclic permutation action, which rotates these, rotating them doesn't change their tensor product. So that's equivariant if we give this the trivial action, trivial Cp action. In fact, you could even make a sigma p equivariant version of this. This is invariant under all permutations, but for simplicity, Mutations. But for simplicity, for now let's focus on the Cp action that underlies that sigma p action. Okay, so you just take the fiber of this map and you call that Cp infinity mu p. So the underlying non-equivariant, in other words, space of CQ infinity with each is C p infinity crossed together P minus 1 times. So if you just take the finer of this multiplication math, ignore the C p action, you get something homotopy equivalent to P minus 1 cuff views of C p infinity. The fixed points are determined And by a fiber sequence, you take V P infinity plus P times. We map it the other multiplication to C P infinity. The final of that is C p infinity over P. Fixed points respect fiber sequences, so if you calculate the fixed points of sequence The fixed points of Cp infinity mu V are just taking the fixed points along the defining fiber sequence. But the fixed points of the trivial action are just Cp infinity back again. Everything's fixed. The fixed points of the cyclic action, on the other hand, are sort of the diagonal copy of Cp infinity. So that's going in the equivalence under the fixed points. Just saying the copy that looks like I'm just saying the copy that looks like L L L L L. So the same thing in every coordinate. And then what is this map? This map on fixed points takes a line bundle to its pth tensor power, because we're viewing it as p copies of that line bundle and then multiplying them together. So the parameter of that is well known to be B C P. So we calculated that the CP fixed points or the CP meeting are just Okay, so just in remark CPM thing equals two so do not need to worry about So, do I need to worry about having a strictly equivariant? I don't even know that I understand what the word strictly equivariant means. Maybe Dillian. If you like this, you can define it like Elmendorf style, so you can declare that to be the fixed points, and then that's clearly Borel equivariant, and there's a MACT the whole time. But there isn't a nice I don't know if there is. Well, I don't know. How can you make me a strict multiple commutative multiplication? Multiple commutative multiplication on this. I guess you can, right? Because it's a pre-abbeli for the two squared. So if the symmetric isn't symmetric. Some are the co-induced pre-abeliator for the two squared. Like that. Alright. So yeah, so I just wanted to say CK infinity mu2, so just restricting this notion to the prime 2, has underlying the space of 2 minus 1 copies of CK infinity is just CK infinity. is just C p infinity and also C p infinity mu 2 C two fixed points is R P infinity, which is P C two. And indeed, this notion really generalizes the real orientation picture, C P infinity mu2 as a equivariant space is equivalent to C P infinity R. Okay, great. So I just erased the definition of a real orientation, unfortunately, because there are only two boards. But the next thing I want to describe for you is what should be the notion of orientation. Alright, so if you remember, for real orientation, it's a map from the suspension spectrum of C infinity R into the row suspension of a ring or ring. So to formulate that definition, So, to formulate that definition in general, we have to figure out what should replace this notion of a row of suspension. So, can we make a definition? The spoke sphere as spoke is just defined to be the co-fiber of the natural map from Cp plus to S0. Zero. So let me just draw some examples which will show what this means. So some examples. P equals P, this spokes here look something like this. So I've got two zero cells and then two three edges. And they're being permuted like so. So this has no two cells, it's just a graph, sometimes called a theta graph. Called the beta graph. And these three edges of the graph are being permuted cyclically. At k equals 2, this is where the stokes here just has two edges. They're being sent to one another. So that goes by another name. It's also known as the sigma sphere. Right, so I think Chloe Ren√© sometimes calls this the egg beater or something, because it's an infinite picture. Theater or something, because it's a nice picture. So the underlying on a copy type. And the spoke is just a wedge, but P minus one copy is one. So if I forget the What's the tech code for that superscript? Why write? Y right. Capital Y. Capital Y right. Capital Y right. Sorry. You come up with something better last time. What are you talking about? This symbol. I cannot see this thing. It's a y lying on the side. It's supposed to be. It's supposed to be a picture of the roots of unity, the third roots of unity. We're open to better names, but we did try this. So wait, is this tech code if this is out there you have to embed it? So if someone wants to make a seven fruits of unity picture or something, We should do that there at the 5. So by definition, we use the 1 plus spokesphere, which is a note, just the ordinary suspension of these spokes here. These things are pointed, by the way, by these point bottom, if you like. So, you know, the suspension here. And I'll say something like sigma 1 plus say something like sigma 1 plus rook x to denote s1 plus load smash of x. So I really want to think of these things as spheres and use the notation as though they were spheres. But they're not spheres. They're what you might call slice spheres. And they're sort of wedges of spheres in their underlying homotopy type. They're also not invertible, so we can't keep them stably. Yeah, they're not invertible, they are negative spoken. Regularizable and spectral. S negative spoke smash. S spoke is not S. Spoke smash, S spoke is not S smoke. That's correct, and it's S mount plus count. That leads to most of the annoying that is in this theory, but nonetheless, my aim today is somehow to convince you that this is sort of obviously the right thing to do if you want to be doing chromatic homotopy period all the time. So, right, so, oh, one more remark. There's a natural inclusion. From S1 plus scope into the CP infinity here peak I'm enhancing, so it's some equivariant enhancement the inclusion of themselves wage two minus one copy. wage P minus 1 copies of S2, including into Cp infinity for S P minus 1, this inclusion just being the thing that induces an equivalence on the second homology group. Okay, so with all that in mind, we can now make the following definition. We might say and it does the right thing. On fix points, it's also the inclusion at the top. Yeah. So, uh, go on. Uh, so a mute the orientation of a CP ring R is a map from the suspension of C p infinity mu t to the suspension by one plus spoke of r. by one plus spoke of r uh such that the composite sorry plus one plus spoke into cp infinity mu p. So as usual with spheres, I will be ambiguous about whether I'm talking about an unstable or stable object sometimes. But that just means the suspension of the thing I was talking about earlier. And I want Earlier. And I want this composite to be signal under spoke applied to the unit. So it's a completely analogous thing to what happened with the real orientation. I'm just defining some notion of new P orientation, complex orientation. Okay, so I want to spend the remaining time telling you as much as possible. Time telling you as much as I have time to tell you about this kind of notion, and we'll see how far we get. So, the first theorem is that this kind of notion shows up in nature. There's so I'll say, and at all prime speed the CPX is the same. The C p equilarium type P minus one Narada E theory is mu p orientable, meaning that one of these mu p orientations exists. Okay, another example, the C3 spectrum. TMF with level 2 structure is unit 3 orientable. So these things that show up in chromatic homotopy theory have these orientations, at least we expect them to. So the general conjecture might be that for all That for all n greater than or equal to 1 and primes p, the height n times p minus 1, now the E theory is mu p or identical. So I should say that. So I should say that some unpublished work of Phil Hopkins Rabinelle certainly strongly suggests this is true. Maybe they even have the tools to prove this somehow. And then I guess Danny and I did the case p equals 2. Danny, she. So we sort of believe this to be true in general. And I think it's a nice goal for something to prove about these things. I am being a little bit vague about which theory. About which group theory I mean here, which field, for example. So, this one, the way it's written down currently, we really mean the Honda formal group, because that's what sort of Hopkins-Miller wrote about, and we rely on their work, as I might explain later. And then I think it's sort of open in general to what extent this will happen for a general group. Though somehow for C2, for C2, it happens for all fields. Happens for all fields. Do you know if this, do you suspect this is best possible? So you're not orientable if you're not at these heights? Well, those are the heights where there's a CP action at all in the Marava stable output group. So now I want to say a second theorem which. Wait, sorry, is that like my Ecovariant here, or is this genuine recognition? These are the same thing. These are the same thing to me. I mean like all of these Marava E-theories are uh all of these Marava E-theories are Borel. The ones you consider in the in the C2 equilibrium context are always considered as Borel things. MUR is Borel also, for example. There's no genuine stuff in this chromatic business as well. Maybe some of you are funny about it. It's just scarcely different. There's no difference because they're all in the Borel somewhere. But for little TMR2, there would be. Ah yeah, well I guess for little TMR2 there would be. Yes, that's right. But it's a good point in mind. Yeah, so somehow these connected things like uh En R tend to have some genuine stuff in them the way they're usually so Okay, so that's just kind of a definition and a challenge to generalize this theorem I wrote on the board. But I'd like to sort of get into a little bit about how this notion could help you really understand this CP action rather than just... Sorry, sorry, after what you just said, this TMF2, it's not, are you talking about connective? Yeah, if you orient the connective thing, you also will orient. If you orient the connective thing, you also will orient. That is not royal, yes. Okay. So the other sort of theorem that I think is written down and ready to announce is it's far less. There exists an app. So here exists a map. I guess we call it a VUR menu P. It goes from the two rows here into the suspension spectrum of CMC and P menu P. So I want to say what that's what I'm going to just say the theorem such that That for any UK orientation of either R equals E p minus 1 or R equals T minus 2. So just saying, talking more about these orientations from the previous theorem, the composite Of this map, V1 with P with the orientation spans the homotopy of R. So as stated, that's a little vague. I want to give an example which will demonstrate what I mean. Demonstrate what I mean. So, what does rho mean here? Rho is the real regular representation of C P. Of C P. Okay. So to explain what I mean here, I'll give you an example of TMF2, which I think is enlightening. So let's consider TMF2, which has this C3 action at P equals 3. So So high star MFT MF2. Well, if I'm working in some sort of three local context, there's anything to want to do. This just has two polynomial generators, where the degree of both of these generators is four. So here I'm just describing this as a non-equivariant thing. It's a non-equivariant thing. Equivariant thing. It's a non-equivariant thing. This is a tomatopy group. And there's a really nice discussion of this and various other things about this ring in the Resmister's thesis. That's where I would go to learn about this example. And what does a mu3 orientation give us? A mu3 orientation So mutator orientation does a composite. We have our map from CPM3 unit 3 into suspension 1 plus tilt TMF2. And we have our map from S2 row into here called V1, VO3, which has underlying So if I forget all the equivariants in this picture, I'm just getting now a map from S6 to the suspension of Cp infinity squared. That's all Cp infinity U3 is. And then that's going to go into, well, remember that this spoke sphere doesn't have underlying sphere. It has underlying spectrum of wedges spheres. So this is sigma 2 TMF2. So this is sigma 2 T M F 2, wedge sigma 2 T M F 2. Okay? And this map then picks out two classes in high chord of TMF2. So somehow this single equivariant map v. Single equivariant map, V1UP, knows about two different classes in any ring which has an orientation. And so, for example, depending on what orientation you pick, maybe you're getting lambda one is one of your two things, and lambda two minus lambda one is your other thing. Lambda one is your other thing. So you get to. Wait, did you say pi? What's the subject of pi? Just a map from S6 to sigma 22. And so you can see that these classes generate the pi four of this. These sort of more canonical, maybe, generators are linear combinations of these. And in fact, if G is a generator of C3, then G of lambda 1 equals lambda 2 minus lambda 5. So that's true by stage minus 3. So the reason why this is an allowable pair is because they're related by that sigma. Because they're related by that cyclic group of OITA3 action. And you can also see then that they not just generate pi 4 of this, but because pi 4 happens to be the place where the polynomial generators live, you can actually completely read off the entire G-action on the entire ring from this one map, the V1 VP here. And actually, if you think carefully, the fact that this is an equivariant map. Uh the fact that this is an equivariant map controls the entire homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for TMF2 and not just the action of the cyclic group avoided 3 on homotopy. So what is gamma of lambda 2 then? G of lambda 2. I think it's minus lambda 1, but you can look it up in Vesma's papers. Okay. Well, so you, you know, there are many different new three orientations. So I'm saying that if you pick the right one, you can have these two be the two classes. If you pick a different basis. All I'm saying is that there's many different bases of this reduced regular representation in Pi 4 that come from different choices of Mu3 orientation. How many orientations are there? I don't know. I mean, how many, like, ordinary content? Because everything's sitting between four, but totally different. You could, you could, for example, put those and like rotate once, or not start with. So does this mean that underlying map, does that mean that the map from S6 factors through a pinch map to S6 wedge ends 6 that go onto those two wedge sum ends on the right? I don't really. I mean, if you have a map from S6 into a wedge, that's just two separate maps from S6. That's all I'm trying to say here. Okay. So just about how many orientations there are. So pi 4 is a rep a z mod 3, a z3 3 local representation of C3. You're saying any generator of that? Yes. So we can use the But but so you can even say again why why is it pi 4 that controls the orientation? Someone does something? Oh I just I just wrote down an orientation and then I said there's this map v1 vp and its domain is 2 rho. I haven't really defined it for you, I've just said it exists. And 2 rho at the prime 3 is an S6, right? No, no, that's n I mean just for points like y at y. So if you look at it non-actively you've got Z3 plus Z3 with a size Z3 plus Z3 with a cyclic group called 3 active. And so I I think the statement is that any any generator in that module will be so let's press on. So we want to prove these two theorems that these things have orientation. That these things have orientations and that this V1 UP map exists. What you want first and foremost to understand is what is the cell structure of CP and Bin V UP? You want to know in what sense Sense A and B as even cells. And then by analyzing the low-dimensional even cells, you can produce the V1, VOP. Just by thinking about the first few attaching maps and the cell structure. So let's talk a little bit about the cell structure. So non-equivariantly CP infinity is a kz2, as was pointed out earlier. And one way to think about that And one way to think about that is that it's sin infinity of S2. Dole-tom theorem. And then similarly, if I took p minus one copies of C to infinity, that's sort of k, the direct sum of p minus one copies of z two. 2. And that can be viewed as sim infinity on a wedge of P minus 1 plus 4 S2. And indeed, C T infinity V T can be followed as C M infinity on S n plus square. So that gives So that gives a natural filtration. We have S1 plus spoke, which is just SIM 1 of itself. And that maps to SIM 2. And that maps to SIM 3. And that maps to SIM 3, et cetera, filtering sim infinity, which is C P infinity v P. So I want to say that this is obviously the sort of natural filtration that you want to be examining when you're talking about cell structure. This recovers, in this case, the ordinary cell structure on CPM3. But this isn't a cell structure in a sense that we might be used to. Sense that we might be used to in equidemic homotopy theory. The associated graded are p greater than two. Associate graded, this filtration is not made out of representation spheres. So one wants to instead start thinking about what the associated creative actually is. When you say made up, do you mean they're not representation spheres? They're not sums of representation spheres. I'll say exactly what they are in a moment. Okay. Cool. So maybe I should say. Say a summer representation scale, something like that. Okay, so let's make a recognition. Regulation the even slice sphere one of the following objects for some N and C So the sorts of things I want to allow are CP plus smash s2n. I want to allow s2n rho. And I want to allow s2n rho plus 1 plus hope. So this is something of underlying dimension 2n. Dimension 2n. This thing has underlying dimension 2n times p. And this thing has underlying dimension 2n times p plus 2. So notice that many of these examples are not spheres, right? This one's an induced sphere, this one's an index. This one's an induced sphere. This one is some even more interesting large spheres. And there's some strange features about how only these kinds of dimensions sort of show up in this business. When you restrict yourself to the prime 2, this is just saying ordinary multiples of rho rather than even multiples of rho, which is perhaps more familiar. But anyway, this is the kind of thing. Anyway, this is the kind of thing that maybe shows up in the associated gradient here. So let's just axiomatize that. CP spectrum X is homologically here if x smashed. Smash PC has big wedge SM slash BC where SM is a wedge of size spheres. An unreliable dimension to out. So I'm making some definition here that's equivariant, but it's supposed to be capturing something like having even homology. And having even homology classically is the same as admitting an even cell decomposition. Something similar is true. Something similar is true here, though it's another theorem relevantly can say that a spectrum so odd slice spheres have odd underlying dimension. Well I haven't I've never tried to formulate if you meant even slice spheres in this. Yeah, I mean so So equivalently, X emits a filtration by spectra with associated graded the wedge of the ascent. So this is the statement that it is equivalent to say that you have That it is equivalent to say that you have an even cell decomposition as to say that your homology is even. But it's some CP equivalent version. Yeah, I'm using some, I mean, so I said greater than or equal to zero here, but you could formulate a definition of bounded below more generally. I mean, it's not really out of slices. It's like in it's it's not the same. It's not the same. No, the third, if it was just the first two that are listed, that'll be even slices if you'll sense that term. But since you've got that egg meter, it's too much general. Right. I think there's a couple of points that are confusing here. One is like, are you talking about like a positive tower or a cell structure, right? Structure you may have. I mean, take one of the spheres themselves. They're homology, but they have terrible senses. Like the zerosphere has offensive. So when you say equivalently, is this, I mean, do you require that x is connected bounded below or something about frequencies? Yeah. Yeah, so so that was like a killer's estimate. So I snuck in this greater than or equal to zero here, which is saying that connected or something. You can formulate a bounded below version equals. Down to the lower version of the still running. I mean, the things which tend to orthomology become zero. Yeah, but they don't have automatic. So hz underline smash something is trivial. I mean, there must be examples of possibilities. Let's just say that. So okay. Yes, okay. So, very good. Okay, so um ah yeah, so then the here I'm a phase thing on logically here. If it emits some kind of cell decomposition, I don't really want to necessarily say that it counts. To necessarily say that it comes from the sim infinity thing. I'd rather just say that some homology computation is going to give us the cell structure we need to see. So now, just a brief sketch, sort of how we improve something like this. So the key point is that you're designing five or sequence. for simply infiniting your p. Gives the Eilenberg-Morse style equivalence which lets you calculate say the cohomology or cochains In terms of the tensor product, the norm of the ordinary cochains on ordinary Cp infinity tensor over the cochains on Cp infinity of trivial action with each u. So this kind of expression um we think turns out to be quite useful for computing out to be quite useful for computing homology of lots of things in this business. So there's much more to say about these kinds of decompositions, but in this case, I'll just say that this then receives map from just this norm using the base point here. Using the base point here, which one point to generating homology classes or dually homology classes. So that's the kind of thing that is useful to observe when uh trying to prove some kind of homological purity statement. some kind of homological purity statement in our experience. And another remark is that when p equals 2, many very interesting spaces are known to be homologically pure. Here in this sense, just meaning their biology splits. So we see, for example, Margaret Hill or Hill and Hopkins, which produces sort of purity results for things coming out of chromatic homotopy theory. So a sort of basic example is BUR. This Grasmanian certainly Grassmannian certainly has a nice even cell decomposition and some kind of homological period. And I like to think of the UR as loops infinity suspension row KUR. Thinking of it that way leads to a sort of natural conjecture, which I would really like to understand how to prove. Conjecture with. Root infinity suspension 1 plus scope ms2 was was on the logic rate here. There's another challenge for you all from beginning of this work of Hill and Hawkins at Hodpron. So are you saying that you don't actually know what the layers are? You know, I said that the structure of the proof. You know they exist, but you know, you can't write them down? Oh, we can write them down. Oh, you can't. Okay. I'm about to. At least a little bit. I just don't think we bothered to really check that it's the exact same as the sim n filtration. Okay. We sort of have, it has the associated, I mean, surely. It has the associated I mean surely it is assembling association. Well, quite many of the same formal properties. Okay, so yeah, I don't know how much time is left. With what remaining time I have, I will just say a few words about this V1UP map, how to think about it. V1 mup map, how to think about it. So maybe V1 mup has something to do with the bottom of that cell structure, which is implied by this homological purity to exist. So how's my terminal? So how does that site structure work? We have S1 plus spoke. And I really we call that CP1 MUP, 5 and Chiki. And then we go to CP2 MUP. And as long as P is larger than 2, the only possible things you can see here look like this, because there are no other even sliced cells of that dimension, unless P is 2. And then if P is larger than 3, this also has to be some wedge of induced things. And then this keeps going until you get to P minus 1. Still a wedge. And then this CP, P and U P is sort of the first interesting place that anything The first interesting place that anything can happen, and in fact, one easily calculates that something does happen. This splits into S2 row, wedge, again, some interesting. So again, there's sort of one interesting piece here. Everything else was induced all along the tower up to this point. So note. So the key locally must have been. Um most of the attachment maps must be trivial. So this, if you like, is some atom sum n thing. But another way to think about it is just what is an attaching map. Like for example, this first one, it's going to be a map from here to here with some shift. And this has an induced domain, so it's really determined by some non-equilibrium thing. Some non-equilibrium thing. And then alpha one is the first element in the homotopy groups of spheres. So there's no room for there to be any attaching math points to be localized. So let me get this straight up. Your p subquotient is S2 rho wedge a bunch of half smash products with S2P, right? Yeah, I mean everything here is in underlying degree to be p? Yes. So it's S2 rho. The so the the first one you summon it is S two rho and the second one is S two P. And the second one is S2P. Yeah, but then induced. Yeah, yeah. Wow. Okay, so P locally, most of the attaching maps would just have to be trivial because alpha1 is the first element in the homotopy groups of spheres. And so there's a first interesting attaching map is something that is a matter of mathematics. is something that goes from S to rho, maybe minus one to S1 plus local. So it's the attachment map from this very bottom of the tower to this first interesting guy here. There's a shift by the line because it's some going around map. And so we call this alpha when. How for when you repeat? So first attaching that. That's two row minus one, that's two row minus one. So the underlying sorry non-equivalent. Non-equivalent non underlying alpha UP consists of P minus 1 mapped from S2P minus 1 to S2. Just remembering that this smoke thing splits up into a ledge of P minus 1 copies of S2. One copy is those two. And these are all multiples of alpha one, as they must be, because that's the only thing in that homotopy group. Then the geometric fixed points, BCB, alpha 1 u v. And that's a map from S1 to S1, and that's multiplication by P. Sorry, is this a stable description? Yeah, I'm doing a stable thing right now. So that's multiplication by P. And this is building the beginning of a cell structure for For the geometric fixed points. Sigma, which is just fancy language for this. First cell in DCP is this multiplication by PmAP. So you can see that this thing is simultaneously building a product of P minus 1 copies of Cp infinity. Of CP infinity and on geometric fixed points building up VCP. So you see some beginning of some sort of Mahal invariant, root invariant type picture. An example, Apple 1U2, is the C2 equilibrium data map which goes from S2 rho minus 1 to S rho. S2 rho minus 1 to S rho has the effect of the geometric fixed points of being multiplication by 2. Um okay, so one other remark is that the class E1 UPS2 here that I was talking about earlier that sort of generates the homotopy of the height p minus. generates the homotopy of the height P minus one moral U theory. That factors through the inclusion here of this CPP which tells me that it's not so bad to construct this thing. Somehow we are just constructing an element in the homotopy of an object that has only one interesting attaching that. And I should say that And I should say that attaching maps in this range were sort of previously worked out also by Dylan Wilson in his thesis, and I think Mike Hill independently came up with constructions of things like this alpha 1UP sort of computationally. But here it's nice, I think, to see alpha 1UP arising in nature, in the cell structure of a very natural object. And we'll stop there. So that last thing you said about the geometric fixed points of alpha 1 UP seems to imply that all of its iterates, all the iterates of alpha 1, UP are non-trivial. That's correct for the appropriate definition of iterates, which is a little bit annoying because these are sort of not invertible spectra. The codomain of all new keys is not a spectrometer. Holding your key. It's not a sphere, it's a slice. Which makes it a little bit annoying to talk about iterates, but yes, basically, that's it. You have a universal MUP-oriented perspective? Like MURL? Yeah, so let's talk about that. So Dylan and I have a long-standing program to build such a thing, which I was going to get to if I had more time a little bit. Build the sort of the analog of VPR in Of VPR in this VP log. So we have some programmed to build this now for two plus years maybe, using some kind of version of real topological ossio homology, but more like new P topological ossio tomology. I don't know whether we'll succeed. What I can say is that whatever comes out of this is going to be complicated and I would very much like to see other perspectives. Like to see other perspectives, or maybe easier perspectives if we're lucky, on how to build this kind of object. When you say empty topological or field topology, do you mean the thing that Barr was talking about last week? No, I mean something else. For commutative ring, instead of tensoring with S sigma, you can tensor with S spoke. So if you succeeded,
