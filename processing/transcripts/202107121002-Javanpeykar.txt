Okay, welcome back, everyone. So, I wanted to give one more just reminder that after this lecture, we'll have the group photo right away. So, please stick around on Zoom. So, our next speaker is Aryan Javanpekar from Universitate, Manz. He'll be speaking on rational points on ramified covers of abelian varieties. Varieties. All right. So, again, thank you very much for the invitation and the opportunity to speak here. So, I'm going to present joint work with Corvallia, DeMayo, Lombardo, and Zanier, which is about rational points on ramified covers of obedient rights. So, the motivation and the reason I got into this whole story is Lang's conjectures, which I'm going to start with and explain a bit quickly. So, the story starts with Mordell's conjecture. starts with Mordell's conjecture which is the statement that for a smooth curve over a number field k so this big k by the way will always be a number field throughout the whole talk and when I write curve I basically mean a smooth projective geometrically connected curve and the statement that Falting's proves is that the genus of this curve Is that the genus of this curve is at least two precisely when this curve has only finitely many rational points for every number field L containing k. So this is a famous theorem and the basic question that you know started this whole Lang conjecture business is what about higher dimensions? So what would be a higher dimension? Be a higher-dimensional analog of this statement of this equivalence. Now, to just start even, you know, in a reasonable way, you should find analogs of both sides. The left-hand side corresponds to being of general type, which I'll just briefly gloss over. And this right-hand side, well, we're just going to give it a name. And I'm going to follow Lang today and call this Mordelic. As modelic. So, what Lang decided was a useful notion to introduce for a projective variety is the notion of mordalicity or pseudo-mordalicity. So, again, I have some projective variety over a number field, and I want to think about when does this have finitely many rational points. Now, it turns out that finitely many rational points is not a very natural thing to study if you leave the realm of curves, already in the realm of surfaces, finiteness. Already in the realm of surfaces, finiteness is kind of unnatural. It's a bit more natural to look at finiteness up to a proper closed subset. So let's say x is modelic. And actually, this closed subset doesn't even have to be defined over k. His modelic modulo, this delta. So this is some definition. Sometimes modelic is called arithmetically hyperbolic, but today let's call it modelic. This is modelic modulo delta. If the same modulo delta, if the same thing as before holds, so for every finite extension L, we don't have that there's finitely many set, finitely many points on this set of L rational points, but that there's finitely many L points outside delta. So this is what it means to be more daddy module delta. And then without mentioning a delta, sometimes it's usual, useful to talk about sweep. Usual talk about pseudo-mordicity. This is basically the pseudo comes from the is used when there's some kind of exceptional locus lurking around. So we call x is, we say that x is pseudomordetic if there exists a delta which is closed and not equal to x. So a proper closed subset such that for such that sorry, such that x is modelic modulo this delta. So x is modelic modulo, this delta. And modelic would just be the statement that delta can be chosen to be empty, right? So x is just for the sake of completeness, x is moreic if it is modelic modular empty set. So this gives you kind of a generalization. I mean, it kind of formalizes this property here. Of formalizes this property here, and you can then wonder: well, is there maybe some way of something that corresponds to being of genus at least two on the left-hand side, something that corresponds to maybe pseudomordalic or mordelic? And let me just already point out that for curves, if you have, say, a curve, then being modelic is the same as being pseudo-mordelic. This is what I mean about this delta not playing really a Delta not playing really a role for curves. It only becomes more interesting when you have like a surface, say, even blown up, blown up of a blow-up of a product of two curves. So with this terminology, Fautings proved that if you take a curve over k. Over k then x is of general type, right? It's just the same as being of genus at least two, precisely when it's pseudo-modelic. And Lang conjectured that this is always true. So this theorem Should be, in fact, a statement that holds for all varieties. So we have a conjecture, that's Lange's conjecture from the late 80s, maybe, that if you take a projective variety over a number field K, then in fact, this variety is of general type, if and only if it is pseudo-mordemic. And by the way, when I And by the way, when I write projective variety, I just mean projective variety, projective integral of variety. I don't necessarily mean smooth or normal. In fact, both notions on the left-hand side and the right-hand side are birationally invariant. Let me just give you a quick example of what I already mentioned before. So, for example, why the pseudo is really necessary. If you take a curve of genus at least two. Genus at least two. Then you know this is a more delic thing. But if you take the blow-up of some in some point of c times c, and you call this x, then x is of general type, because it's birational to something of general type, so it's general type. And it is also pseudo-mordellic. Pseudo-mordelic. In fact, it is modelic modulo this exceptional locus. Modulo this exceptional locus, which by which I mean the exceptional locus of this blow-up. Make it a picture. It's actually maybe a bit more clear. X basically is this surface C times C. Oops. This is X, and then there's this exceptional locus, which is a P1. This exceptional locus, which is a p1, which you have to exclude because on this exceptional locus, this delta this would be then your delta. There's obviously infinitely many rational points. So I want to make a couple of remarks about Lang's conjecture. In fact, only three remarks. I want to remark, first of all, that this conjecture holds for abelian varieties in a very strong sense. So if x So, if x is an abelian variety, let's just call a if a is an abelian variety over k then it is very far from being pseudomodelic. Then a is very far from being pseudomodelic simply because There exists some finite extension such that the set of rational points on A is in fact dense. So there's no chance of finding a delta outside which the rational points are finite. There's a dense set of rational points. And actually, the whole point of my talk is that on an abelian variety, yes, there's a dense set of rational points. So there's a lot of points, actually, but there's actually even more than you might first think. But I'll get to that. First, think, but I'll get to this a little bit later. So, there exists such a finite extension L, such that the set of L points is dense, and of course, Labian variety is not of general type. I should assume positive dimension, maybe. Right, so if anyone should. The density implies that it's very far from being pseudomodelic if the dimension is positive. Another remark, two other remarks, kind of similar in vein, is that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side, they behave very well when you perform operations such as, I don't know, blow-ups or just any birational transformation or any finite ital cover. So this is, I'm mentioning this because it's kind of used implicitly very often in this talk. Often in this talk, if you have x and y, say by rational, then x is of general type, basically by definition, if and only if y is of general type and x is finitely taught, if x is pseudomordalic if and only if y is pseudomordalic. Why is pseudo-machinic? So both left-hand side and right-hand side behave perfectly well under by rational transformations. So you could, you know, you could reduce Length's conjectures immediately to smooth projective varieties. Doesn't make it much easier, but you could do it if you'd like to. Another remark is about descending or ascending along finite etau covers. So say x to y is finite eta. Everything integral, so also surjective. Also, also subjective. Finding the tau, then x is of general type, if and only if y is of general type and x is pseudomodatic if and only if y is pseudomodetic. So, this these two remarks are there so that later on I can kind of freely move around. Later on, I can kind of freely move around X in its, you know, birational equivalence class and also replace it by a tau covers. And that won't really change statements about Leng's conjecture. Right, there is now maybe a little bit of confusion because sometimes people, they formulate a kind of a weaker conjecture, a strictly weaker conjecture, than what a length conjecture. This is, in some sense, a very strong version. sense a very strong version, in fact, sometimes also called strong Land conjecture. There's a weaker conjecture strictly implied by this strong version, which I also want to mention. So the weaker implied by the other conjecture. It's that the state, so basically, if you look at this, it says if you're of general type and you're pseudo. If you're of general type and you're pseudomordalic, if you kind of you know uh write out what this means, then you you see that well the set of rational points on such a general type variety can never be dense. And that is sometimes what is formulated, and I'll formulate it even more suggestively. In fact, suppose that this projective variety X dominates a positive dimensional variety. Variety, projective variety of general type, and this dominates, it can be over the algebraic closure over k, it doesn't really matter. Then for every field extension, which is finite, for every number field L containing k, the set of rational points is just not dense. So basically, if you're of general type, You have general type, then you cannot have a dense set. So, your rational points will always lie on some kind of curve, say, right? So, they always lie on some curve. And if you dominate such a variety, you know, if you're then also the same holds here, you cannot have a dense set of rational points here, because a dense set of rational points here would give you a dense set of rational points down there. All right, so that's kind of my artistic side of how to explain Lange's conjecture. Of how to explain Lange's conjecture. But so I want you to keep in mind that if you dominate something of general type, then we expect that the set of rational points is not dense. So what do we actually know about higher dimensional varieties? Because I just stated the case of curves and then I just started about talking about conjectures. And there is another theorem. Another theorem, which is sometimes called Falting's big theorem, which is essentially all we do know about our higher-dimensional varieties. All right, so what do we know about Lenz conjecture for high-dimensional varieties? Well, basically, as long as there is an abelian variety lurking around, you can prove Len's conjecture. And let me make this a little bit more precise. And let me make this a little bit more precise. So let's say A is an abelian variety. And let's say X is inside of A and it's closed. Then there is this special locus of X. So this is the special locus of X, which is just a priori subset. It's defined as the union of. Of translates of positive dimensional abelian sub-varieties. We have a union of translates of a positive dimensional abelian sub-varieties of A contained in X. So let me give you a little spoiler already. It's not really relevant now, but basically Ueno for me. Ueno, or maybe Kalamata. Okay, now I'm confused who actually did it. I think it was Ueno. Ueno proved that this is actually the Zariski closure of the union of images of non-constant Rational maps or just morphisms d in this case to x with d an abelian variety. And here I mean that you have to run over all abelian varieties and over all non-constant rational numbers. And then take all their images and then take the Zariski closure of that. And that gives you this special locus. So this special locus, by this very first remark here that I made. First, remark here that I made right after the conjecture: you know, an obedient variety has a lot of points. So, if you can, if you have a non-trivial spectral locus, you're not going to be modelic. If you contain one obedient sub-variety, then you're just going to have a lot of points lying on that obedient sub-variety. So the best you can expect, the best you can expect is that you are more delicate modulo this special locus in the case that you're of general type and that the special locus is a proper closed subset. Proper closed subset. And that is the culmination of the work of Ueno, Cavamata, and Fulton's Big Theorem, which I might write down a little bit awkwardly. So this is 1991 with the above notation, X and A, A in abelian variety, everything over a number field K. Then the Then the special locus of X, as I said, is closed because it's this risky closure of this union of, you know, that you're looking at. And you're of general type precisely when this special locus does not cover your space. And let me add to this that X is also more delicate. X is also more delicate modulo, the special locus. All right. So basically what I'm saying is that for closed sub-varieties of beginning varieties, you can not only prove Lang's conjecture that the sub-varieties of general type, if and only if it is pseudomordalic, you can even say what this delta is, right? What this delta is, right? Because in Lang's conjecture, as I formulated it, I didn't really speculate about what delta is. In this case, you can say exactly what delta is, and it's the special locus of your sub-variety. So, as I said, as long as there's an abelian variety lurking around, you can prove Lane's conjecture. So, Lang's conjecture holds for closed sub-varieties. Sub-varieties of abelian varieties. This is quite a useful thing. It implies that Lang's conjecture holds for, say, smooth projective varieties with ample globally generated cotangent bundle. You can kind of reduce the closed sub-varieties of abedian varieties. It also implies that if you maybe not a closed sub-variety of an abedian variety, but some finite a tau cover is a closed sub-variety of an abedian variety, then also Lang's conjecture holds. So it kind of, you know, just this very statement. So, it kind of, you know, just this very statement gives you a little bit more than what it might give you at first sight. And the question is: what would be then the next step? What will be for us the next step to consider when attacking Beng's conjectures? So what's next? And I'm just going to say what's next, in my opinion, would be when we don't leave the realm of abelian varieties. We try to have an abelian variety lurking around. Variety lurking around. And in this case, maybe we don't look at something inside of an abelian variety, but we look at something that lies over an abelian variety. So we're going to look at ramified covers of abelian varieties. So this is what I think will be the next step in studying Lanc's conjectures. And I want to explain a little bit about the geometry. And because this geometry tells you what you can expect about. About the rational points, if you believe nice conjectures. All right, so the geometry of ramified covers of abelian varieties. So let's fix an abelian variety A over a number of field K. And let's take a random, just some arbitrary finite. Finite surjective morphism. From now on, I will always assume x to be normal and also integral. All right, so I have some finite subjective morphism. There is no, okay, a priori reason for this x naught itself to be a or another Benin variety. I mean, you could look at isogenies, you could look at multiplication by n. Isogenies, you could look at multiplication by n and basically this x is an abelian variety if and only if. And when I say is an abelian variety, it's also kind of an imprecise statement. I mean, can be endowed with the structure of an abelian variety over the algebraic closure, but it's an abelian variety if this pi is unramified. So if it's eta. So if you have an unramified cover of an abedian variety, then it's a theorem of you. Of an abetti and variety, then it's a theorem of Lange, I think, that this X itself has over k bar the structure of B D variety. So, really, and we understand those, right? We understand that Lange's conjecture holds for those. So, this is kind of the same as the case X equals A when you have a sub-variety of A. So, you want to exclude the case of A tau covers. And we assume that X is ramified. And by ramified, I mean not on. And by ramified, I mean not unramified, not at all. So then Kawamata actually kind of generalized Weno's vibration theorem, the structure theorem for closed sub-varieties of abelian varieties, and he proved the following. All right, so he proved that, first of all, the Codera dimension of X is greater than zero. And well, X might not be of general type for very silly reasons, by the way. I mean, you could take an Abenian variety. An abenial variety, and you could take, sorry, you could take an elliptic curve times an elliptic curve, take a genus 2 cover of this one, and don't do anything on this one. And you have a ramified covering, which has Codera dimension one. But what you see is that this covering comes from, after projection, comes just from, you know, pulling back basically a ramified cover of one abelian sub-variety or a ramified cover of an abelian quotient. And that's basically what Kamata generally. And that's basically what Kalmata generalized. He said: look, whenever you have a ramified cover of an abelian variety, then there exists, unfortunately, up to a finite etau cover. This kind of complicates things just in the statement, but there exists some finite etau cover. There exists some surjective homomorphism of abelian varieties. And there exists a cover which is ramified, so a finite subjective ramified cover with y normal such that x prime dominates y. So, what I'm saying, and okay, so this is actually a trivial statement, and the codera dimension, because I can take y to be a point here. Oh no, I said ramified. Okay, so and the codera dimension of y equals its dimension equals the codera dimension of x. Now, this basically is just a generalization of this simple example that I showed there. So, basically, we have e times e. That I showed there. So basically, you have E times E, say, and you have C times E covering E times E. And up to modding out that second E, you have a general type cover of your abelian quotient. So in a diagram, it looks like X prime goes to X, goes to A, and here you have B, and then here you have Y. You might have to skip X, but here you have some subjective cover. And this basically is a community of A commutative diagram. So you have this general type ramified covering. And as I said, the dimension of y equals the Kodara dimension of X and is thus positive. So in words, what Kaumata proved in words, let me skip this real quick. Now I'll skip back in a second. In words, X dominates virtually, or virtually dominates, meaning up to finite the tau cover. To finite it alcover some positive dimensional variety of general type that's what it that's what it says it says that x which is this guy right here up to a finite eta cover which is this guy here dominates y which is this guy right here and this y in fact is itself is kind of not relevant for Itself is kind of not relevant for my purposes, but it itself, again, a finite ramified cover of an abelian variety. So, what does Lange predict? Well, Lange's conjecture, the weak Lange conjecture, says if X dominates a positive dimensional projective variety of general type, then the set of points is not dense. And actually, as I've tried to kind of convince you before with these remarks, finally the tile covers are harmless, right, in these kinds of statements. kind of statements. So what Lang's conjecture and well this finite et al covering thing being harmless has to do with the Chevalier-Well theorem, which I'll just mention, imply or predict the following conjecture, which is kind of the guiding thread in our work. So Len's conjecture plus share by the Uh, so Len's conjecture plus Sherbet will actually be also plus Kawamata's theorem. They predict the following statement. If X is a ramified cover of an abelian variety over K, then the set of L. Then the set of L rational points is never dense. So this is basically what Lange's conjecture already predicts. And that brings me to our main result. Our main result goes in the direction of this conjecture. And it doesn't. It doesn't prove the conjecture, it just gives you a little bit of evidence, kind of maybe convinces you that maybe it could, in fact, be true. So, the main result with Provaya and the Mayo, Lombardo, and Zagne is that if you take Zanier is that if you take a ramified cover as in the conjecture, and by the way, X is always normal, in case somebody didn't hear that. So X normal. Then what we show is that, oops, if If the set of rational points on k is dense, which is always true after replacing k by some finite extension, then the set of points on x is less than the set of points on a, meaning that this that way you take all the k points and you cut out the points of x. Cut out the points of x, then you still end up with a dense set. So I like to interpret this in two ways. There are more points on A than any of its ramified covers, or there are less points. on the RamaFed cover of hey saying the same thing twice but this is what I meant when I wrote down this very first remark about Benian varieties I said well Benian varieties satisfy Lange's conjecture simply because they satisfy potential density meaning they have a lot of points right They have a lot of points, right? So, what I'm saying now is not just that A has a lot of points, but if you look at a ramified cover, which could also have still a priori a lot of points, then the image of these points won't fill up the entire space. If you cut out these green points, you'll still end up with a very large set of rational points, meaning that on an abelian variety, there are so many points that they So many points that they can't be filled up by the points coming from a ramified covering. All right, so I want to explain that this is a special case of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem for abelian varieties. All right, so I'm going to call this the weak. All right, so I'm going to call this the weak Hilbert property, but it should really just be called the Hilbert property. It's not called the Hilbert property because the Hilbert property was defined by Ser, but the way he defined it, it kind of excludes abedian varieties for trivial reasons. But he should have just defined it differently. Now, let me just give you the definition for a smooth projective writing. smooth projective writing over number field k say let's say x has the weak hilbert property over k if it has more points than any uh ramified any of its ramified Ramified any of its ramified covers. So if and in fact, for any finite collection of ramified covers, for every finite collection of ramified covers, which includes the assumption that yi's are normal. And integral. The set of points on X derived from the union over the images of the sets of rational points on Y, I, is still dense, not still dense, is just dense. Or in particular, by the way, this is just my. The way this is just my definition stronger than density, right? So, uh, somebody other question, yeah. Sorry, I'm just your ramified covers are all quasi-finite. Yeah, they're finite, yeah, yeah. And dominant? Uh, yeah, finite subjective, yeah. Oh, when I wrote, yeah, yeah, okay. When I say ramified cover, yeah, yeah, thank you. Uh, I mean finite subjective, non-atal, finite subject. Finite objective, non-atalomorphism, and the yi's are normal integral, and the x is smooth and objective and integral, if you like, connected. So if you have the weak-tilbert property, which I'll abbreviate as WHP, then you obviously have a lot of points. Obviously, you have a dense set of rational points because this set, obviously, is contained in this set. Obviously, it's contained in this set. So, if this is dense, then you have a lot of points. So, this means that we can only expect the weak Hilbert property for varieties that have a dense set of rational points. And, well, let's just look at the first examples, kind of to get an idea of what this is. So, the example one, which is easier than example two, is when you have an elliptic curve. So, an elliptic curve over K. So, an elliptic curve over K, well, first of all, I should assume that this is dense, or I mean, that this is infinite, hence dense. Because otherwise, there's no chance, right? And then indeed, if it's infinite, it has the weak Hilbert property simply because every ramified cover of E. Of E is curve of genus of these two. So by Mordell, by Mordell's conjecture, by Fulton's theorem, every ramified cover has only finely many points. So of course, if I take their image, it's just going to be finely many points. And then Ek minus these images is just going to be still dense. So Mordaux's conjecture gives you that an elliptic. Actually, it gives you that an elliptic curve with positive rank has the weak Hilbert property. And the second example, which is historically, which came before is due to Hilbert, and it's just Hilbert's irreducibility theorem reformulated for example, as in Sarah's book on Galois theory, Hilbert's irreducibility. Hilbert's irreducibility theorem says that P1 over this number field K has the weak Hilbert property over K. And our theorem can just be reformulated as saying we abbreviate our names C D J L Z that if you have an abelian variety over K Over k and it satisfies the obvious obstruction to the weak Hilbert property. So if Ak is dense, then this abelian variety has the weak Hilbert property. So it's in some sense, this is why we call it Hilbert's irreducibility theorem now for abelian varieties, because for any abelian variety satisfying the obvious condition. Already satisfying the obvious condition that the k-points have to be dense. In fact, you obtain that it has the weak Hilbert property. And in the last five minutes, I will explain that this is actually not the right statement to try and prove. So the right statement is something about pairs, and where you take an abenian variety together with its risky dense subgroup of its k-rational points. So, a theorem, let's call this theorem A. Theorem, let's call this theorem A. Theorem A follows from, and something I will have to write on the next page because it takes a lot of space, but theorem A follows from something much more general about pairs for pairs A, omega, where omega is now some of the risky dense subgroup of. Of AK. So theorem B is the real statement you should be thinking about. So let's say again, K is a number field, A is an abelian variety. And we have this omega, which is now Zariski dense. Then you have two statements. And I'll explain why we have two statements. First of all, for any collect. Statements. First of all, for any collect finite collection of ramified covers of X, of A, of why did I write X? Sorry. Oops. Right, so for any finite collection of ramified covers, which means again. Covers, which means again, finite subjective, not et al., and you know, yi is normal and integral. There exists a subset of omega, which is not just a subset, it's not just an infinite subset, it is a finite index coset, meaning it is a coset of a finite index subgroup, such that if you look at all the points in C, right? Right, then the fiber over this point has no k-points for every i is one to n. So basically, what I'm going to draw a little picture of what I mean here, I have here, say, my abelian variety, and I have a bunch of, I have omega, which is this. I have omega, which is this. Then, after replacing omega by, let's say, a finite index subgroup, which is then C here. And I look at then the fibers of X, so of pi. So this is, say, pi. Then what I end up with is fibers, which are finite, maybe two points here. Maybe I have three points. Maybe I have one point. Maybe I have one point and one point. But basically, and here I maybe have also one point. Basically, over every point. Basically, over every point of C, I will have no k point. So there is no way to lift this point to a k point in the fiber. It still could be that some of the points are maybe say quadratic or cubic. But the second statement tells you that you can even do something much better, which is also kind of the more natural thing to consider. So for every finite collection again. Collection again of ramified covers with no non-trivial atal subcovers. And I'll explain why you have to, but this basically means doesn't factor over an isogeny. Okay, so a ramified cover has no non-trivial atal subcovers if it doesn't factor over an Covers if it doesn't factor over an isogeny of A. If you have this stronger condition, which you could say called strongly ramified, then you can expect something even better than the fiber having no k points. Then you can expect the existence of a finite index coset such that for every point in the C, the fiber. The fiber over this point is irreducible. So let me just write integral for every is1 to n. All right, so I'm done with my time, but let me just finish here and say that this theorem is more natural to prove because it's a theorem about pairs. And by using a lot of reduction arguments, we prove this theorem. Arguments. We prove this theorem in two steps. We reduce to the case that omega is cyclic. And another step, so this is one crucial step. And the second crucial step is that you prove a kind of a product theorem. So if you have A and omega A, B and omega B, which satisfy the conclusion you have. Satisfy the conclusion you have, the conclusion you want, then also the product of these two pairs. So, if you say has satisfies what you want, satisfy your conclusion in some sense, because I'm being a bit vague now, then also the product of these will satisfy. And this basically means that, okay, it suffices for me to deal with the cyclic case. And there we use Chebotarov's density theorem, a geometric Chebotarov density theorem, like Jason also mentioned in his talk. And here we use also Chebotarov's density theorem and something quite beautiful, but I'll leave that as a mystery. So thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Go ahead. No, you go first. I had a trivial question. Are you assuming Omega is a subgroup? Yeah. And then when you say it. No, no, it's not a subgroup. It's a cosine. Omega is a risky dense. Omega is a risky dense subgroup. Yeah, I didn't say that. I, yeah, but for pairs with omega and AK as a subgroup. And then when you say then the coset, it's like a coset for some other subgroup of omega. Exactly. A finite index coset, I mean a coset of a finite index subgroup of omega. So there's some omega prime, and then I take a coset of omega prime. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? It would be quite amazing if you could get rid of the subgroup, if you could take any Zariski-dense subset. So proceeding optimistically on the assumption that it's now my turn. So I had a couple of questions. So, first of all, you get results about density. I presume that's a risk. I presume that's Zariski density. And on that presumption, do you have any hope? Is there any hope of getting density in other topologies like the real Archimedean one or Piatic ones? Oh. Well, do we know density of rational points on a beam of varieties in these topologies? Yes, certainly in the real one. I'm pretty sure it's true in the beatic one as well. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yes. Okay. Then maybe if If you replace the assumption of omega Zariski dense by omega, say real dense or theatically dense, then maybe you can do that. I didn't think about it. I'd have to go through, maybe, yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay. My other question is: in the weak Hilbert property, have you ever thought about abbreviating Hilbert's name with HI instead of H? With HI instead of H. Because then become a hip. Whit. Whip, yes. And then you get great things like A has the whip, you know. Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. Anyway, that's me. Thank you. I should mention before I forget, this theorem was known. There was just some prior work done by Zanier. Prior some prior work done by Zanier in the early 2000s, I think 2003, and he proved this entire theorem when A was the power of an elliptic curve. And this elliptic curve has no Cl. And our proof does follow his kind of his strategy, but yeah, deviates from it for some technical reasons.
