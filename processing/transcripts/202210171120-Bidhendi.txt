Yes, hi. This is. Can you hear me? Oh, yes. Okay. Excellent. So, Amir is from McGill. He's a mechanical engineer by training, if I'm correct, to turn a couple of years ago to a biological modeler. And he has the market interest for Prancer Wall. And he's going to talk about how pegmats become wavy and what could be the function. And what could be the function? Florida, yours. Exactly. Thank you so much for the introduction. So I am a former postdoc and PhD student of Ania. And as a part of my PhD and my postdoc research, I investigated the effect of, I mean, the how and why of pavement cell wavy shapes. So first of all, I should say that I'm of all i should be i should say that i'm very glad that i'm here today and i'm presenting my results among you uh great scientists which i consider as my extended family um so uh with that said um i move on to the topic so paven cells they form baby cells you know whether that in many it's very prevalent in many plant species and they form interlocking uh shapes that give the epidermis an integrity as opposed to integrity as opposed to the underlying layers of mesofill that sometimes can have large air gaps. So this pattern is very prevalent, as I mentioned, among different species, both dicots and monocots, of course, to a varying degree of waviness. You can read more about it in the paper by Shivan and Wosley. It was published in 2019. The two questions that have fascinated scientists and modelers alike for years has been why and how these wavy shapes are formed. So today I'm exploring our results about the why question. So the hypothesis, our working hypothesis was that the patterning, the silver patterning, includes the toughness of the epidermis. But to test that, we required an isotropic material so that we can only And so that we can only investigate the effect of patterning and not the material. For that, we engraved the patterns obtained from epidermis of arabidopsis and onion onto PMMA or plexiglass, and we made samples so that we could fracture and investigate the forces required to fracture as well as the fracture path in the samples. So we had a total of five different groups of samples. We had Groups of samples. We had the samples with rig shapes taken from onion and then a 90-dig reorientation of a reorientation of these, as well as two baby patterns, which were essentially a reorientation of each other. And the fracture of this specimen showed that when the cells are aligned with, when the crack is aligned with the grain, it can travel long distances into the weakened interfaces, while when it is it is traveling against the grain, it has difficulty and it just mostly cannot follow the cell lines. For the baby cells, we had a mixed type of fracture. So we had fracture following the cell border while also entering the cells at some point. And when the intervegetation is getting deeper and looking at the fourth And looking at the fourth of fracture, comparing these, we saw that the control specimen, I mean, intact or unpatterned specimen, had a very brittle fracture behavior. The force increases and then suddenly it fractures the whole sample at one go. While the sample where crack travels along the grain is very similar to the unpatent specimen, very brittle, but the specimen very bristle but the ones the other pattern specimens they showed a resistance against fracture with the continuous load bearing for the sample and we had up to 60 percent increase in the um in the work of fracture compared to the control specimens so uh we i also asked uh one of the co-authors a colleague uh olivier to perform some simulations this was fantastic because simulations this is fantastic because simulation of crack propagation is not trivial and many available techniques for example the extended finite element they tend to be reliant on the meshing the mesh size meshing technique and the results are not always reliable but he he with his with his code that he has developed as a part of his PhD he was able to simulate the propagation of crack into the The propagation of crack in 2D in a 2D tissue with interfaces that they have different toughness and different mechanical properties. And we observed that there are combinations of the toughness and stiffness fluctuations between the cell borders and the cells that we get close to the experimentally observed pattern, that the control behaves very brittle, and then the samples that they're The samples that they're patterns wavy or the grains are stacked against the perfect direction of the crack, they become tougher. But how about the real tissue? How does the real plant tissue behave? For this, I performed tests on onion tissue and I did various tear tests. So, in this case, for example, you see the tear that is being forced to travel along the grain of Along the grain of onion epidermis, and it could also be also tested it to, I mean, before C to travel against the grain. And as you expect from the previous simulation and plexiglass results, the force required to tear the tissue along the grain showed a brittle behavior, increasing the force to some degree and then falling rapidly, while traveling against the grain showed a consistent. Grain showed a consistent and persistent load bearing and increased toughness. And here are like the comparison of the work to tear the epidermis against and along the tier. You see that it's about three times higher to go against the grain. And we have a reorientation of the tier when traveling against the grain, sometimes 45 degrees, sometimes 90 degree, but along the grain at the But along the grain, the tear can travel straight past. So, looking closer to see what is happening there, I observed that frequently when the tear gets into or gets against a cell border, it can travel against the cell lines very quickly and the force required to propagate this tear drops. So the interfaces are weak points or weak passes for weak points or weak passes for the for the crack and that's why going along the cracks or along the cell lines can reduce the work or the energy requiring to to propagate the tear what about in other tissues than epidermal cells of onion what about tissues that they have baby cell so for this i squeezed arabidoxis embario Arbidoxis embarrio cut out of the seed between two glass slides. And I observed that the tissue can crack with the cells apparently getting separate from each other clean without, I mean, without the cells themselves breaking and releasing the content. As we can see, that the nuclei remain there and the anticlinal walls of the neighboring cells are visible, meaning that most probably. Are visible, meaning that most probably the cells were fractured at the middle envelope. But other than that, this confirmed that in a multi-layer tissue of samples other than onion epidemics, we can have cell cell separation. But these were embaryonic tissues, and also the cell shapes were simple. Would the same be observed if we had fractured tissues with very Very wavy and intideated cell shapes. For that, we performed crack tests on leaves with wavy cells, including Arabidosis and tomato. And we observed results that they were very similar to the plexiglass model: that we have a propagation of crack along the cell line at some points, but then due to the waviness or due to the reorientation of cells from orientation of cells from the trajectory of the crack, they enter the cell wall. And we have shown before using both physical models and numerical simulations that this would lead to increased toughness for that tissue. So to summarize, the wavy cell shapes would prevent the weak interfaces to be all aligned in one direction so that it increases the The tissue toughness in all directions prevent so that the brittle fracture is prevented and the tissue can bear more and more load or the crack can be stopped and minimized. So there are, of course, questions that we would like to explore. For example, how could be considered the third dimension or the mesophyll cells in the simulation? Feel cells in the simulation or in the experiments. And of course, your comments and questions are most welcome, and I would be very glad to take them. With that, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues and would like to thank you for this. Thank you. Floor is open for questions. Chris. Charlie. Charlie. David CH. Chris. So, yeah, so thanks, Amir. That was a really interesting talk. And I'm curious about how this tissue might differ from something like a hypocodl. We published a paper right at the beginning of this year that suggested that in the case of ripping a hypocodal, the cells tend to tear across the wall rather than separate from one another. And do you think that has something to do with the geometry? Something to do with the geometry of the hypochondrial, either the lead surface or an epidermal surface in general? Or is there some other factor that you think is contributing to that difference in separating the cell wall versus separating the middle bell? Sorry, I mean, thanks for the question. I just lost some details. The voice quality in my headphones are not great. So did I understand that correctly that your question is that in your hi-fa copy? question is that in your hypocotyl experiments the cells were separated at the interfaces no so in that case they tear they tear across the cell walls across the cell walls so i i think um if i understand correctly the case um the way that the crack propagates is dependent on several factors uh one is how uh i mean the loading geometry uh one of them is that for example in case of the For example, in case of the tearing the notched onion specimens, because of the loading geometry was forcing the tier to cross the sample at the shortest path. So that's how they were, you know, the final crack was being, the crack trajectory was being dictated. So, but if you had another type of TL test that would, you would just take the edges and would let the tier to run freely. The tier to run freely, it would take a totally different trajectory. So, in my mind, there are interactions of several parameters, such as the loading or the forcing geometry, the forces that they derive the crack. It's also a matter of the cell wall anisotropy. It could be. It also is a matter of the adhesion between the two cells and the strength of the middle lamella. And of course, the And of course, the main topic of this study is the cell shape. So I'm not also surprised that the tissue topology could affect the loading geometry and hence the way that it's cracked. So the cell shape on a flat specimen maybe is easier to understand how it affects the crack, regardless of the cell anisotropy and whatnot, but as it gets into curved surfaces. Into care surfaces, it might get even more complicated. I'm not sure if I answered your question, but I. There is a direct follow-up question from here in the audience. Yeah, hi, this is Dan Cosgrove. This is just a follow-up comment. So we've done breaking experiments with coleoptiles, weak coleoptiles, same sort of thing as with hypocotyls. And just in untreated coleoptiles, it also has this tendency to split right across the cells, not follow along the middle. Cell, not follow along the middle lamella. But if you do anything to weaken the middle lamella, so in that case, you could treat with the fectin digesting material, or in the case of wheat coleoptile, the pollen beta expands and also dissolves the middle lamella. Then it follows along the perimeter, just as you showed with the palisade or the pavement cells here, and you get pullout, right? Exactly. So, yep. Yep. I mean, I agree. So I also have done some treatments such as boiling where the middle lamellas are weakened and you can see that cells are like separated, like piece of puzzle like unlocking. And so the first hypothesis that I had was that the wavy shapes increase the strength of the leaves or the epidermis, which is basically how much work it can take before rupture, other than its toughness. And I did see. And I did see that the loading, I mean, the way that we are stretching the sample, it sometimes dictates the crack to go just across the cells, regardless of their shape. But when the crack is free to run, I mean, the difference between the tear because of stretching like a uniaxial tension or the tear like at one edge and separated, I mean, pulled apart when the tissue is pulled apart. These two, they differ in the way that they behave. That they behave, and this is the second case, the increased toughness that we study. But I totally have seen and acknowledged your results. We switch back to Jun. There is a question for Jung and then Areski. Hi, thank you. Forgive me if it's quite an ignorant question, but in payment sales, like in the plans, the loadingness helps increase their. The lobiness helps increase their like surface area between the cells. So you're making them more connected. You know, the number of like their extra cell images or whatever is more connected. But in the and the pexiglass, is like the cut, the lines you're cutting in, is that actually like weakening, like having air sections weakening? So is this like opposite effects? That is very true, actually. This is, I think it's a part that I was amazed. I think it's a part that I was amazed because in plexiglass we remove the material by weakening it. In reality, it might not be the same. It might be weaker because of the adhesion due to metal lamella, or it could be stronger because you have two anticlinal walls stacked against each other. But I think the experiments showed a worst case scenario that even if you had a weaker case, still like introducing different Introducing different interfaces or different phases of material can toughen the sample, let alone having a vasy border that composed of two anticlinal walls. So, yes, they are in fact different. That's true. Thank you. That's very cool. Thank you. It's more about making suggestions. So, one is that you might want to use 3D printing. It's now possible to print. Printing, it's now possible to print with two different types of materials, or maybe you've already considered that. And the second suggestion, or maybe link, so there's a whole range of study around the behavior of materials like nature, which is composed of stiff pieces with complex shapes and connected by softer pieces. So maybe there are some analogies to draw there between. To draw there between cells surrounded by the middle lamella, etc. That's great. Thank you so much for your suggestion. Actually, I'm really glad to hear that. You're also interested, find the 3D printing interesting because that's also something that we're exploring at the moment to have this pattern 3D printed out of two metrics if possible. If you're exploring that, thank you so much. Great. There is technically time for one last question. Not the case, then I suggest that we thank Amir for his talk and move on to the next speaker, who will be Atiano Iberi. Adea introduced himself earlier today. I just want to add that before moving to England, he was
