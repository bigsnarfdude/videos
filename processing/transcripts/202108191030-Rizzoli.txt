To talk to you about a double-closed problem for classical groups. So, let me set things up. So, working with algebraic groups and over an algebraically closed field capital K, characteristic P is in general assumed to be arbitrary. In particular, many of the interesting cases will occur in positive characteristic. By Tn, we denote an n-dimensional torus. By P, May P, a parabolic sum group, by B, a Borel. And then if we have a root system phi generated by alpha i's, then we use lambda i to denote corresponding fundamental dominant weights. And so if our algebraic group G has root system phi, Vg lambda i denotes the reducible rational G module of highest weight lambda i. module of highest weight lambda i. Okay, so what is our problem? We start with just G, a simple connected algebraic group over our algebraically closed field K. And then we consider pairs of closed connected subgroups of G, call them H and J. And we look at the set of double calls. The set of double cosets in G, so the set of HJ double cosets. And we ask a simple question, which is: when is this set of double cosets finite? Okay, so this is a very general question and in general, it does not have an answer, but of course, in some settings, the answer is already known. For example, if If the two subgroups are a borel or indeed contain a borel, so if they're parabolic subgroups, then of course, just by the Bruhat decomposition, we know that there exists finitely many BB double cosets or PP double cosets, so on. And one particular case of having finitely many double cosets would be when we have precisely one double coset. Have precisely one double coset. So if we have one double coset, then the group G factorizes H times J. And these factorizations, at least in the maximum configurations, have been classified. So here we have a couple of examples of factorizations of simple algebraic groups. So for example, SO7, special orthogonal group, can be written as a G. Can be written as a G2 times P1 parabolic, or an SO8, you can write it as a B3P1. Here I'm using, we're usually going to refer to, often going to refer to groups simply by their type. And here the restriction of the natural module for SO8 to B3 is just a spin module. But then we have a general. But then we have a general result by Brandon, which says that if H and J are both maximal reductive subgroups of G, and we have finitely many double cosets, then there is actually a single double coset. So again, if we are in a situation where H and J are both maximum reductive, then we have a factorization. And since we have finitely many double costs, then we have a factorization. And we have finitely main double cosets, and we have factorization. So, since these factorizations have been classified, and when we consider this problem in the setting of H and J being maximal, then the critical setup occurs when one of the two subgroups, here we say J, is parabolic and the other subgroup H, is reductive. Okay, so this is the setting we are going to consider. Are going to consider, and in this setting, the question has already been solved for SLN. So let's see how this was done by Garel Nick and other people. So what happens? In SLN, the maximum parabolic subgroups, I usually write them indexing by the thinking node that we remove. Thinking node that we remove are stabilizers of M-spaces. This means that for the subgroup H to have finitely many double coss, so for H and J to have finitely many double cosets in G, we need H to have finitely many orbits on N spaces. So equivalent characterization, finitely many H J double cosets when J is a maximum parabolic is the same as H having finitely Is the same as H having finitely many orbits on a collection of n spaces. And what they did was precisely this. So they found all irreducible modules for semi-simple geographic groups with finitely many orbits on n spaces. And when we are considering the action on one spaces, so P1B, so if we have finitely many orbits, then So, if we have finitely many orbits there, we say that the module is a finite orbit module. So, this is just some notation. And how did these results look like? So, this is the first one dealing with finite orbit modules. So, H again, simple algebraic group, V in irreducible rational, finite orbit, KH module. So, by definition, it has finitely many orbits. Finitely many orbits, H has finitely many orbits on one spaces. And then either V is an internal module for H, and I'm going to say a little bit more about internal modules, but here we're guaranteed finitely many orbits on one spaces, or we are in the following list. So, what do we see here? In the first column, we have the group H by its type, then we have Then we have the module V by its highest weight. The highest weights throughout are just given up to a graph or field twist. That does not change the answer. Then we have dimension and some requirements on the characteristic P. So let me, for example, point out what's happening in the first case. So here we have A n, view it as S L N plus one. You can view it as SLN plus one. And for example, the first module, this lambda one plus p to the i lambda one, you can view that as a tensor product of the natural module for SLN plus one with a twist of the natural module. So this is an irreducible module dimension n plus one squared. And this is a special case in this list because so Because so if you have a module dimensional plus one squared, the dimension of the variety of one spaces is simply one less than that, which happens to be the dimension of a n. So this theorem says that we have finitely many orbits on the variety of one spaces, which means that the dense orbit has got to have a finite stabilizer. And this happens only in this first case. All the other cases. First case. All the other cases in this list have the stabilizer dense orbit has at least dimension one. Okay, so this was a result for action on one spaces. And then there is an equivalent one for higher dimensional grass minions, i.e. varieties of totally of k-spaces. So we have again H, connected simple geographic group, and here we are assuming. And here we are assuming that it has finitely many orbits on k-spaces, where k is greater than or equal to 2 of a. And we are not listing natural modules when h is classical, because of course we always have finitely many orbits on case spaces in that case. And we have again a finite list of cases. So here we see in the third column See in the third column, there are some options for k. So, and the highest k that appears is a k equals 4. So, there are no modules that are not the natural modules for classical groups where the group H has finitely many orbits on five spaces if the dimension of the module is at least 10. Because here, 10 because here, yeah, we're not listing. So, things on the we stop at dimension of b over two. Of course, things are the same on the other side. Okay, so I said that one situation where we always have finitely many orbits on one spaces is when we have an internal module. So, one way to quickly construct Way to quickly construct internal modules is the following. So we start with a simple algebraic group H and P, our proper parabolic subgroup of H with Ley factorization QG. So here Q is a unipotent radical and G is a Levy subgroup. And then we consider a G-invariant composition series for Q and it turns out that each factor Qi plus That each factor Qi plus one over Qi has the structure of a rational, irreducible Kg module. So these are so-called internal modules. And the important property to reach Sony Averse for positive characteristic is that the latest handler G has finitely many orbits on each of these modules. And here is a list of Here is a list of internal modules. So, on the left, on the first column, we have the Lay factor and we're taking G prime so that it's semi-simple. And in the third column, we have the larger group that contains the parabolic from which these internal modules can be constructed. So, in all these cases, So, in all of these cases, we know that the group G' has finitely many orbits on one spaces of the module with highest weight, as in the second column. And let me point out that in these semi-simple cases, in the second half of the table, so for example, if we take the second to last one, so this A1, E6. E6. The fact that A1E6 has finitely many orbits on one spaces in this lambda one times or lambda one module tells us immediately that E6 must have finitely many orbits on both one spaces and two spaces of the lambda one module, which was included in the Was included in the result for higher-dimensional graph minus. So, what is our setting? So, I've talked about the double-causing problem and how it's been solved for SLN. So, what we do is we consider the other classical groups. So, our G, so our big group, is either SOV or SPV. Again, our J is the maximum power. Again, our J is the maximal parabolic. Now, what happens here? Before, so maximal parabolics in SLN, just stabilizers of subspaces of a certain dimension. Here, the maximum parabolics are stabilizers of totally singular case spaces for appropriate K. So an R group H is simple group subgroup of G R T. Group, a subgroup of G, Arcturian recipient V. So the question here becomes finding self-dual modules for simple algebraic group H, such that H has finitely many orbits on totally singular case spaces, I denote totally singular with Ts of this irreducible module V. Module V. Okay, so this is the question that we are trying to answer. And well, we first want to get a reduction of the number of cases that need to be considered. And this is done in the following proposition. So restating things, we have H, it's a simple irreducible SAR group of URSOV, or SPV. Of USOV or SPV. And it has finitely many orbits. So if it has finitely many orbits on totally singular K-spaces for some K between 1 and dimension of V over 2, and of course, it could already have finitely many orbits on all K spaces. Those have been classified. We don't care about them. So suppose that it does not have already finitely many orbits. It does not have already finitely many orbits on all case spaces, then it's the pair H and B is in the following list. So this is a final list of cases. And again, as done before, we have the groups by their type, modules by highest weight, and the conditions on K. So here we can see that. Here we can see that most of the cases in this list occur for cables one or cable two. And the higher dimensional ones, there are some not too difficult ones to deal with, but there are also a couple of more difficult cases. And what we do is we deal with the cases from the list, from this list, where cases. The list from this list where k is one or two. Okay, so first result for k equals one. So when k equals one, of course, we are looking at h as a subgroup of so v because simply because all vectors are singular if the form is alternating. So here we're assuming that So, here we're assuming that H is a simple irreducible closed-connected subgroup of SOB with finitely many orbits on singular one spaces of B. Then again, either already it had finitely many orbits on all one spaces, or the pair HB is in the following list. Okay, so this is similar type of result. Similar type of result as the one for SLN. We either have infinitely many orbits or we are in some final list of cases. And again, let me point out that the very first case is the only one where the stabilizer of the dense orbit is finite. And yeah, and this is a good moment to point out that here I've also listed the stabilizers of. The stabilizers of the dense orbits. And we're going to take a look at some of these cases and see how we can prove finiteness. But let me first state the same result for k equals 2. So same setup. This time H is allowed to be suburb of SPV. And so here we are assuming that H has finitely many orbits on totally singular two spaces. So again, you very So again, you already have phantom and you orbit on all two spaces, or the pair HP is one of the following. Okay, so again, we're going to take a look at one or two of these cases. But we actually prove a slightly strong result that is shared between the k equals one and k equals two. So, and this is analogous to a result. And this is analogous to a result that was proved for SLN. So, what we show is that the property of having finitely many orbits on totally singular case spaces for k equals one or k equals two is equivalent to h having a dense orbit on the variety of totally singular k-spaces from k plus one or k plus two. Again, in the setting where h is In the setting where H is simple. Well, as I've said many times, one direction is obvious. Of course, if we have finitely many orbits, then we know that there is a dense orbit. But the other direction is, of course, not true in general for rational actions. In particular, this result for SLN. Result for SLN. They had shown that when H is simple, the property of a module being a finite orbit module is equivalent to having a dense orbit. But as soon as you moved up to higher dimensional Grassmanns, this was not true anymore. Or indeed, if you drop the assumption that H is simple, if you let H be semi-simple, this is also not true. This is also not true. Okay, so what is the strategy? So the first list that I showed you, so the main reduction, can be proved essentially using mostly dimensional considerations. And what I mean by the dimensional considerations is most of the times simply requiring that the group H has dimension at least At least the dimension of the variety that we're acting on. Okay, of course, we need that. But I'm going to talk about some cases, namely adjoint modules where a better refinement is needed. And once we have that list, the list that I've shown you before and I'm going to show you again, we need to consider each case individually. And we either prove that there are finitely many orbs. And we either prove that there are finitely many orbits on the variety of totally singular k-spaces, k equals one or k equal to or we show that there is no dense orbit. So this is the difficult step, namely the getting the list is not hard, but if you get a module which is not too easy to deal with, showing that we have finitely many orbits is often a difficult. It's often a difficult task. Okay, so I want to look at a selection of individual cases from our list. So here's the list again. So again, we know that if we have finitely many orbits on totally singular case spaces, then the module must appear here. And the ones that I've highlighted are the ones that I'm going to talk about. Going to talk about. So, in particular, the first four cases we show that we have finitely many orbits, and most of the times we do this using a counting argument. And for the final one, this minimal module for E7, we show that there is no dense orbit. Okay, so let us start with the A1 case, which is, as I said, One case, which is, as I pointed out, an interesting case because it's the only one where the stabilizer of the dens orbit is finite. Okay, so our algebraic closure field K, let's take it as algebraic closure of FP. This does not, we can assume that it does not change the answer. And P greater or equal to five, of course, otherwise the module. Of course, otherwise the module for lambda one wouldn't be five-dimensional, and we take H as PGL2K. Okay, so start with a two-dimensional vector space, W, spanned by ENF, equipped with an alternating bilinear form. So I'm using ENF as a standard basis. So the form between E and F would evaluate two bi. E and F would evaluate to 1, 2, and E to minus 1, and E and F themselves are singular, of course. Then construct the fourth symmetric power of W. So view this as just the space of symmetrized tensor in the fourth tensor power of W. And at this point, you can view V as the irreducible H module with highest weight 4 lambda 1. squared for lambda one. So this is a five-dimensional module that is not a finite orbit module, which means A1 does not have finitely many orbits on one spaces in this five-dimensional module, simply by dimensional considerations. Dimension of A1 is three, while dimension of the variety of one spaces is four. So there is no chance of it having finitely many orbits. Finally, many orbits. It's an orthogonal module. What I mean by this is that A1 is fixing a non-degenerate symmetric form on the module, which you can inherit from the tensor product by setting the form between two tensors to be simply the product of individual components. So, if we are to show, like we're going to, that, as I said, if we have finitely many orbits, a point in a dense orbit needs to have a finite stabilizer. Okay, so what we do is we start and we find two orbits that are easy to spot. So, if you just take e tensor itself four times, this is a singular vector, and the one space One space that is spanned by it is just fixed by the Porel. And on the other hand, if you take this album symmetrized tensor, this has stabilizer, the maximal torus of A1. Okay, so these are two connected stabilizers for the A1 action on this five-dimensional module, and they're both circular. And they're both circular one spaces. Now, the more interesting part is when you try to find a dense orbit and start with a sub-group isomorphic to the alternating group of four points. So, this exists by standard theory. And using some standard character theory, you can show that it fixes two singular one spaces in V. Two singular one spaces in V. In fact, you can show that it is the full stabilizer of both one spaces if you just work using subgroup structure of PGL2Q. So what do we have? We have a subgroup of A1, Alt4, that is the stabilizer of two singular one spaces in this five-dimensional module for lambda one. Okay, what do we do? We want to use a counting argument. Counting argument, we need to be in a finite setting. So use Lang-Steinberg theorem. We apply, we take the fixed points under a Steinberg endomorphism sigma Q. And what we find is that when passed into finite fields, the dense orbit splits into four orbits if Q is congruent to 113 and into And into two orbits otherwise. So the stabilizers in the first case have size 3, 3, 4, and 12, while in the second case, the two orbits have stabilizers of size 2 and 2. And of course, the other two stabilizers for the other orbits were connected, so nothing happens there. And we can simply add up the sizes of the orbits. And what we find is that we get precisely the number of singular one spaces in a five-dimensional orthogonal module. So this means here right that six is a uniform bound for the number of A1 orbits on singular one spaces. But of course, this is actually saying that there are precisely three A1 orbits on singular one spaces. One spaces. Okay, so this is the first flavor of sort of a counting argument where we pass two final fields, we see that the orbits that we had found produce all the singular case spaces that we're working with, and therefore they were all the orbits. And sometimes we had to deal with some rather large modules, for example. Modules, for example, this spin module for B6. So, a quick construction of it without giving too many details. So, this spin module for V6, a high-speed lambda 6, you can view it as a unique irreducible rational module for B6 of dimensions 64. What you can do is embed B6 in the Clifford algebra for the natural. For the natural 14-dimensional module for D7, and the action is then given by the action on spinors. And here, the characteristic has to be two for the module to be orthogonal. And how do you deal with this case? The idea here is you start with the D7 orbits on spinors. So we can deduce these. So, we can deduce these from previous results by Paul Pof and Nigusa. So, in this list, we have the D7 orbits on spinors in the spin modules, on vectors in the spin module. And if you view these as one spaces, in particular, saying that these seven as finitely many orbits on one spaces. And here we have the connected component of the stabilizers. So, of course, B6 in D7 is just a stabilizer of a non-singular one space in the natural module for D7. So, this means that we can understand the B6 orbits on one spaces by just finding the orbits of these stabilizers on non-singular one spaces in the natural module for D7. And this is essentially what we do. And of course, you don't have to. We do, and of course, you don't have to look at this list. But the overall point is that you write down how these D7 stabilizers act on non-singular one spaces. Here we write just a representative as a vector with a form one. And then you consider the infinite families, so the cases where we have an alpha, and you show in each case that You show in each case that these infinite families do not contain infinitely many singular vectors. And this is going to give the conclusion that B6 has finitely many orbits on singular vectors in this 64-dimensional spin module. Okay, so I was saying before that sometimes dimensional considerations are not enough to so pure To so, pure dimensional considerations are not enough to get the reduction that we need. This happens for adjoint modules, Li of H, which we view H acting by conjugation on it. And for a quick example of an adjoint module, if H is a CLN, then the Lie algebra of Tracy matrices on which H acts by conjugation is the adjoint module. A joint module. Not always irreducible, of course, because if the characteristic P divides n, scalar matrices are fixed and they have trace zero. So if p divides n, quotient out by scalar matrices, and you do indeed get a reusable module of highest weight, lambda one plus lambda n minus one. Okay, so. One okay, so how what happens for our joint modules? Um, what happens is that, um, so here's some quick notation. So V0 is a fixed space of the maximal torus, T, and W is the panel group. And what happens is that the dimension of the joint module, of course, is just the dimension of the group. Therefore, the group is always going to have dimension greater or equal. Greater or equal to the dimension of the variety of one spaces or singular one spaces, it does not matter. So we cannot get rid of these cases just by dimensional considerations. However, it turns out that, as it was shown in the 97 Grani et al paper, two elements in the zero space are in the same H orbit, if and only if they are in the same W. If and only if they are in the same w orbit. And this is very useful because this means that if the zero space contains infinitely many singular one spaces, then we cannot have finitely many orbits on singular one spaces. When does this happen? This happens when the dimension of the zero space is at least three. So for all So, for all modules where we have the dimension of the zero space greater or equal to three, we know that we don't have finitely many orbits on singular one spaces. And here's an example of a case where the zero space is two-dimensional. So we have HSL4 acting on the singular one space. Singular one spaces of module of highest weight lambda one plus lambda three. Again, as I said before, construct this as taking the algebra of four by four matrices of trace zero quotient by scalar matrices, act on this by conjugation by h. And v0 is just the two-dimensional sum spaces of diagonal matrices plus i. But, okay, once you construct this, Okay, once you construct this, it's not difficult to see that every singular vector in V is either semi-simple or nilpotent, and there's only one orbit on semi-simple singular one spaces. And in general, we know that there are finitely many orbits on nilpotent one spaces. And this tells us that we have finitely many orbits in this case. And so this was up until now showing you some examples. Until now, I've shown you some example of finite singular orbit modules. So, modules where we have finitely many orbits on one spaces. But here's an example with cables two. So, again, it's a composition factor on a joint module. We have HA2 and the module of highest weight, lambda one plus lambda two in characteristic three. So, here we construct it slightly differently. I consider a Chevrolet basis for Liobay. Chevrolet basis for Lie of H indexed by the roots. And quotienting out by the one space spanned by this H alpha1 minus H alpha2, which is fixed by H, we get our module V, and H preserves a non-degenerate quadratic form on V. So what we do here is that we start from the H orbits on a simple. H orbits on similar vectors of V for which we have a set of representatives. So here we have X E alpha 3 has stabilizer U31 or Y E alpha 1 plus E alpha 2 stabilizer U2. So starting from the orbits on singular vectors, we show that these seven two spaces are singular, totally singular two spaces. They have the stabilizers listed in the third. The stabilizers listed in the third column. And lucky for us, these stabilizers are all connected, so counting argument is immediate. You literally just add up the sizes of the orbits when you take the sizes in the final case. You find that you have the number of totally singular two spaces, and this means that you actually found all the orbits. Found all the orbits. Okay. And so, as I was saying, I've only shown you how you take a case from the list and you show that you have finitely many orbits on singular one spaces or totally singular two spaces. But let us look at as the final example a case where we have no dense orbit. So let's set this up. So let's set this up. So we have H as E7 and B as the 56th dimensional minimum module for E7 of highest weight lambda 7. Okay, so depending on the characteristic, the form that H fixes is symplectic or orthogonal. So if P is not 2, H is embedded in SPB. In SPV, otherwise, if P is 2, H is embedded in S2V. And this changes things slightly for the proof. So, Growning and Lauter, in two very big recent papers, they have determined all, well, they proved existence and determined all generic stabilizers for the actions of simple algebraic groups on. Groups on varieties of subspaces arising from irreducible rational modules. So, in all of this work, one of the results is that E7 here acts on the variety of two spaces of B with the generic stabilizer with connected component D4. So, generic stabilizer, there exists non-empty, open, and Non-empty, opened, and set where the stabilizers are all conjugate to some subgroup. And here the connective component D4 means that, so let me take this off. So what does it mean? It means that 28, i.e. the dimension of D4, is a lower bound for the dimension of the stabilizer of any two. Of the stabilizer of any two space. So, this is enough when P is not two to say that there is no dense H orbit on the variety of totally singular two spaces. Because if there was a dense orbit on the variety of totally singular two spaces, the stabilizer would need to have dimension 27. And this is not possible, again, by the fact that the determined the generic stabilizer. Fact that it determined that the generic stabilizer had connecting component D4, so of dimension 28. On the other hand, if P is 2, this is not enough because the stabilizer of a dense orbit here would, if there was a dense orbit, the stabilizer would have dimension 28. So we cannot just say that this cannot exist just using this result by This result by Graning and Lauther. So, what we do here is we show that there exists an open-dense subset of the variety of totally singular two spaces where every stabilizer is at least 29 dimensional. And in the very same way, the top 2 for P02, this is enough for us to conclude. So the 29 will be a lower bound for the dimension of the stabilizer of a two-speed. Of the stabilizer of a two-space, of a totally singular two-space. But as I said, the stabilizer of a dense orbit would need to have dimension 28. And a quick note of how this is done. You need to show that the A1, A1, A1, which is a subgroup of E7, has no final stabilizer for the action on total. Stabilizer for the action on totally singular two spaces of this lambda one tensor lambda one tensor lambda one module okay so this was a nice example that of a case with no dense orbit and this talk about generic stabilizers leads to my final slide which is for redirections ie current projects so the first one I met I had this list of cases and I told you that I dealt This list of cases, and I told you that I dealt with k plus one, k plus two. There are some more to deal with. Biggest problem is maybe the computational side of things, but it's not many. It might be just two more difficult cases. And then once we have this, it would be nice to be able to say something about the double-causive problem for exceptional geographic groups. Algebraic groups. So, to have a result, a general result that says if you have a simple algebraic group in this setting where one of the two subgroups is a parabolic and the other one is an irreducible simple subgroup, when do we have finitely many double cosets? And finally, it would also be good to determine generic. Good to determine generic stabilizers. So, show that they exist and find them for the action on totally similar subspaces of sub-dual modules for simple algebraic groups. So, this would be the analogous result to the work by Grani and Lauter. They dealt with the action on all subspaces. We want to restrict to totally singular subspaces. Restrict to totally similar subspaces when we have a self-dual module. And this is it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your talk. If there are any questions, now it's time to ask. Well, if nobody else wants to ask something right away, maybe I'll have a question about that main corollary that you mentioned. Yes. So just to make sure I understand that correctly, so this is independent from the setup that you have sort of it before. So this is for an arbitrary age, and you just say you take an arbitrary. You take an algebraic set of tools and remote tools, and you get this result. So, yeah, essentially, if you take H simple algebraic group over K and you have a rational self-defucible KH module, yeah, the property of having finitely many orbits on totally singular K-spaces for K1 or 2 is equivalent to having a dense orbit. And so, is the self-duality assumption? Do you use that? Function, do you use that in order to define the form and then use the form to define total similarity? Yeah, yeah, it just needed for this to make sense, totally singular, otherwise. Yes. All right, thanks. Are there any further questions now? If not, well, thank you again, Aruna. And we'll resume with the next. We'll resume with the next talk in 16 minutes. I also want to say.
