So today in the morning we heard a Jimbo talk and what he was that anisotropic arithmetic hooks are never boundedly generated. And roughly speaking, the written was very is the following that if you have a unipotent matrix and you look When you look at the entries of the nth power of A, then the entries are polynomials in N. On the other hand, if A is semi-simple, then the entries of the nth power of A are exponentials in N. And it's much harder to solve an exponential equation than to solve polynomial equation. So, let me give you So let me give you a definition. So let gamma be a group and x is an empty set. The width of x in gamma is the minimal n where that can be either a natural number or infinity such that every element in the subgroup generated by x is a product of at most n elements which either belong to x or to its inverse. And then Carter and Keller, as Andre said yesterday, approved boundary generation, but after it they had another work together with Page, which was unpublished, and Dave Morris published their argument. And the main result of the second work is the following. So let n be greater or equal to 3, and O be a ring of integer in a number 3. ring of integer in a number field, then the SLNO conjugacy class of the elementary matrix E1 and its UF1 on the one end coordinate has finite widths. So this theorem talks about a very specific conjugacy class, but once you know that this very specific conjugacy class has a finite width, then it's an easy exercise to show that It's an easy exercise to show that every conjugacy class has a finite width, and not only that every conjugacy class has a finite width, that there is a for some generalization of this theorem, which they also proved, that there is a uniform bound on the width of conjugacy class. No matter which elements you take, you multiply some every element in the Every element in the normal subgroup generated, but it's a product of C conjugate of it or of its integers. It's an estimate. Excuse me? Estimate? Yes, you can compute. In this case, it's very related to boundary generation, but yeah, you can get an estimate. And there is another theorem of Tuslin that says the following. Another theorem of Tusslin that says the following: that let n be greater or equal to 3. And there exists a constant C such that for every commutative ring R, so C depends on N, but does not depend on R, but every element in the SLNR conjugacy class of E1N is a product of at most C elementary matrices. So if you combine the result of Carter-Keller, Result of Carter, Keller, and Page, and the theorem of Sophrin, they do it differently, but it's much easier to combine these two theorems. You get together bounded generation. Now, the point that I want to make is that the real property that relates to the arithmetic structure is the theorem about widths of conjugacy classes. And once you have a finite You have finite rates of conjugacy classes, no matter which are what your ring is, you will have a bounded generation. It is not related to the arithmetic nature of the ring, the path from bounded weeds to bounded generation. And why this is why it's Why it is better to look at conjugacy classes, it is from the following reason. Take two matrices, but think that A is fixed and B is a matrix with variables. Then the entries of the element which are the conjugation of A by B are polynomials in the entries of B. So we return to the good situation that now that we want to prove To prove bounded tweets, we are dealing with polynomial equations and not exponential equations. Okay, so but one of the motivation for dealing with bounded generation was that it implied the congruence subgroup property. So you can ignore the part in in in yellow, just the assumption that you need in order to have the congruence subgroup property. Congruent subgroup property. So also conjugacy with is connected to the congruent subgroup property in the following sense. The GO is the congruent subgroup property if and only if every conjugacy class of the pro-finite completion of the GO um has a finite width. And and the proof of this theorem is not something um complicated, it seems rapid, it's That it's used Rapinchuk's lemma, it's quite an easy proof once you know Rapinchuk's lemma. So now we might want to start to investigate conjunctivity with and hope to generalize the result of Carter, Keller, and Page to other arithmetic groups. In the sense that to show that if you give me an arithmetic group, there is a bound on the widths of controversy classes. Unfortunately, this is not true as the following example shows. So let n be greater to equal than 5 and take f the standard positive definite quadratic form. And you can take gamma to be the group spin f of z1 over 3. F of z1 over 3. So it is dense in the compact group spin F of R. So now choose an element which is very, very close to the center. So since spin F of R is a bin variant metric, the whole conjugacy class will be very close to the center. Now, on the other hand, this group is simple. So when you start to multiply it, eventually you will get to everything. But because you started very close to the center, it will take you a long time. To the center, it will take you a long time to get to everything. So there is no bound, there is no uniform bound on the widths of conjugacy classes in this school. And you can do it similar thing in every anisotropic group. Okay, so at first it looks bad, but then you start to think about it, it's not really bad, because when we try to solve a polynomial equation, the first thing that we are looking for is local. We are looking for local abstractions always. And the best thing that we can hope is that once you pass all local abstraction, then you have a solution. And this is a local abstraction for a uniform bound on the width. Okay. So I'm just saying the setting of theorem one, and for every place V, Place V, we define A V to be either the V added completion of O if V does not belong to S, or K V if V belongs to S. And for every subset X of G O we define X V to be the closure of X in G A V. So it is a conjecture. So I So, under the setting of theorem one, there exists a function from the natural number to the natural number such that for every non-empty normal symmetric subset X of G O, the width of this X is finite, but not only that it's finite, it is bound by the function R depending on the width in the local places. Now, a priori, there are infinity. There are infinitely many local places. But really, you have in all places where the group, in all places which are either non-Archimedean or Archimedean and isotropic, you have a global bound on the width of conjugacy class. So really what happened what you really carry is um the places uh the real pl the real places where your group is uh Where your group is anisotropic. So this gives you the bounds. Also, there, you always have a finite width, but the widths can be arbitrarily large. So the conjecture is that the width of the full set depends only on this. And this is exactly what happened in the so in other words, the obstruction that we saw in the previous slide, we believe that this is the only obstruction. Only abstraction. Okay, so I just want to say that questions of this form are usually called in number theory a Wehring type problem. So wehring asks, you take the integers and you take k powers, and the question is every natural number at the sum of a bounded number of k powers. And then many people generalize these problems and these problems start. And this problem started to enter group theory in finite groups or other kinds of groups. So in this sense, this is continuum, but I'm not aware that okay, so never mind. So the second thing that I want to say is that the conjecture is false for rank one arithmetic groups. For ranked corner arithmetic groups. In ranked corner arithmetic groups, a normal subset, even if they are really large, let's say world maps, always has infinite widths. So this is really a property, should be a property of higher rank arithmetic codes. So is it reasonable to hope that hard is like linear or something, or is it going to be some really good? It will be linear. I do not want to get into them very deeply. One is that gamma is uniformly flexibly stable. I do not want to start to explain what it is. And the second is that the gamma is bind up. The second is that the gamma is bi-interpretal with the length z. Again, I don't want to say too much what it is, but I do want to say something which is surprising. So this is not the definition of bi-interpretable, but this is what it means in this setting. So you have an arithmetic group, GO. So you can think about GO in two different ways. First, as an abstract group, you have an abstract group. You have an abstract group. And the second way that you can think about GO is some variety of the ring O. And you can start speaking in first order languages about this group. You can speak about this group only in the group length, which when you are allowed to multiply things and to take inverses, but that's all. And you can speak about in the ring language, when you can say the language when you can say the 2,2 coordinate is equal to 4. So it is clear that everything that you can say in the group language you can say also in the ring language, right? Because the multiplication and inverse are given by polynomial equations. But by interpretation means that you can also do the other way around. Everything that you can say in the ring theoretic language, you can say The ring theoretic language, you can say in the group theoretic language. So, for example, the group knows what is the two, two coordinates of its elements. Okay, so this is quite surprising. And to be honest, you don't need this conjecture in order to prove it, as long as G does not have a center. But if G has a center, then you think what does the center matter, you know, it's a finite group. Method, you know, it's a finite group, but then we can show that it's equivalent to some weak, the fact that you can still do it is equivalent to some weak form of this conjecture. So you need the final width of some specific quality. You need the final switch of some specific code. Uniformly flexible is with respect to a whole. Flexible is with respect to homomorphism to permutations? Permutations, yes. So here's the theorem. So let n be greater or equal to plane and take the standard positive definite quadratic form onto n variables. And you take O V1 over 2 because we want that the group will be irregular and because we don't want to work over the addict. To work over dead in the dead asset, we don't want to get into this. And you take G to be the spin group of F, and gamma is GO. And in the next slide, I will write sometimes gamma, sometimes GO depending on what is more convenient in the situation. So then for every old prime P, the set of power L G to the P has finite widths in gamma. And the point of this theorem. And the point of this theorem is that this is an anisotropic code. So this theorem gives you an indication, a lateral, I would say even a stronger indication that the conjecture is true also for anisotropic groups and is true also for isentropic groups. Now, the fact that we take odd prime p and not just any n cover, we believe that we can do. We believe that we can do any power. We just didn't write the proof, so I don't want to write it in the slide. Okay. So I want to do the, to explain the, I will first give the main set of the proof and then I will try to go a little deeper into the proof. So the nice thing about the proof is that it's really the proof of the conference subject. Really, the proof of the conference subgroup property, but not for the group, but for a non-standard model of the group. So let's go over the main step. So let gamma star be an ultra power of gamma over a non-principal ultra filter of n. And let the set, so we have the set of p powers in gamma star. And we denote gamma star of p to be the Gamma star of P to be the group generated by this set. So the first step, which is standard in model theory, I will expand the argument, but it's really a standard argument, is to show that the width of x in gamma is finite if and only if the quotient of gamma star by gamma star p is trivial. And I just want to say, because maybe I will say it later, if it's finer than Say tradial. If it's finite, then it's trivial. So it's not the question, if it's actually trivial, it's the question whether or not it's finite. The second step is to show that gamma star over gamma star P is trivial if and only if a certain central topological extension of the convorous coefficient of G Q star, so I take the ultra power of Q star. ultra power of Q star and I take the converse completion. I can define the congruence completion over any ring. It does not have to be a number ring. As a continuous splitting to translate the problem to a problem about central topological curve extension with certain properties. And this is to show that under this assumption you you have a continuous splitting. Okay. So, um I want uh I will st I I I now I want to to to to to get a little bit into the detail. So we take U to be a non-principal ultrafilter of N and we define gamma star. It's just the direct product of gamma contributed many times where and you divide by the And you divide by the ultrafilter. So the important property, so gamma star is two important properties. The first important property is that by Law's theorem, the group gamma star satisfies the same first order sentences as gamma. And the second property, which I'm not going to say what it is, because in this case I can ignore it and do everything by end. I can ignore it and do everything by end is that gamma star is a saturated model of the group. But you can ignore this, you can do anything in Earth with a lens without going into this definition. So what is the argument that implies the second property? It is saturated models. You realize every type. Realized, yeah. Yeah. So w so what so why we can connect the the question whether parallels uh has finite width if and only if a gamma star model gamma star P is trivial. So if the width is trivial, then there exists C such that every element is a product of its most C P powers. But the statement that every element is the product of Every element is the product of P power. But in this case, every element is a problem. But in this case, it's every element in this example. Why? Roughly speaking, because all of the reduction maps are good, so you get simple groups, and you take the congress of property, you get no, but I know the congress of property for this group. I already know it. I already know it. Oh, you are using the commercial? Yeah, we cannot do anything in the... So we hope that at some point there will be new techniques to attack this question, but at this point we rely on the technique that are used for the convergence property. And that's why you need N to be large, right? One of the reasons at least. One of the reasons, yes. One of the reasons, yes. We yeah, so probably you can do a smaller end, but we didn't want to go we didn't try to optimize anything. Laziness is the other reason. So if the width is finite, then there are this is such that every element is the product of a small CP powers. So by loss, Powers. So by Law's theorem, every element of gamma star is a product of at most C powers, right? It's a first-order statement. It is true for gamma. So it is true for gamma star. So you get it. The crop which is generated by p powers is everything. On the other end, which is the thing that I told you that could be saturated, but you don't need it, is that for every n there exists g n, such that g n is not a product of the small n power. product of its most n power. So take the sequence that gives to the n coordinate g n. So it sits, so this element cannot be inside the group generated by p powers. Again, you can use lost your remote directly the definition. So the set of p powers is not, so the subbook generated by p powers is not everything. Okay. Okay. So step B is to show that to translate the question whether or not this quotient is trivial to a question about a central topological extension. So for every non-zero two-generated ideal, the two-generated is just because you cannot, it's not so important because every ideal contains a two-generated ideal. So if you do Ideal. So if you take the completion with respect to two generated ideals, you get the same completion. It's not important, or the same topology, it's not so important. But you do need it because of a technical reason. Denote gamma star purphy, you take just the ice congruence subgroup and you intersect it with the subgroup which is generated by the p powers and we call these groups the p-congruence subgroup. So, the point is that you have this commutative diagram. Now, the fact that this diagram is commutative, it's easy. This is not the point. The point is that the horizontal errors are isomorphism. And why they are isomorphism is because of the following reason. Think about the standard model, your actual group gamma. So you know that the set of p powers is everything. Parallels is everything, so it projects into every congruous cross-shape. But in fact, if you do some periodic calculation, not very hard ones, not only that it projects into every periodic quote shape, in that every periodic quotient, every element is the product of the bounded number of p-powers. But this is a first-order property that in a on-grace quotient, every element, Quotient every element is a product of a finite number of p powers, so it passes to this non-standard model. So, also in this non-standard model, we get that gamma star p project into every congruence quotient, and this is what you need in order to show that these are isomorphisms. Okay. And then you can And then you can, exactly in the standard case, define two topologies on your group. The first is the congruence topology, and the second is the topology which is generated by this p-conggruence subfox. It's easy to see that these are topologies on the group. And if you have topologies on the group, you can take completions with respect to the With respect to these topologies. You need to be a little bit careful what you mean completions, but let ignore it. You can take completions with respect to these topologies. And so we have gamma star bar, which is the congruence completion, and we have gamma star ed, which is the completion with respect to the peak congruence of completion. Respect to the peak congruence topology. And the point is that because of this commutative diagram and isomorphism, we can explicitly compute what is gamma star at. And it turns out that this is exactly the group that we want to show, that it's trivial, direct product with the congruence completion. So now what you get, so because of the p-conggruence, So, because of the peak congruence topology, it's finer than the congruence topology. It's clear that you have a map row from the completion with respect to the pre-converse topology to the completion with respect to the congruence topology. But you get two important things. You get that it is subjective, and you get that if the P congoes topology is trivial, you get that. The P-convert topology is trivial, you get a non-trivial current. Now, if you are used to think about the standard convertible property, you say this is clear. But this is completely not clear in this case. Because what happens in the standard case, you take inverse limits of compact spaces, and inverse limits of compact spaces are never empty. If you take inverse limits of general sets, Limits of general sets, even if all your maps are surjective, the inverse limit might be empty. So it's completely unclear if you don't know exactly what this group are, that this map is rejective or that it has kernel, even if the topology is final. So the P congress topology is engineered in order that we'll be able to compute XP. To compute explicitly at the completion. And of course, at this point, it does not give you much, but it will give us later a lot of information. And the congruence topology, exactly as in the standard congruence sample property, add an extension to a topology on the GQ star. But it turns out But it turns out that also the p-congruence topology has an extension to the topology on JQ star. Now this is non-trivial. This is a non-trivial fact. You can choose other topologies which is clear, but then you will have a very hard time to prove this because of the problem with inverse image. But you you can do similar arguments m more explicit to More explicit to the ones that Knesser used when he proved the central centrality of the convoys kernel to show that it has an extension to a topology on GQ star. And not only this, is that the kernel C is abelian. So in this extension, because it's abelian, it's central, because it's a direct product. And now you can take completion, but not of the Not of G over the integral points, but of G over the non-standard rational points. So you get a sequence, and so you get a central extension. This is a topological central extension. You need to prove it, but this is indeed a topological central extension, which has the following properties. C is discrete and has exponent P. Rho is a continuous section psi 1 over section phi one over the closure of gamma of geo star of gamma star of geo star it's the same thing and rho at a section psi two of the gq star with a dense image in the p-conguence completion so what you want to do you want to glue this two sections to get a a section from the converse completion to the p-converus The congruence completion to the pre-congruous completion, a continuous section. And if you can uh but the problem is that in order to do to glue them, you need to know that they agree on the intersection. But the intersection is geostar and what we are trying to prove, we are trying to prove that it is perfect, right? But we don't know that it's perfect. So we don't know that they agree on the intersection, so we cannot say at this point that you can, that you have. that you can that you have a continuous section from the full congruent circle from the full congruent completion. So okay why it is helpful to pass to the rational point instead of dealing with the integral point is that it follows from the work of Knetter that every element of JQ is a Every element of GQ is a product of a bounded number of commutators. So, again, this is a first-order property, so the same is true for G of Q star. So, this is a perfect group. And once you know that this is a perfect group, because it is dense in the P-congruence completion, the standard argument shows you that C is trivial if and only if this topological extension has a continuous C. As a continuous splitting. So now we translate the problem from a certain group being trivial to a certain central extension to be a trivial extension. So I just want to make a general definition. We don't want to work with this specific extension. So call it topological central extension. We call it a topological central extension of the congruous completion of GQ star, a discrete p-torgian GQ star metaplectic extension if it satisfies the following properties. D is discrete and as exponent P. Elta is a continuous section psi 1 over an open subgroup of the convoys operation. And eta has a section psi 2 over a JQ style with a gent. GQ style with a dense image in it. So if you can show that every such central extension has a continuous splitting, you prove that the set of p powers have finite widths. Okay. So uh the last thing so so so the note uh So denote F prime to be this quadratic form. So it's the standard isotropic quadratic form of degree 2n. You remember we inverted 2, so it's really the standard quadratic form of degree 2n. So it's the sum of n hyperbolic planes. And let H be the spin F tag. The nice thing is that exactly as in the discrete case, you have You have a topological isomorphism, eta, from the congruence completion of the rational points over G to the congruence completion of the rational points over H. And this is continuous, not only the durable and the topological isomorphism. This topological isomorphism preserves Preserve the rational points. Preserve the not the rational points, the closure of the integral points. So what you get is you get that there is a central topological extension, but now of the confluence completion of H, not of G. Okay. But now about HFO, you know that it has bounded generation because this is a Chevrolet group. We understand bounded generation in Chevrolet group. And bounded generation for Chevrolet group is essentially equivalent or even equivalent to the fact that every element is a a product of a a bounded number of commotators. Number of commutators. So you get that in HR, every element is a product of a bounded number of commutators. So because this is a first-order sentence, the same will be true for edge O star, which is the intersection of edge Q star with the profinite completion of A Q star with the profinite completion of H O star. So this is a perfect group. So now you can So now you can do what we couldn't do in G, but what you are missing, you are missing that you have a section from HQ star, because we had a section from G Q star, but we don't know that we have a section from HQ star. If if we knew it, then we conclude the our continuous section with this this three section and get a full continuous section. Continuous section. But in fact, you can do it in the same to show that you have a section of HQ star over the final completion, you need to approximate Steinberg symbols with matrices from GQ star, and you can do not exactly. And you can do s not the exact same kind of argument, but similar arguments to what Rossade and Rapid Schook do in the work on the computation of the metaplectic kernel. And to show that all Steinberg symbols vanish, so you do have a section of the discrete code. But the reason that you can do the same kind of argument as in Kind of argument as in a persadient rapid work is that you know the D is torsion. The first thing that they do is they pass to the case where it's torsion because then you don't have to approximate standard symbols on the nose, but you have to approximate them up to just powers, and this is easier. So, the story that I told you, everything that I said so far, it's I said so far, it's completely work the same for the general conjecture. It doesn't matter if you can take one conjugacy class, you don't need a big thing like the set of three powers, everything will work the same. But now, when you will try to approximate the standard symbols, you really have to approximate them ver uh To exactly approximate them, you cannot approximate them up to something. And then you cannot use, at least as far as we see, the techniques of sudden rapid choice. So, to be honest, we try to do it and we develop a technique to really proxy them explicitly. Explicitly, and until yesterday, we thought that we have a complete proof of the conjecture for this case. No, this case when you invert a few more primes and under the general Liemann hypothesis, but still under this complete proof. But at some point, you need to use some version of Artine primitive root conjecture. And when we asked people from analytic laboratory, they said, Yes, of course, it will work. Do like coolie, you probably don't need even the general liminal process. You can probably do it like it brown, but yesterday we understood that we do not understand Uli's work, so we are not sure that we can extend it. So so we think that we can extend it, but w I w w we w we We don't know how to write a proof right now, so we cannot say that we know this conjecture, but we believe that we'll be able to close this gap and really prove that, at least under the general Riemann hypothesis, that if you have this anisotropic spin group, you have to invert a few more primes, probably, doesn't matter, but that you really Doesn't matter, but that you really the conjecture is true for it. So we'll make this up different. Questions to the speaker? So it's a very interesting thing. So you start out with an isotropic group and then you replace it with a split group. Yes. And you are saying that one metaphoric extension splits if only the other splits. Yes. Yes, that's that's wonderful. I mean, I have no question, but I would like to look at that. So, okay. It's very similar. This step is very it's really similar to what you you do in as long as you have p-torgen, the the the converse you know that is torsion is really cl very close to what the thing that you are doing. More questions, problems? Could you say again what version of the conjecture you're proving, assuming this last argument works out? So take a so we do it at this point. If the last, okay, if you know, I don't know that it's work, I believe that it's working. I believe that it's work, but I don't know. Okay, so I want to be very careful. You assume that generally I'm a part of it because you want to use Shibutarov density theorem in an effective way. And then you take spin of f, the same f, which is the. And you take it over Z, you invert 2 because we don't want to work over the addicase, and then you invert it over 5, let's say 13 and 17. I don't know if you need 3 primes, 2 primes, it depends on this argument. So we believe that here you have a function R from n to R from n to n such that if you have we defined it to a general normal subset, but it's enough to deal with conjugacy classes. So if every conjugacy class here has a finite width, and the widths depend only on the width of the width. The width of this conjugacy class is in spin f of output. It's linear in the width in this scope. Now, maybe I should say one more thing. I'm talking about general normal subset or general conjunctive classes, but what we know for sure is the image of the form xp, and probably, again we didn't write it, but probably We didn't write it, but probably we can test the world of this from x to d. The only thing that you have to prove in order to prove the full conjecture is to deal with the commutator world. It's to prove that the commutator world has finite widths. If you know this for the commutator world, the conjecture is true. So you need to know it in any conversational. Or in any convergence subbook, not just in the full group, but if you know that the common cutover has finite reads in every converse subbook, then this conjecture is true. So, in some sense, after you do powers, the next word that you want to do is commutator. This is the next case. But it's another this is the only case. Once you know commutator, the conjecture is true. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I be careful in this example, it's not for general codes. For this kind of cookie. As for your conjecture that every kind of higher implied is that the interpretable would be extremely but for this kind of code. Or for its criterion? Yes. So data scratching. Well, we didn't know that this it it was to really call it. So the implications for automatic evolves? Yes. More questions? Just a comment. So many years ago, when we dealt, you know, with boundary generation, I mean, Kumar Murti showed that if you invert Command Morti showed that if you invert enough primes, then you don't need to assume GRH. Enough prime is still finite? Yeah. Okay, I see. And well, you could probably contact him and he will give you this reprints. But the consequences for the Artemis root conjecture you need from GRH. If you invert enough primes, you don't need GRH. So this was a rock. This was exactly. So this was a rope. This was exactly what we hope, but we do not we are not from analytic number two and this is exactly what we hope. But announcement was published, but his work with his student was not published. I mean, you can ask him directly, or I can try to find those preps somewhere in my office. So I'll tell you what is the problem that you need art in conjecture not over Q but over some field extension and then the discrete. Field extension and then the discriminant becomes terrible, so we don't understand how to use the discriminant is too big in order to buttariff to work. But we didn't try anything smart, we just did the most stupid things and it didn't work. We didn't try to sieve, we didn't try to anything really. The simplest thing didn't work. Until yesterday, we were sure that the simplest team works, and that's why we didn't. So, and that's why we didn't write anything more sophisticated. But initially, it's probably the best person to ask. I think. Okay. So we'll ask. But that's all. Okay. Thank you. Comments? So let's send this pick again. So no more talks today of the afternoon. And tomorrow we resume.
