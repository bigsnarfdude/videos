Thank you very much. So first of all, I'd like to thank the real organizers. I thought Yeah, Deborah and Pablo, that it's always been a pleasure to co-organize things with them because they do all the work. And this is absolutely true. And so far, I think that everything has been perfect, almost perfect, apart from the rain yesterday. So, geometric applications of linear algebra. Actually, I will. Actually, I will be talking about grasshoppers, and you see here grasshoppers, an incredible biblical amount of grasshoppers. I was amazed when I found this picture on the internet. So, everything that I will be talking about is sort of joint with Gabor Paldochi Institute. Okay, so uh Oleg already mentioned the Olympiad, so it also it started with an Olympiad thing, an Olympiad problem by which was asked by a guy called Kovalci, who has beautiful problems. So, this is the question, by the way, the ask. By the way, Arseny Akopian immediately told that it cannot be 2001, it is 1994, and he was, of course, right. So what is the problem? The problem is very simple, that you have four grasshoppers and they are sitting at the vertices of a square, and what And what the grasshoppers can do is the following: that one grasshopper, any one of them, can jump over another, like this one jumps over this, and ends at the same opposite position at the same distance from it. So now there is no grasshopper here. And then in the second step, maybe this grasshopper will jump over. Jump over this one. And they do these things. And then the question is that I don't know how it was formulated at the Olympia, but actually, with a little bit of help, it can never happen that the grasshoppers end up at the vertex set of a larger square. And I mean, it has a two-line proof, but I think it's really a beautiful proof. The proof is the following. So if you want to think about it, then don't listen now. So the proof is the following. So, first of all, notice that no matter what you do, I mean, if you look at this square, of course, this square. At this square, of course, this square we define a square grid, the integer grid. This already shows that something is, and your grasshopper should always be at the vertices of that integer grid, because that's obvious. If you are at an integer point, you jump over an integer point, you arrive at an integer point. And definitely, in the integer grid, there is no square which There is no square which is smaller than the original square. So the grasshoppers cannot end up at the vertex set of a smaller square. However, and then there's a second idea that these steps are reversible, right? So if you can, if this grasshopper can jump from here to here. Grasshopper can jump from here to here, and you can play this movie backwards, and then it's also a valid sort of series of steps. So, if you cannot end up at the vertex set of a smaller grid, then you also cannot end up in the vertex set of a larger one because obviously, because then, okay, so I don't want to over-explain it now. Now, as far as I know, it was Florestan Brun who asked the question that, okay, that's a very nice proof, but it is very much sort of based on this integer grid idea. So, what happens if your grasshopper see Grasshopper sit in the vertex set of a regular pentagon. Then the whole argument is sort of completely dead. And he says that he explained this problem to Penrose, who is definitely the ultimate expert on pentagons. And the conjecture was that you really You really cannot do this for Pentagon's either. Okay, so I have to say something about it. So to our greater surprise, actually the answer is that for pentagons you can do it. So you can start from five vertices sitting at the vertex set of a regular pentagon. Of a regular pentagon, and after a finite number of steps, you can end up with a grasshopper sitting at the vertex of a larger pentagon. Moreover, you can do it for any number except for four, which I showed. Three and six are exactly the same idea because they are grids, they are determining grids. So So, I mean, we want to consider this problem in a little bit more general way. You start with a certain configuration of grasshoppers, you go through the motions and you arrive somewhere, and then you want to be able to say whether you can get from the initial position to the final position or not. And what does this depend on? This depends on. And you won't be very much surprised to see that this has something to do with linear algebra. So you have to set up, of course, the notation somehow, for some technical reasons that are absolutely unimportant. You will see. So this is a planar picture, but it could be in any dimensions. Many dimensions. If you have n plus one grasshoppers, you put the first one P0 in the origin. It will be pleasant that one of them is in the origin and will stay in the origin. Now, you would think that if you insist that this grasshopper never jumps at the origin, that this would make a difference, but actually, you will see that it doesn't. And then, you know, if Then, you know, if the d-dimension of the picture and you say that one of the grasshoppers is at the origin, p0, then you are left with little n other grasshoppers. Each of them have d coordinates. So the whole configuration, if you have n grasshoppers, can be described by a matrix, which is a d by n matrix. And this is the Matrix, and this is the matrix P. And I will always, so in all of these slides, this P will denote the original configuration matrix. And I'd like to say that where you can go from here. So what can you do? What you can do is you can do two kinds of steps. First kind, the first First kind of step is that you take one of the grasshoppers pi and you jump over the origin, the stationary thing. Then you end up in minus pi. This corresponds to multiplying your original matrix, configuration matrix, with the identity matrix, except that at the ice position you have a minus one. It's evolution because if you repeat. It's evolution because if you repeat it twice, then you get back to the origin. And there is the generic one when Pi jumps over Pj. But if Pi jumps over Pj, then it will end up in negative Pi plus 2 Pj. You can compute that. And this corresponds to multiplying your original configuration matrix again by something like the identity matrix, except that. Except that in the ice position in the diagonal, you have a negative one, and in that sort of column, you have a two. This two corresponds to these two. So these are the two kinds of things. I call them elementary evolutions. And obviously, what you can get from the original configuration. The original configuration is whatever is generated by these matrices. So, what are those things that are generated by these matrices? And it turns out that it's not difficult to prove that a matrix can be generated by these so-called elementary evolutions if and only if the absolute value of the determinant. The absolute value of the determinant of the, I'm talking about integer matrices. Absolute value of the determinant is one. And I say it simply that the matrix is congruent to the identity matrix modulo two. It means that in the diagonal you have odd numbers and in the everywhere else, Everywhere else, you have even numbers. So, in one direction, of course, it is clear because these matrices satisfy this property. And if you multiply two matrices of determinants, are plus one or minus one, then this property will be satisfied. Also, you know, the parity won't change. So, you only have to worry about the other direction. The other direction, and but this means what is the other direction that if you have a matrix that satisfies these two properties, so the determinant is plus or minus one and there is disparity condition, then you can really Really transform that matrix into the identity matrix by doing two kinds of operations. You can take a column and multiply it by minus one, or add or subtract twice at a column from another column. And so let me just show. Show it to you because this is really extremely easy, and then I won't tell you any other proof. So in fact, there is a simple fact, and it is kind of interesting to know this fact because, in fact, there are a lot of rather Of rather involved arguments, but there is a simple one-dimensional argument which is in the background of all of these things. And that is the following. So you have the line and you have this zero and you have some numbers, integers on it. And what I can do is I can What I can do is I can take positive ones and negative ones. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to reduce the absolute value of the largest of these numbers. And what I can do is, I can take a number, one of these numbers, like A. One of these numbers, like e, and I can add or subtract from it twice another number, and by that, I can always reduce the range of the absolute volume up to a certain point. So, for instance, imagine that this is the number A, which has among your numbers the largest. Largest absolute value. So, is there any other value whose absolute value is smaller than that, like this one, then you can simply subtract from this value twice this value. You may jump over to the other side, but then definitely you reduce the absolute value of this thing. Absolute value of this thing. This you can do, you can always repeat this step several times up to the point when there are only two values, absolute values left, apart from possibly zero, a and negative a. And that's what you do. You look at your original matrix. Original matrix, you assume that your matrix satisfies those properties and you look at the only at the last row. And by adding or subtracting twice other columns from the largest column, you can always achieve that there are only three possible values in the last. Values in the last last row, a negative a and zero. But if this is the case, then this number a, which is the only possible value in the last row, must be one, because otherwise you can expand the determinant across the last row and everything will be divisible by a. Right? But we know that the determinant is one. This was one of my, this was the. is one this was one of my this was the first foundation so so here in the last uh last uh row i can achieve by these operations that i have only plus one minus one uh and zero but then the only possibility is uh really this that that all of them are zero and and the last one is one because there is the parity condition i cannot have a one or a minus one which is the same module two anyway Which is the same module two anywhere else, and here it might be one, and then you have a problem which is of one smaller size, and then by induction you are done. I go to sleep. What do I do? Cancer, not sleep. Okay, no. Very good. All right. So now this is the statement. The first statement is completely trivial based on what we had. That if you start with an initial configuration and then the positions reachable by this. By these so if you assume that the zeros grasshopper sits on the origin, then you can reach exactly these things that are B times A, where A is generated by elementary involutions, fine. But what happens if you can also, the grasshopper at zero can also jump? This is what I said: that if it can jump, That if it can jump, it doesn't change anything really because if you allow it to jump, then the only difference is you can reach exactly the same things plus some translates. And you can even tell that which translates they are. You can get to translates by two times p times w. Well, w is an integer vector, another way of saying that. Another way of saying that that translates by p times w, where w has only integer values. And this, here I have a drawing which I have to show you. You don't have to look at it, but it took so much time to draw it that I have to show it. So, why is it? Throw it. So, why is it this 2p w? So, imagine that you have your original configuration. Here is zero, here is a fixed grasshopper. You really fix it, and then there is a generic other grasshopper P. So, what you can do is that now your grasshopper at zero, the stationary one, jumps over A. Everyone jumps over A, and everybody else jumps over A. So, what happens with this one? The one that was stationary now is at 2A. And this one jumps over here. It's 2A minus P. And then everybody in this picture will jump over this 2A. So, this is the grasshopper. So, this is the grasshopper that used to be stationary, but I allowed it to jump. This is what happens: that now they will end up, the original one will be at 2A, this thing will end up at 3A, this will end up at P plus 2A. So, everything was translated by 2A. And you can do it with any other fixed class of 2A. The glass of today. Okay, so this is possible. This is one direction, and the other direction you have to work a little bit. So you really don't have to worry about the stationary glass hopper at all. Now let's look at the stationary. I mean, look at this, sorry, the similar configurations. So So, this was our original problem, but not only for regular rangon, but for everything else. So, we start with a configuration of P, and our question is that we want to end up at a configuration which is similar to P but is larger. When can we do that? And well, I mean, obviously. I mean, obviously, we can do that if the final configuration is P times A, that's larger and similar to the original one. And E is a matrix which satisfies those two properties. One of them was this property, and the other one was a parity condition, right? So the difference from the previous statement is that now I drop the parity condition. So I said that. So I said that if I can find a matrix A which satisfies the determinant condition, then P times A is larger than and then similar to the original configuration P. And if I can find such a matrix then, then I am fine. Then I am fine. So, what I have to show is that the parity condition indeed can be dropped. But that's a very simple algebraic fact, right? Because what I do is the following, that if I assume that that matrix A, so that P A is larger and similar than the original one, also satisfies the periodic condition, then I am fine. Fine. So now I take any matrix A, which possibly doesn't satisfy this property, but I notice that these are just over modulo two, they form a finite matrix group, these matrices. So this means that my matrix A. That my matrix A has a power which satisfies the, so that A to the T is the identity matrix, it will satisfy the condition. And then this matrix A to the T is also generated by, of course, if A was generated by these things, the A to the T is also generated by this. So this means that I means that I found a matrix P times A to the T, which satisfies both of the conditions. Therefore, I can get to a larger and similar configuration. Now, I should mention this point because you may wonder really that if you can get an algorithm for reaching such For reaching such a position, and this is the weak point that here I said that there exists such a thing. I really don't know. You can try all of them, but that we slow down the process. Okay, so now going back to regular polygons, so this is what I just like to apply this. What we have learned so far to our original question. So, this is a picture that shows the case n equals 6 where we know actually that for hexagons the argument works, but it doesn't matter. So, you find this means that little n, the non-stationary Grasshoppers, there are only five non-stationary grasshoppers. So if you describe this, you can describe that by a two by five matrix because you are in the plane and there are the five non-stationary you ask of first p1, p2, p5. And then you just construct this matrix that I do here, very simple matrix. Simple matrix. In the first row, you have negative ones, otherwise, it's like an identity matrix. And of course, its determinant is absolute value is one. And then you notice that if you take that this you have to check while looking at this picture that actually p times. That actually P times M for this matrix is S times P, where S is a rotation, rotation matrix in the plane. So this means that my matrix M almost satisfies that property that I wanted for the matrix A. This means that if I take P times M, then Then this will be similar to the original configuration, rotated, but unfortunately it's rotated so it won't be larger. It is congruent to that. This is the only problem with this matrix. But then again, there is a simple kind of, I just copied that, simple algebraic fact. Fact that since P times M can be described as a rotation of P, therefore for any polynomial of M, I can think M squared plus M, whatever, P times F M is just Fs times P. So this is So this is, you know, you can apply it. So here, you know, P times M squared is just S squared times P. If B equals S P. And this F of S is, since originally this is composed by rotations, this F of S is also a kind of rotation. It is some constant times n. Some constant times an orthogonal matrix. This is a very simple algebra effect. And after that, you know, you only have to figure out what the polynomial f of m that you apply this observation is. And this requires, you have to find such a polynomial, and then you have to prove it that the matrix A, which is the A, which is this polynomial of m, satisfies both of the properties that the determinant of a is one. And p times a is not only a scaled rotation of the original one, but it is really larger than it. And this is the polynomial. So again, the polynomial is that you add up just the Just the powers of m up to a certain point. And here comes in number theory that you can find an i, apart from the fact when n is 3, 4 and whatever on those cases, for which this property will be satisfied. This requires some calculations, but once you are sure this polynomial, then the calculation. The calculations are trivial. I don't want to tell you more about that. Now, there is one other thing that another problem which is perhaps a little bit more difficult to solve that I like to tell you. I won't say anything about the solution. So, the question is that. So, the question is that you modify a little bit your problem. What does it mean? You say that you have your original configuration of grasshoppers and there is a final configuration. But now you don't insist that you want to get exactly to the final configuration. And that we described more or less by linear algebra: that how you get. Less by linear algebra, that's how you can decide. But you just want to say that this is the final configuration, and by a number of steps, I'd like to end up with my grasshoppers in a position where the first grasshopper is very close to the first point, the second grasshopper to the second point, the third one to the third point. So approximately they go to the position. They go to the position you prescribe. And the question is: when can this be done? And obviously, there are some necessary conditions. So the number of grasshoppers has to be larger than the dimension because otherwise, you know, you are just jumping around on a grid and you. Jumping around on a grid, and you won't be able to get off the grid. This is just like in the original thing. So there's no hope that you could get into any arbitrary positions. So the question is that when, what is the assumption that makes sure that you can end up at any rescribed positions. So, what is the second necessary condition? The second necessary condition is that because you are jumping around on this grid, which is generated by the non-stationary grasshoppers, therefore that grid, so to speak, so all integer combinations of it's not really a grid, I don't know how to call it, additive group generated by, has a mathematical name. Mathematical name. So that has to be dense. That's obviously there. And it turns out, and surprisingly, it is not quite trivial, that these two conditions are really also sufficient. And so there is a very, again, a very simple fact which is behind this thing. Behind this thing, a very simple, which is which one can easily check. And this is the following. That if you have a set of vectors, in the plane, it doesn't matter, it can be in any dimension, and you want to know if If these vectors, if you take all the integer combinations of these vectors, then you get a set which is everywhere dense in the plane, for instance, any dimension. It turns out that the only obstacle is the following, that if you can find a direction so that vector W so that the scalar products of Scalar product of every pi with this vector is an integer, then of course you have no hope. So let me assume that this vector w is kind of a unit vector, then the scalar product will be the so then the project the scalar products will be just the projections, right? Of course, if the Of course, if the projections for all of the vectors are integers, then it doesn't matter how you jump around, you take integer combinations of these vectors, then their projection will always be an integer. So this means that you cannot be everywhere dance in the plane. The more difficult part of it is, of course, to prove that this character. So, this characterizes this thing, but then really the other direction that you can really get, if this condition is not satisfied, then you can get close to everybody. So believe it or not, it has something also something to do with heritage theorems, but I definitely don't want to talk about that. And I thank you very much for your And I thank you very much for your question. Question? Yes. What happens if you consider a compact, for instance, sphere or flat bolts? In this case, maybe the second, can you move some yeah, flat bolts, right? Do the same thing. Yes. The same thing, yes. What happened with uh with this logo? Do we have some so? I guess that uh, you mean the density thing? I don't think that it changes. The density doesn't change the linear algebra thing. I guess that that doesn't that wouldn't change either. But it is different, you know, if you for toros, for square toros, if they have jump in this direction, you will get. Yeah, I don't know. You are right. Maybe it changes the maybe changes the algebra. No. No. Because there can be some, you can generate some uniform with the distributed memory. Okay, is there another question? Another question? Yes. Did you think of starting not from a regular polygon but from a point set Q? And could you characterize the point sets Q for which you can get to a similar? Yeah, that was the first theorem. This is when they are, yes, when you can find the matrix which is generated by those things. It satisfies only the determinant condition. But you know, the But you know why we didn't look at the I mean you can ask much much simpler things which will kill our arguments. For instance, what happens if a grasshopper jumps over this grasshopper and ends up at a point which is twice as far as the original one. Unfortunately, this argument that I said about reducing by adding, subtracting, By adding, subtracting twice the original number is that. And everything else, in a more convoluted way, is based on this one-dimensional argument. So I actually, I don't know how to characterize those things where you jump further. And I am sure that it can be done. And some elements of the argument work, but someone will have to work it out. It's not clear. out it's not uh it's it's not clear the the arguments so so the the the the way how we proved it is there doesn't work yes yeah do you have condition where the the copy is not similar for this conference i mean this gives some condition uh you know for you take all you know for you take all of the all of the I mean here in the original version of course you can always even even for integers you can just translate it right so con to congruent copies you you can translate everywhere and I guess that you can describe that but I guess that you can describe that, but in general, I don't know if there is any nice theorem for that. There must be. Yeah. Mary, the last question, yes. So in the original problem, right, in the four grasshoppers. Yes. So you can reach certain configurations, yes? These are like some, like if I just take every possible grid. Every possible grid configuration I mean the the there is a description right the the description is uh if you can find a metrics which is but uh but how how you can describe yeah how you can Which lettuce quadrangular? Yeah, it's it's it's not obvious. It's also I mean, this is how deep we went. Thanks, then, uh, Janice and Holmes. Thank you very much, Harley. Thank you very much. That's it.
