That's right, actually, that's right. We have co-organizers. It obviously fitted. Yeah. Okay, so first I should say that I'm now in Beijing. So my main affiliation now is Tsinghua University. And I'm still affiliated very much to the University of California, but I retired from there. California, but I retired from there. And it was quite amazing, the move. So it's a very interesting place. It's inquiring lots of energy. And I assume that and I hope that many of you will visit this place sometimes in the future when the travel will be easy. Okay. So, here is the grant plan. So, first, I'll remind the old story and some open questions about the old story. Then, I'll discuss the integral versions of quantum SL2 and their specializations at roots of unity. I'll discuss the breaking. So, and then this is what I was planning to do. This is what I was planning to do to discuss invariance of tangles with G flat connections in the complement, invariance of three manifolds with G flat with flat connections in them, or rather in principle, G bundles over them. And again, it's possible to have presence of links and some open problems. So So actually, I can just say that this is a big open problem with partial results due to Castancina, Gir and Puturo Miran, Basiliac Benedetti and Kashaev, Turoev and Gir. I don't know why I changed the Change the G should be at the top. So, and then I was planning to discuss open problems, but I think this will be done in the presentation. So, you know, if this presentation will be somewhat chaotic, then feel free to contribute to this chaos. Contribute to this chaos, ask questions, make comments. So, last few weeks were very chaotic with the quarantine in Shanghai, moved to Beijing, getting used to the new place. So, altogether, somehow my contributed somewhat to the chaos of my thoughts and my presentation. So, let me start with the old story. So let me start with the whole story. In fact, this is really what it all begins. So I think everyone knows what UQSL2 is. So it's a Hopf algebra. So what I wrote here is so-called small quantum group. And for the purposes of topological invariance, Topological invariance of three manifolds, or rather, construction of 3D TQFT as the functor from 3D cabordisms to vector spaces. For the time being, we only need small quantum group, which is a finite dimensional Hoof algebra with the parameter Q, which is the root of unity of degree 2r. Of degree 2r. So here m over r is they're mutually simple, both odd and q to the r is equal to minus 1. As a result, so it's this particular case that's important. The algebra is generated by invertible k by e and f elements with these relations that are well known, with these extra relations that Extra relations that rth power of E and Rth powers of F is zero and two Rth power of K is one. This two R is, again, it's important for obtaining a modular tensor category. In fact, it's interesting that in representation theory in this community, people usually don't pay attention to this fact. So, for example, in Lustig's work, it's key to Uh, it's k to the r is one, which is exactly not the case that's interested interesting in the applications for GQFT. So, this Hoof algebra, as an algebra, it's non-semi-simple. It's quasi-triangular in a sense that there are these commutativity morphisms represent the tensor product of two any finite dimensions. Tensor product of two any finite dimensional representations is isomorphic to the inverse tensor product. So the structure of representations is the following. There are simple modules with the highest weight with or rather with the analog of the highest weights that range from zero to r minus two. 0 to r minus 2. Strictly speaking, there are two types of them depending on the value of this central parameter k to the r. So in each of this presentation, there is a white basis where k acts diagonally, e and f, so they lower or they elevate the weight by one. And then And then, a very important notion of a representation for such quantum groups is the quantum or functorial dimensions. So they exist because the corresponding categories of models are so-called pivotal or more precisely spherical categories. So, these functorial dimensions in this very specific example. Specific example of this form, and you can easily check that the only way how they can be positive is when m is equal to one. And so in physics, it's this phenomenon or rather in physics, both in representation theory, this is called unitarity. And so when so the dichotomy here is When so the dichotomy here is when m is equal to one, the theory is unitary, and the corresponding conformal field theory is unitary and non-logarithmic. When m is not equal to one, the corresponding conformal and unitarity of conformal field theory, of course, it's related to how the collision functions behave at infinity. But these are all connected phenomenon. So if M is not. So, if m is not equal to 1, the theory is non-unitary, and we certainly expect different properties in this theory. So, then there are so-called very special representations, standard models with the highest weight r minus 2. So, you see, sorry, with the highest weight r minus 1, it's the next after r minus 2. And again, strictly speaking, there are two of them with respect to the value of the. With respect to the value of that central element k to the r so then there are tilting modules, these are extensions of simple modules which are projectives, projective representations. In other words, they have no extensions, they cannot be included as sub-modules in anywhere sort of thing in other modules. So these standard modules, they are also projected. Standard models, they are also projectors. And they are all tilting models. So the structure of represent of, and then there are others, like there are while modules, or rather, these versions of while modules for For a small quantum group, which are extensions of irreducibles. So the category of models over this small quantum group, and it's a small quantum group, so U should be small, has the following structure. The whole category of finite dimensional representations contains the subcategory of tilting models. Where I'm joining, where the kind of well, not simple modules, but tilting modules are X and V's. And then by there is a subcategory of projective representations. And here I include the Steinberg representation. Well, it's projective. So there are three categories. The big category of all modules. Big category of all modules, the smaller category of tilting modules, and the even smaller category of projective modules. And this is the structure of the tensor products. So this is the structure of monoidal category. So you see that this is the monoidal subcategory. Subcategory, and this is also monoidal subcategory. So we have various quotient categories, and the most remarkable one is when you take the quotient of chilting modules over projective modules. This is what's known as modular tensor category at level R related to SLD. Related to SL2. It's a semi-simple category. It has monoidal structure, it has braiding, it's a rigid category, it has everything. It has non-degeneracy of the S-matrix, it has a Riemann structure. And so using this category, you can construct invariance of three manifolds. Invariants of three manifolds, or more precisely, TQFT by surgery. This is what we did in this particular example for SL2 with Turaiov in late 80s, earlier 90s. And for the closed manifolds, this invariant is just a certain state sum. So these are the invariants of links. Of links, frame links. And for this picture, and when so this is for closed manifolds, when the manifold is open, then you define the vector space that's assigned to the boundary of the manifold. And then in this vector space, you have a no, sorry, I was thinking about cylinders, you have a You have a vector that's the partition function corresponding to the manifolds. So this is the semi-simple story. This is the semi-simple GTFT. I'm skipping all the details because I think all of this is known. So the question is, can we extend Can we extend this functor toe by adding these non-semi-simple representations? In other words, can we construct some kind of non-semi-simple versions of this TQFG? The answer is yes, and it's been known for quite a while. Henning constructed Certain invariance of three manifolds using integrals over Hof algebras for closed manifolds. And integrals over UQ, over small UQ SL2 will not give our invariance with 2. They give something else and they give some kind of non-semi-simple versions of this invariance. Toe. Lubashenko developed these ideas and he developed Uh, these ideas, and he developed the whole uh non-semi-simple QQFT based on this, and then there were lots of developments in this direction. So, um, okay, so so this is this is the sort of uh this is the story, and you can see that this question is very natural. So, you have something that you can something very important that you can. Something very important that you can associate to this quotient category. The question is: can you make similar constructions for the whole category? And so we will return to this discussion later. But now I want to mention the other constructions, so-called local constructions of three-dimensional TQFT, where triangulation by Tura F. Where triangulation by Torre F and Zero. So they are based on so-called Q6J symbols for this semi-simple quotient category. The idea is that if you multiply irreducible representations, if you decompose the tensor product in two different ways. Tensor product in two different ways. You will have two different bases in the space of homes from Vi tensor, Vj tensor, VL to VK for each K. So roughly speaking, this basis can be characterized by these graphs. And if you take the transition matrix between these graphs, Between these graphs. I mean, then you can naturally associate the trihedron to this. So we did a lot of these computations for generic Q with Anatoly Kirilov and identified this Q six-g symbols with Q hypergeometric functions of type 4, 3 for generic Q. This story is for roots of unity. And it's quite remarkable that. And it's quite remarkable that for rules of unity, the sort of magic happens, and you have these Q6G symbols for truncated modular tensor category. And as a result, what you can do is you can assign to a triangulated manifold certain partition function, certain state sum. So it doesn't matter now what these d's are, they are quantum dimensions. So, what you have to do is you have to take the product, you have to color the edges of triangulation, and then you have to take the product of all tetrahedra associate to each tetrahedron Q6G symbol, and then take this sum. The result is that this sum doesn't depend on triangulations. So, that's the theorem of Toro F and zero. And the relation to our kind. The relation to our construction with storages is the following. For closed manifolds, the invariance magically is just the product of two invariants for M and Tau invariance for M with opposite orientation. Or because it's just complex conjugation, it's just the absolute value squared of our invariant with derived. So this is for closed manifolds as a QQT function. As a QTFT functor, it is still some kind of tensor product of tau and toe with the opposite orientation. So the question now is, can we construct a non-semi-simple version of Tura Ferro construction? And well, it's again, there was some progress in this direction, but Some progress in this direction, but it's more a question to the audience. So it seems like though there were some partial progress, the complete picture is still not here. If someone knows a better answer, then feel free to join the discussion. The discussion. So now, so our work was partially motivated by the work of Witten on quantum Chern-Simons invariant. So he gave a phenomenological, wonderful kind of idea of the existence of such invariants, which was the kind of which was important for us. And we started to look for invariants of links that are invariant with respect to the Kirby moves, and that's how. To the Kirby moves, and that's how we constructed those invariants. So, Witten's idea was different. So, he started to construct quantum field theory by quantizing classical topological field theory. So, it's a classical, any classical topological field theory assumes that there is a space of fields. In this case, this is the space of connections. Of connections on a principal G-bundle over some three-manifold M. If three manifold is closed, all and G is connected, simply connected, all such bundles are trivial. And so you can identify connection with one form. And then this is the Chen-Simons functional. Simon's functional. So you can consider this as the action for three-dimensional topological classical field theory. So then if you have a closed three-manifold, then you just take the path integral, which is something that physicists do all the time. And in fact, there is certain meaning in these path integrals, but this is a separate discussion. So, if you will integrate over all connections e to the Chun-Simons action with some constant k that has the meaning of the inverse Planck constant. If k is an integer, that's the gauge invariant object. And if we integrate, we get some invariant quantities. Get some invariant quantities, so we get topological invariant. Of course, how to make sense of such path integral? Well, there are two schools. One is really saying that we should try to compute it measure theoretically, and before computing it, we should define it measure theoretically. The others who say that let's just consider the asymptotical expansion of this thing as k goes to infinity around critical points, pretending that. Around critical points, pretending that the integral is defined, we will just define the formal asymptotical expansion of this integral as a formal power series. And so when I say path integral, I always mean this. So if you have just a single closed manifold, all you can do is you can define this expansion. Can do is you can define this expansion and you cannot really construct the theory, you cannot verify what you get. But then if you organize this three manifolds, if you consider three manifolds as boundary, if you consider the functorial property of gluing these three manifolds, in other words, you want to construct GQFT, this is much more meaningful thing. You can define such power series extensions. Power series extensions for three manifolds with boundaries with certain boundary conditions. I didn't discuss boundary conditions, what they are, but they are the following. On the space of connections over the boundary, if the three manifold has a non-trivial boundary, you have a natural sympletic structure that goes back to Atiya. Goes back to Atiya and both. And then, kind of the boundary conditions that we care are so-called Lagrangian vibrations of this three-manifold. In fact, there is a nice and interesting story, but it's kind of complicated story that what we actually need is just the Um Hamiltonian reduction of this infinite-dimensional sympletic manifold with respect to the infinite-dimensional group acting gauge group acting by Hamiltonian transformations. And the result is the moduli spaces of flat connections over the boundary over these surfaces. And what is really needed is some kind of Lagrangian vibration of this boundary moduli space. Boundary modulus spaces. So it's basically a story about geometric quantization. And so this was Witten's idea. That's sort of to do something like this, to have a functorial quantization in this way. And these phenomenological arguments fit sort of nicely with the idea that these boundary spaces, the space of geometric quantization. So, these boundary spaces of geometric quantization, they are spaces of conformal blocks of boundary conformal field theory. So, in this particular case, these are chiral, this conformal blocks are so-called chiral kind of parts of Witten, sorry. Sorry, WCW. I forgot the order of this to mean in theory. So these are conformal blocks with special properties. So now I'm talking about, I'm still talking about partition functions of Chun-Seim and Theodore. So here's an example when you have a So, here's an example. When you have a sphere with n punctures, then from these punctures, you have a tangle growing inside of the manifold, and you have some kind of holomorphic sections of something, and actually solutions to so-called Knushing semiological equations. So, they give you these objects that are geometric on the boundary and topological inside. Side. So that's an that's an on-old story. That's uh, I think everyone in the audience knows this, but I still want to kind of bring back these memories. So all this concept was made precise by a group of people, Suchia, Ueno, Anderson, and many others. So just want to make a remark about the difference between these holomorphic. Between these halomorphic sectors or chiral sector, which is the same, or conformal blocks. These are all different names for the same things. So, and the kind of true conformal field theory, that's the WZW, where you have variables GZ bar and fields depend on GZ bar. GZ bar. So that theory also can be considered as John-Simon theory, and that's the work of Fuchs. Filter, I forgot. There was a group of people sort of Group of people, sort of. I think I forgot Runkel. No, Schweiger. Schweiger. Schweiger. Sorry. Okay, so anyway, so this full WZW, it's theory in the cylinder where you have Z on one part of the cylinder and Z bar on the other part. Cylinder and a Z-bar on the other part of the cylinder. Inside is topological, so the side of the cylinder doesn't matter. What matters is that kind of in some sense the ZZ bar are connected by infinitesimally small intervals. So, anyway, so that's the difference between this story and this story. So, then, but But but still, there are two somehow there are two disconnected parts. There is one is perturbative path integral, the other part is this combinatorial construction using UQSL2. And the natural conjecture is that it's the same thing. So the true meaning of this conjecture is the following: that the perturbative path integral, if you define it as If you define it as the limit k to infinity, the formal limit with the gauge fixing, with everything, as a TQFT, it coincides with the asymptotical TQFT that you can obtain from our invariance with Turk if you take R to infinity limit and this invariance. So this is still an open problem. Open problem. It's an open problem for certain technical reasons because it's non-trivial how to construct this perturbative path integral for manifolds with boundary, you know, with all the gauge fixing inside and on the boundary. So there has been a lot of progress. So with Catania. We developed a so-called BFV framework, which allows to quantize gauge theories in the presence of boundary for the space-time. And then there was the work of Catania Wernley. I think Paulo and some other people from this group who made very important progress in quantizing Chern-Simons theory for meaningful Swiss boundary, perturbatively quantized. And actually, it's very interesting, it's not churn-simons, it's so called split channel signs that is very Is very natural to quantize. And split transients is the transience with the group that is G cross H that's locally can be written as G plus cross G minus to barrel plus cross barrel minus. And that's exactly what you have in the quantum double construction. So I'm saying all this as simply the Simply, the arguments that this story, the semi-simple story, is not so simple, is not so semi-simple. It's actually quite complicated if you will take into account all these isymptological problems. Not just theory for non-perturbative theory for finite k okay, so then there is another problem. So you see, it was very important that here Q is specifically e to the i pi over r. In other words, it's the unitary case. It's the case that corresponds to really to the wzw at the integer level k. Now, if m is not equal to 1, it turns out that the story is quite different. Although it, you know, if... Although it, you know, if you consider the combinatorial version of this invariance, the story looks the same because it's algebraic and q, so it doesn't matter what q is. But as you start to analyze the asymptotical behaviors, r goes to infinity, these are different stories. So, in particular, it was found in the works of Chen Yang Murakami. Young Morakami, and actually, these works are based on previous works, in particular by Francois Constantina. So these people, they found that if you take the asymptotical behavior of the simplest invariant, take Q6J symbol, that's the invariant of the handle body of genus 3. In this TQFT framework, you expect some kind of semi-classical behavior for all Ms, for all M, some kind of behavior of semi-classical type that you have for M equals one, but it's not true. In this case, the asymptotical behavior is more like the hyperbolic. Hyperbolic volume conjecture. So the invariant is not behaving oscillatory, it's behaving as a power of certain thing. It's basically behaving like e to the r and then something that's volume of something. It's a long story to say exactly volume of what. So it's a totally different type of. So, it's a totally different type of behavior. So, okay, so then the non-conjectual part is that the WZWCFT of level K corresponds to this modular category. That's a well-known fact. And then we have questions. So what is the So what is the conformal field theory corresponding to? So now I'm talking about the boundary of TQFT, so what happened to the boundary? So what is the conformal field theory corresponding to all UQSL2 modules? Not just the category that's our favorite MTC, that's quotient of tiltings or projectives. So the answer The answer is that this should be triplets. The story goes back to the work of Fagin, Chipunin, Genujinov, and others. And so then the question is: what is the conformal field theory, if there is any, corresponding to just tilting modules? Not all. Not all finite dimensional UK cycle models. So, what is Vague and specimistic, I think, but still I will raise these questions, whether there are any CFTs corresponding to these subcategories. So, and of course, if there are any, then they would be logarithmic. So, So now we're talking about logarithmic extensions of CFTs corresponding to semi-simple categories. And then actually there are two stories. So there is a story that can be called local in the sense that only the brain group is involved. That's the story for That's the story for surfaces with punctures. So here we have only braiding. And then there is a. So basically, I'm reciting secretly the work of Moore and Seiberg, where all these braiding fusion relations were written carefully. So here it's only braiding. Here is the Brading fusion. Breathing fusion, they kind of interact with each other. So, the important part of this theory is sigma one more particular. So, in some sense, it's reasonable to ask these questions separately. And it could be that some extensions exist for genus zero, but Genus zero, but they may not exist for higher genuses. So let's focus on the spheroids and punctures. So we know from Kinshni Zomalochikov that WZW can form out blocks. And now I'm talking about the usual WZW. K is, I already wrote it here. K is non-negative integer. Non-negative integer, and we are interested in truly unconformal blocks corresponding to this unitary conformal field theory. So, whatever Q we will have, it will have to be this one, k plus 2. So, these conformal blocks are algebraic solutions to KZ equation. So, So, not all solutions, but certain subspace of solutions, which is this subspace of solutions, is exactly the Berlinde space in this case. So, here solutions, they are elements of the tensor product VL1, VLM. So, describing relation functions of primary fields or matrix elements of corresponding vertex separators or representations of the Representations of the corresponding vertex separator algebra, but all these L's, they should be between zero and k, where k is the level. So here the residues are just so-called mixed casimirs. And the question is, but now, so this is something that every high school students now know. Every high school student now knows this story you can obtain various integral representations for the basis of solutions for this particular for the for the for the basis of solutions in this particular space of solutions and i'm emphasizing that these are not all solutions the dimension of the galinde space is not equal to the so the dimension Is not equal to the product of dimensions of these spaces. It's smaller than this, typically, Li. So the first question here, and I know it's and it seems like it's still not settled, which can formulate theories on surfaces with unpunctures. On surfaces within functions, correspond to other solutions rather than those that are in the Linda space and to other values of Li, because nobody said that we shouldn't consider these differential equations for other values of Li. We can consider them. There will be plenty of solutions, much more than the dimension of the Berlin space. And the question is, what is the kind of What is the kind of conformal theory framework for this? And another question that's related to this one and clarifies the structure of this space is the following. If we will take k-generic and consider the basis of solutions there, the basis of solutions is well known. It's given by multiple integrals. These are so-called generalized hyper-geometric functions. And the question is, what happened? And the question is: what happens to these solutions if k goes to the integer? If k is approaching to the integral, to the integer. So, and can we analyze all solutions and can we organize them in a good way? So, this is something that, I mean, I hope it hasn't been done because it's a work in progress by Fagin, Gukov, and myself. So that's So that's one of the, and of course, these theories, I mean, there is no way they will be algebraic, so they will be organic. So they probably are related to some ogarithmic vertex separator algebras, but that will be completely clear if this when these questions will be clarified. And then there is a similar, I mean, there is a related question. I mean, there is a related question, a similar question, rather. Okay, what can we say about the space of solutions to the Knussian eczemological equation when the level is rational? There are results in this direction, but I think there are still many open questions about this. And again, the same thing, one should analyze the way how the one way to answer this question. One way to answer this question is to analyze precisely how the spacer solutions behave when you go from generic value to the rational value. So this is all we're trying to do this, but I mean, if somebody knows that this is already well known. What kind of quantum field theory quantum topological field theory? Cody, your your connection got interrupted for half a minute. Could you please recall what you Could you please recall what you could just when I oh okay just when you started with chapter D, I think okay so I just said that the question is what is the topological quantum field theory in the sense of say how Witten constructed quantum transmit theory? What is the counterpart to this for Turin-Firo invariance? So the answer is The answer is this is so-called BF plus B cube theory. This is a very interesting topological, it's a classical topological field theory with two sets of fields B, which is a one-form G-valued Lie algebra value with one form on the manifold, and as in Schun-Simon's connection. Connection. So then the action is, I mean, the name of this, it's not Batellium Fratkin plus Batellium cubed or anything like this. This is just really the field B times the curvature of A plus B cubed. That's the structure of the action. So you can have it only You can have it only in 3D. The BF theory, it's a topological field theory, well known, it gives some kind of interesting torsions, but it exists in all dimensions. But only in three-dimensional case, you can add a cubed of one form to the action, and you have this theory. And actually, the sign plus and minus, they are important, they are different. The corresponding theories are different. The corresponding theories are different. Just I'll say what it means in a second. So, here you see, if you look at this theory, the obvious gauge theory is just usual gauge transformations of the connection and of B field. It looks at first that there are no other gauge symmetries. But then there is a miracle. So for the plus. Uh so for the plus sign, this BF theory actually can be written as the difference of two uh Chern-Simons theories, so it's the same manifold in one case for the first one it's a plus b you see when you add the connection in one form you get the connection so this is a connection when you subscribe i mean it doesn't matter whether you add or subtract it's still a add or subtract it's still a connection so so so as a classical theory uh this b of plus b cubed theory in this case is just the difference of two churn sement theories with independent fields say a prime and a double prime if the sign is negative then the bf theory is the imaginary part of the complex transign theory A complex transcendence theory. And you can see why it's remarkable because the gauge group here is the gauge group for transcendence times the gauge group for transients. I mean, it's only manifold with opposite orientation, but it doesn't matter. So in our case, it's SU2, SU2 and it's And it's say if M is closed, then these are just maps from M to this group. And in this case, instead of SU2 plus SU2, you have SL2C. So these theories are very different. And similar to Chen-Simons, one can conjecture that for plus, we have the Tura F 0 in V. Vero invariant, or more precisely, that if you take the semi-classical formal asymptotic of the BF plus B cubed theory, then you get the asymptotic behavior of torre F hero as r goes to infinity. So to see directly is what Directly would be quite remarkable. I think it's an open problem. Although it's clear that it should work, but still, how to do it, it's an open problem. So then the same questions about various non-semise simple extensions as for Chinese theory. The boundary conformal field theory for Tora Ferro is some kind of doubling of chiral WGW for plus and some kind of For plus, and some kind of conformal, I mean, probably complex WZW for minus. But correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is still a big question how these things work, what they are. So the other big question is: what is the combinatorial TQFT corresponding to the mind sign or to the To the quantum complex transignant theory. So, for the, I mean, there are some nice works on quantization of complex transmit theory done by Bukov, Witten and other people. So, the question is: we already know that something very funny happens for, say, our invariant to arrive when. Uh, derived when r goes to infinity, but m is not equal to one for the non-unitary case. And the very naive question is: is it possible that by some miracle complex transience theory is related to the to refer for this variance of q or to not to turan zero but to our invariance. I think these are all. Invariants, I think these are all open questions with natural conjectures, but still open questions. So, so yeah. Sorry to interrupt. Answer to your minus sign, CFT. So at least part of that, I think, is known now. It depends what the integer level is. There are two level parameters involved in complex turn assignments. There's a continuous one and a quantized one. When the quantized one is equal to one, I think one ends up with Liouville on the boundary. And for higher ones, there's some sort of extension of LiVo by parafermion. Something that I think is relevant. But anyway, there have been papers in the last five, ten years discussing these boundaries. I know. But yes, but it would be nice to have a kind of complete understanding of this. Yes, there are these beautiful things. For example, there are these papers by Anderson Kashayev. There are similar results by you. Similar results by you, by the group of people around you. And do you feel that there is a place where it can be, yeah, I would need to look. But maybe I should also say the final word has not really been written on this either, as you're saying. And the answer may also not be unique. There may be multiple boundary conditions supporting multiple. Multiple choices for these PLAs. Okay. Well, can I assign you to these problems? Sure. Thank you. Thank you for coming. It would be nice to have some kind of comprehensive. Uh uh understanding of this and Jurg. I forgot to mention you no well I don't deserve to be mentioned but but but but you mentioned the idea to approach this uh by starting off with generic level and then taking limits of solutions to KZ and so on. So, what do you think of H3 plus Western Witten for the minus story? Sorry, can you say it again? There's a complex version of Trends of Wesserman-Witten, which is the Wesserman-Witten for hyperbolic three-space as a target. And there, well, you have, okay, first you can have level generic and you can have solutions to KZ for generic values of all the labels. And of course, I mean. Of course, I mean, nobody ever worked this out. I played a little bit a long time ago, but of course, very interesting things happen if you then specialize the level to rational and furthermore, then of course, representation labels to integers, then of course a lot of interesting things happen. But in some sense, there is a mother theory which should, in a sense, know about all this by its analytic structure, and that would be H3 Wesman-Witten. H3 was Mino Witten. Yes, I completely agree with all this. The problem is that I think it's all kind of people think about it, but I don't know. There are things to be done for sure. No question. Exactly. Yeah, to Tudor and York, I want to mention that Kolli probably means connecting this to invariants of closed three manifolds in a TQFT type fashion so that all pieces fit. Fashion so that all pieces fit together. Okay, so I don't know how much time do I have? Minus five minutes. Oh, okay. So I'll just briefly say what I wanted to talk about, but I will not abuse the time. So there is a beautiful story about quantum groups. Is a beautiful story about quantum groups. You see, I only mentioned so for a quantum group, small quantum group, but there is UQ for generic value of quantization parameter. And algebraically, it's an algebra of rational functions in a formal variable v, invertible formal variable v. And then when you want to specialize v to roots of unity, V to roots of unice, we don't want to have denominators, so we have we want to have so-called integral forms. And then there are two well-known forms: the divided powers, loustic form, when you define these elements. And then beautifully, it turns out that there is a these elements they generate a sub-algebra in this algebra over rational. Rational functions in V. And this subalgebra is over the integer Laurent polynomials in V. So here there are no denominators, you can specialize it to root of unity, and that's why it's so important. It turns out that, well, yes, and then the other extreme is when you don't divide by k factorials, but you multiply by the minus v inverse, then you get rid of this denominator. And then you have another integer form, that's so-called the Cancini cuts. And then it turns out that there is a whole spectrum in between. So we described this whole spectrum in between with Henning Anderson in 2015, never published it. And now I feel that it's actually quite important. So it will be soon published, especially. It will be soon published, especially since both of us are in China and you know it's a small country. So I'm sure we'll get together soon and we'll complete this. So specialization to roots of unity, this is what I wanted to discuss. So that's one story. That's the kind of the opposite story. That's an interesting story that's sort of in between. And then I will finish this talk here. Thank you very much, Paul. There are many things that I wanted to say, but I didn't. But I'll say about this some other time. Actually, we have a discussion session this afternoon, but I guess that's way too late for you. But yeah, anyway, thank you very much for all the nice insights. We can still ask a few questions. Hi, I was thinking maybe I could make some comments about, because you were asking questions about something like a CFT at level K that includes these extra KZ solutions. Extra KZ solutions, probably is possible to do something like that with the universal affine VOA. The modular tensor category comes from a simple quotient, but we also have a non-simple VOA at this level that has a lot more modules. Probably we can get a braided tensor category for this, but it would not be rigid. That's possible. But then, then also we can discuss this. I mean, I'll be very happy to discuss. Yes, maybe, yes, maybe we can discuss this. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, I didn't really think of it. Well, actually, I did. So the VOA aspects are quite interesting. To me, it's the question about special organizations and special Bosonizations and special bosophyll kind of bosonization of modules so we'll find SL2 add. So basically, this is Bodias and with Sergei. Right. For the M over R levels also, we have these nice affine VOAs at municipal levels. And we certainly for SL2 at least, we have some mod we have modular tensor categories. That's Thomas and Zino. Thomas and Sinwe and H.O. Huang. And probably be easy to get a Kaushi and listig equivalence with the quantum group, at least for SL2. Probably it's easy. I don't know if Thomas or someone else is working on that. I don't know. Well, for SL2, you get this from Kashtan Bensel more or less for free. But I should point out that in that case, you have braided fusion categories and you have to. Fusion categories, and you have to have a 50% chance to get the modular tensor category. So they are quite often actually degenerate. But I think really the interesting question in that case is also what does one get if one extends to the category that David has described in his talk, to all the relaxed modules. So this means one allows SL2 modules that have infinite-dimensional That comes from infinite dimensional SF2 representations, etc. And actually, let me say, I think David and Shashank Kanada are working on
