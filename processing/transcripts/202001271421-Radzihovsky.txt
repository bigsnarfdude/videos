So I want to tell you about some work that I've been doing with a very talented student in Boulder, Zhang Tengzai, on quantum smectic and restricted mobility of the quantum smectic in relation to fractant phases. It's sort of an attempt to try to get more mileage out of the elasticity, tensor gauge theories or vector gauge theory, duality. Gauge theories or vector gauge theory, duality that is a kind of a root to facton or restrictive mobility gauge theories. So I'm going to quickly just remind you about duality between crystal elasticity and tensor gauge theories that you undoubtedly have heard about. Work with Michael Pretko that appeared in a couple of PRLs and then a long article. And then, so here I'm just going to state the result and then I'm going to. State the result, and then I'm going to tell you maybe somewhat less familiar work that Mike Hermley and I have been doing, and it's on relation of fractons to vector gauge theory. So relation of fractons and vector gauge theory is something much more familiar and closer to the conventional gauge theories of spin liquids. But the main part of the talk that I want to focus on, building on this, is tell you about the Tell you about that when you melt a crystal order into something like a smectic, you still get some vestige of restricted mobility. And you get an interesting gauge theory that's very closely related to this gauge theory, sorry, to this gauge theory that's connected to the restricted mobility of disclinations in the quantum smectic. And I will tell you various routes to getting to this. You various routes to getting to this thing. So, just, you know, there's various, there's an ever-exploding set of models that describe, that exhibit fracton order. But, you know, the route that I'm going to take, and I'm going to focus on these U1 gapless tensor gauge theories or gauge theories in general that exhibit some form of fractal order in the sense of. That order in the sense of they have charges that are immobile, and undoubtedly you are familiar with this. So you generalize conventional gauge theories to a tensor gauge theories. I'm focusing here on two plus one dimension, where you can do the duality. Then these guys are symmetric straight gauge field, and it's canonically conjugate electric field. The key ingredient that makes this into a fracton theory is the Into fractant theory is the, again, looking at the scalar charge theory is this double divergence Gauss's law. And, you know, as pointed out by Michael in 2016, Michael Pretko in 2016, this Gauss's law encodes not just the conservation of charges, but also conservation of dipoles, and that's at the heart of how this kind of a tensor gauge theory encodes fractal phenomenology. Basically, if you want to move a Basically, if you want to move a charge in this theory, you have to create a dipole. But dipoles are conserved, so you can't. Well, sorry, if you want to move, a motion of a charge corresponds to creation of a dipole. So if you dipoles are conserved, so then you can't move a charge. You can move it off shell by creating a gapped dipole to cancel out a dipole corresponding to this motion of the charge. Charge. On the other hand, dipoles in this theory could have some restricted mobility, depends on some more details of these tensor gauge theories. They're not completely fractonic, but they have the constrained mobility. And sort of with Michael looking at, you know, one thing we appreciated is that topological defects, in particular disclinations in a crystal, of course, have very similar. Have very similar immobility that the fractons and the extensive gauge theories have. And in fact, there's a complete mapping between disclinations in the two-dimensional crystal, two-plus-one-dimensional crystal, and fractons in the extensive gauge theory, where the topological definition of the disclination charge corresponds to, after some epsilon symbol, 90-degree rotation of this. So, this is sort of a double curl. So, this is sort of a double curl, and this is double divergence, but other than that, cosmetic difference, this just encodes the two corresponding quantities. The dipoles of disclinations is a well-known defect in crystals, is a dislocation, and dislocations in the crystal have a restricted mobility. Without vacancy instead, stitchials, they can glide, but they cannot climb. And that corresponds to some restrictive mobility in the tensor gauge theories, certain kinds of tensor gauge theories. Gauge theories, certain kinds of tensor gauge theories. And so here's the dictionary that we've written down. So that's one approach to this, to establishing this connection. But now once you've established this connection, and in fact going back to even before the sensor gauge theory mapping was done, I first started playing with I first started playing with, in 2016, I started playing with a vector gauge theory connection. And of course, a naive, and the motivation was the vector gauge theories are much more familiar. And in fact, if you think of a crystal and kind of squint your eyes and don't worry about indices too much, you can think of it in a sense that it's very much like an XY model, except you have, let's say, two plus one dimension. You know, let's say two plus one dimension, you have two phonons, ux and uy, or phix and phiy. And so you might think that, you know, that it's actually very, and we know the conventional xy model dualizes to a superconductor or to a gauge theory, where vortices appear as the matter in that gauge theory. And so kind of a, but you know, that doesn't work naively because if you just take a flavored XY models, Flavored XY models where phik would represent two flavors of phonons, it's not going to work because, okay, it just trivially gives you two vector gauge theories, which just the flavor K coming along for the ride, and so that doesn't have any restrictive mobility in its charges. So, why might ask then, how does it, we know that the crystals do have this restricted mobility for its disclinations, so how does that come about? About and the underlying object there is actually a strain tensor UIK and that guy is a symmetrized object. So the Hamiltonian for simplest Hamiltonian for a quantum crystal has kinetic energy and it has a strain, elastic energy, which is the symmetrized strain squared. And so because it's symmetrized, it's really not, it's very, it's quite different from just two decoupled XY models. You can think of it as, if you think of K as the flavor. If you think of K as the flavor, then you can think of that there's a space-spin coupling. You know, the I is the spatial index and K is the flavor, but then here you have also a term where you have a derivative along the flavor of the spatial component. So this is not just decoupled XY models. Thankfully, we know that because it does give you fractal order from the tensic elasticity tensor gauge theory duality. So how do you make progress to try to make it closer to? Make progress to try to make it closer to a vector gauge theory. This pointer web gave out. I do need a pointer. Anybody has a pointer? This is being recorded, so you know I wouldn't be troubled if I dropped it. Okay, good. So the trick is to try to rewrite this theory as something closer to an XY model in terms of unsymmetrized train tens. And this is the way you would do it. You simply, kinetic energy is the same, but what you do is you kind of, you introduce sort of an analog of a Higgs mechanism where you write down unsymmetrized strain and then subtract out the anti-symmetric part. So at low energies, So at low energies, this anti-symmetric strain gets higged out. The anti-symmetric part of the strain gets higged out, and you're back to the symmetrized strain. So this theory is completely equivalent to this theory, where theta physically represents the orientational bond orientational degree of freedom. And so then you have to have some kinetic energy associated with it and some elastic energy. So you can see here, then now you're almost there. Here, then now you're almost there. You have two in the D plus one dimensions, this would be two X D dimensional D flavors of X Y models plus one additional X Y model, and then they're coupled in this funny minimal coupling-like way. And so now you can, since this theory is equivalent to this theory, if you utilize this guy, you're guaranteed to get a theory in which disclinations of the charges will be immobile. Immobile. It will have restricted mobility. And so one might ask: what is this symmetrization? This symmetrization is the really underlying rotational symmetry that you're encoding in the target space. The crystal doesn't have to be rotation invariant in the reference space, but in the target space you can take even an isotropic crystal and rotate the whole thing. And so that corresponds to this transformation, inhomogeneous transformation on the phonon degrees of freedom. 49 degrees of freedom corresponding to this rotation. So, anyway, so you start out with this model and then you turn the crank, and as we have done with Mike Hermale, and you get a gauge theory that looks like this. And now it looks like a flavored vector gauge theory. It looks a lot more familiar. So, there's a there are D plus one or two plus one if I'm working in, so three vector gauge theories, and they're coupled together. So, there's two. They're coupled together. So there's two vector gauge theories labeled by index K, and K can be A and B, or I guess I labeled A and B, or X and Y. Let me call it A and B. So there's two of these guys. And then there's a little vector gauge theory, additional vector gauge theory that has a field E, electric field E, and a vector potential A. And each of these is coupled to their response. These is coupled to their respective currents. And then the coupling is this interesting coupling, which really came from here, from coupling of the theta XY model and the phonon XY model. And this is basically the curl of the little vector potential A is not gauge invariant by itself. So it has to be gauged. So this guy is a two-form, so it has to be gauged by an anti-symmetric component of this. Component of this AIK vector potential, capital A vector potential. And the corresponding Gauss's law that you derive to come from this is that the little electric field, divergence of the little electric field gives you the charges. That's the disclinations in the crystalline language. And then the divergence of the capital electric field is a combination of dislocations that are labeled by index. That are labeled by index k, and then also the components of the electric field, a little electric field. And so, in fact, you see here, you know, the way the fracton order or the fracton restricted mobility on the disclinations, on the charges, is encoded, is that when the charges of the little E-theory move, they generate electric field lines, but those they would have to generate electric field lines. But those electric field lines are themselves charges. themselves charges for the capital electric field, Gauss's law. And so you can't, so that's forbidden by Gauss's law. And so then because of that, little S's, little charges cannot move. And okay, so here's the somewhat modified or extended gauge redundancy of this theory. It's not a usual one, and that's what encodes this at the heart of this fractal order. This fractal order. And you can also see it from the corresponding continuity equation. So the continuity equation for the charges, for the dipole charges flavor K, are violated by the motion of the little charges, of the elementary charges S. So if there's a current of the S charges, little JK is non-zero, and so then it creates, It creates, it acts like a source for the dipoles. So if you have disclinations moving, it generates dislocations. So their conservation is violated. And you can see that by thinking about a crystal dynamics of disclinations of the crystal. Okay, okay, so that's, and so from that, if you know, if the dislocation is a gap, you immediately get that the current of disclinations of the charges of this little gauge theory are. The current must vanish. So you can put this theory on the lattice. It's quite simple. So one way to do this is you think of an underlying lattice that's drawn in gray. And then that's where the electric fields and gauge fields of the little EA theory live. They live in the bonds of this underlying lattice. And then in addition, there's also There's also D flavors, in this case, two flavors of capital E theory. There's an additional lattice, the blue and the red lattice. So E sub A lives on the blue lattice, and E sub B lives on the red lattice, as indicated here. So B is just the flavor, and EX and X and Y are the actual vector components of it. And so that's, you know, and there's a sort of a more lattice version of this. I just didn't want to write. Of this, I just didn't want to write it out. And in fact, so Mike Cromley will be here next, well, I don't know when he's arriving, but I think he's giving a talk on Thursday. So he will talk about connection and this inspiration of this formulation to thinking about fractal orders arising from higher form symmetries and breaking those symmetries. So anyway, so now once you have a theory and you think about it as a crystal, You have a theory and you think about it as a crystal. We know crystal you can melt. The way you melt a crystal is you, for example, I'm buying dislocations, condensed dislocation charges. And so then, you know, it's just a condensation of these dipoles. And what you get is a liquid. But once you get a liquid, it's a special kind of liquid. It's a hexatic liquid because you still have orientational order remaining. But in addition to that, if you have two dislocations, if you have dislocations. Dislocations, if you have dislocations that have proliferated, a pair of them, equal and opposite pair of them, can always make an atom or a vacancy or an interstitial. So as a result, if dislocations condense, then the pair of dislocations have also condensed, and therefore this hexotic phase is necessarily a super hexotic. In other words, not only have you melted a crystal into a hexotic liquid, that liquid is Liquid, that liquid is most condensed. It's a superfluid liquid. Okay, so that's just sort of necessarily. And so you can put in at least kind of a schematic phase diagram with the axis of vortex mobility of the underlying atoms and vortex fugacity and dislocation fugacity. And so in this phase diagram, so here's a convention crystal. When you melt that, well, so that crystal can undergo. Well, so that crystal can undergo if you only condense vacancies and testitials, then you'll go to a supersolid. You'll still have crystal and order, it'll still have fractonic order, but you will now your vacancies and testitials have both condensed. So that's the, so there are two fracton phases that this analysis predicts. One fracton phase, yep. Yeah, go back and go back. Yeah, go back. Go back? Yeah, go back. Yeah. Maybe you can continue later. But so the earlier theory you write down, let's say field theory, maybe two slides earlier, is a symmetric tensor updated and gauge theory coupled to U1 order giving theory. Is that right? Are you talking about this theory? Well, I think of this as three vector gauge theories. Two capital, you know, EA, you know, two capital. You know, EA, you know, two capital ones, EA and EB, and then coupled to the little, you know, the one-mortgage theory, and those guys that are linked together through this coupling. The other advantage of this formulation is that it allows you to see how to go from a fractonic phase to a spin-liquid phase, some kind of a liquid phase, quantum liquid phase in which there's no fracton order. If this, if you confine... If you confine, let's say, little A theory, then you'll get just decoupled XY models and just you will lose this fractal order. So this coupling is important. But so what's your question? So spin nucleus, a U1 gauges theory. The ordinary spin nucleus here is a ordinary U1 gauges theory. Right. And then you have additional three codes of gauges theory that is from the symmetric tensor. Okay. And well if that's right, that is fine. So then the what's the fourth term there? You have a curl A which is anti-symmetric tensor. It's like a magnetic field. Well the capital A actually is a symmetric tensor. Well you can think of this as so you have an anti-symmetry. Well okay I was explicit. I just don't didn't want this equation to grow. This is Z component. So it's a Component, so it's a two plus one dimensional theory. So think of it as curl A dotted into Z, and this is anti-symmetrized. This is in two plus one dimension, this is just Axy minus AYX. Okay, so just the antisymmetrized object. So this Aij is not a symmetric tensor. It's Ai with a flavor J. J, okay? But now what this says is anti-symmetrize over them and subtracted from them a little magnetic field. Okay? Anyway, so you can melt this and then you can melt a super solid into super hexatic and super fluid by cranking up dislocation fugacity. Okay, so that's one way to leave this phase. Oh, yeah, sorry, I was. Oh, yeah, sorry. I was, let me, let me, I was in the middle of just describing that, you know, so this melting or this thinking about vacancy interstitials and their condensation reminds you, or tells you that really you have two fractum phases corresponding to two crystalline phases that we know about. There's a commensurate crystal phase where vacancy testitials are normal, they're gapped, they're in the mod insulating state, and then there's a fracton phase. And then there's a fracton phase in which vacancy tissues are both condensed. So that's the supersolid phase on the crystalline side. And so these fracton phases are distinct. Both of them have charges that are immobile, but the dipoles in this theory are immobile, but dipoles in this theory are actually constrained to move only perpendicular to the dipole. So anyway, so that you get this phase diagram, but there's another way to leave a crystalline phase. Leave a crystal in phase, there's no, you have, in two plus one dimension, you have two types of dislocations. You have the X dislocations, you have the Y dislocations, different dipoles with the X directed dipoles and Y directed dipoles. So two types of dipole charges. So there's no reason why you have to unbind or condense both of them. So imagine you condense only one of them, but not the other. That can happen spontaneously. So let's say if you're in a square lattice, you spontaneously break symmetry. Spontaneously break symmetry and pick one over the other. So you break that discrete symmetry between X and Y. Alternatively, you could have just an isotropic crystal that's not a square crystal. And some X bonds are weaker than the Y bonds. Then necessarily, X dislocations when I bind first, condense first before the Y dislocation. So imagine that scenario. So now you take this quantum crystal. Now, you take this quantum crystal and you melt it by unbinding X dislocations and condensing them. And so, what you'll get is a quantum smectic, which I'll describe in a second. On the other hand, we know, as I just described, this quantum crystal is dual to another description of quantum crystal via this coupled vector gauge theories that I described that has fractal order. Similarly, you can. Order. Similarly, you can now dualize this quantum smectic elasticity and get a vector gauge theory description of the quantum smectic. Alternatively, once you're in this quantum crystal, you have this coupled vector gauge theory. You can have a Higgs transition there where you condense Y dipoles, which corresponds to dislocations, and that Higgs transition will take you from this vector gauge theory of a quantum crystal. This vector gauge theory of a quantum crystal to another vector gauge theory of a quantum symptom. So that's the last part that I want to tell you about. Okay? So there's this sort of, you know, starting with a crystal, you can end up in different places and there's, you know, these two routes to getting to this vector gauge theory of the quantum symctic. And the punchline will be: this guy has some mobility constraints. Mobility constraints on its topological defects. And if you're wondering how the vector gauge theory is related to tensor gauge theories, tensor gauge theories are kind of a low energy limit of these vector gauge theories. But they're completely equivalent at low energies. So, okay, so to give you a little bit more technical details, you start out with a quantum crystal like this, uij squared plus pi squared. So here it is. And then what you do. Here it is, and then what you do is you condense X dislocations or Y dipoles, and as I said, just like you get a super hexatic if you condense all dislocations, you get a super smactic for the same reason if you condense just the X dislocations. So here the X dislocations with the Burgess vector in the X direction indicated by these nails. So now you have liquid order. It's periodic in this direction, but it's liquid in this direction. So there's no shear modulus. So there's no shear modulus, there's no longer shear modules across layers. And then, you know, in principle, this is something we're studying as well, you can then further condense Y dislocations, and then you'll get the quantum pneumatic. Okay, and you can think about that state. But let me tell you about supersmectic. So if you take this theory of a crystal, there's a very standard way you can You can add to it dislocations on the crystal side, on the elasticity side, and condense them, you know, proliferate them in a very similar way you would proliferate vortices in an XY model. And then you can ask what phase do you get. So if you add dislocations to this with finite fugacity and allow it to unbind, what you get is a smectic, a quantum smectic, which has this Lagrangian. So again, it's a So again, it's a gradient of uy. So there's only uy degree of freedom because you killed the ux degree of freedom because it's liquid in the x direction. So you have a gradient uy and it's coupled to this bond angle, theta, that corresponds to orientation of the layers. So it's very similar to the vector, sort of this XY coupled XY model reformulation of crystal, except now I'm doing Of crystal, except now I'm doing it for smectic, and it comes directly from this theory. So then theta is the spawn angle, and it has some elasticity, some stiffness. This is sort of an orientational stiffness between different, you know, across, you know, as a function of space. Then there's a kinetic energy for the phonons in the y direction. There's a kinetic and orientational kinetic energy, angular momentum squared. And then there's a superfluid component, because as I said, when you unbind dislocations, you'll get. Dislocation, you'll get a liquid, condensed liquid of vacus interstitial. So there's just an XY model of just bosons that are both condensed. Okay. So now let me focus. So here it is. And so now, again, you turn the crank, you can just dualize it using standard methods. And what you get is you get a U1 vector gauge theory, which looks like this. So it's kind of very reminiscent of the vector gauge theory. Of the vector gauge theory, flavored vector gauge theory that I got for a crystal, except now there's no flavor. There's only two, there's a capital E and A, and there's a little E and A, and they're coupled in this funny way, but there's only one E and A, capital E and capital A. There's a Gauss's law, but only now the X component of the literal electric field enters the Gauss's law of the capital E field. Well, before there were both components. Before there were both components, corresponding to two flavors. There's a gauge redundancy that you can track through. And now, when you derive the continuity equation, you see that only the X component of the current of these charges, of the disclinations, that vanishes. The other one is free. So you can try to interpret that or understand that that's kind of a power of elasticity theory, is that Of elasticity theory is that you can kind of look at real space pictures and think about what is this constraint and why are these charges, certain kinds of charges that cannot move or constrain to move in a certain way. So this is a picture of a smectic where I added a minus and plus charge, namely I added this dipole P. And or equivalently, it's a dislocation of charge five layers. Five layers, five layers thick. So now imagine I wanted to, and the reason I'm not focused, I'm not drawing one disclination like plus, is because then it will screw up the layers completely, so then it's difficult to visualize. So imagine this was gone, and I drew this, then the layers would be going vertically here. So it's just nicer to think of a dipole and trying to have one part of that dipole move. Okay? So imagine. Move. Okay, so imagine I move the plus defect. So if I move it over like this, now you see, it seems like it's just a single hop by a couple of lattice spaces, lattice constants of the layers, couple of layers, distance of a couple, few layers, from five layers to nine layers. But what you see here, that requires an introduction of extra four layers of atoms. Atoms. And so that's a very non-local process in terms of the original atoms. And so there's no way to have that operator in the Hamiltonian. If you require the Hamiltonian, it has to be local in terms of the atoms. And so this is forbidden. And that's why that current, that's why current here vanishes in the x direction along the layers. On the other hand, motion in the y direction is not a problem. And you can preserve the strength of the dislocation so this vector can rotate as long as its x component remains the same, because that's the only part that's conserved. Okay, so that's okay, so that's part of the phase part of the path where I take the crystal, I melt it into a smectic, and then I dualize the smectic into this vector, two ve uh two coupled vector gauge theories. Two coupled vector gauge theories. But alternatively, I could take the, let me go back to this picture. I should have. Yeah. Alternatively, I could have, so I went this way and then that way. Alternatively, I could take the vector gauge theory of the crystal and then Hick the Y dipoles in it. And see, you know, I better get the same answer. And just for consistency, indeed, you do. And it's much simpler actually. When do I stop? I have three minutes left. That's all I need. So start with a crystal, gauge dual of the crystal that I introduced on the second slide. Here it is. Two flavored vector gauge theories plus one more gauge theory. And they're coupled together by this funny two-form minimal coupling. But then write down an equivalent version of it. Equivalent version of it, sort of a quantum Ginzburg-Landau equation, where these dislocate. So JB represents currents of dislocations in the X and the Y direction, or currents of dipoles, and this represents currents of charges, the little J. So if I want to condense dislocations of dipoles, I'll just right explicitly introduce a quantum field, JK, which represents. JK, which represents a creation of a X-dipole or a Y-dipole. That's what the K is. And so it'll be minimally coupled to this vector potential. So that's how I know from this coupling, I know how to do this. And there's some potential there. Plus, there's a maximal term, which is all this stuff. Okay? This stuff is just represented by this minimal coupling plus the potential for psi. And so now all I do is just the allow. The allow one of the psi's or both of the psi's, but for the smectic, I'll allow one of the psi, psi sub y to condense. The y dipoles will condense, and that will get me to a quantum spectric. So psi sub y will be non-zero, psi sub x is zero, and you can see what it does is just Higgses out the y flavor of the vector potential. And then you immediately get this theory, which is the gauge dual of this quantum smectic. Okay, so with this, let's. Okay, so with this, let me just summarize. So I remind you about the fractal and elasticity duality via the path of tensor gauge theories, connection to tensor gauge theories. I talked about thinking about melting this guy isotropically into hexatic and superhexatic and various other phases. But then I talked about anisotropic melting of a quantum crystal into. Of a quantum crystal into a quantum smectic. And then there's a route to a corresponding gauge theory, vector gauge theory, either by a Hicks mechanism or by dualizing. And what you get is you go from a quantum crystal to quantum smectic, and you end up here, and that gives you kind of an interesting vector gauge data that does have constrained mobility for its charges. So, with this, let me. So, with this, let me thank you and close. Did you try to do Higgs mechanism with this theory that Michael rose, which is a heigenominia you know, force or theory of uh with global symmetry at the different sort of spectrum? Okay, so the short answer is no, I haven't tried because it was so complicated. Do you think it's equivalent to the type of equation that you were writing? It's a good question. That's something I have not checked. Just I was intimidated by the theory that Michael wrote down. So I didn't want to. This is just so much more standard going through the vector gauge theory. Just very familiar. At some point, he wrote Higgs mechanism and he wrote Ferdinand or Psycho. Right. So that's that theory that's called. So does that theory is global you know global symmetry that concerns that it does have that it does have that symmetry then why does it multiply theorem? Question to both of you actually this is something to discuss online so I I don't know we should you know we're We should, you know, we're, you know, I know him actually, and so we're in the same picture. I have a very naive view. So, in a lot of series that let's say micro, track or write-on, there's a hidden disquiet symmetry. It's not quite Hidden discrete symmetry. It's not quite hidden, but people don't pay much attention. There's a discrete charge conjugation or particle hole symmetry. That means that when I have a scalar field phi, I transform this field to an anti-particle field, to phi dagger. What is phi in this context? When you have a fractal matter field theory. So, but phi is the matter field or the matter field. Okay. Then, if I have a gauge field. Then, if I have a gauge field, like your case, there is also such symmetry, which will flip the gauge field A to minus A. So, is that symmetry manifest in all your setup? If you, let's just write down Lagrange for your theory, and let's send A to minus A. Well, electric field say E to minus E. So you see there is such symmetric global symmetry there. Oops. Okay, so I haven't thought about that. I wasn't aware of it. And then you have to flip all the A's and it's for this one as well. Oh, so then, well then I think the charge or the current also flips, I suppose. So the comment I was going to make is that in micro Pracle theory is that that symmetry Is that that symmetry will not commute with the U1 symmetry? I said you want ordinary symmetry or you want vector symmetry or you want polynomial symmetry. You'll simultaneously gauge both of them. That's a simplest prescription, simplest method to get the non-avarian theory. So there's a simple way to get non-avarium theory by getting this. I suppose this can also work. This kind of works. If that symmetry is there, then gauge that work. And maintain the same gauge field that you write down, but couple to a Z2 chart can't be no gauge field. You get a non-valued field. Okay, I wasn't aware of that symmetry, so I'm just one comment. So thank you for that comment, yeah. I have a lady, I have a question. So if you if you are in the quantum semantic phase, so how do you how do you probe experimentally, so to speak, how do you probe the fractonic nature of the elementary activity? Of the aluminium? You know, that I can ask that question to everybody in the thought of. So, I mean, this is elastic theory. No, okay, so I mean, there's a little bit more seriously, you know, if you really, you know, so there are a number of candidates or there are a number of realizations of quantum smectic order, like Eisenstein's, for example. I mean, there's a difference that this is. I mean, there's not really a difference. This is high, partially filled, high Landau level. I mean, there's an issue there with the magnetic field, so you have to do the time-reversal broken version of this, which we have done for the crystal at least, but not for the smectic. But so, in principle, a system like that, and there are other systems, but in principle, that's one example. You know, you can, I don't know how, well, okay, I don't, it's in. It's in classical smectics, it's easy to visualize them, it's easy to image them. I don't know how you would image, most of the probes are indirect. You do transport, for example, or noise. But if you could visualize the defects, then it's a statement about that the charge of this dipole doesn't fluctuate. It's really a statement about. It's really a statement about kind of a squeezing of the fluctuations of this dipole moment. It's conserved. But if this was a classical phenomenon, then you literally can image dysmetics as my colleague Noel Clark does. And in fact, I'm in discussions with him, because you can ask about classical restricted dynamics or suppressed dynamics. And the statement is that this process would be suppressed, that's it.

Yeah, we can press the button. Okay, so.
