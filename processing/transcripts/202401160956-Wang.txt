Thanks for the introduction and thanks very much for the invitation from the organizing committee. It is my privilege to give a presentation at the BIRS. I will talk about within the programs unknown self-joint quasi-periodic operators. The main object in this talk is quasi-periodic shooting operators. Quasi-periodic shooting operators, which is denoted by H. The self-adjoint shooting operators is a linear and bounded operator defined on L2Z, and it is defined as follows. HUN equals Un plus 1 plus UN minus 1 and plus VX plus another times UN. The first part is called the discrete Laplace and the second part is the potential. The second part is the potential, which is a multi-plocation operator. x is the parameter called the phase, and alpha is a frequency satisfy rationally independent, and v is a real-valued function. There are two ways to produce non-self-adjoint shorting operators. The first way is to replace the real-valued potential with the complex-valued potential. For example, For example, if V is real analytic, we complexify the phase so that the potential will not keep real anymore. Then we get a special kind of non-serve joint steering operator. The second way is to replace the discrete Laplace by adding some metric of in parameter. For example, we let G be positive, then we consider the following operator, h u n equals HUN equals exponential t times u n plus 1 plus exponential negative t times u n minus 1 then plus the potential charge. This operator is called the Hatano-Nielsen model, which I will explain in a moment. So combine these two ways, non-service models will join the study. So generally speaking, many properties of non-self joint operators Non-self-joint operators are different from those of the self-adjoint operator. So I list these comparisons here. By the way, in physics, self-adjoint means Hermitian and non-self-adjoint means non-Hermitian. For the Hermitian operator, the spectrum is real, and people can define its spectrum measure, which can be decomposed as absolutely continuous component. Absolutely continuous component, singular continuous component, and a few-point components. However, for non-formation operators, the spectrum might be complex, and there might be no hope to define the spectrum meta-normal decomposition. The motivation of the study of the non-soft joint operator comes from two aspects. On the one hand, for mathematics, this kind of operator is useful. This kind of operator is useful because it was the use of the complex potential that Availa developed the global theory of passive periodic shielding operator. But on the other hand, for non-Hermitian physics, people are concerned about real complex spectrum transitions as the parameter variance. A special kind of complex potential is called the PT symmetry potential. Is called the PT symmetry potential. That is, parented time involving symmetry. This kind of potential was proposed by Bender and Portuguese in 1998. So to put it simply, in the quasi-periodic case, if the potential V is the PD symmetry potential, that means the real part of V is the event function, and the imaginary part of V is an. Imaginary part of V is an odd function. So, in New Hampshire physics, the reason why people are concerned about this kind of potentials is that this kind of potential has many properties similar to those of the self-projoint operator, such as PD symmetry potential might have real spectrum and PD symmetry modification of the traditional quantum mechanics. The traditional quantum mechanics is considered as observable as Hermitian operators. Here are some examples of P D symmetry potentials. The first example is the cosine function with the complex phi phase where epsilon is non-zero. The second example is the exponential function where the coupling constant is non-zero. Now, the question is. Now the question is how to study the non-set of the joint operators. Recall that the spectrum of the operator is defined as the set of E such that H minus E does not have a bounded inverse. And we denote the spectrum by sigma. And we can treat the Schoeninger operator as an infinity dimensional matrix, where the the diagonal is the potential and the the odd diagonal is one. And the off-diagonal is one. So, by the definition of the spectrum, to know what the spectrum of the shooting operator is, we need to check whether the inverse of H minus E exist, which is not easy to calculate generally. So, let's start with finite-dimensional matrix. We truncate the operator that is such an m by n matrix. Such an n by n matrix, which is denoted by Hn. And we require this matrix satisfy differential boundary condition or open boundary condition. That is, the upper right corner and the lower left corner of the matrix takes the value zero. We need to use an important topological index called the winding number. Called the winding number. This index is useful because the topological phase transitions can be detected by detecting the variation of the topological winding number. There are two winding numbers, nu plus and nu minus. Nu plus is called the right winding number and nu minus is the left winding number. One number. This index is defined as the limit of μn and ν is defined in this way. We fix the energy, then we complex by the fix, then we calculate the determinate of Hn minus E. Then we take the log then, then we take the derivative and integrate it. Finally, we divide it by n. By n. Although the definition of the topological winding number is a bit complicated, but it has a very intuitive explanation from the perspective of the physics. If we rewrite the determinant as the equivalent form, the nu n can be reduced to this formula, where arg ej minus e is the argument of is the argument of the complex energy E j minus E. So by this formula, we can see that Un gives the number of the times that the complex energies surround E. So here I draw a diagram. At this point, the winding number is 2. So why do we need two winding numbers, nu plus and ν minus? Because if E falls exactly in the spectrum, we can In the spectrum, we can approach it from two sides of the scope. So, naturally, there will be two winding numbers. It was proved in the physics that the winding number is always an integer. So, our question is: Is there any mathematical explanation? Here is the result. It was observed by Liu. By Liu Zhou Cheng in a PRB paper, that the topological winding number is just the acceleration in Avella's global theory of the one frequency plus a periodic shooting operator. Although the proof is not rigorous and only at the physical level, later we give a regular proof in the other paper. So before I introduce the definition of the acceleration Definition of the acceleration. Let me introduce some general notions quickly. We suppose the potential is a complex value and t is a map from x to x. Then we get a family of dynamical defined Schuling operator. And it is defined as H Un equals Un plus 1 plus Un minus 1 plus V T N x times Un. times Un. And for any formal solution of eigenfunction equation, we get a discrete dynamical system which is called the Schrödinger cocycle. Because the potential is complex value, so the cosycle belongs to SL2C, not SL2R. Once we have the Schuling of Cocycle, we can define its neoplaton. Can define its Niaplum exponent. We fix the energy E and multiply the following matrices together and we denote it by ANX. ANX is called the transform matrix. Then we calculate the norm of the transform matrix, then take the logium, then integrate it, then divide it by n. Finally, we take the limit, and this limit is called the Nyapom exponent. The Approbe exponent. The appropriate exponent is the important index in dynamic systems which describe the growth of the transfer matrix. Now let's give the definition of the acceleration. We define the complexified Niaplo exponent in a similar way, just as before. Then the acceleration is defined as the right derivative and the left derivative. And the left derivative of the Lyapunov exponent to the complex phase. In his paper, Avela defined the acceleration as a right derivative. However, the left derivative is also well defined, and it is very convenient for us to use these two derivatives at the same time. I will prove that the Neapolitan exponent is piecewise linear and convex. Linear and a convex function to the convex phase, and the acceleration is always an integer. Based on our result, suppose that the frequency is rationally independent and the frequency and that potential is complex analogic. In the positive neopropy exponent region, the topological. The topological winding number equals the acceleration. Note that the winding number is the topological index and the acceleration is the dynamical index. So this theorem proves that these two kinds of indexes are equivalent. As a colliery, we can give the asymptotic distribution of the asymptotic distribution of the zeros of the determinate in the annulus. So to explain it clearly, we use AR1R2 to represent the annulus whose inner radius is R1 and the outer radius is R2. And we use NR1R2 to represent the number of the zeros of the determinate in this annulus. In this annulus. Here is the result. Suppose that the frequency is rational independent and the potential is complex analytic. In the positive Nyapomic exponent region, the number of the zeros in the angles divided by n converges to a limit. This limit is the difference of the winding numbers in the inner boundary and the outer boundary of the n. And the outbound of the angular. So the winding numbers describe the average distributions of the zeros in the angles. I should mention that Herand Schlark showed this result for strong Diefante frequency. Obviously, the determinate is the polynomial to E of degree N if the potential is analytic. This determinate is also an analytic function with two variables. So we can discuss the asymptotic distribution of the belows to x and e at the sum time. We have already given the distribution of the phase by winding numbers before. So in the following, we will focus on the distribution of the energy. One can imagine that just One can imagine that just as in the self-joint case, the distribution of the energy is related to the density of states. Moreover, we will give the connection between these two kinds of distributions. Now, let's study the distribution of the energy. Suppose that Ej are the zeros of the determinate. With these zeros, we can define a measure, d. Define a measure DNA which is supported by these zeros. Here data Ej is a direct measure supported by EJ. And the weight of each data Ej is 1 over n. So this measure DNN is a normalized eigenvalue counting measure. Abra and Simon in 1983 brought the following example. ETS3 proves the following result. If the planjel is a real value, then for almost every x, this normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges to a limit measure, dn. As the dimension of matrix goes to infinity, where dn is called the density of states. And they also proved the Solis formula. The Solis formula showed that the Neapolitan exponent That the Neoplomic exponent can be written as the convolution of the Logan function and the density of state. We shall note that the existence of the density of state and the solace formula was only proved for the real-valued potential. So we can ask for the non-self-joint operator, does the density of state also exist? To state the result, we let dm be the two-dimensional Love measure, and we denote as a C the level set of the near-love exponent such that it equals C. Now, here is the result. Let the potential be a complex analytic and the frequency is rationally independent, and we assume. And we assume the two-dimensional Bay measure of C0 is 0. Then we prove that for almost every x, this normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges to a limit measure, which is equal to 1 over 2 pi times the Laplacian of the Nioclonal exponent, where the Laplacian is defined in the complex plane. And the way we also moreover we prove that the solace formula also holds. Compared to the solace formula in the surface joint case, the integral in the right-hand side of this formula is taken in the complex plane because of the existence of the complex structure. I marked the assumption. If we back to a self-adjoint case, the spectrum is a compact set in the real life. So in this case, we always have the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure of Z0 is 0. The next question is: when does the Lebesgue measure of Z0 equals 0? As far as we As far as we know, it is true in the following case. The first case is for the real analytic potential with the complexified phase. Because in this case, we can prove that this zero is the subset of the real market. So of course, the two-dimensional big measure is zero. The second case is for the big potential. Actually, it is proved in the one-frequency. In the one frequency by Soris and Spencer, and in the multi-frequency by that the zero is empty. The third case is for the small potential with the coincidence, which I will explain in the following. Anyway, a positive answer to this question would immediately establish the existence of the density of states and the Solis formula in the non-subjoint. In the non-subjoint case. Now I explain the coin structure. We suppose that the frequency is 17 and we suppose the potential is analytic. The force-fourier compression is supported in the coins. We call gamma in integer cone. Here R is a parameter used to control the angle of the cone and Wj is an angle. And WJ is the weight to control the direction of the code. Then we prove that for this kind of Schrodinger operator with complex potential, if the potential is small enough, the spectrum is an interval from negative 2 to positive 2. So of course, the two-dimensional we can measure is zero. So to sum up the one-time Sum up, the winding number reflects the asymptotic distribution of the zeros to the phase, and the density of state reflects the asymptotic distribution to the energy. Based on this, we give a formula to relate these two kinds of distributions. In fact, the left-hand side of this formula is the integral representation of the Nyablohmm exponent as the Exponent as a piecewise linear and convex function. And the right-hand side is a race representation of the Nyapov exponent as a subharmonic function. Now I introduce the Hatano-Nielsen model. This operator is defined in this way, HUN equals exponential T times Un plus Um plus 1 plus exponential negative g times um minus 1 plus v n times un. This operator was proposed by Catano and Nielsen in 1996, motivated by the study of the superconductivity in the solid state physics. This model describes a behavior of the quantum particle on the one-dimensional lattice with The one-dimensional lattice with the superimposed imaginary magnetic flat. If Vn is real IID random potential, sometimes people call this model the non-self-joint Anderson model. There are many results for the IID random potential, such as Davis, Good School, Coruscant, Solving. We are concerned about the dynamical defined potential. If the Potential. If the potential takes the form Vtnx, we call this operator the dynamical defined hatanias model. If the potential is a cosine function, by operating duality, the dynamical heterogeneous model is the dual operator of the almost multi-operator with a complex white phase. Just as we did before, we can treat the heterogeneous model as the infinity-dimensional matrix. And then we truncate the operator wherever we have two choices. That is, we can use open boundary condition or the periodic boundary condition. What I can see is that under the periodic boundary condition, the upper right corner is exponential negative G and the lower left corner is The lower left colour is exponential t. We will say that the limited distribution of the eigenvalues is very different, is very different under these two kinds of boundary conditions. The dimension of matrix goes unbentage. And because the topic of this workshop is about the randomness and the fast periodicity, I think it is football. I think it is suitable to make some comparisons for the random potential and the quasi-periodic potential for Hartano-Nielsen model. So let's recall some results for the random Hartano-Nielsen model. For random Haternon Nielsen model, with probability one, the spectrum has a positive two-dimensional big measure. Dimensional optical measure. More precisely, we denote by sigma g of the spectrum of the random heterononius model. Then in 2001, Davis proved the following result. If V is IID according to a probability measure mu with a compact spot m, which is the interval from negative lambda to positive lambda. Then with probability 1, the spectrum of The spectrum of the random pattern in the model contains the sum of the ellipse and the interval. Well, the ellipse is exponential g plus i theta plus exponential negative g minus i theta. And the theta is from 0 to 2 pi. Moreover, it proves that if navel is greater than or equal to exponential g plus exponential negative g, Exponential negative G, the spectrum of the random heterogeneous model is exactly the sum of the ellipse and the integral. So obviously one can see that the spectrum of the random heteronyl model not only has a complex component, but also has a positive area. However, for the operator in the finite size, the spectrum of the operator in the finite size is very different from that of the operator on L2Z. Actually, in the finite size, people are concerned about real complex spectrum transitions. There are many results on this topic, such as Gold School Korozengo in 2000 and 2003, Gold School Soding in 2000 So I summarize them in the following: suppose that potential is self-averaging, which means that the density of state of the corresponding shooting operator exists. Then we define two indexes. G one is the infamy of the Neapolitan exponent, and G two is the sub premium of the Neapolitan exponent in the spectrum of the shooting operator. Of the shooting operator. They handle a periodic boundary condition. As the dimension of matrix goes to infinity, if t is less than t1, the eigenvalues are asymptotically real. If t is greater than t1 and less than g2, the sum of eigenvalues are symptomatic to the non-random analytic curves in the complex plane. If g is greater than g2, then nearly all biomass. G2, then nearly all eigenvalues shift away from the real axis. But we can see that for the random potential, the spectrum of the operator on L2Z cannot be approximated by the spectrum of the operator in the finite size because the random potential is several averaging. So, this result can be applied for the random case. Random case, which means the spectrum in the finite size are asymptotic to the codes. However, just I mentioned that Davis proved that the spectrum of the operator on L2Z has a positive area. The result of the real complex transitions strongly implies Strongly implies the existence of the limited distributions of the eigenvalues. So the nature question is: for Hartano-Nierson model, does the density of state exist? Here is the result from Gaut Horizon in 2000. They prove the following. If the underlying dynamic system is a Gautic and X-ray, And X is a compact matrix space. The potential is real-valued such that log 1 plus the absolute value of A is in L1. Then under the open boundary condition, this normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges to the limited measure, just as the Schrodinger case, which is equal to 1 over 2π times the Laplace of the Neoplatonic exponent as a dimension of matrix. As a dimension of matrix goes to infinity. Under the periodic boundary condition, this limited measure is equal to 1 over 2π times the Laplacian of the L plus, where the L plus is the maximum between the Neapolitan exponent and T. So there are two kinds of density of states under the open boundary condition and under the periodic boundary condition. Under the periodic boundary condition, we will ask which density of state measure will support the spectrum. Actually, there are two steps for this question. The first step is we need to find which kind of ergodic potential will lead to the spectrum coinciding with a limited distribution of the eigenvalues. And the second step is to find the correct boundary condition. A boundary condition such that the corresponding density of state supports the spectrum of the Hartano-Nielsen model. We answer this question in the strictly ergodic city. More precisely, we denote by sigma g the spectrum of the dynamical defined heterononius model. In particular, sigma zero is the spectrum of the shooting operator. Then we prove the following result. If the underlying dynamical system is strictly ergodic, which means this dynamic is both minimal and unique ergodic, and X is a compact connect matrix space, and the potential is continuous. And we also assume the neoplomic exponent is continuous to the energy. Then we proved on the open boundary condition. Under open boundary condition, the support of the density of state is sigma zero, that is the spectrum of the Schoening operator. Under the periodic boundary condition, the support of the density of state is the spectrum of the Hadron Nielsen model. So we concluded that under the periodic boundary condition, the limit of the distribution of eigenvalues is the spectrum of the operator on L2Z. The typical example of The typical example of strictly algorithm dynamics is the fasciperiodic rotations on the torus and the skew shift on the torus. I want to emphasize that random potential is not strictly a voting potential. And the idea of the proof of this result is to establish the Solus formula for Haramius model. There are two kinds of density of states, so it is reasonable to get the two kinds of solid formula. We suppose the underlying dynamic system is Godic and X is a compact matrix space, the potential V is such that log1 plus the absolute value is in L1. Then under the open boundary condition, the left-hand side of the solace formula is Side of the solid formula is just the Niapnam exponent, just as the Schroinker case. Under the periodic boundary condition, the left-hand side of the solids formula is the maximum between the Nyapomi exponent and the T. So we have shown that in the strictly ergodic setting, the spectrum of the operator is the support of the density of state. Of the density of state under the periodic boundary condition. So, but in general, we cannot calculate the density of state, let alone the support. For Hartanias' model, we can give the formula of the spectrum by using the Nyoploo exponent. We divide the complex plane into three sets. The E negative is the set of E such that the Nioplopic exponent. Such that the Nyablom exponent is less than T, and E0 is the level set of E such that the Nyoglomic exponent equals T. And E plus is the set of E such that the Niagara exponent greater than T. Then we prove the following result. If the underlying dynamic system is strictly aquatic and X is a compact connect matrix space and the And the potential is continuous. Then the spectrum of the heterogeneous model consists of two components. One of them is just the E0 and another one is the intersection of the spectrum of the shredding operator and E plus. As the application, we can As the application, we can give the real complex platform transitions for the operator on L2Z. We define two indexes just as before. T1 is the infomium of the Neapolitan exponent and T2 is the supremum of the Neapolitan exponent in the spectrum of the shooting operator. Then we prove the following result. If T is less than or equal to T. Then or equal to G1, then the haltogeneous model is either spectrum to the shredding operator, which means the spectrum is purely real. If T is greater than G1 and smaller than G2, then we have the mixed spectrum. If T is greater than G2 or equal to G2, the spectrum is complex. So we can see a clear. So we can see a clear real spectrum, a real complex spectrum transitions for the strictly ergodic potential. However, in the random potential, for the random potential, this kind of real complex spectrum transition was only proved in the finite size, not on L2Z. The last question in my talk is about the profile of E0. Fire of E0. In fact, Gottschold and Horizon proved that E0 consists of a family of counters. So the next nature question is whether the number of the contours is finite. In the random setting, they wrote the following settings. It is easy to construct the examples with the prescribed finite number of counters. However, we do not know any of Wales's. We do not know any obvious reason for the number of candles to be finite for an arbitrary distribution. Although this question was proposed in the random setting, we provide a partial answer in the strictly ergodic setting. Here is the result. Suppose that underlying dynamical system is strictly ergodic and we assume the potential is continuous. We also assume that the ablo exponent is continuous. exponent is continuous to the energy. And if g is greater than g2, then it zero consists of a finite number of counters. The topic is over. Thank you for your attention. So any questions? Comments? Why do you need the assumption that the Lebanon measure That the Lebesgue measure of Z naught is equal to zero? Yes, because in the proof. I'm asking only for the Taoist formula. You mean the atlas just for the tautus function? So do you think without this assumption, because this is this is where you use kind of large deviation. kind of large deviation yes why do you why do you need this assumption because we use we need to use the forbidden theorem to exchange the integral about the energy and the phase but we do not know if if so the question is can can you erase that assumption do you think it is true with that yes actually that that is a hard question because we do not know if if whether this if if whether this condition is uh hold hold automoti automologically for the analytic potential. Maybe we do not need this as object, but in the proof we cannot prove it. So we just put them here. Okay, so so this is so as far as you're concerned for right now this is a technical assumption. Yes, yes. So it might be the case that it can be dropped. Yes, you're right. So the only you assumed strict volicity and you also assume in the later results you also assume that Lyapunov X motion is continuous for all E on the real line. So I think the only known example is when you have quasi-periodic base dynamics and you have analytic potential. Yes, you are right. Because outside of that you don't know much examples, so that satisfies this assumption, right? Satisfy this assumption, right? Uh yes, yes. So the the original motivation is the quasi-periodical uh quasi-periodic uh potentials. So uh and in the analytic case, the Nyapom exponent is continuous. Yes, you are right. Basically, this formula, the Thales formula was supposed to be true in the non-South Adjudic case. Not for just quasi-work, but in the robotic case. Because here, as far as I understand, you use very heavily the fact that you have quasi-periodic operators. I'm saying you using in the proof of taut formula the fact that you have quasi-periodic operator edition, I'm just giving you ergodic. Because I need to use a large division in the quasi-periodic case. For the other case, I don't know how to prove that. Maybe it is true. So you said that operators with PT symmetry could have real spectrum, but what are the conditions that they actually do have real spectrum? That is also a hard question because we do not know the exact the mechanics. the exact uh the mechanics how to uh make sure that the spectrum is purely real or not purely real. Just in some case it is real and in some case it's not real. There's a nice paper by Sarnak about 40 years ago where he does this. He sees the he shows it's real for a while and then after you turn up the coupling, it becomes it branches off and becomes an unreal. So he calculates. I don't know if you calculate the exact thresholds, but that's quite a bit about having that case. So, you find no more questions?  I know your payloads.
