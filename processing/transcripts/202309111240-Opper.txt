Yeah, so this is the rough plan for today and tomorrow. Today is basically sort of the two words already. So I will recall what dental algebras are and then how you from those can construct the surface. And then tomorrow, sort of applications of these geometric models. And one is how you can classify them up to draw. Can classify them up to derived equivalents, and another one is which is a bit more recent, kind of almost finished project. Um, building on other works of mine, uh, how you can describe the derived symmetry group, the derived Picard groups of graded versions of those. Yeah, I thought maybe I'd just jump right in and start with the definition of gentle algebras because that's the main object of interest today. And this is due to Assam and Skoronsky. And so gentle algebra is a quotient of a certain path algebra of a very special type of quiver. And this special type of quiver will be a finite quiver with relations. And the quiver will be denoted by Q and the relations will be denoted by R. And such a finite quiver I will call gentle if a bunch of conditions are satisfied. So the first one is. So, the first one is that at each vertex of the quiver, that most two arrows going into that vertex and most two arrows going out of that vertex. Two arrows which start. Two errors which start respectively the same for arrows which end in this vertex X. So it's quite a restrictive condition right from the start. So is this readable? Okay, good. The second condition is that R is just a set of paths of length two, so we have quadratic relations. Too, so we have quadratic relations. And then the third one is that we don't have too many arrows, let's say, too many combinations for one arrow. Maybe I'll write it down first and then we can discuss it. So, suppose we're given like a combination of Like a combination of two paths of length two, and we either assume that both are in the set of relations or both are not part of the set of relations. Then, if one of them agrees, so like if alpha equals alpha prime or beta. Beta equals beta prime, this already implies that the two agree. This is usually phrased slightly differently, but it's the same thing. In the definition, A is an algebra, it's a K algebra, I guess. Ah, sorry, no, A, a finite query. I haven't said yet. Just a finite quiver. A finite quiver, yeah. It's not. Ah, okay. Sorry, yeah. The algebra I will usually call lambda for that. Why don't you add to the finite quiver? You missed the website. Oh, ah, okay. Ah, sorry. I didn't notice this. I didn't notice this. Are you readable now? Yeah, quiver with relations. Sorry. So that's what I call a gentle quiver, and then a gentle algebra is what the algebra associated to this quiver with relations. You take the power. You take the path algebra and then divide out the ideal generated by the relations. And I mean, usually, when you say gentle algebra, there's an implicit assumption that this is also finite-dimensional. Just from the definition here, this is not necessarily the case. So we will add this extra. So, we will add this extra. I mean, you can also do theory without this assumption, but for the sake of these talks. But this is finite dimensional. Okay. Sorry? Yeah, yeah. It's just that when you have a loop, it's kind of restrictive. Yeah, but like it's possible. So you're, I don't know, kx modulo x squared is a perfectly gentle algebra. Okay. So maybe like some simple Okay, so maybe like some simple examples that we'll drag along throughout the talk to just illustrate some things. The first one is the one that also appears on the right, but I will come to that part later. So the first one is this quiver here. One, two, three, four, and then And then there's a reason for that, maybe odd-looking numbering. So, this is a quiver, and then I, as common, I indicate the relations with dotted lines. So, with these two. That means like the composition of this arrow in this wall is zero. So, it's an R. That's just what it's supposed to mean. It's one of these relations. So, likewise, this composed with this error zero in the algebra, in the gentle algebra. So, it's the first example, and then the second example is the chronica river. And the reason is because it illustrates a lot of pathological behavior that can. Behavior that can happen with ventilator algebras. So this is the Kronecker quiver/slash algebra. So just for completeness. So we have two vertices and two arrows without relations. Okay. And then more or less from the And then, more or less from the way I phrased it here, there's an observation one can make. Namely, these quivers, these gentle quivers, can always be decomposed in a certain way in terms of A ends. So if Q in R is a gentle quiver, then Q Is glued in a unique way from maximal subquivers of actually oriented AN types. Actually oriented AN type. So you just have a bunch of errors, and then the point is no relations without relations. And the reason is essentially the third condition. So let's say you've picked your favorite error, and then you can, let's say, you found if there's another error, so that. If there's another error, so that's the composition is not in R, then you know it's unique, so you can kind of extend it to A3. And then you just do this as long as you can, and at some point you will end. And the reason is because we have this finite dimensionality assumption. Otherwise, you can possibly end up with a sort of closed loop. But so I will illustrate this in an example: what this means. Yeah, you can have self-gluings. Yeah, so this is sort of the unglued version, and then you can possibly self-glue them together. So what do I mean by this? So let's take the first example there. Or maybe I wanted to give them names. So I will call these just QJ for some index sets. J runs over some index set. And so for the first example here, the quivers would be, so one consists of these vertices one, two, three, and four. That's an A n without any relations. And then you have another. Have another part which is this part consisting of five, three, and six. Sorry, and I didn't finish the sentence. So it's glued uniquely, but how it's glued at vertices. Yeah, sorry, I wanted to fill this in. So So when you glue now Q1, Q2 and Q2 at these vertices three, you get the quiver here. And whenever you glue together, you just fill in the relation you didn't have. So, I mean, you kind of say, okay, I just take maximum subquivers without relation. And then whenever I glue them together, I have other possibilities. Whenever I glue them together and I have other possible paths, for example, here, I'm going in this direction and just fill in my relations. So, I mean, like a good way is to do this with colors. So what you could do to maybe make it a bit more obvious. You can just in this particular case, it's like one color of arrows and then. one color of arrows and then another set of colors five and six and the relations basically say whenever you compose two colors then you're zero two different colors but like this this is a kind of this analogy breaks down a little bit exactly in the loop case or whenever you have sort of self-gluings then you have the same color and there can still be zero relations so you have to be a bit careful Relations, so you have to be a bit careful with that. But, like, this kind of unfolded examples, this works works well. And you can also glue quivers at several vertices. So, like we do the Kronecker example, maybe just for completeness, to see that this can also happen. Okay, so example two would be the Koneka quiver. In here, I mean the two colors are we have two vertices, so we have one copy of this quiver, and then we have another copy of this, say with a different color, and then you glue them. And then you glue them, you glue them again at vertices, but now at two at the same time. And then you get one which has two errors. So, the upshot of this is we have a commentorial definition, but essentially. Have a common toggle definition, but essentially it's just a bunch of equi-oriented ANs without relations, and then they glue together at vertices. And at each vertex, they're at most two which kind of meet, which are glued together. So that's that. Because we will now find something very similar in the surface construction. You said it combinatorially, because it also part algorithm is disconnected. I mean, not our query, but is that the outer break version of where it's meaningless of queries or module cutting resource? Sorry? In terms of queries, just it's it is more like software technical. Yeah. Because yeah, we have the zero relations. So I was trying to think, wouldn't they be wouldn't they follow? Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I don't know if this is maybe like a pullback construction, maybe. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so I hope that kind of illustrates that essential algebra are just built from very simple pieces. Okay, so now we sort of go. And now sort of go already to the surface part, the geometric model part. And I first stated, and then I will again illustrate this how you sort of construct that. But so the point is that every gentle algebra, well, let's say every gentle quiver, because that's what we're actually using determines. Determines we heard this term before a marked surface. And now we okay, let's say, let's go with the algebra. We will use the quiver to define it, but it sort of has to do with the algebra more than the quiver. It determines a marked surface, and I will denote this by sigma. surface and I will denote this by sigma lambda where lambda is this algebra that we'll use and again what what do I mean by this um just to be specific so so that is this is an oriented surface not just orientable but it comes with with a choice of orientation um And it also has a non-empty finite set of points on its boundary, which implicitly says that the boundary is also non-empty. And these points are then called, this is what I will refer to as the mark points. I didn't tell us also a bit more, but I will say something about this later. So, how do you go from gentle algebra, so a gluing of some to a surface? This follows a very simple recipe. So, like the quiver is glued from A n's, the surface is also glued from local pieces, which have something to do with these A n's. So, the statement is that the sigma line. So the statement is that the sigma lambda excludes from pieces and there's one piece for every for every one of these subquivers which are just denoted by Qj. So what do you do? So let's say our So, what do you do? So, let's say our Qj looks like this. So, you have vertices from 1 to, let's say, L. Then this local piece looks as follows. So, it's a disk topologically with L plus 1 marked points, but I draw it in a certain way for specific reasons. So, you kind of have sort of fingers here. And you have one, as you may think of, like a sort of central mark point. These are my mark points. And then L other mark points, which kind of sit at the end of these fingers. And then you also draw a graph inside, which are labeled. Which are labeled by the vertices of this quiver. So you would label them. And like the orientation is important. So you have sort of standard orientation on the disk here. And you label them in kind of that order. I will always draw it like this. So you have light from one goes to two and then goes all the way down to L. Okay, so this is topologically this. So, this is topologically a disk, and the edges are labeled by the vertices. And now, when I glue ANs together at vertices, what I want to do is I want to glue them at these fingers together to get a bigger surface. This is what I will do. So the point is now: if let's say these two quivers, two Qi and Qj, two subquirivers of this kind. To subcurls of this kind, if they are glued at vertices, say V and V prime, then we glue glue these pieces. How as follows. So you yeah, okay, so basically I have the example. But I will finish drawing this and then we go to the example. Finish drawing this and then we go to the example. So these two covers have two vertices v and v prime, and they are glued. The gentle algebra is obtained by gluing these together. Then locally, you have something like you have these two fingers, and the orientations are like this. And let's say. Like this, and let's say: so this is the edge corresponding to V. This was right in the upper picture. And then you have, on the other hand, you have an edge corresponding to V prime. And the orientation here is this one. So you just need to align them in the correct way to get something that you want. Get something that you want, and then you just identify them along this whole bit. And by doing so, you have no longer a mark point because this is something that will be in the interior of the surface. You just forget about it. And here, this is done for the example we had before. So, here this is the algebra again, and the colors again indicate the kind of decomposition of the quiver into two pieces, which are glued along the vertex. Two pieces which are glued along the vertex three. So now only of these two pieces here. So the right part here corresponds to the red bit and the left part here, which I had to invert. So the order is here, one, two, three, four, and here is five, three, six. So you have this. This the reason is that the orientations match up in the way that I asked them to match up. So I have to kind of flip it. So, I have to kind of flip it. Yeah, and then they're only glued at this one vertex. If there are other vertices where they're glued at, then you glue several fingers together, but in this case, only one. Glue them together, and then you just have one big disc that you get topologically. And if you deform this a little bit, then this will look like this. So you have this one marked point, then edges labeled by five, three, and six, and then four, three, two, and one, which enter my point. Which had to mark point. So, this is how the general construction works the same way. So, when you're interacting with a Google potential, I don't want to say yes because I'm not sure. I think it's different though. Yeah, maybe afterwards. I'm sorry, I'm not entirely sure. You can see one difference with the cost of the child which is that you have asked. Yeah. In which in which case? Ah, sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah, I agree. Okay, you can't have this. Yeah, okay, then I guess it's not. Yeah, sorry. Okay, and then maybe that's we'll use this later. I'll mention this just quickly. Will use this later. I'll mention this just quickly. You can also do this for the Kronika Griver. And I just indicate this quickly. So for the this was example two. So we had the chronic equivala, which again was glued basically from two instances of just one arrow, and then you could just. instances of just one arrow and then you just identify both of these vertices together so you have like gluing and then what you get is an annulus with exactly one mark point on each boundary component and then the edges here that I had here will look like this and sort of this this gluing surface here that I had in red I will indicate because it's a bit So, one is here, and the other one would be, let's say, here. And if you kind of dissect it, you can see the fingers again. In this case, you just have two fingers. And then you glue both of these together in a certain way. So, this is an annulus. Okay. Yeah, but you can get like any surface you want. And then maybe a quick remark. So it can happen that in these cases, the boundaries always have at least one mark point, right? But it can happen that they don't. And there's a characterization of this when this happens. So the surface So, without any mark points, if and only if the global dimension of lambda is infinite. Is infinite. You can already see sort of some topological property of one. It's not really topological, but the mark points tell you something about the smoothness of the algebra. Yeah, okay, so that's that. And then maybe we have to stay with these backboards. Everyone has to stay with these big parts. From the construction composers, shouldn't it tune red arc to the angle to meet at the same point on the composer? Sorry, the arcs should meet. I mean, you can literally see the. I mean, I assume in the end it's that movement, but if you stick rigidly to the structure, once on each one of the planes, these red lines join. Okay, I don't know exactly what you mean with. Okay, I don't know exactly what you mean with join. I mean you can you can just move them along. I mean then they're not intersecting yeah okay or maybe the colour wasn't good. Sorry. Unfortunately I used the color here as well and I wanted to kind of say I wanted to indicate if so the in the picture that I drew there this would be sort of the red line. This would be sort of the red line. This is where the fingers are glued together when they meet each other. Sorry, yeah, these are dotted line. I should have used a different color for this. This is where they're dotted. Yeah, maybe blue would have been better. Yeah, sorry. So this is where the fingers meet and they're glue together. Okay. So there's one extra piece of information which I kind of glossed over and I will. Which I kind of gloss over when I will most through this talk and the other times is that this is not all what the gentle quiver gives you. So another important piece of the picture, but just for, I thought it doesn't add much if I talk too much about it. So a quiver like this, or like a gentle algebra, determines some extra data. In this extra datum, which I will usually denote by eta lambda, this will be a line field. And what is this roughly? So, I mean, a vector field gives you a vector at every point in a kind of smoothly or continuously, whatever you want, varying way. One varying way. Also, yeah, smoothly, maybe it's better. And then, and this gives you a one-dimensional subspace. So for all x in the surface, eta of x is now a subspace of the tangent space at x. And it's a one-dimensional subspace. And I mean, if you have a vector field which doesn't vanish anywhere, then you can just take the one-dimensional subspace spanned by this non-zero vector, and then you get a line field. But not every line field arises in this way. And the way to think about it is that like the main difference is maybe that a vector field has an inherent sense of orientations. I mean, it's not just a vector space, but it has a direction, right? And sometimes line fields you can't associate. And sometimes line fields you can't associate in a coherent way these orientations. And this is when it doesn't come from a vector field. But maybe that's enough what the line field is. It's roughly, it's like a generalization of a vector field, if you want. And I will mostly ignore that. Like one thing, maybe I will mention, and that's sort of important, is that it allows To define winding numbers, that's a winding number, which I usually have by omega, gamma. And this is an integer, and gamma is just a suitable form of curve. So, this is a closed curve which has no base point, so this would be a map from. Point so this would be a map from this and this should be immersed and so on, but anyway so you have like you have like a loop let's say you could like only here I mean the disk is not so interesting, but if you go around once in the annulus just like the closed curve, there's no base point or anything, this would be an example of such a gamma, and then you can attach a number to this after you've chosen a line field. After you've chosen a line field. And there are possibly different choices, and different dental algors might give you the same surface with the same mark points and so on, but different line fields and different types of winding numbers. So this is an important part, like extra structure, but I will just occasionally will say what it kind of does without going into detail how this works. So if you want, you can either think of a vector field. So, if you want, you can either think of a vector field or just completely ignore this bit for most of the talk and tomorrow as well. Yeah, I mean, the idea is roughly, maybe I do erase this now. So, if you have a line field like a vector field, you have sort of an elimination of your surface. So, this would be like these are the lines that are carved out by of this line field. And now let's say you have your curve that kind of runs around like this. This is gamma. And then you have a tangent vector at each point, right? And now, if let's say you stand on the curve and you just walk along the curve, and each time when the tangent vector and the line field align magically, you just count a plus or minus one. And the plus or minus one depends on whether I kind of turn left, this would be right, turn left and kind of align, or turn right and kind of align. This is kind of a signed intersection number if you want. So, and then if you do this for a closed curve, you will always end up with an integer. And that's what. And that's what the mining number counts essentially. Yeah, maybe some finalizations have winding number two. Yeah. Sorry? Yeah, oh yeah, there's another difference from so Yeah, so like, yeah, so this will be two or not like one, like in vector fields. Yeah, yeah, so you have this kind of difference between this. In case you were alluding to that, I'm not sure. Right, so it's not really the usual notion. Yeah, it's not like ways you compare this with one with a vector field. You have a factor to that. Yeah, exactly. But I mean, yeah, morally, you do count this. The point is like if I go like this and this. If I go like this and this, that's yeah, we don't have this sense of orientation anymore. That makes a difference. So, like, the question is: what can you do with a geometric model? The question is, what can you do with this geometric model? It's nice to have a surface, but can you say anything reasonable about maybe the category that you're considering? So, the first theorem is viewed in some setting height in Katzakov-Konsevich, and then in a different And then, in a different language, Pete Plomodon, Sabil Schwarz, and myself. So you can model a bunch of things in a derived category now of these gentle algebras in terms of the surface. So the first one would be maybe that you can prove that there's a bijection. proof that there's a bijection between on the one hand we have um so sorry lambda is gentle it's a gentle algebra and then you can ask for indecomposables in its runner derived category and then you divide out isomorphism so isomorphism classes and at this point i also want to divide out shifts so only isomorphism out shifts so only isomorphism classes have to shift this is in bijection with certain curves on this surface that we have model or homotopy and then here something I also maybe just briefly mention there's some extra data There's some extra data. And so, what do I mean by curves? I want to be a bit more specific about this. So, there are two types. The one is one would maybe call arcs. These are nothing than paths. And between mark points, And then the other types of curves are loops. And by this, I mean something that we had before where we can apply the winding numbers like maps from S1 into this. And I have an extra. I have an extra condition. I don't consider all these kinds of maps, but only those where the winding number vanishes. And the idea is that it has to do with something like when you have bands, you want kind of the ends to meet in a certain sense. And this is somehow captured by this winding number. Again, it's just like this. This is how the winding number first shows up. It's not all these kind of curves. I mean, here for the arcs, there's no condition, just everything that goes between mark points. Between mark points, so if you have different gentle algebras with different line fields, this path doesn't see it, but this part does because the winding number might change and might not be zero anymore. Okay. Okay, now when I say extra data, then you technically have this for all curves, but you can kind of, it's superfluous for the arcs. So for the loops. So, for the loops, what is this extra data? It basically consists of, or is equivalent to what you would usually call a band parameter, which is a non-zero number, at least if k this is what we're assuming now, it's algebraically closed. Otherwise, you have contributions from all irreducible polynomials, and then you also have a height. Then you also have a height parameter. And the reason I call them like this is because you really should think of homogeneous cubes in an Lambda right equivalent. So objects coming from these types of loops contribute or form Of so this and this is kind of where it sits in the tube, and this is just No, they're just like in the middle. Like, for example, if you have the annulus, the central curve would be one. And you can move them around freely. They're not attached at any point specifically. That's what I mean with base point three. You can just move them around as much as you can. Yeah, sorry. That's a very good point. I forgot that. Yeah, these are primitive. Yeah, these are primitive. Sorry for this. So sometimes you have a loop which is sort of an iteration of the same loop just several times, and you just want to exclude this. And this is what I mean by primitive. You don't want loops which are powers of another loop. Good save on my finding the problem because I want to, yeah, yeah, right. Okay, yeah, this this will okay. Sorry, this is the picture for perf. Yeah, sorry, it's a bit sloppy here. Um, you can also do this for everything which is not perfect, but the way I stated it, let's say Let's take those. Then it's correct. But you can also do this for everything which is not in the perfect complexes. And then the curves are sort of infinite things which wind around boundary components. But yeah, I mean, to give you the flavor, there's two types of curves, generally speaking. And there's a rejection between sort of curves, homotopy classes, and objects. And this is Kuru-Mark-Schmidt. So every object is a finite direct sum unique. A is a finite direct sum uniquely of these indecomposable ones. No, no, only on no, only on mark points. And then once you have sort of, they can spiral around infinitely. That would be the picture. But yeah, there's that. And then, yeah, maybe just at the end. Just at the end, we'll talk about the example. So, you can also remove this shift part. Again, for this, you need the line field. So, I'm just ignoring that. The other thing is we have this kind of topological distinction between arcs and loops. And you can ask whether this is a categorical notion. So, does it depend on the model? So, we have like a triangle like the category, and maybe we have a different gentle algebra, which is equivalent to this. Which is equivalent to this. Does being an arc or being a loop is something which is intrinsic to the catch we are not? And this is almost true, but not quite. And you all know an example where it's not true. And I will just discuss this briefly to kind of prepare a bit what we will talk about next time. So, maybe like a remark, if you want, a long remark. So, you have this topological dichotomy where you have loops and you have arcs. One thinks I have base points and the other one doesn't. And if you have anything that observes the structure of the server. That observes the structure of the surface, like a homeomorphism, then you will send arcs to arcs and loops to loops. So, this is being one of the two is a topological invariant. So, this is almost, but not quite almost intrinsic to To here we approach lambda. And that means, almost means, I mean, I won't really explain what it is, but it means for most objects, you have a, you can say it's always a loop, it's always an arc, and for some, the lines get a bit blurry. And now, this example where the lines get a bit blurry is the Kronecker algebra. So we had So we had our chronic equiver from before, and now I give names to the arrows as well. Let's make not enough space for this, so we'll do it over here. And then hope this fits. You have the let's say bounded derived category of k yeah, I mean okay and by Baylinson's equivalence that's the same as the boundary of kt of p1 and here you have the the structure sheaves of the points so maybe the the first one I take is So, maybe the first one I take is kind of, I mean, there are many, many different choices for this equivalence. I just chose implicitly one. So, you have these structure sheaves where x, I just choose certain specific homogeneous coordinates. So, lambda is a non-zero scalar. And I mean, this is a point in just P1. In just P1. Okay, and you have this luxury sheaf there. And then under this equivalence, this will correspond to certain objects here. And the objects that we have that correspond to these ones, if I choose this in the correct way, then I get these types of complexes where you just Complexes where you just have two indecomposables at some point, projectives, and then this type of differential, and then zeros everywhere else. And like people will recognize this as band modules, like if you, if you're quasi-isomorphic to a band module. And then, but if you take sort of so these are the points which are not zero in affinity, by the way, I chose it. By the way, I chose it. So, and if you take now the sort of special point structure g for zero, which using a sort of same notation would be zero, one, this would go not to a band module, but something which is quasi-isomorphic to a string module. This goes to a complex which just has the B on it. So, what kind of happened is I degenerated this parameter lambda to zero. What you can also do is, I mean, this is isomorphic to the complex where I just shift the lambda over to the b, so it's lambda minus 1b. So it's lambda minus 1b. This is still readable. And then, so you have this. But now you can degenerate it again by sending lambda minus 1 to 0. And this could correspond to the structure sheaf at infinity. So if you degenerate lambda minus one to zero, Lambda minus one to zero, you get this complex where you just have a on the differential. So now just like the last thing, then I'm done. If you draw this on the surface, some things will be arcs and some things will be loops. So, this kind of generic part, which will be the band models in the Kronecker case, on the surface, so I don't know, the corresponding curve of this would be just a loop. And this kind of parameter lambda, remember there was some extra data on these curves. This is exactly this extra. This extra datum, and the height is one, like in these cases, right? Okay, and now you can sort of degenerate this loop if you want and attach it to the boundary. So you would get a picture like this. So you can turn this into an arc. And you can also do it the other way. And you can also do it the other way in this case. And just have this. So what sort of happens in this case is you have this sort of family of objects which live over the same loop, parent metrized by lambda. And then you have sort of degenerations of this object, which are arcs now that live on the boundary component of somebody. Are that live on the boundary component of some boundary component, very special one? In this case, this has one marked point and a certain winding number. And now the point is: okay, so I just say this verbally. The automorphisms of P1 act transitively on the points, so that they permute these act transitively on these objects here. So in the automorphism of P1 gives you some symmetry group of this one as well. Of this one as well. So that means you can't really distinguish categorically between these objects and these, right? Despite being arcs and loops. So this sort of model is a bit imperfect because sometimes what you really need to do is you should kind of blur arcs and loops together. And this happens in a very controlled way and has to do with society chromology. And that's something I'll talk about tomorrow. Thank you very much. And are there further questions or comments? I know you didn't want to talk about the line field, but you just think which data in the river determines the line field. Um yeah, you can sort of draw it locally and then glue together as well. Okay, okay, change it, micro, yeah, yeah, sure. This always looks the same, and then you just have to do it. And then in each of these disks you have a level length. And the line is also the main shape and how the point you are viewing. So then you can just group them together quite likely you could use them effectively because you have a different I don't know, enough about the share coordinates after. Yeah. I have to think about this. I think a sh shortcut. So, this allows you to essentially determine the number of boundary components in how many years like on the surface, if you're on a first determine the number of boundaries. Number of boundaries, and then you need that fundamental proof of the quiver is the same as the fundamental group of the surface because it essentially had these fingers and you had to get this. The idea is that you can put tracks people describe. That's why you can read up the hundred and by the different things that you can read. So So let's say you have a boundary here and you have a bunch of markets. Then you would have something from ANs here locally. But then in between, you might go to other boundary components, right? And you have sort of so this will be what people would consider like a maximum antipath. So you're kind of an alternating sequence. So you're pathetic for automatic sequences between maximal power.   But yeah, this is maybe the discount. Maybe a bit. Yeah, yeah, this is this is an also for graded algebra, so it's far more general than this one. Yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, I mean, you can always like choose like a, well, like a minimal one, except for yeah, okay, except for any of punctures everywhere, or like unmarked components too. Oh yeah, yeah, like like even even here, I mean for the playlist and one you just make I mean when when you do this you have you have to pick a basis between the homes between the structure sheaf and the and the in the hole. The structure sheaf and L1. And this determines how, like, for example, where these are sent to. I mean, essentially, it's the graph I have, in a sense. I mean, you have the surface, and then you pick a certain sort of generator of your category, and that's in forms of this graph. And that sort of determines how this projection actually looks. That determines how this projection actually looks like. I assume also from the online audience. So then that's the same discussion again.
