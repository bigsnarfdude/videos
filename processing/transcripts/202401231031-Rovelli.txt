Thanks organiser for putting this together. It's great and uh it's nice to think back about a few things that I had uh maybe not thought about for a while and also thanks to Vittoria for setting up the ground for part of my talk a little bit. I should say many of you have already seen versions of this talk but even I had forgotten about most of it so maybe you forgot too it's gonna be a brand new talk for every Got two, and it's gonna be a brand new top for everyone. I think the main punchline was already given away various times, but I'm gonna put it on the board once again. And this is roughly the goal of what we're gonna discuss in the next 60 minutes. So, the goal is to somehow identify an equivalence An equivalence realized by some more relaxed, more uh general version of 1000S dot construction, defined on some potentially weird input that is to be determined, but valued in the objects that maybe everyone at this workshop should care about, which is uh two single spaces or the composition spaces. Or the composition basis. And I'm going to follow, in a sense, the trend that Philip started setting yesterday: namely, I'm kind of giving two talks at the same time. I'm going to refer explicitly to spaces, so every pullbacks are going to be homotopy pullbacks, but if you are less comfortable with that, just replace spaces with sets everywhere, and this is going to be a perfectly valid and interesting result in itself. Interesting result in itself. The focus is more on species because the examples that we care about only live in general, or the majority of them live in the homotopical version of the story. And so maybe if that's the goal that we are trying to achieve, the first thing that I should say is how do we fill this blank box? And we know that we should expect to see in there something that resembles like an environment where we can do An environment where we can do some form of homological algebra, maybe. And what we call these is stable augmented double single spaces. And obviously, you don't know what these words mean, and that's fine because this is going to be essentially the first theme that we're going to dial to. So that's the plan. And maybe another nice way to tie this story up with some of the points that were highlighted yesterday is that there is a very explicit way to go back that I'm calling P and it's in a way, a sense to combine in an organized way both the two uh the collage or path spaces constructions that were mentioned yesterday. So if you are careful in the way that you combine them, Therefore, in the way that you combine them, this is going to completely, in a sense, recover all the information that is present in the story. So, we discuss what this is, we discuss what the two constructions are, and depending on how time goes, maybe we can try to get a sense for why I'm not lying and these two constructions are actually inverse to each other. So, let's start by saying a bit more about what type of object we have over here. Over here, and there is various ways of going about it. The one I choose for today is the following. So, here's a notation. I'm gonna call sigma the category that is obtained by tweaking a little bit delta times delta. So, sigma is the category obtained from delta terms. Delta times delta by freely adding a terminal object. So this maybe feels weird. Delta times delta already has a terminal object, but no one prevents us from adding another one. So here's how we picture it. We have a delta times delta part that we could put over here. And I will also stick to the linear algebra convention. So, this part is just going to be an infinite matrix in the two directions. And the entries of this matrix would be 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, and 0, 1, yes, 1, 1, 2, 1, and so on. And so on. We also have an explicit understanding of what are the generative maps for this category. But I'm declaring that I want to add a new terminal object, and I'm going to place it here. And for reasons that may become clear later, I want to call this negative 1. So the fact that it is a new terminal object means that in terms of the structure maps that I should require to generate this category, I should keep whatever I have in delta term. I should keep whatever I have in delta times delta, and I need to add one new map that goes this way. That's it. So this is kind of a bisimple, like three sheets over this category are going to be kind of bisemplical spaces, but with a tiny bit of extra structure. And we can actually maybe write it here. So whenever I have some cliche, From sigma up into spaces, I'm just gonna kind of reverse all the maps present in here, and so I'm gonna have some bisimplicial space over here, which will have d00, d01, d10, d11, d20, d21. And I don't want to continue, but we do have. continuum but we do have an extra space which is d negative one and it comes structurally with a map to d0 zero. So the way we are regarding this is that we have a natural way to regard every element in d negative one as an element of d00. And of course there's going to be some all the relations coming from the bicep stuff. Okay. How do we think about these spaces? So, I'm trying to train you towards the way that we should think about each of the spaces that are featured on the board. So, interpretation. We'll talk about d negative one in a second, but that's the weird one, so let's leave it for last. And let's start with the more familiar ones. Familiar ones. D00, D01, D10, and D11. How should we think about these? So, D00 for me, it's a space of objects. So, when I want to draw something that represents an element in this 0, 0, it will generally look like this: just a single dot. Just a single dot. And this may be confusing until I stress what the pictures for the other ones will look like, but wait a second. So, this 0, 1, I want to think of it as the space of horizontal morphisms. The bisimblition structure tells me that every time I have something living in D01, it's going to have source on the target. is gonna have source and the target in D00. And I'm declaring for you that I want you to think about something like this as something living in the horizontal direction. So that's what an element of d01 should look like. And now without too much imagination you can then guess what I should write for d10. This is going to be the space of vertical morphisms. So, same picture, but drawn vertically now. And an element in D11 has a bunch of sources and targets, depending on whether I'm trying to apply these horizontally or vertically. And so, the natural display for something like this would look like a square. So, we are thinking of D11 as a space. One as a space of squares, and when I draw them, I should have four dots, two horizontal morphisms, and two vertical morphisms. And if I'm diligent, I should somehow also maybe decorate this square to say that it's kind of a part of the datum. I don't know whether I will remain this diligent, but for now we'll do it. It's also not. It's also not too difficult to think about what should happen if I look, for instance, at D23, just to pick something with higher numbers. I don't really have a name for what D23 should be, but we can collectively think about how we should draw an element in there. And this should look like a grid of size, I guess, 2 times 3. It could be something like this. It could be something like this. See, I'm already being less diligent in signaling the directions of the errors and stuff, but this is what it should look like. And a limit of this graphical calculus is that I'm kind of drawing only the generators, but you should figure there are also like opposites and the things that Like all the things that I'm that I'm displaying. Okay, so so far it's just a bisimply shown space with a particular interpretation. I'm not telling you anything particularly new. So let's go to this d negative 1. I already have a great name for this, so I'm just going to stick to augmentation space. And all I know about it so far is that I should have a way to regard everything. I should have a way to regard everything living in D negative one as something living in D zero zero. So I want to think of this as a collection of distinguished objects among all the special objects. And so when I want to stress this viewpoint, I would draw the object as maybe something like a star or an asterisk. Okay. Any questions about this? Questions about this? Yes? So just trying to connect to the previous talk. So I think there was the discussion that horizontal is connected to like monomorphisms and this is epimorphisms. And we also have exact sequences. So these guys. And what would be the negative one? What is the negative one in that case? What are the the objects that played a distinguished role? Distinguished role. Zero. And as Victoria pointed out, there are many zeros. I could take a weird module with a single object and call that element something that is not zero, but it would still play the same role. Yes? Okay, but to support the type of intuition that I'm trying to implement, I should kind of impose some axioms. So we are not just interested in any pre-shift out of sigma. Any pre-shift out of sigma, we're interested in pre-shift out of sigma that meet certain conditions. And so that's what we're about to have. So here's an almost complete definition. So if I take some gif, this kind of play augmented by simplicial space, I want to tell you when I should declare that this deserves to be called a stable augmented double single space. There's roughly three groups of conditions that correspond to being double sigma. This is a notion that exists also in other contexts. There is a family of conditions that implement stability. This is a terminology that is new in. Terminology that is new in the way that we introduced it, but we kind of borrowed it from the notion of stability from stable infinity categories. And then there is this augmentation that regulates the behavior of the weird negative one component. So let's discuss the double signal part. So the double signal part does what you would think. You don't care about the negative one part, you just look at the big. Negative one part, you just look at the big matrix, and they're just asking that every row and every column is a single space in the definition that we have already mentioned at this context. So I guess we would write it as DAB comes with a single map to D1B times D1B. So I split A into a bunch of copies of 1. Of copies of one. This is an iterated pullback, I guess, over d0b, and I'm just asking for this map to be an equivalence. Of course, there's a dual condition where I'm splitting the where I'm splitting the other one. This should not be too new of an encounter for us. So let's focus on the other two things. Stability. Stability, as I said, we're kind of mimicking what it means for an infinity category, for instance, to be stable. So essentially, the way that we want to phrase this is that if I give you one of these squares that I'm thinking of as distinguished squares, they have to be completely determined by either the span contained in its boundary or by the Boundary or by the cospan contained in its boundary. This is no news to us because so far these squares were like bipartisan squares, so they were indeed determined to a reasonable extent by the span and by the cospario. So that's what we are implementing. If I take the space of squares, I can map using the structure maps to the horizontal part and the vertical. And the vertical part, and these two are going to be glued over an object. And instead of writing down using the notation of the structure maps, what this is, I'm going to do it with a cartoon. This is the map that picks a square like this and selects the two horizontal and vertical sources of its boundary. So it would look like this. So it's a local and there's a dual foundation that selects the horizontal and vertical part to the battery. Why? This is an equivalence. So the way that we remember this is every square is completely determined by the span or cospan and every square Span or co-span, I never know, contained in Spanish. Okay, so let's go to these augmented things. In all examples that we've seen so far, this augmentation part was kind of given by a zero object. So maybe I would be tempted to say that d negative one should be like the space of zero objects. Objects, this is not general enough. So I need something a little weirder. But the idea is the following: given any object, it must receive a unique horizontal arrow from something in the augmentation. That's one. The dual one is given any object maps in a unique way through a vertical morphism to some. Vertical morphism to something in the augmentation. So, what does this look like? What I'm saying is that if I take a horizontal morphism with the condition that each source is in the augmentation, I'm going to draw a picture of what this looks like in a second. If I forget the augmentation, The augmentation part, and I focus on the object, this has to be an equivalent. As I said, I understand that this problem does not speak to you, but the problem is. So, a generic element in here is a horizontal morphism where the source is in the augmentation. So, it's something from asterisk to dot. The map just focuses on dot. And of course, you can write this in terms of the superficial structure, if you want. Okay, is this not clear? Because it's often confusing. So the way that we remember the requirement that this is an equivalence is given any object it receives in a unique way horizontally from something in the augmentation. And as I said, there's a dual one. And as I said, there's a dual one. And since it's slightly confusing, I will draw the cartoon for the dual one. The dual one is that if I look at dot vertical to star and I go to dot, this is an equivalence. I say it's confusing because here the star is in the domain and here the star is in the product. What does this pull back? This one? Go back. This one? So here I'm requiring that the domain comes from the augmentation. So I have a unique structure map from D negative 1 to D 00. So that's a map involved here. And this one is the domain. So I guess it would be D one in the cycle component. From B minus one to B0 is here? So, a priori, no. Here you could create a super weird crazy pre-shift. But I think once you impose this condition, if you work in the discrete setting, so if you are learning in sets, I think it really implies injectivity. If you work in the homotopical setting, I think it implies some homotopy injectivity. So we are really not abusing too much by thinking that the canonical map is on sort of embedding. More questions? Other questions? Yes? For the double SQL, shouldn't there be some compatibility condition in between the whole data? Oh, that's built into the double SQL. That's built into the SQL. Oh, it's a double SQL. Oh, yeah. I see. We have that very question. Okay. So we kind of recognize properties of what we've seen before. What we've seen before, that's a good start. Are these things so weird or not? And actually, they are a bit everywhere. So stable, augmented, double, I should really shorten this, but single spaces arise from a bunch of things. Arise from a bunch of things. So, the first main example, which is the one that, in a sense, Victoria went into detail the most, would be rings. So, given any ring, I can produce for you something that looks like this. And you could probably also guess how you would implement that. But, let's just spend a couple of words on this. Okay, so what's the idea behind how to build a sigma space out of a ring? Well, we would say that if R is a ring, we could consider something called the exact nerve of the category R mod. This notation looks R mod. This notation looks terribly complicated because I'm kind of composing a bunch of existing constructions. So ignore this and just take this as a name. This is the name of a sigma space that you can produce out of R. So this is one. And we can guess what to put in the component AB, and we can guess what to put in the augmentation. Part so think about it while I erase this. Okay, so component AB, I'm putting the group point of group. Of grids valued in our modules with the constraints that Victoria has highlighted when she was doing the S-dot construction. So I would say it's the group point of reads so something from A times B into the category of our modules. Into the category of our modules with the constraint that everything horizontal is a mono, everything vertical is an AP, and every square appearing has to be by Cartesian such that horizontal are mono, all vertical are epi and all And all squares are by factor. That's what we would have all guessed. And it's correct. And going back to Ivan's question, for the augmentation, we don't want to be biased. So we don't want to put just the singleton of our favorite trivial module. We are just going to put the groupoid of all trivial modules. Of all trigger models. It is of course contractual. I see how that's the most natural thing to do, but would something fail if you choose as you? I was thinking about it as I was writing it. Probably not, because this is so. Probably not, because this is so canonically contractible that like since it's a zero object, I don't see an obstruction. Maybe someone does. But even if there is no obstruction, I may be bothered by choices when they are unnecessary. I don't know. As I was writing it, I was thinking about it and you need then to choose this very same zero object for all the natural objects. Put a single tone and yeah, I think it's a good place for what you're first. Yeah, yeah, okay. And if you know what the more complicated things are, by tweaking this construction, you can also get a stable augmented double single space. So, what are the more exotic types of structure that we mentioned? We mentioned exact categories. Maybe infinity, sorry, maybe exact infinity categories, maybe proto-exact, stable infinity categories. Not surprises. So, four is a question mark, and it's essentially the setup of CGW categories that may. GGW categories that maybe Brendo will say something about, maybe not. So I don't know what is the exact link. So I'm going to put a question mark, but it does seem like there is a big overlap between this setup and the one that Iman Jonathan developed. So some values of them should fit into the picture. But most importantly, for the purpose of our talk, we can get Purpose of our talk, we can get one of these from any two-secal space. So that's what we want to unpack. This is what was promised in the mini trailer. We promised that we should be able to get a stable augmented our server space from any to Sibaspace. So, we're going to define a construction that works for every sigma space, so Pre Shif over sigma, but we will be interested in particular in the construction when the thing we start with is not the other way around. Sorry, the other way around. We're going to be defining something that can eat any simplicial space. I will be particularly interested in it when we feed a two-sigar space. So here's a construction. Take x as initial space. And we have a nice way to produce Px, a sigma space. So this is the thing that is trying to be a stable augmented double sigma space. Will not be in general. How do we do it? The quick answer to this is package in a clever way the two decalage or path space constructions that we Pathspace constructions that we saw yesterday to produce a matrix. Clearly, what I said is not very mathematically well defined, so let's write something slightly more precise. So I can tell you what it does on the entries of the matrix. So in position AB, it picks the value A plus 1 plus Plus one plus P of the original simplicial space. We see that in particular x0 gets left out, x0 will be recorded in the augmentation. So in particular there's a lot of repetitive like when we think about this as a matrix. When we think about this as a matrix, there will be a lot of repetition. X1 will feature many times, X2 will feature many times. Let's try to draw it maybe here. So the augmentation, we said that it is X0. Then in position 0, 0, I should see X1, then I should see. Then I should see two copies of x2 to the two sides of x1 over here. And then I see three copies of x3. And I can continue in this way to see what the entries of the matrix should look like. Now, the maybe less clear part is how to deal with the bisimplicial structure. This is an exercise that you could This is an exercise that you could do. You could sit down and think what possible bicycle structure I could put that would be kind of compatible with this formula. A compact way of seeing it would be to say that P is a pre-composition functor with a variant of ordinal sum. This probably doesn't speak to you. He didn't speak to me yesterday night when I pre-read a paper. So maybe let's try to give a bit of an indication. Maybe let's try to give a bit of an indication of how the bi-simplicial structure works. So, I can tell you that the zero of rho should be the collage that I think the one that shifts. So, the one that removes D0. I believe we call that P bottom, I don't remember. Bottom, I don't remember. So, this is telling you the whole simplicial structure of the zero fraw. And it's the one that shifts. So, we are using, for instance, over here, d1 and d2, we are not using d0. So, just because everything I'm doing is nice and cute and symmetric, then the 0 of column. Then the zero column is going to be the other decouage. So this one is going to use in the first instance here the faces D0 and D1, but not D2. It's supposed to be the same paper and. Ah, sorry. Thank you. So now I don't remember anymore. I guess this one is p top. And if I'm not mistaken, all other rows and columns are iterated decalage constructions. So if you really wanted to do what the vitamin construction was, this one would be p top, p top, x. And the second row will be P bottom, P bottom, X. So the vertical stuff is easy because there's no shift. The horizontal stuff is more complicated because there is a shift. And by how much you are shifting depends on which row you are. So the sub is there. Okay. Maybe I didn't say what is the structure map. What is the structure map from x0 to x1? Not a lot of choice, it's the choice. Questions about this? So we kind of reused almost all of the structure of x, some of it in different ways. We did leave out the faces from x1 to x0. From x1 to x0. They did not feature. That's fine. So I'm pointing this out because it means that every sigma space of the form Px somehow has extra structure. It's not going to be present in general when I work with an arbitrary sequence. Okay. Cool. So as promised. In general, Px will not be a stable augmented double sigma space, but it is one if the input is nice, namely when the input is a two-siga space. So if x is two sigma space, then px is stable augmented double single space. And I'm gonna give a I'm gonna give a maybe a heuristic of the main ideas that go into the proof. What is nice is that the properties that need to be verified for Px really come from the properties that are verified for xb into sigma with a very nice matching. And it's also interesting that sometimes a single pullback diagram relative to x will correspond to different properties of px. Properties of px, because there's a lot of repetition. One of the technical questions: fullback means homotopic fullback here? Yes. All of these are homotopy fullbacks. Yes. So if you're watching the spaces talk, everything is derived. But the diagram from sigma up to spaces is a strict function. Yes. Let's see. Philip and also others yesterday gave us a long list of tools, lots of available pullbacks that we can use, starting from a two sequence space X. From a two-siegel space x. I'm going to start from three of them and see how I can translate them to say something about px. So here's the idea. x is to signal. So this will give me a bunch of pullbacks. I want to focus on the two pullbacks coming from the two triangulations of the square, and I want to focus on one. And I want to focus on one of the pullbacks involving the degeneracies. So I'm going to write them. One of the pullbacks is x3, x2, x2, x1 with the maps being d0, d2, d1, and d0. This is one of the things that we know is a pullback. Then there's another one with the same. Then there's another one with the same objects, but different maps. So this one should be P3, P1, P1, P2. And then I want to pick one of those with the degeneracies: X1, X2, X0. X2 X0 X1 So here the maps are S0, D1, D2, S0. I would write or I will not be able to correct them. So I'm going on with this. So I believe we have encountered these at some point on the board. Now, all these XNs feature. Xn's feature as part of the structure of Px, but I have a choice. Like, do I want to regard this X3 as the space of composable horizontal things? Do I want to regard it as the space of squares of px? Or do I want to regard it as a space of vertical stuff? And I need to be clever in what's the viewpoint that is convenient to take. Point that is convenient to take right now. So, what I want to take to translate this one is the following: x3 is px to 0. I'm regarding it as a horizontal string. No, vertical string in an algebraic function. X2, I'm regarding it as, I guess, one. I guess one zero the other x two also one zero and x one zero zero and I could be diligent and track down what the given max max corresponds to for the structure of Px And I believe this should be D0 vertical, D2 vertical, D1 vertical, and D0 vertical. I invite you to ignore them and instead trust me that this pullback is expressing one of the smallest instances of double signality horizontally. So this is totally new. So, this is telling you that a string of two composable horizontal morphisms is precisely two individual single horizontal morphisms glued along an object. So, this is the smallest instance of horizontal singularity. You could try to work with a more general pullback square to get the To get the full generality of the horizontal signality, and you could try to dualize things around to also get the one and the other branch. So, I'm going to be abusing notation a little bit and just say that from this we obtain that px is double sigma. Maybe you guys are going for stable and Going for stable and augmented for the other two. So, this one I'm hoping to retrieve the stability pullback, the stability condition. So, to do that, I should rather regard x3 as the space of squares and I should regard x two and x two as a horizontal and a vertical morphism. And a vertical morphism. And to do it precisely, I want 0, 1 here and 1, 0 here. These maps would be the horizontal source and the vertical source. Once again, I invite you to ignore this. I invite you to ignore these, but I tried to chuck them, so I wanted to put them on the point. What we have here, here I want, so they are glued along the notch. So this is again this, I should. The point is one of the two signality conditions translates precisely to one of the two stability conditions. To one of the two stability conditions. If I had started from this one and tried to regard it as a stability condition, I would have gotten the dual one. So again, I'm going to slightly abuse and say that from this I assume for you that px is stable. Questions about these? Yes. So the same pullbacks where the Matto Sega condition is. Square from a two-segal condition gives you both a stability and one half of stability and one instance of double segregation. Yes, that's so cool. It's magic, I think it's magic. Yeah, I mean in a sense it's not surprising because there is a lot of repetition over here. Like the same structure map in X represents, I don't know, a horizontal source at a certain point in the matrix and maybe something else. Okay, augmentation is slightly subtle for a reason that you may or may not have realized, but I'm just gonna go with it. So, here's how I want to rewrite this pullback. I want to rewrite it as follows. X1 is Px00 X2 is Px 01 x0 is px negative 1 and x1 is px00. So I chose how I want to regard the entries of x kind of. Okay, now some maps, here I have four maps, some of them are actually structured maps of Px. Of Px, such as this one, this one is the augmentation map, and this one is also a structure map for Px. It would be the horizontal source. But the other two maps are not structure maps of Px as a sigma space. They exist because Px is peculiar, but they are not part of the structure. Part of the structure. So, in general, when I have a sigma space, there is no map that kind of goes back over here. Now it just exists because it does. But nevertheless, this is expressing that px zero zero via a specific map is equivalent to a certain pullback, namely px. Px 01 with Px negative 1 over Px 00. And now if we were diligent and looked back at what the augmentation map would be, we would realize that it points the opposite way. But that's fine, because the map that points the opposite way is a partial inverse of this one. So I have created a map that I have created a map that is a with equivalence, that is a partial inverse of the thing I would want to be a with equivalence. So I'm perfectly happy with that. This is the augmentation. So in particular, I can conclude that Px is augmented. Once again, I only checked half of the augmentation condition. For the other one, you would have had to start with the other. Start with the other diagram dependencies. This is subtle. If this was confusing, you can just ignore this part and just believe that it works. So, this says that given any two secret space, we can produce a stable augmented double secret space. We can actually also go back. This was already announced out loud. So, we can produce a simplish space out of any sigma space that will be two sigma if the input is stable augmented double sigma. Here's a construction. Even the sigma space can define something that by no coincidence I'm calling S dot of D, and it is going to be a special space. Here's how it's defined. Sn of D is a space where Is a space. What is this space? It's a mapping space from a certain sigma space P of delta n into d. Now maybe we're disappointed. The terms on the board were at least briefly described. Like I did tell you what P is whenever you input. What P is whenever you input any signature set or signature space. So you would have access to what that is, but it doesn't look familiar at all. However, if you try to spell out what P of delta n looks like, you will recognize the 1000 shapes that we have seen many times. So if I try to describe the sigma space corresponding to P delta 1, As a sigma space, this is something generated by a single object in the augmentation. That's it. Just that. P of delta 1 will be generated by the datum of two distinct objects in the augmentation. In the augmentation, one object not in the augmentation, and the horizontal and the vertical mortal. Now we start seeing that this simplicial object is capturing the same information that other flavors of S-Dot constructions were capturing. I will still draw P of delta 2 and P of delta 3. P of delta 2. has three objects in the augmentation, three other dots that are not in the augmentation, and some horizontal and vertical things as displayed. Now we have an interesting square appearing for the first time. The order of three It's the one that captures the bicartesum squares essentially. And you can guess how the pattern goes on. But this is again another magic moment for me because we kind of realized the adjunction as a formal thing at the point we had even forgotten about this dot and we were trying to just pack out what these p of the tanks were. We had a combinatorial description, and then, of course, when you try to draw it, that's what you get, and it will make sense. So, you could prove that if D is stable augmented double sigma space, then it says dot obstruction is to sigma. And I could say something. I could say something about the proof, but I'm not doing it in the interest of time. So what you could do is look back at the notes that you took during Victoria's talk, try to repeat the argument that she sketched, and realize that it had nothing to do with models. And really what you were using was the fact that certain squares were determined by parts of its boundary, the fact that the zero object mapped uniquely to things and received uniquely to things. To fields and receive uniquely to fields. So you could kind of reproduce the sketch of the argument that she gave to get a sense for why this should be too secure. So now we have discussed all the pieces. So if we were teaching our undergraduate students how to build a bijection or a correspondence between things, now we put up what are the two sides, what are the ways to go back and forth. And so the next thing to do to conclude that these two things are inverse to each other would be to check that if you start from one side, go and come back. One side, go and come back, you are taking back the original thing. And so you could prove that if you start with D being stable augmented double sigma space, then what you could do is you could do S dot to it, you could To it, you could do P to it, you could build a canonical map that maps to D. For a reason that you can imagine, I'm calling this epsilon. And this is going to be a level-wise equivalence. So you could really spell out what the elements of the generic entity of both sides look like and see that they see the same information. Right where Sagal is the dual part, namely x is to sigil. We have a unit from x to s dot of p of x. This is slightly more subtle because if you are doing things right and you are careful with the technicalities, you need to add redefining replacement to P, which we will Replacement to P, which we will not discuss. So you need to kind of correct the homotopy type of P. But you can prove that there is one such canonical map, and it's a levelwise with equivalence. So when you put things together, then you get what we wanted, that there's an equivalence. Of homotopy theories between stable augmented double silver spaces and are below. Are below two zero spaces. And the two constructions are the generalized Mordaunt construction on one side and this effect matrix built out of the path spaces. So if you had the feeling that many of the examples of two single spaces that you were dealing with were coming from S-dot constructions of something, this is not. Something, this is not coincidental because you could always, if you're willing to broaden your views, identify something that looks like an exact category and build a start of that. And if I have three minutes, I could say a bit about this one. Should I do it or should I stop? Okay, I'm gonna stop on the timeline anyways. So. So, honestly, it's not too hard to get a sense of either of the two theorems. Like, proving it rigorously requires a bit more pain, but just to get a sense, you could just try to write down what both are, and you probably believe that it's level-wise, we could. But let's just put on the board a quick idea for one. So, this is a map of sigma spaces. I'm claiming select-wise weak equivalence. And let's just stare at what this would look like in an interesting small component, namely 2,1. So, let's look at what this map should look like when we do 2,1. So an element of D21 is not too difficult. Say cute. Maybe I want 1, 2. Doesn't really worry much. An element of D12 is a little grid element. An element of P as dot of D12 represents the divided by 1. PS dot of D12 requires a bit more thinking. But if we unpack what things are, this is something in a score of D. So an element of a score of D looks like a 1000 shape with four elements on the diagonal. Looks like a much more complex object. What the map is doing is it's forgetting a lot of it and just focusing on this part. But am I one off? Ah, yes, thank you. I am one. Excuse me. Selecting zero. So it does look like on the left-hand side I have a lot more information, but once we get acquainted with this like calculus, where we recover missing information from the existing pieces of the diagram, we see that we are not really losing any information because here I have a unique map that can go from an augmented. That can go from an augmentation to this point. So I could recover this bit. But if I recover this bit, then I could pull back and recover this one. And then I could use the augmentation property again to recover this top part. And we see we are arguing that it would recover the bottom. So this is obviously just one instance, but it kind of showcases that the phenomenon that it seems like you're throwing away information, but you're throwing away information that is redundant. Information that is returned, so you can get it back as you want. 11:30, I'm perfectly on time, but I can take questions. So I have two questions. One about something that's on the board, and one about something that we can erase. The thing that's on the board, if I decided to watch the set instead of space versions of this talk, is there still some kind of equivalence? Is there still some kind of equivalence in what happens to this fibrous replacement? Yeah, there's no fibrous replacements there. If you are in Second Land, these are isomorphisms. You get an equivalence of MAC lane categories, like really old school categories. Here you have double categories that are stable and documented. And here you have two single sets. You have to be careful that the stability condition in the strict setting is super strict, almost. Is super strict, almost nothing verifies it. Like, you may think that if you input an exact category, you're gonna get a stable augmented category because composition is strict. But the stability condition is not verified strictly because, as Victoria was pointing out, every time that you pull back, you have potentially influenced choices or the problem of pullbacks. And then, sorry, second question: Is there a way? Is there a way, since you said the word double category anyways, is there some notion of nerve that beats a double category and spits out a double single space? You can spit out simplicial set. Okay. But you will not, like if you lack stability and dogmation, you will not be able to get to SQL. So you can take the double category and you can take Category, and you can take more or less level-wise nerves, and this will provide you with some double CO space. You need to do something then. If you want to do something to yourself, maybe Brandon has actually, yeah, okay. Yes, something very similar to this will come up later today. Cool. Yeah, please. I'm not sure if I understood the conversation, but if you try to think of one single space as sitting inside of the right-hand side, can you identify what? The right-hand side, can you identify what the left-hand side would be? So, I can tell you what my idea was before the splitting discussion that happened this morning that confused me. So, before that discussion, I thought I would get... So every time you are in here, you could define what an extension is. You could say that the space of extensions is D11 times D00 D negative 1. D negative 1. How am I coming up with this? The generic element would be this one. So this is what would deserve the name of an exact sequence in this context. And so if it's sigal, in particular it would imply that if I fix two objects up to homotopy, there is a unique expression. To homotopy, there is a unique extension. Does that fit with people's intuition? So it would be a restricted setup where I think it's fair to say that in particular split if it's signal. Is this correct? But the other way around, it seems like it's more subtle. Yeah, sorry, you don't seem happy with the answer, but that's all I can give you. Does it make sense? Personally. Okay, we can talk more about it. So, a different question. Does this equivalence of home to be theories that's on the board, does it arise from some wonderful? Rice from some woolen equivalence between? Yeah, we do it with Woolen equivalents. You could decide to bypass model category machinery and probably just do everything in 50 categories, but you cannot put back model categories. So yes, it's a green equivalence. And it's what you would think. We start with injecting model structures on both sides, and on one side we localize with respect to signality, and on this side we localize with respect to the maps that co-represent all the... the maps that co-represent all the conditions that we put on the board. And this is right quill and it's actually a lower star, upper star of the drought for the speed structure. Are there any other questions for my opinion? Just The third one is around what you see as much as sure you could bypass it, but then I think if you don't want to invoke that pullback at all, you would have to kind of reprove your mitarga. Of reprove unitality in that case. But yes, maybe I should have mentioned this. When we did this, it was not known yet that every two single space was unital. So really we proved an equivalence with unital two single spaces. But then we learned that this is redundant, so now I tailor the talk to the bypass that I'm going to do. Ah, so you're trying to see what it corresponded to. I'm guessing you would have to involve this type of retract argument, but it doesn't I don't have a lot of intuition for it. But you could just take the proof of every tubercle space is unital and play the same trick and try to reread these as structure maps for the x, but I didn't try this. I also didn't really read the proof that I read to see what I'm. Read the proof that every two siblings object is unitar, but I think it involves one of these cancellations or interactive pullbacks. To me, it is not very natural what has happened on the left-hand side. You know, as Matina was saying, we can redo this, but I don't see any natural explanation. Final revisions on this paper was right when we found out, and we tried to sort. Out, and we tried to sort of remove the word throughout. We found couldn't, I mean, we just said, well, this is a consequence, is all it's holds on extra condition. But we still found it very useful to refer to it. A stable augmented triple space. Stable augmented what? Triple space. Double space. Did we try this? So are you going for like higher zero spaces? I think we thought about it a little bit and we didn't get to anything. But we had a conversation at that point. I don't think I have anything. Stability and organizations are more complicated than. Or mutations are more complicated than, but I think at least my failure is I don't know what the more complicated should be. My other problem is that I don't have a sense for what a higher signal space should be. Like here I started with an example that I have a sense for and I was not able to say anything meaningful because I don't have intuition for what Hiercus says. It would be very nice if this Another related question was to you to do a scale fragmented double 2C rotations. That actually also produces something interesting on the right hand side. There's something about the existence of deck there's there are two decks, but but not three. I wonder what the other um well then I I think right. I think, as you pointed out, this is a game about taking some of the ordinal sum of like copies of delta. And it's somehow just about understanding the structure of this junction. If you sort of point extensions along it. I think it would be very nice, but I don't know. So various siegel conditions in all kinds of directions. Notion of stable when you go to triple things, there's at least two different notions of stable. There's at least two different notions of streaming you can think of. You can think of tacos that have faces or tacos that only I actually also started thinking about triple categories. I mean this quick set and I yes, I like she said I wanted to see how if you could say something, but I also have no idea how what a three single set would be. So but I am very interested in in doing something with triple categories. I mean if something if other people are interested to like take a look at so it seems like maybe there's a lot to explore here we can put a pin on this and come back in our open problem session yes i mean in particular after toby gives his result tomorrow i think that's going to be very useful for the problem right so let's think more team again to give you
