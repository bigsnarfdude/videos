Of what I'm going to present to you today. So, I'm going to introduce you to the problem of electromagnetic gravitational perturbations of Kern-Newman black hole in classical black hole perturbation theory. And in fact, try to explain also why that problem was not solved back then. And in fact, presents what were the obstacles in finding separated equations and what Chandra Sekar called the apparent indissolubility of coupling between spin one. Is solubility of coupling between spin one and spin two fields. And then I'm trying to go and move to a new approach that I had to solve this problem, which is a physical space analysis of those electromagnetic gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Neumann through the Nyes of the Tukovsk equation and the Regulator equations. Okay, so let me start by reminding everyone what is the Kernoum black hole and what is the main protagonist of this talk. You know, the main protagonist of this talk, and the Kernuman metric is given by this expression. As you can see, it's totally identical to the Kerr metric, where now the delta here involves the curve part, but there is also the presence of a charge Q. So, in fact, the Kern Neumann metric is a three-parameter family of sojourn-funded Einstein Maxwell equation. So, now we have the mass. So now we have the mass m, the rotation a, and the charge q. And as it's written here, it's a solution to S and Maxwell equations. So each, the Ricci purvas is non-zero, but it's source by a quadratic expression to an anti-symmetric two tensor that is called electromagnetic tensor that satisfies Maxwell equations. This Kern-Newman metric is somewhat important because it represents stationary, rotating, and charged black hole. And in fact, it generates. Charge black hole, and in fact, it generalizes all the pretty much all the explicit black hole solutions that we have as solutions to the energy and vacuum or Maxwell equation. So it generalizes a Kerr space-time. If you plug in Q equals zero, generalizes Reison-Arnstrom, if you plug in A equals zero, and if you have both A and Q equals zero, of course, you get Schwarzenegger. So, really, Kernuman metric is the most general explicit black hole solution that we have. And so, for this reason, you know, it's been For this reason, you know, it's been, of course, it's been part of the study of the black hole perturbation theory as it was done, especially in the 60s and 70s as analysis of perturbations of these known solutions, such as shoreshield, Keras, and Osman-Kernuman. But what I am going to show you is how Kern-Neumann actually stands up as being different from these other solutions, even though they look pretty similar. So, they look pretty similar. The necromancer looks pretty similar to the other ones. In fact, you know, if we try to go back to black hole perturbation theory, and for example, we open this book by John DeSecard, the Radical Theory of Black Holes, that contains pretty much all the results from back then. So, this book was published in 1983 and contains all the most of the results prior to that. Or even, like, you know, if you imagine opening this book, you know, looking at the index. Opening this book, you know, looking at the index, you can already see that the Kernuman is different from the other three solutions. Why? Because there is, you can see that there is a chapter, you know, see this chapter four or about 70 pages, or you know, see that it's about the perturbation of Schwarzschild black hole. Then there is a chapter, again, another 70 pages or so about the Racing Rostrum solution that contains also its perturbation. And then there is an entire chapter, gravitational perturbations of curves. Entire chapter, gravitational perturbations of curved black columns, something like 100 pages. And then there is no chapter on electromagnetic gravitational perturbations of Kerneumann. Okay, so you actually have to go to the end of the book, last chapter, that it's called Other Solutions, Other Methods. And there is one subsection that it's called the Kernman solution of a few pages. And then there is another subsection of, this is like maybe four pages, that says the equations governing the council diplomatic rotational perturbation. Governing the couple of data medication of perturbations of Kern Human space-time. And that's it. That's what you'll find in this book, which I'm deciding. And so now let's, I want to explain a little bit of why is Kernuuman different and in fact its perturbations and the nice of its perturbations were not solved by the black core perturbation community. So let's start just to remind ourselves what were the perturbations even on Schwarzschild. On a Schwarzschild. Well, in a Schwarzschild, for example, you could treat a perturbation of Schwarzschild just looking at metric perturbations. So you have, for example, you can write a general metric of this form and separate it into different cases, but into different dependence on different functions on the coefficients of this metric. And something that was found by Reggie Wheeler is that the axial perturbations, so those which Axial perturbations, so those which only modify this part here of the metric, so that this WQ2Q3, are governed by what is now called the Reggie-Wheeler equation. That it's this very nice looking wave equation. So it's, you see, a Dalmersian on the Schwarzschild metric equal to some very nice positive potential. And then there is also the Zerilli equation that covers the polar perturbations, but I'm not going to. But I'm not going to remind you about that, but because you see, this Reggie-Wheeler equation is the one that is going to play a central role in what comes next for Kern Newton. And in general, I'm going to call a Reggie-Wheeler equation any equation that is such a nice form that version lines a positive real potential. Okay, so this is what happened in metric perturbation of the perturbation of scoreshield actually decouple in metric perturbations. In metric perturbations, you can analyze these equations in modes and separate modes and analyze their model stability. If you want to do perturbations of care instead, you cannot do, they do not separate at the level of metric perturbations. What you have to do, you have to go at the level of curvature. Or, you know, using the Newman-Perens formalism, you want to decompose the curvature into biscalar, by scalars, which are n-spin coefficients with respect to a null basis, like n are to null vectors. For example, L and N are two null vectors. M is now a null complex vector that you know you should think of it as being tangent to L and N and orthogonal to say the spheres. And they have some corresponding derivatives. In fact, what was found by Tokovsky is that the relevant vial scalars given by the capital of Psi 0 and Psi 4 for gravitational perturbations and similarly for electromagnetic perturbations, the Electromagnetic perturbations, the uh what are called the phi zero and phi two, which are really the construction of the electromagnetic tensor with these null vectors L and M, L and N, they are very relevant because they satisfy this decoupled equation that is in the Tukovsky equation. And this component, so this curvature component psi zero and psi four, so the ones that satisfy the Tukovsky equation are actually some rescaling of it. Of it, but they are quantities of spin plus and minus two. So Z0 is a spin two, and T4 is a minus two. And similarly, for the electromagnetic perturbation, you have components of spin plus and minus one. So this changes the coefficients of the Tokovsk equation, which depends on the spin. But again, the Tukov equation is pretty nice, but not as nice as the Reggie-Willer equation, one could say. So you see, you have a Dalamversion, which is, of course, its proper of the, you know, the... It's proper of the, you know, the in fact that we're talking about some wave phenomena, so there is a wave operation. But now there is not just a potential, there is also, there are also a bunch of first-order terms in dr and d phi and dt. And they appear precisely with this in this expression of the Tokovsk equation. And in general, we will call the Tokovsk equation, an equation of this formal et alamversion, a bunch of first-order terms in the R defined dt plus the potential. T plus the potential. Okay, so and this Tapovsky equation was can also be studied by looking at you know mode stability and you know separated modes. And that's all we're going to say here. So the advantage of these equations that really they can be separated in modes because the double version part in fact can be separated, meaning that if you assume as an answer that your solution is written in this way, so you have the dependence in t and its frequency omega. In theta, its frequency omega, the dependence on phi, and its antimuter frequency m, and then just some functions of r and theta separately, then this unsat plugged in inside the equation actually gives you two separated ODE, one ODE for the angular part S and one radio D for the function R. And the angular ODE for S are, this is precisely the definition of spherological harmonics in general. So those are solutions are, in fact, eigenfunction. Uh, solutions are in fact eigenfunctions of a certain operator with some eigenvalues, and this is and this is how it goes if you want to prove mod stability, which is the statement that there are no mode solutions with finite energy at time zero and imaginary partner omits greater than zero, which are exponentially growing in time. Okay, and so this is this is what was obtained. So, these mod stability results were obtained by Schwarzschild, Resinoshen, and Kerr. Shear as an Osman and Kerr, and you can do. So, in the case of Schwarzschief, you can also do for magic perturbation, so using the Reggie-Wiener, the Villa equation. And in the case of Kerr, you want to use a neuron perus formalism, as was obtained by Tukovsky, Bernard-Preston, Zasek, and then the definitive proof of most stability by Whiting. And just, you know, as a comment, you know, from the mathematician comment saying that, you know, the statement of most stability is not conclusive in general for non-mode. In general, for non-mode solutions, so for any solution, like if you're just asking for any general solution of your equation, well, the model submit is not conclusive for that because you cannot translate statements at the level of individual modes to a superposition infinitely maintained modes. So it is not as strong as one would like, but still, nevertheless, it's the first type of stability that you can think of. But if you were able to, for example, prove that general solutions instead of Example prove that general solutions instead are bounded, then this would be a stronger result than modest stability. Okay, let's see what happened in the case of Curneu. Once we say there were results for short-shift rise in Nordstrom and Kerr. So if we jump to these few pages that I told you that are in Chanda Sagar's book about the equations governing up to 20-day gravitational perturbations of Curneuma, we see in these pages, if I'm under 80 of the book, he writes the methods that prove to be society. He writes: The methods that proved to be so successful in treating gravitational perturbations of Kerr do not seem to be applicable for treating the coupled gravitational perturbations of Curneoma. The principal obstacle is in finding separated equations. And then he says we should briefly consider the origin of this apparently dissolubility of coupling between spin one and spin two fields. If we go on, you see in the next page, he tries to, he starts doing whatever he did before for Kerr, so just deriving the Tukovsky equation. Okay, so he starts, he derives. Okay, so he starts, he derives it in these two pages, and then if we can zoom here at the end, it says all efforts to look out on these equations were not successful. Numerous other alternative manipulations of the systems were equally unsuccessful. And that's pretty much how it ends. And this is also pretty much how this problem has been since then, since the 80s. And so really, what goes wrong in Kern-Neumann? What is really so different between Kerr-Neumann and Ker or Reison Austral? And K or Isenostrum that makes this whatever we were doing before not work now. Well, we, of course, the per-Newman metric is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equation, right? So, and the Einstein-Maxwell equation governs interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. So you can think of the gravitational radiation as being encoded on the left-hand side of your anchor-Maxwell equations, in the Ricci curvature term, and the electromagnetic radiation being encoded in your right-hand side. So, in all these terms that involve the electromagnetic. These terms that involve the electromagnetic component F. And we know from, you know, from, for example, the study of the Tukovsk equation and for gravitational and the electromagnetic perturbations occur, we know that the gravitational radiation is a spin-two field and the electromagnetic radiation is a spin-one field. And we know, because Tokovsky showed it, that when those two fields are taken independently, they satisfy, they both satisfy Tokovsk equations being respectively two, plus and plus minus two and plus two. V two plus and plus minus two and plus and minus one. So they satisfy this nice cost equation equal to zero. But here that's not what we're doing, we're not taking them independently. So, what we want to do is we want to do electromagnetic gravitational perturbation for black holes. We want to allow for a black hole to have some radiation that is also in the form either of either of gravitational or electromagnetic. So, there has to be an interaction between this pin 2 gravitational field. Let's say that it's going to be this red gravitational field, psi 2, and Gravitational field psi two and a spin one electromagnetic field, some some blue, this blue electromagnetic spin one field. So we're not going to have two independent the cost equations, but what we should expect, we should expect to have a system of coupled to cost equation of which form where a form, a form like like the following. So we can imagine to have the Turkas equation of spin one for our curvature, our electromagnetic field of spin one, being sourced by Being sourced by something that involves the gravitational addition. But now the gravitational addition is a spin two field, so we cannot simply say that this is sourced by psi two. There has to be applied an operator that lowers its spin, that it makes this psi two field be, you know, have an operator that its output is a spin one field. And that's, for example, the operator delta bar. So that's the derivative along the m-bar complex conjugate con. Complex conjugate of m vector field. So, this is lower, it's a lowering spin operator. So, we can expect that to have a token equation sourced by something like that, the delta bar opsi2. And similarly, to have the tokowski equation for epsi2 sourced by, we want it to be sourced by epsi one, epsi one is spin one, so we need it to be we need to be applied to a to a raising spin operator, such as delta, for example. Okay, so this is the capacity. Okay, so this is the couple kind of couple Tukovsky equation that we expect, that we expect that we're going to have in Carneuma. And remember, so in what Chanda Sager was doing and what people in the black pole perturbation community were doing, they were decomposing in modes, right? They were taking the Futokovsky variable or whatever spin it was, decomposing it into this expression, and this will give us an angular OD for this S, which For this s, which would define the spheroidal harmonics as eigenfunctions of this, you know, this kind of modified Laplacian. And now, if the a is equal to zero, so if there's no rotation, those spheroidal harmonics reduce to the spherical harmonics. And if you have spherical harmonics, then very spherical harmonics of different spins. So spherical harmonics refer to see eigenfunctions of the Laplacian for complex functions of spin one and two, but they are simply related. So in fact, if you raise, if you raise. So in fact, if you raise the spin of a spherical harmonic of spin one, you get something that is proportional to the spherical harmonic of spin two. And on the other and the other way around, it's also true. So if you lower the spin of a spherical harmonic of spin two, you get something that's proportional to the spherical harmonic of spin one. So this is what happens in the case of spherical symmetry. This is nothing else than the odd theory, odd theory of spheres. But on the other hand, if you're in the general axisymmetric case, so if A is not zero, So, if A is not zero, then the spin-weight and spheroidal harmonics of different spins are not simply related. There is no such thing, you cannot simply apply this operator and expect to have something that is proportional to your spheroidal harmonics on different spins. So now you may start, you know, kind of see where the problem was then back then, because if we look at Reisen-Nordstrom, Reisen-Nordstrom is nice, spherically symmetric. So, if you have this coupled system of the cost equation, then you can you Then you can, and you separate in modes, you separate in spherical harmonics. Now, since you have this operator on the right-hand side, this actually gives you something that is proportional to the spherical harmonic of spin one. So if you're separating with respect to the spherical harmonic of spin one, you actually get something that only involves at the end of the day spherical harmonics of spin one. And similarly for the second equations. Now in Ker, you're in axial C, you have axial symmetry, so you have rotation, you have spheroidal harmonics, but you only have a toposomic. Harmonics, but you only have a Tokovsk equation of spin two. It's a Tokovsk equation equal to zero. So you just have, you know, your spheroid harmonic of spin two. There's no interaction between the two. But in Kern Newman, now you see you have both these things combined. You have now a couple system that involves the spheroidal harmonics. So if you want to separate in those modes, you see that you have a Tokovsky equation of spin one applied to a spheroid harmonic of spin one. This is sourced by now something, now the Now the lower spin operator applied to a spheroidal harmonic of spin two. But this now is not simply related to the spheroidal harmonic of spin one. So you just, this depression mode does not pass through. It does, the equations do not decouple. And the way, see, you should really understand this problem is that the mode decomposition is not your friend. So for what are the most general perturbations you can think of of black holes, so the electron and anti-gravitational perturbation. Black holes or the electromagnetic gravitational perturbations of Kernuman, well, the decomposition remotes, which very understandably was done to simplify the analysis of the equation, well, in this case, actually makes them unsolvable. And so our approach to solve this issue is to abandon the decomposition modes and perform a physical space analysis instead. Of course, so we can do that just because we were here in 2021 and not, you know, in the 80s as Chandra Secker, and there'd been so much progress in the analysis of the wave equation backward backward. In the analysis of the wave equation backward backgrounds in the last 15 years, which allow us to do that, to try to explore this problem in physical space without doing decomposition remotes. And in fact, if you remember before I said that mod stability, yes, is good, but it's not the best thing you can hope for. And in fact, if you can have a physical space analysis that doesn't involve mod stability, then you can prove boundedness. And if you can prove boundedness of a general solution, this will in particular imply mode stability. This will, in particular, imply more stability. So, it will be a stronger statement. And so, again, as a mathematician comment, of course, this in particular will make mathematician very happy to know that her proof of boundaries of solutions through some methods that are somehow stronger than most stability is indeed needed to even prove modestability because of this mode decomposition that doesn't pass us through. Okay, so what, how, how does the physical Okay, so what how does the physical space analysis work? Well, first thing you want to identify what are the quantities that satisfy, what are the Tukovsky variables in this case, the quantities that satisfy this coupled system of Tukovsky equations. And this is something that is not clear at all at first. Why? Because these Tubowski variables should at least be somewhat gauge invariant. So they should be invariant under infinitesimal theater transformations. Why? Because they represent some radiation. know they represent some radiation so they should not depend dramatically on the on the on the coordinates right on on the on the choice of frame if you uh remember uh in newman parasformalism you have we have three type of you know telejohn transformation they one where l is fixed one is n is fixed and the third one is the variation of is there is a conformal rescaling of l and n and associated to each of these fetal transformations you can you know compute how each curvature component How each curvature component changes. And in particular, for example, the site 0 and z4, the ones that satisfy the Tukowski equation in the gravitational radiation, are quadratically invariant because you see that psi 0 doesn't change through, let's say, applying the first form, the first class, and the second class is symmetric. You know, the psi 4 changes here, but you see it changes only by terms that if, you know, if A is small, so you can think of A, so this change. So you can think of A, so this change of frame as an O epsilon change of frame. So an infinitesimal tetra transformation. So each of these A and B are O epsilon. Then here you see anything that changes the psi 4 is actually of size epsilon square. It's O epsilon and now it's multiplied by Psi 3, which is zero in the background. So it's another epsilon quantity. So these are all changed by quadratic terms. So they are quadratic and invariant. So that's why there's also a consideration. That's why there's also a considerable gauge invariant, the psi 0 and psi 4. But now, in the case of Carnuman, those are not enough to describe the full perturbation. And you may think, okay, that's fine. We have psi 0, psi 4, and then we have the phi 0 and φ2, right? So the ones that satisfy the Tupac equation for the electromagnetic perturbations occur. Well, no, those are not good in this case. If your charge is different from zero, those are non-invariant under infinitesimal rotation, because you can see here, zero. rotation because you can see here rode zero a this is invariant here but but the phi zero but the phi two now here has a uh it changes by this term a times phi one and now phi one is not zero in the background so this is not an epsilon quantity and a is only o epsilon so it is only changes by epsilon it doesn't change by epsilon squared so it's it's it's it it it is it changes completely because you know we're only we're looking at points that are already o epsilon and we're changing by something that is o epsilon are changing by something that is O epsilon. So this is really a gauge-dependent quantity. It cannot represent radiation, it cannot represent something that is a wave-like if it's so dependent on coordinates. So we have to come up with a different definition for the spin one field. And in fact, what it turns out is that in Kern-Neumann, there is a definition of these two quantities of spin two and spin one, which are actually, which happen to be gauge invariant. Which happen to be gauge invariant, and are the ones that you need to get a nice system of Turkovsky equation. So it doesn't matter what is the definition of which one. I mean, the only thing I really want to show is that this quantity of spin two involves electromagnetic radiation and this quantity of spin one involves both electromagnetic and curvature. And in Chandra Sera's book, he was actually using the phantom gauge. So he was pinning up a gauge at the beginning to even the It was picking up a gauge at the beginning to even derive the equations. The fact on gauge where 5, 0, and 5 are identified zero. And this, in fact, prevented also to detect such gauge invariant quantities. So he was just going through the derivation of using site 0 and side 4, and somehow then couldn't get through the fact that you needed some more gauge involved in quantities to describe these perturbations. And in fact, the spin is not the only thing that matters. know the spin is not the only thing that matters in Kernoma what is important is also the conformal type so you remember this this third this rotation of plus three where you change the you change the L and N conformally well then the Tukovsky variables the psi 0 F and B they get changed in this way so the psi 0 is equal to the minus 2 so and we say it's a conformant type 2 but the f and b are of conformant type 1 and so for for those three Tutowsky variables we can for for all for all three have this table where we write Have this table where we write what's their spin and what's their conformal type. And you see, the side zero and then the b are like the standard kind of standard quantities which are the same spin and conformal type, while f is a little bit of a strange piece that is a spin two quantity but conformal type one. And in fact, what happens in the case of pernumin is that the Tilkovsky equation gets modified and it depends on the conformal type as well as the spin type. So this is the new Tilkovsky equation. So, this is the new Tsukov equation that we got in Newman. You see here, the conformal type appears in whatever is whatever in front of the real part of the first order terms, while the spin involves, it appears in front of the imaginary part of the first order terms. And of course, in the case of curve, since they only apply to quantities at the same spin and conformal type, Spin and conformal type, you we only, you know, Tukowski just define, you know, Tukowski equations on a certain speed. But in this case, we needed both the spin and the conformal type. And if we make this definition, then the Tukovsky equations which are governing the electromagnetic gravitational perturbations are precisely this one. So we have some Tukovsk equation for B that is sourced by F, Tukovsky equation for F that is sourced by side zero, Tukovsk equation for site zero that is sourced by F. zero that is sourced by f and it's only this last equation that induces the tokowski equation in ker when q is equal to zero when q is equal to zero this is you get the standard tokowski equation group sine zero equal to zero but in uh so of course this is what we obtain as you know system of uh equations for uh some gauging variant quantities but remember our our we cannot separate in modes right because because there is this interaction with the spheroidal harmonics with different spin so of course Monics with different speed. So if we look at this system and we clearly then we ask ourselves, well, can we then know the composed modes? Can we perform a physical space analysis of this system? Well, unfortunately, no. Well, why? Because let's try to remember what does it mean to do, for example, estimates in physical space. Let's say you have even the wave operator in Minkowski space equal to, let's say, box of size equal to zero. Then how you obtain energy? Energy, for example, abundance of the energy for such an equation. Well, you multiply by d tip sign and you integrate by parts, right? So you get zero equal to this. So if you write the box operator, you know, let's say in 1D in this way, you see that if you integrate by parts in t, you actually create some time derivative of a positive. So this is of an energy density. Okay, so this gives conservation of the energy. And if you had a Energy. And if you had the nice equation that I said, you know, we call a Regime equation, you actually do the same identical thing because you still have a box of minus a positive, membrane, a positive potential. Then when you integrate, you multiply by the T P C and integrate by parts, this gives you again the conservation of a positive, so a cursive energy density. But if you're trying to do that to the cost equation, so if you have this bunch of first-order terms, then you just cannot. Order term, then you just cannot, there is no integration by parts that will do the job, right? So you cannot directly obtain boundedness here. And this is a problem that already appears in Schwarzschild and K. So one, as a general, you know, goal, one would like to pass from a Tukovsky equation that is not as good, right, as a downversion as potential equal to this first set of terms, into a regular equation that only has the potential. And this is nothing else. So this. And this is nothing else. So, this transformation, in fact, exists. And it's what Chandra Secker called the transformation theory from Newman Perro's perturbation, which is the Togalski equation, to the metric perturbation, which is the Red Jubilee equation. And so this is, you know, some, the way he wrote it, right? So he said to express the solution of an equation of this form. So the first line, this line is how he writes the Dukovsk equation into a one-dimensional wave equation. So into something that is just a regular wave. Into something that is just a red Julian equation. And so, this is something that already Shandosecker identified back then in mode stability, but it was only introduced in physical space by Rafermos Oltzegeroniansky in Schwarzschild and then in Kerr in physical space, so something that does not depend on the composition modes. And this passage really allows to prove boundeness for solution to Kovsky equation passing through the Red Jumil equation. Okay, so that's precisely what we can do here as well. Here as well. So we can look at the Canuman case. We start with our system. And in fact, what's interesting here is that we only need to transform the first two. So the only equation that was in common with Kerr, we actually discarded. So we only look at the two equations that are nil now in Kern Newman, and we can transform, so get this, apply this Chandra-Cycle transformation. So now what does the Chandler-Cycle transformation? What is the Schmander-Segger transformation? Is a transformation that consists of taking ingoing null derivatives of these equations. And since B and F, as I said before, conform of type 1, as opposed to site 0, is conformable type 2. Now here, the Januser transformation consists integrally only one derivative indeed going down direction, so with some rescale functions. And if you do that, then the system of these first two equations actually gets saved. First, two equations actually get simplified and the dependence on the psi zero gets cancelled, and we obtain something that we call a generalized Reggie-Wheeler system because we have some Dalamversian minus potential, see Dalampersian minus potential. Now we still have a first order term, which okay, maybe you can think it's dead. And then we have some coupling term between the Q and P. So if we define the P and Q, this P and Q, this Chandler Sega transformed. And now I guess that's what. And now, I guess that's what my last slide or so is just to convince you that this system is good enough to do some physical space analysis. Okay, well, how do we, again, how do we do a physical space analysis? These are all complex scalars. So let's, the way we want to do some energy estimates to multiply the first equation by dtp bar and then take the real part, multiply the second equation by dtq bar and take the real part. A tactile part. Well, if we do that, then let's look at this first-order term. So we may worry that this first-order term is bad because at the end of the day, the Takovsk equation was bad because it had a first-order term. But this is a very special first-order term. It's from I times a real function dtq times dtq bar. And you can see that, in fact, when you take the real part of this, so the first two terms, first of all, okay, they just behave like the Regulator equation. So those are good. Equation. So those are good. And on this first order term, because of this structure, because they have the structure i times the real function dtp times dtp bar, they cancel out when you take the real, they actually have real part equal to zero. So this first order term is pretty good. So the left-hand side is fine. Now what about the right-hand side? Now in the right-hand side, we have some coupling term. So we, of course, we cannot opt to estimate each one separately. What we want to do is One separately, what we want to do is that to do the estimates of these two equations and sum them. So we have this, we multiply the first one by dtp bar and the second one by dtq bar and then sum these two equations. And what happens is that because of the specific structure of this, so let me sorry, let me just go to the system. So you see this specific structure, which is in particular in front of this operator here, you see we have these two functions that are one conjugate, complex conjugate of each other. And these two operators, delta and delta bar, are actually. Operator, delta and delta bar are actually a joint operator on the horizontal structure on the space that is orthogonal to your principal narr frame L and N. And so we use this factor to actually show that when we add the two equations, well, by integrating by parts in dt and integrating by parts in delta, so in a certain sense, really using the fact integrating by parts in the in the angular derivative, if you. The angular derivative, if you want, or using the fact that those are joint to vector, we can cancel out these coupling terms and only obtain boundary terms. And that's, of course, and boundary terms are not, you know, you cannot just simply throw them away, you can show that you have to still check these boundary terms. They go and modify your definition of energy. And in fact, this is something that I first linearized in Northstone in the full sub-extremal range to show that these boundary terms actually make. That these boundary terms actually make allow you to define a positive energy, and for a very small A, the boundaries of positive energy can also be obtained in Kernoman, and those terms can be absorbed for small A. And so with this, I just finish with some conclusion, that conclusions that, you know, in order to overcome these issues of indissolubility of coupling between spin one and spin two fields that Sean Dazeker talked about, for this, the most For this, the most general case of electromagnetic gravitational perturbations of per Newman, we derive our approaches to derive non-separated equations. So, look at something that does not depend on gauge, then does not depend on mode separation, and we really aim to analyze them in physical space. And those equations are a system of three coupled to cost equation, and they are now differently from the Kerr case. They depend on both the spin and the conformal type, but for which, unfortunately, physical space. For which, unfortunately, physical space estimates cannot be obtained. But then we're able to transform them using this Chandler-Sero transformation into a two-coupled generalized virtual real equations, which crucially have some real potential and first-order terms of the form I dt, like in Ker, and coupling terms which are joint, just like in Reisen-Nostrum. So, this somehow the decomposition modes that was done back then prevent. Back then, prevented to see this good structure that happens instead in physical space. And so, thanks to all those favorable properties, one can obtain abundance of the energy, also space-time energy decay estimates for a small A bypassing the field attempt to move stability. And I just repeat this, this proves a stronger result because this proves some boundedness for all solutions to this system and not just the separated ones, the mulstability ones. So, in particular, in The mod stability ones, so in particular, implies in a certain sense a mod stability. And with this, I conclude. Thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you, Elena. Let's see if we have questions for Elena. Cindy has one over here. Okay, go ahead, Cindy. Hi there, Elena. I wanted to ask: is there any way to relate the work? Is there any way to relate the work that you've done here to the killing structure separability stuff that Kubizhnik and Kurtush and Prolov are doing in just plain curve backgrounds? Yeah, I'm not sure about the other. So you say separability, which kind of separability do you refer to? I didn't really get that. So basically, they were working on using the killing. They were working on using the Killing structure. So, in the case of four dimensions, it's just the existence of the Killing-Yano tensor in order to build separability for Maxwell equations just in a plain curve background. That same object doesn't exist in Kerr-Newman, but something related or that solves a weaker equation might. So I'm wondering if there's any relationship you can build with it and what you've been able to do here. Yeah, I'm not sure about that precisely, but for all. But that precisely, but of course, I mean, in here, we have it is somewhat hidden the fact that Kernuman also has a Carter tensor, for example, so a killing tensor, just like Kerr. And so, in particular, the box, so the number per se is several as a consequence of having a character tensor in addition to the constant of motions for geodesics. So, the motion of geodesics is integrable and so on. Is integrable and so on. So that allows you to separate the down version. But of course, here the problem is that it doesn't separate because you just don't have just the down version, you have down version equal to then some operators that does not separate. So that's where they should present it comes from. But I'm not sure about how this would relate to some of the regressions of a teleter. So yeah, I don't. So, yeah, I don't know. Okay, I can ask you more about it later. Any other questions? So, if not, let's thank Elena again. And so, I've put the coffee break link in the chat again. Coffee break link in the chat again. So feel free.
