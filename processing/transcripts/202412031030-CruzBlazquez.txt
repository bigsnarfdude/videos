To bring me here to Ban. This is a wonderful place. This is actually my very first time in America. And so far, this experience has been great. So thank you very much. Also for letting me contribute to the amazing conference. I'm feeling really, really lucky and I really want to send you this opportunity. So I wanted to dedicate my time to talk about the cut-down border problems of manifolds of dimension n greater or equal to n three with a boundary. With a boundary, which is also known as the problem of prescribing the scalar and boundary mean curvatures via conformal differentials of metric. This is a problem that arises in conformal geometry, but unfortunately we are going to pose it as a PDE and we are going to study it using the calculus of providation. So there will be a lot of analysis in this talk. Okay, during this talk I will mention some works that have been done in collaboration with Professor Luca Bataglia and John Lisa. Professor Luca Bataglia, Andrea Listoya, Andrea Malchioli, David Rubit, and Ju Caria. And all of them are publicly available through Archive, for instance. Okay, so after a short review on the classical version of this problem, that is the one for closed manifolds, compact without the boundary, the talk will be divided into two main, two different shaded parts. First, I will introduce the problem and I will talk about the original approach that we are going to follow. The variational approach that we are going to follow, and we'll present some existing results via minimization. And in dimension 3, and this dimensional restriction is going to be pretty important during the first part of the talk, we will perform a detailed low-up analysis and obtain existent results thanks to the multi-pascal. In the second part of the talk, I will concentrate on the particular case of the unit ball over n for any dimensions, in which we are going to prescribe a scalar curvature that is a Scalar curvature that is a small to the region of minus one via Ali Avonov-Smith's finite-dimensional reduction. Okay, so I need to point here. Okay, so for starters, let us think of mg to be a closed Riemannian manifold, so compact with the boundary of dimension n greater or equal to 3. Then, a classical problem that arises from geometry. Then, a classical problem that arises in geometry is to try to understand what functions defined on the manifold can be assumed as this colour curvature of the manifold with respect to a metric that is in the conformal class of the background one. Or equivalently, give me a function k defining the manifold, and we try to understand if there is any conformal metric to the original one, that has k as its color curvature. If we choose the conformal metric t tilde to be of the form u to the 4 over n minus 2, where u has to be positive because we are interested in Riemannian metrics, then this problem is equivalent to solve this elliptic equation that has already appeared in the GE and Johannes Talks, which is the scalar curvature equation. That involves the differential operator that is the Laplace perturbing. Differential operator that is the Laplace-Bertramian operator. Also, the starting scalar curvature is G. And here the nonlinearity is the critical solid exponent for m minus 1. A first remark that is in order is that we cannot put any function k that we want in this equation and expect existence of solutions, because, for instance, there are restrictions for the sign of this described curve depending on a conformal invariant of. depending on a conformal invariant of the manifold that is called the the Jamabi class or the conformal class of this manifold. Probably the most famous version of this problem is the one called the Jamabi problem, that is the case of prescribing a constant scalar curvature that would be like the analog of the uniformization current that exists for surfaces. And this case was completely understood thanks to the work by Jamao, Trovinger, Awan and Shen. On the other hand, when we consider a function that is not constant, this problem receives the name of the Kaplan-11 problem and has been solved only in particular situations. For instance, we know that it's always possible to prescribe a negative scalar curvature of manifolds that are negative conformally invariant, and this is like the easy case. While the case of prescribing a positive scalar curvature k is still open, we have both. We have both partial existence results and also non-trivial abstractions to the existence of solutions. In this case, there is one particular example that is especially challenging, that is the Niedenberg problem or the case of the standard sphere because of the non-compact action of the matrix group of the sphere. That is to say, consider for instance in the standard sphere with the standard metric, consider the problem of prescribing. Consider the problem of prescribing the scalar curvature 1. Then we know that every Merbius transformation of this variant itself is given rise via the Pullback metric to a solution of the problem. And since this group is non-compact, we have found an explicit example of a case in which there are non-compact families of solutions, which is typically related with blowing up phenomena. Okay, so our intention Okay, so our intention is to pose this equation when a manifold with a boundary, so we need to choose some boundary conditions. Instead of working with homogeneous Titiclet or Neumann conditions that has been studied in the literature, we impose another boundary condition that has the geometrical meaning of prescribing also at the same time the boundary mean curvature to be a given function H, capital H, define or the boundary. Then, prescribing a given function k as the scalar curvature and a given function capital H as the boundary mean curvature results equivalent to solve this elliptic boundary problem that has a non-linear Newman boundary condition involving the normal derivative, the starting mean curvature of the boundary. And then this problem becomes doubly critical because this exponent here is the critical. This exponent here is the critical solid exponent for the boundary minus one. This boundary case of the product has been studied less than the one on clock's manifold, and in some sense the presence of the boundaries creating new non-compactness phenomena that we are going to see. That makes the problem rather difficult. And also since here we have two curvatures that are playing a role in this problem, then we also need to understand how they interact with each other. How they interact with each other, their competition and so on. Okay, to put the problem in its context, let me say that it was in the 84 when Jerry gave first criteria for the existence of solutions, although they invoked some Lagrange multipliers that were out of control, and also proved the regularity of the solutions to this problem. Also, a popular version of this problem is the one that was. Problem is the one that was studied by SCOR, which is the case of prescribing a constant and positive scale curvature with a constant bounded mean curvature. This problem has also been studied in the particular cases in which one of the curvatures is zero and the other is variable by many different errors. This is not a comprehensive list. However, the case, the complete problem with a non-constant k and h is the one that has been compared to Is the one that has been comparatively less studied. Let me remark some results in this direction: the one by Ambrosetti and Magchioti, in which they address the prescription of curvature. There are small perturbations of constants in the unit ball of Rn, where the scalar curvature is positive. And this work is going to be the major inspiration for the second part of the talk. So I will go back to it later. A very beautiful work by Jasmine Marcio de Anamedo, in which they The Malachio Diana Medo, in which they addressed the description of a positive scalar curvature on the three-dimensional upper hemisphere, and they also performed a low-up analysis. And more recently, by Cheng Hu and Sung, in which they considered the case of prescribing negative scalar curvature with negative boundaries curvature by means of a geometric flow. But if I recall correctly, also these results involve some Lagrange modules. So the intention of this talk is to present some results. Of this talk is to present some recent existence results for the problem with non-constant k and h when the prescribed scalar curvature of the wine in the interior is negative. That is the one that has been studied the least. Before going into the details, I will do a convenient simplification using a result by Escobar, but warranties that every compact remaining manifold with a boundary and of dimension n greater than or equal to three. Admits a conformal metric that has minimal boundary, so mean curvature equal to zero, and whose scalar curvature does not change sign. And this sign is determined by the conformal invariant of the main point that is called the SCOVAR class, or at least I call it the Escoval class. So since we are interested in finding solutions within the conformal class of the background metric, then it's not restricted to assume that we have already done this conformal change. Have already done this conformal change, and that the initial metric in our manifold is the one given by square. So that our starting mean curvature is going to be zero, and our starting solar curvature is going to be either negative zero or positive. Okay, so as I was saying, this problem is variational, and the solutions can be recovered as critical points of the following energy function. That is standard, that is defined for. Standard that is defined for functions of h1 and involves the L2 norm of the gradient, two polar determines with the starting curvature. For us, this will not appear in the first part of the talk because we are assuming that we have this color metric. And then two very ugly terms that involve the prescribed curvatures and also the critical sum of the exponent for the interior and the critical sum of the exponent for the boundary. Since we are working with a Since we are working with a negative scalar curvature, then this term is going to be positive, so it's going to push the functional upwards and it's going to help us. But we are not assuming any restriction on the signs of H, so this boundary term can create a competition. And in fact, understanding how this competition goes, how these critical terms interact, is going to be very important for the nature, for the behavior of our energy function. And this brings us to. And this brings us to the first result that says that the competition between the interior curvature and the boundary curvature is somehow encoded into the scaling invariant function dn defined on the boundary of the manifold. That is defined as a dimensional constant times the quotient of the prescribed mean curvature over the square root of the accelerated value of the prescribed scalar curvature. The results send. The result says, in a few words, that the boundary term of the functional is bounded, is less or equal than the ultra-normal of the gradient and the critical interior term, and with the right constants that appear in the functional, but up to a factor that is the maximum of the positive part of this function, dm, plus some lower order terms. So, as you can imagine, we will be in two different situations depending. Be in two different situations depending on whether this maximum, this factor here, is less than one or not. The easy case is when this maximum is strictly less than one, because in this scenario, what happens is that the positive term of the functional is dominating the boundary term. And as a result, the functional becomes coercive, and there exists a global minima. This global minima is going to be a solution of the problem as long as we can guarantee. The problem as long as we can guarantee that it's not zero. Because remember, we want it to be the conformal factor that defines a conformal metric that has to be money. Our first result, together with MachiaD Android, says that this is the case, for instance, if we are on a manifold of negative conformal invariant. I will be using SG to they are exchangeable because the sign is determined by the conformal class, so I will be exchanging this notion. I would be exchanging these notions often. So we'd say that we prove that if k is negative and h is taken in such a way that d is always less than one in the boundary, then this problem admits a solution on many folks on negative conformity variants. This is the case, for instance, when we are prescribing a negative scalar curvature with negative boundary curvature, which would be like the analogue of prescribing a negative scalar curvature of a closed mouth. That is the easy case. On the other hand, On the other hand, if the manifold is zero, then we need to impose an additional assumption, that is, that H has a positive boundary average, in order to discard the possibility of the minimized theorem. And if you are wondering what's going on with the case of a positive conformal class, we were able to discard this possibility. So let's move on to the case in which. So let's move on to the case in which this function d could be greater or equal than one at some point in the boundary. And the first thing that we observe using the model of the of the ball with the standard hyperbolic metric is that here, where the conformal factor is blowing up in the boundary, there are profiles with d greater or equal than 1. This function d is greater than 1 at the boundaries of geodesic spheres, and it approaches 1 as these geodesic spheres are converging towards the boundary and becoming. Are converging towards the boundary and becoming bottom spheres. So if this is greater equal than one, we could expect some blow-ups for this problem associated with these profiles. Okay, so let us assume that this function dn has a point b in the boundary where it is greater or equal than one. And the first thing we do is to construct thing we do is to construct a sequence of test functions Vi which mass is concentrating around this boundary point that sends the energy towards minus infinity. This means that the functional is no longer bounded from below and we don't have hope to find the final minimizing. However, in dimension 3, and I will explain later how this dimension enters critically, we are able to recover existence of solutions using Existence of solutions using the multi-fast theorem. Our min-max theorem says that when we are working on dimension n equal to 3 and sg is 0 and the conformal class is equal to 0, k is negative and h is taken in such a way that it has negative overage, the boundary. So, like opposite assumption with respect to the other theorems. The maximum is greater than one at some point in the boundary. And one is a regular value of this function or this invariant function, dn, then the problem admits a positive solution. And in doing this theorem, let me highlight what have been the main difficulties. The first one, as it happens often, is that we cannot guarantee that the Pauli-Smith sequences are bounded due to the triple homogeneity of the energy function, because the electron of the gradient The ultronorm of the gradient and also both of the critical terms are rescaling with the same weight. So it's not possible to show that Palestine sequences are bounded. One way to bypass this difficulty is to use a struggle monotonicity trait that will allow us to consider bounded Palestinian sequences. But even then, due to the presence of the critical solar exponents in our functional, we are not able to say if bonded Palesmanian sequences are correct. bonded Palesmanian sequences micro. So what have been the approach we actually combine these two things? We are going to combine the Strubus monotonicity trick with a sub-critical approximation problem. This goes like this. A strube monotonicity trick in a very few words says that we can work with bounded Palestinian sequences up to considering a small perturbation of a part of the energy function. Of a part of the energy functional that here is encoded in allowing these curvatures the k and h to be sequences converging in the situ sense. Since we are in the subcritical case, these bounded pales mid sequences are going to converge and they are going to converge to a solution of this approximating problem. So now the i it becomes a matter of deciding if we can pass the limit here and recover a solution of the original problem. Recover a solution of a puristic problem. But now we have a main advantage that instead of working with arbitrary pales in sequences, we are working with a sequence of solutions of a problem. So we can use regularity theory, Both side identities, and so on. And via regularity theory, passing to the limit here and recovering a solution of the original problem is as much as proving if a sequence is uniformly bounded from above, which leads us to perform. Which leads us to perform a problem of analysis. So we reason by contradiction and define a singular set associated to a sequence of the problem that we have just seen as the set of points in the manifold or its boundary for which there exists a sequence xi convergence toward p that makes ui of xi unbounded. And in this regard, we are able to prove the following compactness result. First of all, First of all, the singular points, so the global points, are in the boundary. This is because the prescribed scalar geometry is negative, as we will see later, where this function dn is greater or equal to 1, as we were expecting. And this creates a division, creates two classes of blow-up points. The first one are the the points with uh d where dn is greater than one, but we are going to call Is greater than 1, that we are going to call S1, and the second one are the points that have dn equal to 1, that we are going to call S0. And in dimension 3, we have a lot more information. Namely, the set S1 has to be finite. If, moreover, we are working on a non-positive conformal class, then this set is empty. And assuming that the energy of this sequence is uniformly bounded, This sequence is uniformly bounded, which is not restricted because remember that we are obtaining these sequences of solutions as using the multi-path, so they have uniform energy. And one is a regular value of this function at the end, then there are no log points with d equal to one. And observe that this theorem immediately implies the mean-max existence result, because under the assumptions of the previous theorem, there are no global points, so the sequence is uniformly bounded. So the sequence is uniformly bounded, and we can pass through the genital undergoing a solution. And the additional assumptions, if you remember that the average of H had to be positive, is just to warranty that the energy functional has the multi-pass structure. Basically, this is the main result of this part. Let me go to sketch a bit the main ideas of the proof. But first, let me emphasize that this singular set in this boundary case can be actually really large. Actually, really large. Consider, for instance, again the case of the human border for n, then we define his sequence of solutions that instead of they are parameterized by a parameter rho that is converging towards one. We observe that these functions actually satisfy, solve the problem with a constant, scalar curvature, that is a negative constant, and h that is converging towards one. So actually, this function is converging towards one. And as we can see, as C, as rho tends to 1, this sequence is blowing up in the whole boundary. So the singular set is S0, is actually infinite, is the whole boundary. And if we rescale in the sense that we are doing zoom, what we find is a one-dimensional limiting profile, which means in particular that the volume at the boundary is infinite. And this is a new non-compactness phenomena that, for instance, is not present in in the closed case of the log. The closed case of the problem. Okay, so let us move to give the main ideas of the proof of this result. I will not enter into the most technical details, just to sketch the main ideas. So we want to prove that these singular points have to be in the boundary where p is greater than 1. This is a classical argument. We take a singular point. With a cart singular point with associated sequence xi convergence to p, that sends ui to plus infinity. And the idea here is to rescale around this sequence xi and try to pass through it. If we are able to do so, we will find a solution of a problem in the whole Euclidean space, and we try to use the properties of this problem, of this Euclidean problem, to derive properties of this blowing up solution. Solution. The difficulty here is that we cannot guarantee, for instance, that this sequence xi is made of points of local maxima, because consider, for instance, the previous case in which the blow-up is one-dimensional in the whole boundary. And which would be really convenient to get bounded limiting profiles and we can bypass this difficulty by means of Echelon's variational principle that says that even if your sequence xi is not adequate to respond Is not adequate to scale and basketball limit, there exists a sequence zi which satisfies the same, the very same properties of xi and it's also really close enough to the sequence xi and is such that if we rescale ui in the following fashion, by defining these sequences bi, they are rescaled with this factor that is delta i defined here, and they are defined on the Are defined on expanding domains, because remember, what we are doing here essentially is making it zoom. So the domain of definition is broad. Then if we do so around these new sequences, what we find is limiting profiles that have a local uniform boundaries property. And this property here, together with regularity estimates, allows us to pass to the limit in the local sense. Sense. In doing so, we have to distinguish two cases. The first one is when the point is in the interior, or when it is in the boundary, but the blow-up is happening faster, much faster than the convergence to this sequence to the boundary. Then, what happens is that the domains of definitions of these scale sequences, the i, are invading the whole equivalent space. And when we go to the limit, we find a solution of this equation on our end. On our end that has, by construction, a global maximum at zero. But since k is negative, what we have here is a supermarket function that has a global maximum at zero. So this case is discarded. What happens actually is that the point is in the boundary and the blow up and the convergence rate towards this point are comparable. Then, after a change of variables, what we have is a solution of this limiting problem. Of this limiting problem in the Hald space, where the contribution of the curvatures is just their value at the critical point. So, the solutions of this problem were classified, in a vapor value bulk, inaugural and transfer, and they only exist whenever this d value is greater or equal to 1, which proves the first point. So, now that we know where this flowing up exists, then as I was saying, we tried. Then, as I was saying, we tried to analyze, to understand the limiting profiles of the solutions of this problem to derive conclusions of how our blowing up sequences is made. So, let us first review what are the solutions of this limiting problem. If around points, if the value of d at the point p is equal to 1, what we have is a one-dimensional family of a one-parameter family of one-dimensional. Parameter family of one-dimensional solutions that we have infinite volume antiboundaries, I was anticipating. And more interestingly, where t at p is greater than one, we have the so-called bubbles. There are these functions here that concentrate around a point in the boundary and depend on n parameters. m minus one is the concentration point that is in the boundary of the Point that is in the boundary of the Hubble space and comes from the invariance of the problem under translations. And then a blowing up or a blowing up parameter that determines how fast it's blowing up. And it comes from the invariance of the column under dimensions. Okay, so let us concentrate now on studying what happens around the blowing of points with B greater than 1. Greater than one, which is where the bubbles are being originated. Here, if we rescale back using the rescaling properties of the formulas of these bubbles, what we find is that the initial blowing up sequence resembles in a situation log sense a sequence of bubbles whose parameter, whose concentration parameter is going towards zero. However, this happens in a ball of radius that is collapsed. Happens in a ball of radius that is collapsing. And unfortunately, that is not enough information to draw any useful conclusion. So we have to go further and obtain more information. And to do so, I will recall two notions of blow-up that were introduced by Shen for blowing ups of this kind. There are first the notion of isolated blow-up points. We say that a blow-up point of this kind is isolated when there exists a fixed When there exists a fixed radius R independent of I, and such that in a ball around this blowing up sequence of fixed radius R, the growth of this sequence UI is bounded by this negative power. What happens around isolated lower points is that we could not have bubble accumulation or clusters, which are bubbles that are Which are bubbles that are being originated at different points that are collapsing towards the same point. However, we could still have what we call towers of bubbles. There are bubbles that are being originated at the same blow-up point, but at different scales. And to deal with that case, the notion of isolated and simple blow-up point is introduced. We say that an isolated blow-up point is also isolated and simple. Isolated and simple, if there exists, if this sequence of one-dimensional functions defined as some sort of way the radial averages around the global points, have a unique critical point in an interval of a fixed length. And even if this definition seems a bit involved, what happens here is that around an isolated and simple row of points, we can also discard the presence of towers. We can also discard the presence of towers of bubbles. And what happens is that we have one bubble at a time, which is actually the next result. That around an isolated simple blow-up point of S1, remember the DFP, so it's here an assumed greater than 1, then our blowing up sequence is resembling sequences of bubbles with parameters converging towards zero, but in a ball of a fixed But in a ball of a fixed radius. And the first consequence is that as long as we can guarantee that the row absorption is isolated and simple, since the boundary is compact, then we have that there could be at most a finite number of them. But here is what the dimension enters in a critical way, because only on dimension n equal to three we are able to prove that the blow up is isolated and simple. And this is not a technicality. And this is not a technicality. Actually, dimension n equal to 3 is the maximum dimensions for which we can expect to be able to prove that these blow-ups are actually isolated and simple for generic choices of k and h. And this is a typical behavior of these problems in low dimensions because, in a few words, the bubbles are interacting strongly with each other. In the this property in the closed case is preserved up to dimension n equal to Up to dimension n equal to 4. However, the presence of the boundary is in some sense creating a stronger interaction between the prescribed curvature k and the vowels that dominate the mutual interactions between them. In this regard, let me also highlight the recent work by Yame Blue and Menaje, in which they construct, also using a Lyapunov-Smith approach, explicit non-isolated blow-ups for the case of the Blow-ups for the case of the upper hemisphere with positive k and zero meter. So once we have this resemblance, we use a sort of capacity argument to discard these vowels. This argument exploits the differences between the blowing up sequences and sequences of vowels with parameters closer to zero. Of bubbles with parameters closer to zero on the manifolds of non-positive conformal class and far away from the concentration point. This result says basically that there are these integral quantities that are uniformly bounded for the globing up sequences while they converge to that they go to plus infinity for the sequences of bubbles. So assuming that we have this resemblance Assuming that we have this resemblance between the sequence and the vowels, we can actually employ this method to rule out this kind of log. Let me stress out that this result actually holds for all dimensions. However, we need this resemblance that only happens in dimension 3 to be able to use it to reach a conclusion. And finally, let us deal with the case of lower points with t equal to 1. With t equal to one, remember that around these points the blow-up is one-dimensional, and therefore this quantity here is going to plus infinity. Assuming that we have uniformly bounded energy that it's not restrictive, as I said, then we can prove that also the other two terms are diverging. And what we do now is we multiply the problem by a tuspunction, integrate by box and switch more way, and rescale. With rho a and rescale at order rho i, and we observe that this boundary term and these interior terms behave as the same measure. A measure that is supported on the boundary of the manifold where the blow-up is happening, where d is greater or equal to 1. Using the extra information we have in dimension 3, that this resemblance between the blow-in Resemblance between the blowing up sequence and the bubbles, we are able to discard this kind of blow-up from the support of the measure. That is to say, the measure is zero around those points, and actually the support is where d is equal to one, so points of s0. And we are also able to prove, using a Poseidon identity, that it has to be where the tangential gradient of the function dn is equal to 0. So whenever we have all these ingredients, So whenever we have all these ingredients, that is dimension three, uniform boundedness of the energy, and that one is a regular value of the n to discard this possibility, then the second type of blue out is also non-possible, which gives us compactness, which proves the compactness result, and in turn proves the min-max theorem. The min-max theorem. And this is the end for the first part of the talk. So it's a nice moment if you have any questions. If you have any questions, not to forget them for the end of the talk. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's the end of the first part. Okay. If no questions, then I will move to the second part of the talk. Oh, yep. The bubbles that you get from blow-up analysis, do they contribute energy? If you like write energy as your ID functional? We haven't done IV. Uh we haven't done a quantization of the energy for this problem actually, but like um this would be a nice argument to to discard this possibility chunk. I would expect, yeah, as it happens often in this kind of problem, we expect some quantization of the energy, that the bubbles have a fixed energy, contribute toward the total energy, and assuming some quantization, I believe it's possible to also roll out this blow-up, but we haven't done that yet. Okay, so for the second part of the talk, I will this will be a very different approach. Here, I will concentrate around we I will concentrate on the particular case of M being the unit pole over n. And we are going to prescribe, we aim to prescribe a negative scalar curvature that is a small perturbation of minus one. Here, k is the perturbation function, it's not the curvature that we have. Function, it's not the curvature that we are prescribing, but I'm going to use a bit of the notation. And h is a small perturbation of this value d over the square root of n times m minus 1. This is written in a quite artificial way, but it is to stress that this parameter d is going to play the role of the scaling invariant function dn that we introduced before. And we are going to focus on the case in which this d is greater than 1. D is greater than 1, because it's the case that remains the most open in higher dimensions. So, as I was saying, we will again here obtain existing results by finding critical points of these energy functions by using a Lyapunov reduction. This procedure is quite technical and I believe is standard enough to skip most, if not all, the technical details, but in our case, But in our case, at least in my head, it consists in three main steps. The first one is to choose an adequate answer, that is, an approximating solution to the problem. The solution will depend, of course, on a series of parameters. Then, we need to study the invertibility of the linearized operator around the unsets in order to use an adequate correction term. And if we have done everything correctly, And if we have done everything correctly, and the error that we are committing by choosing the solution to be the answer plus the correction is small enough, then finding a critical point of this energy functional is going to be reduced to making an appropriate choice of the parameters as a critical point of the energy of the ants. Okay, let us review these things. So you can imagine the You can imagine the approximating solution that we are going to choose are the solutions for the unperturbed problem. This problem here on the ball. These solutions are actually, we didn't know how they were made, but using the conformal equivalence that exists between the ball and the upper hemisphere, the atom version map, we can actually relate these solutions to the valvus. Let me explain how this is done. Start. Okay, we considered the inversion map from the half space to the ball, and we know that this map is conformal, so the pullback metric can be written as a positive function rho to the 4 over n minus 2 times this standard gradient metric. Then we observe that U solves the unpertured problem on the ball if and only if this U hat, which is a combination of U and the inversion map time is described. And inversion map times this factor rho solves a problem that we had seen before, that is the limiting problem in the Hald space. Since we are working in the framework in which d is greater than 1, then the solution of these problems are the bubbles. And since these solutions are explicit and this factor rho is explicit and the inversion map is explicit, we get a formula for the solutions of the unperture problem that depending on the Depending on the same parameters that were present in the bubbles for the Euclidean space. Okay, so this is our answer. Now we are going to move to study the invertibility of the linearized operator around it. And here, also using the conformal equivalence existing between the wall and the Euclidean space, this reduces to study the non-degeneracy of the bubbles for the problem in the Euclidean space. For the problem in the Euclidean space. To our surprise, this, as far as we know, this hadn't been done. This had been done only for the case in which k is greater or equal than 1 or n were done by circular marath. But this hadn't been done in the negative case. So, this is a main step that we have to achieve: that is to prove that all the solutions of this linearized problem. solutions of this linearized problem are actually linear combinations of the derivatives of the vowels with respect to the parameters. Since it's fair to say that this is like the core of the construction, let me briefly go over the main ideas of the proof just to emphasize what that difference is with the non-negative case. Okay. Okay, I have spoiler. Here we observe we are going to use again conformal invariant. To use again conformal invariances of the problem. Here we observe that these bubbles are actually conformal factors that relate the standard metric in the half space with a metric that has minus one curvature and the function d greater than one, which, if you remember for the first part of the talk, was the case for the geodesic spheres in the hyperbolic space. So repeating. So, repeating the reasoning we had done before, we construct an explicit conformal map which allows us to pass from this linearized problem to this one that at least in shape is more simpler than the previous one, that is, posed on the ball with the standard hyperbolic metric. And now, by looking at how things are done in the non-negative case, we know that we have to look at this. We know that we have to look at this problem as a new Managing value problem and try to understand if this D is actually an eigenvalue, a non-Managerian value for this problem. Which lead us to consider the following problem. And again, to our surprise, there were no new structure available for this problem. So we had to do everything by hand. This was done by considering hyperbolic polar coordinates that are in few words. Hyperbolic polar coordinates that, in few words, are just polar coordinates, but are more suitable to work with the standard hyperbolic metric because, in this framework, the hyperbolic metric has a nice splitting. So, we decompose eventual solutions of this eigenvalue problem using spherical harmonics. And using this splitting, we are able to separate variables and find that every one of the coefficients in this decomposition is satisfying a second-order. Is satisfying a second-order OD with a wrong boundary condition. And thanks to half of the spectral theory and also with the assistance of mathematical software, we are able to classify all the solutions to these final eigenfunctions. And what we prove in the end is that actually this value t is the second Neumann eigenvalue for the problem and has an associated And it has an associated eigen space that is n-dimensional and is generated by functions that are, after all the conformal chains that we have done, are just the derivatives of the bubbles with respect to parameters, which is the non-degeneracy of these solutions. Okay, so trust me here, the answer plus the correction term that has been appropriately chosen are good enough. The error term is high is small enough. Is high is small enough, and finding a critical point is as much as choosing the parameters to be a critical point of the energy of the answers. Now, using again this conformal invariance between the ball and the Euclidean space, we find we can actually compute the first-order expansion of the quantity we are interested in. And we observe that at We observe that at zero order it is a constant that is independent on the parameters, and this is due to the different invariances of the problem. At first order, which is the term that matters the most, is a function of gamma, which has this definition after a suitable change of variables. And as you may see, maybe it's not easy at all, but it's easier to compute derivatives and limits with respect. Derivatives and limits with respect to delta using this expression. Delta, where d delta is involving numerator, denominator, and everything. And that's actually the next step. In the next step, first we prove that this functional delta can be extended to the boundary value delta equal to zero in a smooth way, and then in notorious. Notorious demonstration of gradients, we actually compute the expansion of this gamma up to any given order m around delta equal to zero. And the composition goes more or less like this. At first order, it is a function c defined as a linear combination of k and h. At first order, there is the normal derivative of the function k. Oh, sorry, I forgot to say that here we are seeing things again. To say that here we are seeing things again back in the sphere because it's actually the formulas are clean. So this G is just the image via the inversion map of the parameter x0 and x0 bar. Sorry for the confusion, but yeah, it's much more easier in this case. And then at subsequent orders, we have a family of functions vi that depend on certain derivatives. On certain derivatives of k and h, and they are really interesting. I will do a final remark about them. So now that we know how the boundary behavior of this function on gamma, we can, wow, I press too hard. We can derive existent solutions using the visual degree argument. We actually are able to prove that this problem. That this problem admits a solution for small enough epsilon whenever one of the following assumptions holds. For instance, that the function c, for every at every global maxima of this function c, the first non-vanishing function phi takes a negative value for respectively for every global minimum of this function c, the first non-vanishing function vm is possible. Function of Vm is positive. Or when this C is a Morse function satisfying a rather standard counting index formula, then the problem admits a solution. Some final remarks, just to conclude, is that if we stop this theorem at n equal to 2, then we obtain a counterpart of the results that were obtained by Ambrosetti Nio and Machiotti, but in my opinion, you see a much straightforward Using a much straightforward approach than the one that we follow. And it is interesting to notice that if we go farther enough in the expansion of this gamma, depending on the dimension of the rainifall, then we find non-local terms. For instance, if we are working in dimension three and then the third function is it involves the second normal derivative of the Normal derivative of the perturbation function k plus the tangential Laplacian of this k minus this non-local derivative of h. I don't know if it has a name. I don't know if it has a name, but it's clearly non-local. And the final remark is that even if the problems are very different in nature, because the two-dimensional analog of this problem is that of describing the Gaussian. Problem is that of describing the Gaussian and the boundary division curvatures of a surface, and they are very different because they are the non-linearity, it's an exponential, so it's a new type equation, then this approach can be easily translated to the problem of the disk. And if we do that, then a couple of remarkable things happen: namely, that non-local terms appear at first order, and the second is that you might have And the second is that you might have noticed that the value of d hasn't played any important role here. So long as d was greater than 1, everything was perfectly fine. But in the two-dimensional case, due to technicalities, there are non-admissible values for t that we are yet to understand if they have any geometrical meaning or not. So that is everything I wanted to tell. So thank you very much for your attention. Okay, Mark
