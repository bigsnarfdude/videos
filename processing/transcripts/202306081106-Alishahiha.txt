Speaker is Professor Mushin Kulushenga, and he's going to talk about quantum complexity. Okay, thank you very much. Is my sound clear? Simply Laura. Do you hear me? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Let me start by thanking the organizer for inviting me. And I apologize for not being able to attend in person for this conference. In person from this conference. Okay, my talk is based on these papers. One is done by Michael Lapland, Sumic Benergi. Let me start by saying a few words about the general idea of the relation between complexity and chaos. Actually, as we have in this conference at the Control KS and Conference that the quantum chair is an interesting subject, though it's difficult to understand. This is due to the fact that the time evolution of quantum mechanics is local and military, and thus, in general, it is hard to study the emergence of ergodic behavior in quantum systems. Therefore, it is of great interest to understand thermal behavior in the quantum level, in which the eigensector machine hypothesis plays an important role. Important role. Actually, at the classical level, the chaotic behavior may be described by the sensitivity of trajectories in the phase space to the initial conditions. Indeed, two initial nearby separate exponentially thus characterized by the Lyabodov exponent. Since the classical reality trajectories, it has become obvious why it is difficult to deal with the quantum neighborhood. Nevertheless, to prove the nevertheless to probe the nature of the quantum curse certain quantities have been introduced in the next few years this includes for example uh out of the time order correlators and complexity my or my main concern in this topic is the complexity intuitively complete complexity may be uh maybe may be defined as a as a the measure that measures the uh how when we want to make attacks that tax how difficult Tax that tax, how difficult it has for you. That's that's complexity loss. For the chaotic system with finite entropy, complex are expected to grow for exponentially large times in the entropy long after the thermal equilibrium has been reached. Interestingly enough, the same growth holds for the black hole entranum. Actually, these two leads to the following conjecture by Saskine that the complexity of the boundary state is proportional to the volume of the maximal coordinate. Proportional to volume of the maximal co-dimension one hypersurface involved within the boundary. This is known as the C complexity equal to volume. Of course, it's another proposal for the holographic complexity known as the complexity equal to action. But what we are considering in the following volume. Yes. I mean, we don't know. We don't know if the platform interior grows until a certain time and then it stops. So, I mean, we know that complexity will grow for exponentially long time to stop, but it's the same as the growth we expect to grow to infinity. That's what we know. Yeah, you know, okay, if I saw us broken, but if I understood your question correctly, you are asking that in choreographically. Asking that in choreographic the countries grows further. This was your question? Yeah, no, my question is that it is like you say that the same happens for the black hole interior, but we don't know that because we don't know whether that loss stops for the black hole. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, it was not so. So yeah, I understand. Okay, you're right. This sentence was not precise. But I was trying to say that we see something in the holographic picture that something happens. Picture that something happens after time dependent happens after when we have the okay. This is what I was wanting to say. Actually, we note that for the chaotic harmonic after the time I mentioned here, which we have the linear growth, the complexes such breaks according to the constant. Actually, the general picture one may draw for the complex. The picture one may draw for the complexity in the chaotic same has the following form, general flaw. Of course, we understood this picture piece size. We don't understand fully. We have some exponential or some parallel energy growth, which ends at the time, which is of order of log of s, which is the scrambling time. After which we have the linear growth, which we have a linear growth up to a scale of time is a big time, which is exponential. Heisenberg time, which is exponential of entropy, in which the complexity saturates the constant, which is of order of e to the power s. That's the general, more or less general idea of, I think, in the literature agreed on that, more or less, that that's the behavior of computer would expect to see. Actually, although this linear growth is very easy to see in the monolographic picture, but when it comes to the situation, it's a little bit sad. Nevertheless, at least in the two Nevertheless, at least in the two dimensions, the resulting holographic complexity was calculated in Jetta gravity using the CBA conjecture, where it was shown that including higher GDS geometries gives the correct length and behavior for complexity. I mean that we have the saturation, we can see saturation here as well. In this context, the complex is computed in terms of non-perturbative geometric lens in the Jacques-Ternel gravity, which is given by this. Which is given by this expression. This is essentially that the average L here is the regularized length, geodesic length, and this is the heart of our wave function. And essentially, we are computing average of the length. And from this expression, one can see that for late time, much smaller than e to the power s, we have linear growth. But for the large time, which is a scale of e to the power s, then this. To the power is, then this entry load decays and we get some constant which is a saturation phase. Let me back to the chaotics, to the chaotic system, say something about the chaotic system. For the chaotic system, the notion of thermalization may be described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which gives an understanding of how an observer thermalizes its value of equal to thermal equal value. According to the ETH thermal According to the ETH, thermalization occurs at the level of individual organisms to Hamutona. In fact, setting defining the average energy and different energy, the ETH states that the matrix element of those observable and the basis of the energy are the ethics of the Hobbyan obeys the following answers. That's the ATH. Where here, where bar O is the macro canonical average of the corresponding operator, is the entropy, and we have the. Very true is and we have that we see that the essentially it says that the uh eigen the matrix element is diagonal up to some of the which dictates exponential uh the thermal the ETH and such has an immediate application understanding of the thermalization which indicates that the control expectation value of an observer must approach its thermal average for long enough time. We note however that this answers does not tell us how long the person must Tell us how long the personal thermalization is. Of course, our main studies is not to explore the thermalization of the system. Actually, the aim is to understand the late time behavior of a certain observable when the system is in the thermal equipment. Indeed, within the context of the ETH, we are interested in finding, if any, an observable that exhibits time growth, even though the system has been already reached the term. Actually, the approach, the thing I'm telling The approach, the thing I'm telling you here is inverse of what we have heard here in this conference. Namely, people start from some definition of complexity and try to understand the behavior of this complexity. What I'm going to do here is just I assume that some complexity, whatever it is, has certain properties. I want to understand if it is possible to define some quantity which obeys such a problem. Which avoids such a progress. Our main motivation to propose a content for the quantum complexity comes from the phologic setup in which it is believed that the phological complexity exhibits a linear growth at late times. Therefore, in what follows, for a given quantum system, we would like to define a quantity exhibiting such a linear growth. To proceed, let us define the quantum object C associated with that operator O as follows. That operator goes as follows. The expression as you will recognize that is very similar to the thing we have in, for example, this complexity, or when we are computing the ETH average of the one-point time chain or expectational operator, it has some error. But for the moment, we just define such an object, which depends on data. I assume that maybe it all seems a finite temperature, and it has some dependent here. It's a common dependent behavior. Using the completeness condition for the energy eigenstate, this expression may be reclassed to the following form. Where we have the this is actually the product of the density density of e1 equal and a which I call the a function is somehow the eigenstate the matrix element of operator O in the eigenstate in the energy eigenstate. In energy identity. For the typical operator, the A function follows the ETH answers, and therefore, the long-time average of C of O approaches that of the microchemical average of the corresponding operator. As far as the time dependence of the corresponding quantum of this is concerned, as we will see that the A rule is played by the A function. We would like to see whether there is a condition under which the corresponding quantum of text C of O keeps growing with time. Of O keeps growing with time even how the whole system is reached thermal equation. Proceed, since we are interested in the late time behavior for C of O, it is useful to rewrite the corresponding expression in terms of variable X1 and omega. Then to address the question, following etiquette, it is clear from these equations that the corresponding information should be included in the behavior of the pain function. Actually, it is evident from Actually, as is evident from the above expression, the time dependence of C of O should be read from omega integral. Due to the simple factor of e to the power i omega in the integral, using the Cauchy residual theorem, with the assumption that the density of states is a smooth function in the limit of omega zero, in order to get a non-trivial time B dependence, the A function must have a The A function must have a full structure of order of n for n bigger than. In particular, for the case of the double quality structure where a function has the following limiting behavior, where the omega goes to zero, with a positive A, one finds that the quantum object C of O exhibit a linear growth at late times, wherever C is a constant, which depends on beta. It is worth noting that this linear growth. It is worth noting that this linear growth must not be confused with that of the dramatic space in the, for example, spectrum form factor, where the linear growth was the consequence of a sub-living connected part of the density correction. Here, you have linear growth already at the living disconnected part. Having found a quantum object that has linear growth at the time, it's tempting to identify the corresponding quantum object as the quantum. object as the quantum complexity. To be precise, we would like to define the complexity as follows. For a chaotic quantum system, the quantum complexity is defined by C of O for a particular operator O to be found for a given system, which might not be even local operator, so that the associated a function defined before here, associated a function here, exhibits a double point structure in the limit that. Structure in the limit that E1 approaches E2. Where here, A, we assume that A is a positive. Of course, for the given quantum system and for the given system, a priori, it is not obvious how to find all that result in the desired double purple structure for a function. However, in general, the corresponding quantity may not be even expressed in terms of the local operator. To further explore this observation, let us consider example in which one could is an example in which one could identify a parameter O opera and also to see what the result of of the what could be this C of O the simple the example I'm considering first is the quantum system given by this Hamiltonian sometimes leaving not Hamiltonian the corresponding Schrodinger equation is given by this expression the X the eigenstate data functions eigenstate functions of the above function are given Of the evaporation are given the same of the vertical function of the second kind with imaging order. Actually, this Hamiltonian is used to say different aspects of two-dimensional Jacques-Tarton gravity in this paper. Actually, this provides some holographic description for Jacque-Tarpin gravity. But for the moment, the connection of this Hamilton with the jacket-to-bog graph is not important to us. We just consider as a quantum system. Quantum system. The ordinary condition for the eigenstates function is given by this expression, where the law of the law of nu is essential within slash steps. Following a proposal for the quantum complexity, the quantum complex is given by Ci expect, whose a function in this case using the coordinate system is given by this expression here, where f of x and x prime is actually the much. Is actually the matrix element of the operator. You have to define it to have to find it in the coordinate system. Actually, motivated by this work, we'll consider the following expression for f vertex as prime, by which the associated function reads as follows. Actually, since the function f may be interpreted as a matrix element, for instance, the above choice corresponds to the matrix elements of the position. To the matrix elements of the position operator. That is a physical diagonal leading to the delta function I have here. On the other hand, since the date function satisfies the short equation, essentially in this case, what we are evaluating is the average of the position operator. By making use of explicit expression for the wave function in the term of the vertical function, it is then straightforward to asset the full structure type of the a function indeed using epsilon's omega and the limit when omega goes to zero one is. When omega goes to zero, one will see that the a function has this desired behavior of the double structure. Therefore, we get linear growth for the complexity. If one recalls that the Hamiltonian was considered, was considered, we consider, describe two-dimensional exact gravity, it is possible to identify what exactly the quantum C is. Indeed, in this case, it can be interpreted as a quantum expectation value of the geometrical n. Expectation value of the geophysical length, which is the length of the workhole, connecting to boundaries of a two-dimensional black hole. This means that the function fx is just a regularized geodesic length. As another example, let's see how we can see systematically this double core from in the context of the holographic, in the context of the clear of composite with relatively well understood literature. To proceed, let us consider a quantum system described by the time-dependent Hamilton H, whose eigenstate and eigenvalue is given by t i's r cos a equals t, which is the dimension of the inverted space. In this case, in this system, the time events are given by Schofield equation, which is given by this expression. Then the density matrix associated with this asset at any time is given by this expression. Expression. Actually, given a state in the limited space and giving an operator, one can always possibly construct orthonormal and ordered basis using the Lama-Schmidt processing. In our case, we start from this initial state and the operator, which uses a Hamiltonian. From this, one can construct order, orthogonal, and order basis, which is known as the Kriloff bases. Known as the crudo basis in this way. And the procedure, the first element of the basis is indeed the original given states of the reverse space. Then the other elements are constructed here simply as follows. The procedure stops whenever the n vanishes, which occur for, for example, at n, which is a dimension of this subspace of the condition. This procedure produces. This procedure produces an order basis together with coefficients a n and bn, which are known as the Lange coefficient. Since the basis of the subspace of H of the psi is an ordered basis, one may label any elements of the subspace by the number which amounts to define the label operator given by this expression. Or given by this expression for arbitrary function c, which should be absolutely increasing. Since the basis n is already ordered, a natural choice for the coefficient is just cn equal to n. And if we expand the rate function in terms of this basis, group basis, then the group complexity is given by this expression here, which we have already seen in this context. This contrast. Now, here I have written this complexity in terms of the trace when we have the label operator and also this density. Actually, an advantage to express the truth complexity in terms of the phase of this operator, this is just another side for the comments. Actually, there is an advantage to express the global this curve. The colour there's a curve complete in terms of the trace around this density of X appearing here. Defining this way, it is somehow straightforward to define curve complexity for sub-region and also to define subjects like they call it the kill of mutual complexity. This has been done in this paper and the mutual and then we know that in the entanglement, the mutual entanglement has Mutual entanglement has some information more than the entanglement of the here. We could also close mutual composite composite, which may have some information more than clock composite. Back to our discussion. To further proceed, exploring the complexity, let us assume that the Hamiltonian continuous spectrum. Using the energy agency, the curve of complexity may be recast in the following form, which has exactly the same form of the proposed complexity. The complexity for this complexity, the a function is given by the matrix 11 of label operator in the energy basis. At leading, and row here, at leading order is dimension of the in the at the leading order in dimension of impress rate is assumed by the product of the instance. The behavior of the clock complexity is encoded the behavior of Langevin's coefficients. It was conjectured that programmatic system has large, one has large If one has large n-linear growth, when n is large, we have seasoned variants. Actually, the large n-linear growth is a typical behavior for Lange's coefficient, and has nothing to do with the clientic nature of the ceasefire that's been shown in this paper and also we have the body. Of course, under certain conditions, it may also exhibit saturation rates on which the Landscheos coefficient saturated constant. The saturation of the Landscheos coefficient results in linear growth for the Resolve the linear growth for the complexes at the late times. The behavior at the late time imposes a condition on the function of a function to have the double pull structure. Not the point that whether we see such a double pull structure in the complexity. Actually, using the expression for the matrix element of the label operator in the context unit, it is straightforward to see that it exhibits. x double double equal uh the area more precisely uh in the continuum limit control limit is defined by this uh by this way you just uh define x to be epsilon time n and we epsilon time and then there is a y here which is defined of x in this form and it is indeed easy to show for to show that in this case the matrix element of label operator has this behavior which exactly gives result to a double point structure Result to a double pole structure or derivative of a delta function in this action. To conclude, we note that the double polar structure is indeed a consequence of the saturation of Lancashire scroll shape. So even in this clinical complexity, we see that the double polar structure appears naturally in these companies. Let me escape this because of time, but I will give a comment later. Another interesting feature of the companies. Another interesting feature of the compass is that it saturates at very late times given by the exponential of the entropy of the system. It is then natural to see how saturation could occur in this context. What is this question? We note that the density matrix rho of E1 and E2 appear in the expression of the quantum object. So it is straightforward, it should be C, C of O, has the following general form. It could actually perform. We already discussed where the case, in the case, where the Where the case in the case where the row and t2 was just products of row t1 and row of two, but you could have some connected term where the row connected represent the connected term, meaning that it cannot be written with a factorial form of t1 and g2 with the g1 and g2. The connected term could have either perturbative or not perturbative or genes, which may have given non-trivial codes such as that with result in the sales function case at the time. Actually, this is the very known structure structure which has been seen in the literature for the spectral form part of the model such as tragedy, in which the connected part of rho of E resolves the RAM phase and citation phase. Of course, for the spectrum form factor, there is no antenna function, and the whole time dependence is controlled by the density, density current one. On the other hand, for the holographic complexity, On the other hand, for the holographic complexity of jacket thermal gravity, where there is an A function, the connected part of rho of E1 and T, which has non-trivial force such as at lecture, is indeed responsible for such function curves. We note, however, that in the present case, where we are dealing with the general information, which is not directly related to the holographic picture, it is not clear how the full expression for connected term could be computed. Could be computed. Nevertheless, for the chaotic system, as far as the late time behavior is concerned, what would expect that the main contributions come from the short-lived correlation, which is given by the universal signal term. This is known by this expression here. Here, this is the dimension of the Hilbert's rate, which is given by the exponential of the entropy of the system. The double point structure of a function leads to many groups at the leading order disconnected cross. The leading order is connected of the density correlation. While there is a saturation phase, we can be described by sublimating connected term giving the universal signal term when you plug about the double base structure. One can see that the saturation occurs at the t of order of t to be precise using this expression here and plugging into the expression for complexity. We get at later, we get such an expression here. From this expression, one From this expression, one observes that at a late time when omega goes to zero in the spring, and for rho omega is bigger than one, essentially the first empirical dominates in the bracket dominates, and we get us linear growth there. While for rho omega smaller than one, which is the case when t as t is of order of t, the second term, which is this term, actually starts dominating that the same. Start dominating that essentially cause the whole integral to upward zero, leading to a constant comp C, which is the saturation phase, which we interpret of the saturation phase. To summarize, we have seen that we could define quantum complexity, maybe defined as a quantum object associated with an operator, which could be non-local operator, whose matrix element in energy basis exhibits the double-block structure, let's make that. And it has general feature general expression in this one, no matter what is the colour, holography complex, or Nelson complex. It has this general and the double structure in the actually that this the the the the the page I escaped actually was to to explore this this statement that the double polar structure is the highest polar structure for the for a function one with m. For a function, one could imagine. For jacket-titrom gravity, this expression reduces the quantum length connecting boundaries. It also reduces the curl of complexity if one computes the quantum object for the label output of the basis. There is a universal, as we have seen also, there is a universal form for the sectional phase, which occurs due to the connected part of the Roman correlation. With this, I finish my talk and thank you for attention. Anyone comment in the keylog complexity? Do you hear me? Yes, yes. In the keylog complexity story, uh the separation of of the of the complexity is not due to to the event performation of the uh in chaotic behavior. In chaotic behavior. It's just due to the fact that you have a discrete spectrum. So, for example, you could see the separation of the complexity even in an interval system where there is no universal formulation, there is no design kernel that you are in. So, I mean, I guess there is a kind of saturday there. I don't understand exactly where it enters, but certainly, at least in the keynote complexity story, saturation is not a question is is not a analata of the of the yeah of this kind okay i i i do agree with you actually you are right there are competition between two two two two expressions one from rho and from a the whole information about lanes coefficient is encoded in a function and whole information about the system is let's say is the room and there are two ways to to get the saturation which compete To get the saturation, which compete with each other, one from the Lancius coefficient, as you mentioned, and the other is this sign colour. This competition, I agree with you. There are two ways to differ. Actually, we were thinking with my collaborator, maybe the way we get the saturation may tell you about the nature of the nature of the chaotic nature of the system, whether it's from Seinfeld or from the behavior of the natural function. You're absolutely fine. Correction. You're not absolutely fine. This is the tool that you can put in the face. Okay, so let's thank Machina Mutai. So we're going for lunch. I will be back at one. Thank you, Colery. Thank you, Martin. Okay, thanks.
