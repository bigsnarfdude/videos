We shall resume with Ralon Dujarin from Sorbonne Universit√©. We'll talk about structure of complex normals with disconnected G. No, it's G, it's J, I'm French, so it's confusing. I I I realize that there's a lot missing in Tito which is high-ball, okay? Which is high-body. Okay? Okay, so as you can see, so this is a never-ending joint work with Michelle Lupic. So I'm talking about this quite a few times already, so I've heard you already heard this before. Thanks a lot to the organizers for efforts to make Complex Senna Maps fashionable. I appreciate a lot. And okay, so it's also very pleasant to be able to do terror. To be able to go directly to Ethereum without explaining all the basics already. So, very present. Okay. So, does the thing work? Okay, okay, okay. No problem. Okay, so let's go. So, time is short, so I want to go straight to the point. Oh, even this is not working. Uh-huh. So, I really need some help here. You have to stop the clock, please. You are inflexible now. How do you explain? Is it slideshow maybe? I don't know. Slideshow is automatic, right? Yeah, slideshow is automatic and I. You can put it on pause and then I click. Yes, right. It's fine. Okay, thank you. No, now it's automatic. No, that works. No, it's not automatic. Okay, okay, good. Thanks. Okay, so as most of you know, a very important intuition if you want to study say dissipative complex NRMAP. Anticipative complex MRMAP is to rely on the equation of one-dimensional parallel dynamics. So it has been very successful so far. And so let's contemplate this classical theorem. This theorem is the structure of the Julia set for hyperbolic polynomials. So if you take a polynomial which is hyperbolic on J, and then you have a rough classification of the topology of the Julia set, either it is connected or it is not. Connected, or it is totally disconnected, or it is in between with the point components and not point components. And so the classification is like this. So if it is connected, of course, it means that the critical points do not escape. Since they cannot lie in the Julia set, because it is hydraulic, it means that they're in the fat set. And so, and they don't accumulate the Julia set, so you have attracting points. So the interior will be made of attracting points. If all critical points escape, as you know, the All critical points escape, as you know, the Julia set is a count of set. And otherwise, you would have point components and non-point components. And so there is a theorem which is not completely tricky over here, which is this second part, that you have a classification of components. So many point components, uncountably many point components, and countably many non-trivial ones. And all these countably many non-trivial components, they are all preperiodic to a finite set of components which contain a certain attracting point. Which contains a certain attracting point. Okay, so let me repeat: you only have countably many non-point components, each of which is prepared. It is prepared to a finite set of components which contains a critical point. And so the proof of this theorem is just classical one-dimensional proof, look where critical points go. And so my purpose in the talk is to extend this theorem as much as I can to an automorphism of C2. And of course, I cannot just apply the strategy. Of course, I cannot just apply the strategy for point view because I don't know if it's failed. Okay, maybe some conventions. So I don't recall basics on Henry Map, just a few conventions. So I normalize in the freedom minor style. So I don't use the same convention. I like to put an A here and there. Okay, so then the Jacobian is A squared. And what is nice with this form of thermal maps is that when you generate, you generate a flat line. You generate to a flat line, not to a parabola, which is usually, I think, simpler. So it's conjugate, of course, today. So in my convention, the degree is on the X coordinates. So if you fix a large by disk, you will have expansion in the horizontal coordinate and contraction in the vertical one. Okay, so I will use this convention for the path. And D is the degree which is also dynamical degree. Okay, so what is a hyperbolic map? So, what is a hyperbolic map? So, the definition of hyperbolic angle map is that the Julia set is a hyperbolic set. So, in this case, it must be a saddle hyperbolic set with a repelling and attracting reaction. And what is nice with this definition, which is just a definition on the Julia set, is that it has very strong global consequences on the dynamics, as proved by Snehi a time ago. So, in particular, in this case, you can describe the literature of K plus, which is as in the one that. Of k plus, which is, as in the one-dimensional case, the finite union of attractive bases. And so I always work in the dissipative case, okay? So Jacobian and so you can always renew, of course, come back to this case by considering the inverse. So the basin is a finite thing of attracting basin. Julia Saturday set is a finite thing of attracting basins. You have no F minus and also J equal J stars. It's a case where you can prove that the J equals J star. F is so-called an axiom A nice global consequences. There could be no basis. It's a finite fusion, possibly empty. It could be of empty interface. When the Jacobin is equal to one, then K it has no fancy set. Jeff couldn't limit specifically the one in the application of A sound. It would not be hyperbolic. Oh oh oh yeah, that would not be. Oh, yeah, but sorry. I should read more papers. Okay, just a few additional facts on hyperbolic maps. There is this theorem that actually hyperbolic... So it is equivalent to assume hyperbolicity on J or on J star. Okay? So I don't have much time to explain why this is a non-trivial and interesting theorem. Maybe you should just remember one. Just remember one idea. It says that capability is a property of periodic points, something that you can read on periodic points, which disclose that. Sorry? For all possible, no restriction on Jacobian. Even perhaps also in the conservative case. Okay, and another comment is about examples. So there are not so many examples available. So, there are not so many examples of hyperbolic maps, unfortunately. So, simple examples are given by small perturbations of hyperbolic polynomials. Okay, and now it is nice to have an A in most coordinates, so that when it degenerates equals to P of x0, so you see the nice C polynomial. So, if you take a hyperbolic polynomial and part of it into a Reynolds map, you get a hyperbolic and map. And for such examples, you have a complete topological model for the Julia set. You can describe everything in terms of the one-dimensional dynamics. It's not obvious, but you can do it. It's not obvious, but you can do it. And a number of sporadic examples which have been approved by Peckard, who's around here. So he found a number of examples, so this is one, of mappings which are probably non-conjugate to perturbations of one-dimensional maps. So there are a few of them. So this is a cubic example. They are. And the proofs are computer-assisted. We have to check the hyperbolicity by. I think. Anyway, so we have a few examples. Okay, let's go to the first case, which is the case of connected Julia C. So in this case, we have no contributions. So the work was done by Bethel and Smiley in papers 6 and 7. And so what they did in paper number 6, which so paper number 6 is about general maps, and paper number 7 is about hyperbolic maps. Okay, so the criteria works for non-hyperbolic maps. The criteria works for non-hyperbolic maps as well. So, what we proved in BS6 is that if you take a dissipative map, so again, dissipative in the general sense, I mean Jacobian equals one, is okay, then the connectivity of the Julia set is a property that you can read on unstable sets. So, if you look at the intersection of K plus with any piece of unstable manifold, you can tell if the Julia set is connected or not. And the quote is that. Disconnected or not? And the coin is very easy, so it's easier to state it in the disconnected case. So you take any disk which intersects, so not the Julia set, but J star in a sense. So take any disk which intersects both the complements of K plus and K plus. If you see a compact component, and look at the trace of K plus on that unstable disk. If you see a compact component, it means that the GSET is disconnected. Otherwise the component the this component is the This component inside this local disk is non-compact. Okay, so that's the criterion for PS6. And so, in paper number seven, they constructed the topological model for the Julia set, for the dynamics of the Julia set in the hyperbolic case, which is based on unstable external rays. And so you have a solenoid at infinity, you have so this was explained by Eric and Stock. And you have this lending of external rays, which produce us in dimension one. us in dimension one, a model for the geoset, and there is this conjecture n equals one, which was mentioned by Derek. They just opened one question in the paper, one natural question, is so if you remember the theorem in the first slide, when you have a hyperbolic map with a connected dual sense dimension what it must have a sink, must have an attracting point. So is it the case for the Henon for Henon mass? And what is nice is that it seems that this topological model for the Julia set, as far as I understand, For the Julia set, as far as I understand, is not able to produce a sync for you. So you have, like, maybe you can have remembrance of a sink because you have the kind of circle or something like this, but you don't have the sync. Okay? And this is a theorem I proved some time ago, almost 20 years ago, which is that indeed, if you have a hyperbolic map with a connected Julia set, then it must have attracting points. In particular, the Jacobian should be strictly less than one. should be strictly less than one. And the proof is quite short. Yes, I have the time to explain the proof. So, well, apparently. So the proof is by contradiction. You assume that you have a map which is connected to the set, which is hyperbolic, and K plus has no interior. So remember, K minus has no interior. So here, but here you could have some. I assume, sorry, that K. I assume, sorry, that k has no interior. Now, I think it was also described in Eric's talk. Close to the line at infinity, you have the Butcher function. The Butcher function is a semi-conjugation, not written here. So it semi-conjugates, it semi-conjugates the dynamics and taking the disparity. But it is a map from It is a map from this C2, sorry, from a neighborhood of infinity. You see, it's a map with a one-dimensional range. So you should think of it as a kind of dynamically defined first projection. Okay? And so the fibers of this first projection are the green lives on the teacher here. So it's a naturally defined first projection. Okay, the theory of BS6 says that, so one way of expressing that theorem is that there is no unstable critical point. Okay? Having no unstable critical point means that the green leaves are transverse to K minus. You have no critical point, the tangency between the buttonfoliation and the unstable lamination. Okay, so here you have transversality. Now, if you pull back, you can pull back this buttrafoliation. You pull back, you can pull back this bunch of relations. Since you are in a hyperbolic situation by the inclination lemma, when you pull back these green manifolds, they will fit nicely with the stable manifold of K plus. And since the interior of K is empty, what you get is a lamination of the whole of C2. And this lamination is actually holomorphic outside K plus. Now you use basic complex analysis. Use basic complex analysis. You have a continuous map which is holomorphic outside the set of measure zero, and you can translate. So it extends holomorphically. So actually, this foliation is holomorphic everywhere. And it is even a holomorphic foliation in P2 because it is the line at infinity solid. But there is a theorem by Dehman, which says that a Reynolds map does not preserve, cannot preserve holomorphic foliation at P2, so you get a contradiction. And so this contradiction shows that you have an attracting point somewhere. So it's a very indirect rule. So it's a very indirect proof. I don't know how to. I would like to produce the point, and so far I don't know. Okay? And by the way, it raises a nice question that I like. So Brudena's theorem says that there is no algebraic foliation which is preserved by Reynolds map. But I would like to say that there is no transcendental foliation of C2 preserved by Reynolds map, or even a local one. So question, is it possible that for a complex NOM map somewhere in a region? Map somewhere in a region intersecting the Julia set, the unstable lamination, say, is the restriction of some holomorphic freation. Okay? And my bet is that it does not exist because the philosophy is that there are no special examples for Henry maps. So you know in one-dimensional dynamics you have this ChF, lattice, etc. And in Henromaps, in the space of complex numbers, there should be no special, no rigid examples. And my bet is that there cannot exist There cannot exist examples where the stable lamination is part of a whole morphic formulation. There are C1 examples. C, so Eric, you prove that you cannot have C. C1. C1. So C1 is a contradiction. Eric and Kempi, right? So it cannot be C1, but here the question is. So, okay, so you proved that the boundary of K plus cannot be a C1 manifold. Here, I could deal with something which is transactively a counterset, but the leaves are the restriction. But the leaves are the restriction on the holomorphic formulation. So it's a different problem. I think it's nice for how to do it. Okay, so that's for the whole stuff. Now I want to go to the new material with Michel Bitch. And so what motivates this work is the second statement in my initial theory. So the case totally disconnected Julius. So if you believe in the analogy between polynomials in dimension one and Hang on maps, it should be the One hang on maps, it should be the case that if you have a hyperbolic henon map which is dissipative and which has no sink, then the Julia set is a counterset. Okay, so this is what we have been trying to prove with Michard. So far without success. So the conjecture is still open and we have partial results towards this conjecture and also regarding the last case. And we'll explain this. Okay, so if I want to so If I want to prove this conjecture, so I take a tablican map with no sink, I know that the Julia set should be disconnected. So I will study maps with disconnected GJ sets. And as always, to analyze the components of the Julia set, you will slice them in the stable and the unstable direction. Okay, so you want to look in the unstable direction that they look like, in the stable direction that they look like. What to expect? What you expect is that when the Jacobian solar, we assume that the note was really dissipative, and then we make a stronger assumption in the notes. In this case, you assume that the stable slice are totally disconnected. Okay? And as far as I know, nobody has ever seen a non-totally disconnected stable slice for disifying hyperbolic or not. So it seems maybe that this total disconnectedness in the stable direction is a... In the stable direction in the general fine. Okay, anyway, so if the Julia set has non-trivial components, you should expect them to be non-trivial in the unstable direction. So what can these components look like? Well, basically, you have two cases. Okay? Either you have a bounded subset. So you look inside, so you have local unstable manifolds, but also global ones. So global unstable manifolds are copies of C, which are immersed in C2. First, you see two. So, the first possibility is a component is a bounded subset of some unstable manifold, like a gradient rabbit sitting in some unstable manifold. In this case, of course, the topology of the rabbit as a subset of the manifold and its topology in C2 are compatible. Okay, so what you see is a rabbit floating in C2. The other possibility is that this component is not bounded in the unstable manifold. Okay, so you have like a kind of infinite rabbit in C2. So you have like a kind of infinite rabbit in the unstable manifold. And now this component, so it is not bounded in the unstable manifold, but the component in C2 is compact because it lives in the Julia set. So it means that you have some non-trivial recurrence. And so this rabbit should accumulate maybe itself or accumulate something in a more or less complicated way. Okay, so let me put a definition. So I say that a set is a quasi-solenoid. If If so, it is an, I don't assume that it is inference, it is a subset in C2 which is connected and unbounded in the unstable direction, like in the picture. And in the stable direction, it should be totally disconnected, like a solenoid. Let me also assume that it is locally connected in the unstable direction. So it is a nice subset like a rabbit if you look at it in the unstable subset. The and look at it in the unstable states. And a very desirable property from the hyperdynamics point of view is local product structure. So, locally, the set should be a product of its stable slice by its unstable slice. So, it's a very useful and classical property type of dynamics, which guarantees a number of automatic theorems, like existence of periodic points. Okay. Okay, and that's all. Okay, good. Cool, let me. So that's the main theorem. That's the main theorem. So I take a Reynolds map which is dissipative. Okay, which is actually it's stronger than dissipative. So here we assume Jacobian is less than one over the degree. It's not one over the degree square. I will explain the difference between the two. Which is hyperbolic with a disconnected Julia set. With a disconnected Julia set. Okay? Then you have three types of components of J: points, components of the type rabbit sitting in some unstable level, so leafwise bounded component, and leafwise unbounded. So this is a tautology, right? The fact which is not tautological in this result is that the leafwise unbounded ones are quasi-solenoids. So they are locally connected in the unstable direction, and more importantly, they have local product structure. Okay? So that's the Okay, so that's the first statement. So, three types of components. And now you have the dynamics on the type of components. So, remember the one-dimensional statement. In the one-dimensional statement, I said that every non-trivial component is attracted, is triperiodic, to finitely many periodic ones. And here we have the same statement. So, every non-trivial component, so we don't have only quantitatively many for obvious reasons, but every non-trivial component is attracted to a finite set of quasi-seminoids. Finite set of quasi-selinoids. So let me say it differently: you have only finitely components of type 3, which attract all the components of type 2, which are not points. So every of this one is wandering to some component of type 3. And under an additional assumption, which I will try to describe, non-tangency condition in a sense, each of these components is associated to an attractable. Okay, so it contains. Okay, so it contains each position in it when I now give it as a component of K, contains an attracting point. So let me repeat that this last statement is under some additional assumption, which I will introduce later. We are not able to prove it in full generality, and so we are not able to prove a conjecture in full generality. Okay? Maybe a comment here. If you look at the Julia set from the point of view of the maximal entropy measure, Or the maximal entropy measure, what you see is only points. So the points are full measure, that's the theorem of the small. So all these remaining ones are zero harmonic measures. Okay, so where is the where do you use this assumption on the movements? Step one, assumption on the jacuzzi. So I could be cleaning the two. Of the Jacobian. So let me explain the proof. Okay, I will try to explain the proof, the steps of the proof. So, step one is the assumption of the Jacobian. So, the assumption of the Jacobian guarantees that the slices that the vertical, so vertical slices are stable slices, are totally disconnected. Okay? So, in the first approach, we use one over d squared. In the first approach, we use one over d squared, and then we have a proof with Michel, which relies on the Will-Mann theorem, and Pierre Berger. Theorem and Pierre Berger gave us another argument which allows to relax the Jacobin assumption to one over t just by computing. So you have an exact formula for the order dimension of the stable spaces. This is hyperbolic dynamics, so you can compute dimensions. And the formula, as usual, is a certain entropy of our exponent, entropy of a certain equilibrium state for a certain potential. Okay, so the entropy is less than log b, and the exponent, if the Jacobian is smaller than log b, is bigger than log b. It's bigger than log D. Okay, so you get the dimension less than one, so it is totally disconnected. A connected set has dimension at most one, at least one. Okay, so that combined assumption ensures that you have a stable total disconnectivity. So an important consequence of the fact that the stable spaces are totally disconnected is that the stable filtration, so now I will fix a certain bi-disc, okay? Disc, okay, a large bi-disc containing the dynamics. The consequence of stable total disconnectivity is that the stable lamination is simple in the bi-disc, meaning that every leaf is a vertical curve of bounded degree and even uniformly bounded level. Okay? And it's quite easy because, you see, every component in a stable info is a point. So you can take a small loop around that point, then iterate it a few times, a small loop which avoids k minus, because, and just to iterate. minus because and just to iterate a few times and get a large disk with which escapes which escapes the by disk and not to have a uniformly bounded degree you use just properties of semi-continuity properties of the degree for convergence of it's a little clever but it's okay okay so the stable elimination is easy okay it's just a bunch of vertical submanifold there is one difficulty which plays a very important role in the proof that it can have tangency with the Proof that you can have tangency with the boundary of the bi-disc. And these tangencies with the boundary are the main source of difficulty, actually. Okay, so that's for step one. So, most important. So, step two is constructing external rates. Okay, so it is very important in our external race. And what we do is we just define external. So, we say we will define unstable. You see, we will define unstable external rays, and in unstable maps, in this case, you have plenty of critical points because the map is disconnected. So, when you have critical points, you know that the rays bump on critical points and they fork, they bike circuit. So, we don't, I mean, we don't want to define precisely if you have to turn left or right or whatever. And anyway, we don't have any model at infinity. It's not clear if the model at infinity is so you know, let me just define the external ray as a piecewise smooth. a piecewise smooth curve which is made of predant lines of J plus of G plus on the unstable 94. And the proposition, which is not difficult in this diabolic case, is that not very difficult, is that all external rays land and conversely every point in the Julia set is the landing point of some external ray. And also we have a Ray. And also, we have a kind of estimate of the speed of this external ray in terms of traveling along the ray along a certain length. Let me stay at the top. So it's not a complicated proposition. And we actually don't, the way we use external arrays in the proof, so we don't use descending external rays, but we use ascending external rays. So we view them in the ascending direction. And the reason is this. The reason is this. So, the important fact is this parallel which is upstairs, which we call the John Older property of the basin, which is that there exists a universal alpha which is related to the Older constant of the mean function, such that if you take any point which is outside k plus, you can escape from k plus quickly, so that it means that there is a certain part of length, uh something like eta to the power alpha, which s which uh brings you eta far from k plus. Brings you eta far from K plus. So you can escape quickly from K plus. Okay, so that's what external array do. An external array is the fastest way to escape the Julia set. So in this case, not only is this fast, but you have estimates. And this is very important because it has strong topological consequences on the geometry of the unstable slices of the Julia set. For instance, you cannot have a long channel between two components. So that's the purpose that we use. That's the port that we use. So this picture does not happen in our case because it's a typical situation where you need a long time to escape from K-plus. So this does not exist. And so it implies that the components of K-plus and NC verify are locally connected. And also it implies that you cannot have an accumulation of different components of big diameter, because otherwise it would create channels between components. Components. Okay? So it implies a very important finiteness property, which we can see in the theorem, is that components of a given diameter are uniformly separated from each other. So in particular, you have finitely many of them on some local unstable disk. So it's a finiteness property, which ultimately comes from this john property of the basic. So that's the main property. And together with local connectedness. So that was. So that was step two: how to use external arrays, and the answer is to escape the Julia set quickly. Step three is the classification of the components of J plus. So now, let me again fix a large bidisc and consider the connected component of J plus in that bidisc. So this is a bunch of vertical subsets. Okay, so some of these subsets will be just vertical manifolds, which will be a good one. Vertical manifolds, which will correspond to point components of the Julia set, and some are non-trivial. Okay, now, so you have this bunch of blue components here, and the Hemann map induces a non-invertible dynamical system on this, because you can have two components mapped to the same one. And the result is that for this set of components, we have exactly the same theorem as for hyperbolic polynomials that I mentioned one. So the statement is this: you have uncountably many components. This, you have uncountably many components, and only countably many of them are non-trivial. And if a component is non-trivial, then it is preperiodic to a non-trivial component. And there are only finitely many periodic ones. Okay? So that's the classification of a vertical component of a J. Okay? So repeat, let me repeat. You take J, you cut by disk and you look at the components. Okay, so the proof of this theory. Okay, so the proof of this theorem here. So, first step of the proof, the first part of the theorem, so proving that there are countably non-trivial components is easy given the previous step. So, one important consequence of the Bedford-Smiley ES6 is that you can find a global unstable transversal. So, there is a certain disk, an unstable contained in an unstable manifold, which is a global Which is a global horizontal manifold in the bi-disk. And the reason is that since the Julia set is disconnected, you can find a compact component somewhere of K plus, and you again you take a small loop around it and you iterate and the loop becomes large. It gives you this red curve. Now, look at the trace of the two components in this horizontal transverse hole. As I said, it is a certain set. It is a certain set which satisfies the John property, John holder property. So you only have finitely many components, for a given delta, you only have finitely many components of diameter bigger than delta. So you only have countably many non-trivial components. Okay, so that's not complicated. What is more complicated is to prove that every non-trivial component is periodic, is pre-periodic. And the way we prove it is to rely on a fixed thing decomposition for desired. Fixing the composition for these vertical components. So let me say that a component of J plus intersected with B is a thin if every unstable manifold, the diameter is smaller than delta. And say that it is thick if all the slices are diameter bigger than delta. And there could be an intermediate situation of a certain component which both has thin parts and thick parts. And what you put, that does not exist. Does not exist. So a component is either thick or thin. Okay? So precisely, there are two constants, delta 1, delta 2, such that every vertical component is either delta 2 thin, so all the slices are small, or all the slices are big. You cannot have a mixed situation like in the picture. And so how do you prove this? How do you prove this? So what you have to show is that if you have So what you have to show is that if you have you take some non-trivial component and assume that somewhere you take some unstable slice, assume that you see a small component of this unstable slice. Then you have to show that all slices are small. Then we do infect. Actually, so what is important here is to choose the bidisc B well. So again, as I said, it's complicated to deal with possible vertical or possible tangencies between the stable damage. Possible tangencies between the stable domination and the boundary, blah, blah, blah. So it relies on the clever choice of the bidisc. And here is what you can do. So you take your bidisc and say enlarge it by two. Okay, so you take the bidisc, twice the bidisc. The difference between the two you can subdivide into annuli, annuli cross a disc. Okay, so the picture is this. So this is D times D, and this is D times 2D. Okay, and I subdivide it into many Divided into many small annuli, many regions of the form disc for the annuli. And remember the stable foliation. Remember the stable lamination is a lamination by curves of uniformly bounded degree. Let me call this degree K. And I keep different annuli. Now, if you take one of these particular blue curves as a Riemann surface, it is a disk because of the Surface, it is a disk because of the maximum principle. It is the intersection of a copy of C with a pi disk. So it is a disc. So you have at most k minus one horizontal tangencies. So by pigeonhole, one of the angular does not contain any horizontal tangency. So you know that for every blue curve, there is one of these angular here which is free of horizontal tangency. Now what is nice is that since we are doing complex analysis, we have That since we are doing complex analysis, we have equalities for three. If there is no horizontal tangency in the region like that, if you look at the point in the middle, it must have definite angle with the horizontal, just by some poincarmetic reason. So you know that you have an angle, so there is one of these anguli such that this component here across the boundary of this uh middle circle is a uniform angle. Circle with a uniform angle. And now you apply the rate stability theorem for conditions. Okay? See, if now you take, since now you have found the bidisc, what I mean is that what I said is that for every blue curve you can find a bidisc which boundary is nicely transverse to it. So now if you take a small perturbation, it would remain transverse. So what I say is that if you perturb it a little bit here, just because it is a disk, so it has no topology, so no possible homology of the stable for this. So, no possible angle of B of the stable foundation. And since you have this nice angle, you can perturb it by some definite amount and you stay transverse to the boundary. So, the component is globally a product. So, what I state is that if you have a thin component, it remains thin all the time and it is global your product. Okay, so now how do you conclude the theorem? So, now you take any component. So, since you have expansion in the horizontal direction, it will be. Example in the unstable direction, it will become thick at some point. But you have only finitely many thick components. That's it. Okay, so it shows that every it shows that every non-trivial component, blah, blah, blah, is a free piot. Okay, step four is how we go from components of J plus to component of J, where you retire it forward and you apply some hyper dynamics. It's not too hard. Let me use the last. Let me use the last epsilon minutes to explain how we construct attracting cycles. And for the game you have to play this, as usual, we use the one-dimensional intuition. And what you have to do is to find the proof of the existence of attracting cycles for hyperbolic polynomials disconnected Julia sets, say, without using critical points. Because if you use critical points, points because if you use particle points you you you're lost and so that's a proof that's a proof of the existence of attracting cycles without particle points take a connected hyperbolic dresset in one dimension so since it is locally connected it contains a small path take one of so there is a small right path now you apply the dynamics okay when you apply the dynamics the path gets bigger because it is hyperbolic so the path will become long okay so because you can cover Okay, so because you can cover it with images of it becomes known. So when you iterate many, many times, it has to accumulate on itself. But so somewhere it has to accumulate on itself. But because of the job property, again, you cannot have channels like this. So when it accumulates on itself, it needs to intersect itself. And once it intersects itself, you have a loop in the Julia set. And once you have a loop in the Julia set, there must be. Look in the Julia set, it must be, there must be a factor component from the builder. So that's a proof without. And so, what we do is implementing this proof in two dimensions. Okay? And unfortunately, there's a difficulty because somehow, so we apply this argument and we have to saturate it. We have to saturate it by stable manifold in the bank disk, and in the process of making this saturation, we we need to be sure that this loop goes all the way to the boundary. And then tangencies with the boundary become a complete mess. With the boundary become a complete mess, it's very complicated. And so we are only able to conclude under some additional assumption. So, one easy assumption is that if you can find some bias such that the stable furiation is transverse to the boundary, then it's okay. Okay? Because this argument, the exact argument I gave you, you can just saturate by the stable frozen and you get your FA2 components. Okay? And otherwise, there's a slightly not slightly Not safely. There's a weaker condition that we call non-divergence of holonomy, which also guarantees the existence of attracting points. And maybe let me finish with two comments. So actually, this difficulty that we found at the end, this property, this divergence of holonomy, is a well-known problem in hyperbolic dynamics. And somehow it is the main obstruction for the absence of classification of anoser diffeomorphisms. So people would like to classify anosophyomorphisms. And other preferreds. You have several strategies for that. And so far, it's only known in dimension two. And one of the reasons why the strategy fails in higher dimension is this problem of divergence of all numbers, which we assume as in this case. And also another last comment. This problem of extending a loop from the Julia set to by stable my default is somehow similar to the problem of non-existence. Similar to the problem of non-existence of Hermann rings. If you want to prove that Hermann rings or Henoma do not exist, well, you take one orbit in the Hermann ring, you saturate by the stable lids, and you get the cylinder. And of course, if the cylinder in, even if the biodisc, if you're able to show, if the cylinder is transverse to the boundary of the biodisc, you get the contradiction right away, because of the maximum principle. And even more, if you can show with the intersection of the With the intersection of the cylinder with some stable manifold, with some unstable manifold contains a loop, then again you get a contradiction. So, for this Hermann ring problem, the difficulty is that you have this circle in the Hermann ring, you saturate by this nice holomorphic foliation, because the stable foliation in the ring is holomorphic. And it might be the case that every time you slice by a non-stable manifold, what you see is not a circle, but some dendrite. Okay? If you can solve this, you solve the Hanlon ring problem, and we have exactly the same problem. And we have exactly the same problem with saturating our loops from the Julia set to produce this component.
