Share my research work with you. Today I'm going to talk about algebraic versions of the rank conjecture. Yesterday Wolcker already mentioned the algebraic approach of the conjecture. Let me summarize the algebraic background of the conjecture in order to introduce my notation. So let's start with the rank conjecture in algebraic topology. If elementary evaluum P group of rank R X freely and cellularly on a finite C W complex X which is a homotopy equivalent to product of spheres then Then the rank of the group R is less than or equal to number of spheres. Right? As you all know, this conjecture is motivated by the result of Summit. Adam already mentioned the fact that Zp cross Z P cannot act freely on any sphere and Heiler verified. Heller verified the conjecture for the product of two spheres, and we have many contributed results with respect to different aspects of the conjecture. For instance, Barnard used the tame homotopy theory, and today I want to focus on Carson's work when p is equal to 2. At the beginning of my talk, I'm going to talk. Talk: I'm gonna talk about algebraic generalization of the rank conjecture, and then I introduce another stronger conjecture concerning varieties of strictly upper triangular matrices. And one of the case verifies the conjecture for product of three spheres. More precisely, I'm gonna show that. To show that Z2 to the four cannot act freely on product of three spheres. And I think this result also given by Rafae, so you can find it in the literature. Okay, so it's so natural to consider the homology if you have spheres. Spheres. So we have a more general conjecture, Halpering-Carson conjecture. So I'm going to state it for p torus. So if G is elementary abelian P group of rank R, which acts freely on any finite CW complex X. Then the total dimension of is maybe I should write with this notation, sorry, the total dimension of its homology is at least 2 to the r. When x is homotopy equivalent to product of spheres by Tunnet theorem, we have the rank conjecture, right? We have the rank conjecture, right? So this is stronger than rank conjecture. And Carson's aim was to translate the problem into algebra. So we consider the group in Kg. So suppose that K is Fp again G is elementary volume P group of rank R and if C is a If C is a free finitely generated differential graded KG module with the non-trivial homology, then dimension of its homology is at least two to dar. Okay, first of all. Okay, first of all, it's stronger than Artpain-Carson conjecture because in the conjecture X is any finite DW complex. That's why if you consider the cellular chains of X, they are also finitely generated chain complex of 3D KG modules and they have the same homology. And yesterday, Walker gave the details about the counterexample. Details about the counterexample. Band P is odd prime is bigger than or equal to 8. So this is given by Lynger and Walker. And the counterexample works only when P is outprim. works only when p is odd prime so p is equal to two is still open so that's why we should modify the conjecture for p is equal to two and i should also say that it's not a counterexample for the topological case this is given by henrik rupping and mark stefan One. So RP and Carson conjecture is still open for all prime p. And when p is equal to 2, Carson showed that the conjecture is equivalent to another conjecture in commutative algebra. So I So I'm going to consider the polynomial ring. So let's consider the field K, which is algebraically close and characteristic Q. And let's denote the polynomial ring with A. Sorry about my different notation. I think Wolcker used S. So let's say A is a polynomial ring. So let's say A is a polynomial ring in R variables, and if M is a semi-free finite degenerated differential graded A module with a non-trivial homology, and its homology is finite-dimensional as a k-vector space. Then the rank of the module is again given by the same lower bound. So we have an equivalent conjectures in here and Carson proved the equivalence by setting a functor from the category of Free chain complexes over Kg modules, sorry, Kg and to the category of differential graded A module. Maybe I should use a notation in here. Let's say C is from this category. With this differential, and let's use m from here. And I want to write the explicit formula for the differential because I'm going to give you a simple example. So the differential is given by this formula. Uh F is an A and here Kg isomorphic to this ring. Okay, this is T. Okay, as you can see, the differential is not the usual one on the tensor product, so that's why we are using twisted tensor. Okay, this is the algebra. Okay, this is the algebraic versions of the conjecture. And in 2018, this is joint work with Osgen Uni, we propose another conjecture which is stronger than conjecture two. Conjecture too. So we state this conjecture concerning varieties of strictly upper triangular matrices. Let's take K algebraically close field and A is a binomial ring in R variables with the degree of each xi is equal to plus one and we have some. We have some integers. I will explain what they represent. And I have a matrix D they are n by n matrices over A, and I have six conditions about the matrix D. First of all, D must be D must be strictly upper triangular matrix and it's square zero matrix. So actually D represents the differential of certain modules and each constant term in the matrix D must be zero. So let's write in this way. So when So let's write in this way. So when you plug zero, you have zero. Okay, so for instance, one cannot appear in my matrix D, and I have some rank condition. So maybe I should say in this way: so the rank of the matrix must be the half of the size. Size. That's why I set the capital N as two times n. And I have some degree condition. So let's say I have n tuple of non-increasing integers and each entry pij is a homogeneous polynomial. In A with the degree condition is each degree is given by di minus dj plus one. And the last condition is about the number of the first zero blocks. So maybe I should say in this way. So let's say Should say in this way. So let's say J is less than or equal to C. So the capital C represents the first leading zero columns and I is my last zero rows. Maybe I should explain by writing the matrix. So I have an n by n matrix and c is the C is the I have C many leading zero columns and R many ending zeros. And I have homogeneous polynomials in here. And our claim is the size of the matrix and The matrix n must be bigger than or equal to 2 to the r minus 1 times r plus c. Okay, let me show you the six conditions clearly. I'm sorry, let's go back. Okay, I think it looks better. Okay, so this is the conjecture. Can I ask a question? Yes. So this doesn't could talk about the homology of such a thing, right? The kernel of D modulo of the image, because it's squared, and you're not, if I'm understanding correctly, or maybe it's implying, you're not asking that that homology be finite length. That's not a it will come from the minimality. I will explain the first five conditions then. Then, when I talk about minimality, I think it will be clear. Right now, I don't have such a condition. Yes, so maybe I should start with the results. Then I promise I explain the first five conditions. So, first of all, the first five conditions imply the algebraic version of the Algebraic version of the rank conjecture for polynomial rings. And for any characteristic, we proved the conjecture for n is equal to 2, 4, and 6. And recently, I proved the conjecture for n is equal to 8. By the way, I should say that the last condition, we add the last condition just because of the results we obtained. Because of the results we obtained by group algebra programming gap, because we were looking for the counterexample at the beginning. That's why it is stronger than other conjectures. And again, we have a counterexample when p is odd prime and r is equal to 8, you can form the counter example. You can form the counterexample by using the construction of Engers and Wolcker. He mentioned the magical W yesterday. So you can obtain 252 by 252 matrix if you have eight variables, and this is not bigger than or equal to this number. But the again. But the example again is not a counterexample if p is equal to 2. So this conjecture is also open when p is equal to 2. And if we have this case, our conjecture implies all other conjectures I mentioned before. That's why when p is equal to 2, it implies the rank conjecture for spheres. So our aim was to understand the question in terms of matrices because it has advantages to do the calculations, right? So let me explain where the first five conditions. Where the first five conditions come from. First of all, let me recall the definition of minimal module. Someone asked Walker, so maybe I should state it. So we say that a differential graded A module is minimal if If when you transfer the differential with identity, you will get the zero map. And we prove that for each differentially graded A module, which is semi-free. And finite degenerated differenti-graded A module, there exists a minimal module. Let's denote it by M tilde, so this is minimal, and M is equivalent to, sorry, is quasi-isomorphic to minimal module. So we have a quasi-isomorphism. Let me show. Of it. Let me show you the process because I'm going to give you an example. If M is not minimal, then consider the basis and for some ij, differential Bi is given by C times Bj plus Plus the other term, so I should say it is not equal to j. Okay, here, this is from the polynomial ring, c is from the field and consider the new basis. So just New basis, so just replace Bj with a boundary of Pi, then it will give you a new basis. Let's say P1 prime, PI prime, Pn prime. Then consider the differential gradient submodule of M, that's denoted by E, is spent by these two elements. And it will give you a short exact sequence, which gives rise to a long exact sequence. But since E is a cyclic, we have a quasi-isomorphism, which is actually a surjective quasi isomorphism. Surjective quasi isomorphism. So we can repeat this process until one arrives at minimal module. So first of all, this is really important fact we are using in here. For each semi-free finite generated differenti graded A module, there exists a minimal one. And let me And let me tell you one more thing, then I will give an example. When you have a minimal module, let's say M is my minimal module, then there exists a homogeneous basis. Let's denote it again B1 to BN. Again, B1 to Bn such that boundary of Bi will be in the summand of this. So I try to say that I have strictly upper triangular matrices. Okay, so example. Let's start from the beginning. So let's just consider element. Element rebellion two groups, so my rank of the group is just one and take x as s1 and consider the antibody. So if you consider the rank conjecture in algebraic topology, so that g x on x with an antibodyle action, so I have a So I have a free action, right? Definitely free action, since only Iran element fixes NSLs. And if you consider the associated chain complex, the differential is given by one minus g, but remember that. Minus g, but remember that we have characteristic 2k. So I have isomorphism in here. So my differential is just a multiplication by t and let's recall the functor of beta functor given by Carson. So M is Given by this twisted tensor product, and let's try to calculate the differential. Why did it somewhere okay? If you consider the formula when r is equal to one, you can You can write the differential explicitly, right? And since I have S1, when I consider the associated chain complex, my differential is multiplication by T, then you may obtain the differential as four by four matrix, right? But clearly, it's not minimal, right? Because when you tensor it with k, it's not the zero map because of the one at the corner, that's why it's not minimal. But it's not so difficult to find the minimal module. So, if you consider the differential, then P1 is going to P1 is going to xb2 plus p4, right? Differential of p2 is equal to 0, differential of p3 is equal to x times p4, and differential of p4 is again 0, right? So this is the so I want to obtain a new basis. So this is the element I need to replace. So if I replace Place so if I replace B4 with boundaries of B1, then in the new differential, let's denote it by tilde. For instance, B3 will go to X squared B2, right? So B two is already going to zero. That's why my new differential will be zero x square zero zero. x square 0 0 and now when you tensor it with k it's definitely zero map right so it's the minimum it's the differential of minimal module right any question okay this is the simple example for the rank conjecture and for the other Conjecture. So let me explain why we have even dimension for the matrix. I think this is given by, again, Carson. If again M is semi-free, finitely generated differentially graded A module. Again, I have an assumption about the dimension of its homology, it has to be finite. And if M is any maximal ideal other than X one to X R Then homology of m tensor, this quotient will be zero, right? It's coming from the exactness of localization, and of course, this is necessary. It's not true, okay. And If you have a free finite dimensional module over k, its homology is equal to zero if and only if the dimension of m is equal to two times rank of the differential. Right? So Right, so by the previous lemma, so I can get the trivial homology, and this result is obvious by the first isomorphism term, right? That's why I have a even dimension, okay? So n must be equal to an even number, and as a result Rank of my matrix, which is strictly upper triangular, if I evaluate my homogeneous polynomials at gamma, the rank must be equal to the half of the size. So we may consider the algebraic version of the curve. The algebraic version of the conjecture given by Carson in terms of matrices. And let me show you examples for our conjecture. I hope you can see it, right? I hope you can see it, right? Okay, so let me remind you the assumption. So here we claim that n is bigger than 2 to the r minus 1 times r plus c. C is this number, r is this number, so it's equal to 1 in equal to one in the first example. So it comes from the antipodal action of Z2 and S1. And if you consider the elementary abelian two group of rank two and if you take X as S1 cross S1 so R is equal to 2. R is equal to 2. If you try to calculate the differential, you will get 16 by 16 matrix, which will be not a minimal module again. It has ones. Then, when you apply the process for minimality, you will get this differential. And it again satisfies the inequality. Actually, we have. Inequality. Actually, we have equality for this example. And it should be familiar to us from Cuzo complexes, right? If you consider the polynomials, this is Kuzu complex. Okay, and for instance, when R is equal to three, this is. This is an example for n is equal to eight. Again, c is equal to one, r is equal to one. Maybe I should also mention about the degrees. So this is the linear case, so my degrees are just zeros. But again, I have a Kuzu complex in here. Complex in here. I didn't write the minus sign in here, sorry about that. But if you consider the Kuzoo complex, you have this matrix, right? Right. And okay, they are coming from the spheres, but for instance, when I have dimension six. I have this example, and here C is equal to 1, R is equal to 2 with the degree 1. At the beginning, I have 1, the others are 0, and it again satisfies the condition. So I want to show this is the same thing. So, I want to show this is the examples. Actually, we have really sharp bounds in here. Okay, we have equalities. For instance, I don't know which manifold it comes from. Maybe someone knows from the audience. I don't know. Anyone? I thought that maybe it might be a minimal manifold, but I'm not sure. Okay. Um now I want to mention the related work given by Aramo Bookweiss and Anger. I want to I want to consider the free flags. So let me give you the definition. So if f is a differential module over the associative ring, let's say R, then we define a free differential flag. Of F is a chain of R sub modules starting from the zero. Let's use L for the last one, such that each quotient is a free R module of finite rank. R module of finite rank and the differential of fi is in the fi minus one. So we have a nice filtration in here. And we say that f has a free flag with l plus one holes. If you are familiar to Carson's work, To Carson's work, I think he used composition series and but he starts from the one, I guess. That's why he used Q, sorry, L for the length of the composition series. And let's define the pre-class pre-class is the infimum of this link. Infivum of this length. So if F admits a free flag with M plus L plus one false, then free class is equal to infimum of L. If F admins no finite free flag, it means that free class is equal to infinity. And our remote bookweiser. Auroma Bukweis and Ianger as a theorem about the lower bound of the pre-class. Okay, I think I should maybe I should say corollary, but okay, let me write it in this way. If we have a differentially graded A module, I think this is valid for I think this is valid for a big con Makalai ring, but I'm going to use it for polynomial ring. Again, with the assumption the homology is non-trivial and less than infinity, so it's finite. If F has a free differential flag. That is free class is less than or equal to L because it's the infimum, then they prove that this L must be bigger than or equal to the dimension of the ring since I have a polynomial ring in R variables, so we have this result: L must be bigger than or equal to the number of variables. And the other result is again given by our remote bookweys and anger. If again F is a differential graded A module with these conditions, then if we suppose that it's three classes equal to L, which is Equal to L, which is some finite number, then differential of Fi cannot be subset of F to the I minus 2. I mean, we cannot get a shorter sequence, and we have restrictions about the rank of each quotient. The first one and the last one must be at least one, and the others must be at least two. Okay, so let's use these facts to our case. Now let's go back to the matrix D. So, I have a strictly upper triangular squared real matrix with the six assumptions, and I will also introduce the notation for the type of the notation for the type of the matrix T. So T0 is type of my matrix. It means that I have T0 by T00 blocks at the diagonal. And the first one is C, the last one is R and clearly the summation of Ti's are equal to size of the matrix. To size of the matrix. And if there's a basis in which D appears, then the span of the first T0 basis gives us F zero So, you can construct the flag in this way. And note that actually ti is the rank of the each quotient. And we will use the results given by Aromo and Buffis and Ianger for these type of the metrics. Okay, I think we are ready for the proof. Let me write the theorem first. First, if we have at least four variables, M is semi-free finitely generated differentially graded A module. Let's say I'll rank N again with the assumption If the homology is non-trivial and finite-dimensional as a k-vector space, then the rank of the m must be bigger than 8. So let's prove it. Actually, it is enough to prove it for r is equal to 4. And if And if you suppose that M is the semi-free finite degenerate differentially graded A module, then without loss of generality, I can suppose that n is the smallest rank of all differential graded models. All differential graded modules satisfying the condition in the theorem. And by lemma one, I know that there exists a minimal module. And by abuse of notation, I use m again for the minimal one. And further, I can assume that has a free flag. Such that is free class is equal to L. So I think I proved this in my thesis, which maybe is in an explicit way, but we know that for each semi-free differential graded finitely generated differential graded A modulum, there exists a minimal one and it has a free flag. It has a free flag. Okay, now let's show that n cannot be equal to 8. Okay, by the theorem given by Aromo, Buchweiser and Eyenger, we know that this length L must be bigger than or equal to the number of variables. Of variables and remember that the rank of each quotient in the filtration, if you take the summation, it must be equal to n. But it is bigger than or equal to 4 means you have at least five lengths, and you have to okay, you can put one at the beginning, but the other. Put one at the beginning, but the others must be at least two, right? So, this is the only possibility, and this is clearly not possible for n is equal to two, four, or six, but n might be eight with this type, right? This is the only possibility, so we should eliminate this case. And it's not so difficult to prove that we cannot find a matrix with this type, which also satisfies the six conditions in the conjecture. Let me show the proof because it's so easy. We will just use linear algebra. So with this type. I have the matrix T and my size is 8, and we know that each entry is a homogeneous polynomial in A and Remember that the square is equal to zero. That's why when you multiply, for instance, the matrix, okay, maybe I should write in this way. If you consider the greatest common divisor of the pairs P24 and 2,5, then I may write 2, 4, P25. two four p two four as a times two four bar and that's why they are really relatively prime right and I can do this for the others and when I take the square eventually I will multiply them so for instance consider the b as the greatest common divisor The B as the greatest common divisor of the others, let's say P3435. So you have the following equality. When you multiply this, you have, for instance, this equality. But A is unique, so you have a UFT. So since they are relatively prime, I mean to They are relatively prime, I mean 2, 4, and 2, 5, and the others. That's why, for instance, you can write P56 bar as some unit times P24 bar. Just consider the characteristic two case, but you can do this also for other characteristic, right? So without changing the rank, I can rewrite by. Changing the rank, I can rewrite by metrics by using these units. So here u is a unit. Then t will be in this form. Now remember that we suppose the number of variables are the number of variable is four. The number of variables is four, and just focus on the matrix in the middle that's denoted by t. By the theorem in algebraic geometry, if we have four variables, we can find a non-zero root for three polynomials. Let's say gamma is the root, so I will choose t2 for. P24 bar as my first polynomial and P25 bar, and I will choose the third polynomial as the minor of the matrix T, so let's say M2, 3, 6, 7, right? And they are all equal to 0 since I have an algebraic clause field. Algebraic clause field, then it means that all 2 by 2 minors of the matrix T is equal to 0 at gamma. Therefore, the rank of the T at gamma cannot be equal to 2, right? It can be at most 1, but it means that the rank of the matrix D D can be at most three. That's why we have a contradiction with the fact that the rank of the matrix is half of the size, so it's not equal to four. Okay, so this is the proof of the rank conjecture when p is equal to two, and if you have a product of three spheres, three spheres. Maybe I should write as a corollary. Write as a corollary because when r is equal to 4 and cannot be equal to 8 means m must be bigger than 3. Any question? Any questions? Okay, let's. I don't know. I'm just talking about the top. Everything, continue. Everything is good. I wasn't sure if you were finished or. I may mention about n is equal to 8 for the whole conjecture, but if you have questions, I can stop in here. No, no, I didn't want to interrupt you. Just simply hear TGD models, but does it work for differential? GD modules, but does it work for differential modules, or was there some subtlety? I cannot hear. In the statement of your theorem, it was stated for DGA modules, and I was curious if it works for differential A modules, or is there some subtlety? You mean not graded? Or in the theorem statement at PG? Yeah, differentially graded A module, right? It still works if you just have a differential A module. Yes, okay. Let me talk at the same time. I cannot hear anyone from the meeting room. Sorry. He's going to ask later. He's asking if it still holds for differential modules, not just differential graded modules. Maybe. I'm not sure. Sorry. Thanks. Any other questions? Okay, maybe I should say a few things about. Maybe I should say a few things about if you want to prove it for product of four spheres, so you should eliminate the case when r is equal to five, you should show that and is not equal to 16, but it's not so easy like the case for product of three spheres because in this case, okay, we know that the length must be bigger than or equal to five, but Or equal to five, but we have also possibilities, right? It might be eight or shorter, for instance, the type might be given by this T. So we have lots of possibilities for R is equal to 5 case, but when I do the proof for not just for 8, when we do the proof for n is equal to 2, 4, 6. Is equal to two, four, six, or eight, we use the stratification of the varieties. And by the work of Rotba, I think it's given by in his PhD thesis, we can stratify the varieties by using boreal orbits and they have the nice representatives. That's why we can calculate by using. By using a computer, we can calculate the whole asset diagram so we can see the each boreal orbit, which represents also the matrix D, so we can see the minimal ones. So we are still looking for the pattern for the minimal modules, but we couldn't find it. So we are still working on it. So I think I should start. I put four. I don't know whether you can hear me. Can you hear me? No. Yeah, I can. No. Okay, very good. So my question is the following. I think Carlfun states in his paper, where he proves the case R equal to 3 and P equal to 2, that he also knows that the conjecture holds for R equal to 4 and claims that the way he proves it will not. The way he proves it will not generalize to your R. But I have never seen a proof of R equal to four in the general case, not for the seal case, not for three seals, but just a boundary 16. So I wonder whether Carlson still sort of claims he knows his results for I to four or whether this is uncertain. Does anybody know about this? I didn't see any proof for i is equal to five. Well, not i equal to five, i equal to four, but not for the sphere case, the general case where you have the estimate two to the four, so 16. And in his paper, I think it's a paper for the Moore celebration, 60th birthday of Moore, where he proves the case R equal to 3, he has this claim. He says the all. It's plain. He says he also knows it for r equal to 4, that this conjecture holds, and makes a statement. But the way he proves it does not generalize for bigger r than four. But he doesn't indicate how he proves it for i equal to four. So I wonder what the state is. I don't know it either. Okay, so probably nobody knows, but you should ask Carlson about this, whether he still claims that he knows about. Are there other questions? Okay, if there are no other questions, then let's thank Bering again. And we have the open mic session in a bit of over half an hour. Take over half an hour where everybody can contribute.
