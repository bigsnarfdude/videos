Well, thanks so much, John. Thank you, organizers, because I know it takes a lot of work to pull together a conference like this. And it's really been a pleasure to talk to everyone at the conference. And also, the view is pretty spectacular, so I'm really happy to be here. So, today we're going to talk about a GABO action on cyclic bailey covers. And in order to make this more about modern techniques in diaphanic geometry, then I'd like to show how. Geometry, then I'd like to show how that gives a new proof of a result of Grandberg. So, to start, we're going to need a curve. Well, to start, we're going to need a prime actually. So, let's fix P, which just for today looks like to be at least 11. And we're going to also fix K, which is between 1 and P minus 2. And the curve that we're going to look at today is a famous curve. famous curve given by y to the p equals x x minus one to the k and so you can view this as a cover of the projective x line where it's branched at zero one and infinity so um and um those are the only branch points above zero one and infinity and since this has an automorphism of order p which takes x y to the x Which takes xy into the x zeta py, we can then see that this is, in fact, an alpha cover of the projective y that branch just at these three points. So these are famous not only for being Bailey maps, but also because from the work of Brotinik, we can understand that the action of the absolute Galois group of Q is characterized by how it acts on curves that are branched only at three points on the projected line. Uh, three points on the projected line, and also one or two other cases. And so, this type of curve plays an important role in Galois theory. There's also a lot of work of Ihara on curves like this. And also, curves like this show up a lot in number theory because when you look at them over finite fields, you get all these Jacobi sets. So, these are some reasons why these curves are very popular. Okay, so in particular, I want to fix one pattern. There's one path here, so we'll call it B naught. So you can think of that as a, we can just write it down with formulas where x is given by 1 minus t and y is given by the pth root of 1 minus t times minus t to the. So let's look at the Jacobian of this curve. And this is a And this is a principally polarized abelian variety. Its dimension is the genus, which in this case is p minus 1 over 2. And we can see that this Jacobian has complex multiplication by the field k, which is the cyclotomic field q z. All right, and so we can think about the endomorphism pi given by the action of gamma minus. Even by the action of gamma minus one. And so, what did Greenberg prove? This was in 1980. Proved that if you look at the pi-cubed torsion on the Jacobian, then that is contained inside the p-torsion on the Jacobian. On the Jacobian, which is defined over k, and in addition, he gave a criteria for equality. And this criteria was proved by Kuri Hara. 1992. Okay, so let me just give a few remarks. So, first of all, there's a lot of work by Coleman and Gross and Gorlick about the torsion on these Jacobians. And in fact, except for a few small cases, the p-torsion is the only torsion on these Jacobians. This also relates to things like hospital torsion packets. Things like cuspital torsion packets and connects with Augs conjecture, which is also a big topic. And in particular, work of Coleman, Tamagawa, and Sermias is about this curve and the cuspidal torsion packets. So there was also work trying to make an effective algorithm to try to find these torsion points and compute with them. And that was done by Sirmias, but it's only been implemented for very small primes like five and seven. And even this. And even this result, when p is equal to 5, has applications to things like quintic reciprocity, as you can find in a paper of Grant. Now, the other thing I want to mention is that this is just one class of curves, and similar results have been found by other authors for other classes of curves. In particular, you might want to look at a recent paper by Michel Arou. So, but I'm not today, I'm just focusing on this class of curves. Okay, so I'd like to give you just a brief sketch of Greenberg's proof because what's really incredible about it is that in a short 15 pages, he manages to fit in practically every topic you might find in a course on arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory at the graduate level. So let's just kind of think about what kinds of things we go into Greenberg's proof. Okay, so first of all, Okay, so first of all, we need a description of the P. torjana, Jacobi, and this is done by beta violence. Then we need to understand some kind of criteria when the p infinity torsion over some number field F will be equal to the kernel of pi to the s. So we need a sort of a criteria for that. Of a criteria for that, and that's done in terms of paint modules and Gala representations. Then we need the V pairing and complex conjugation in order to say that, well, as long as the entire p-tworkian is not contained in, is not rational over F, we get that sort of S is. That sort of s is odd under some condition that the entire controls not contained, is not defined over s and then we look at unit groups and norms in order to show that s has to be greater than flat. So that's how that's how we get this statement right here. Lynn Greenberg spends the majority of his paper giving this criteria for equality. Giving this criteria for equality. And so, first, there's some work over finite fields, including zeta functions, and Jacobi sums, and Stickelberger's theorem. Can I just clarify? Whenever K IQ, you mean KIQ K? No, this is, so the, this is, so we, we work over K bars. Okay, that was, yeah, yeah, thank you. Okay, so then I was working on the funny fields, then we work over. On the finite fields, then we work over local fields in order to understand the action of the Galois group on the inertia group and the Artin map and Chevotov density theorem. This gives a local condition under which this would not be inequality. And coming into whether the prime divides certain Bernoulli numbers, unfortunately, the prime sometimes does divide those Bernoulli numbers. So then we start, Wienberg starts building this connection with the real cyclotomic unit. Connection with the real cyclotomic units. This requires the eigenspace decomposition of this p-torsion, the power residue symbol, Art and Toss reciprocity law, Bauer's theorem that Gau extensions are determined by the primes that split completely in that. So there are a lot of tools being used to finally get a criteria. This criteria for equality boils down to the last group over K when we Over k, when we look at the psyllop subgroup of that, and then we look at a particular eigenspace for that being trivial. So just want to say a little bit about how Kurihara approved this condition, then that this eigenspace for the PCLO subgroup of the cross-group is trivial. There was work. Group is trivial. There was work of Lee and Scars, I don't know how to say it, Scarsabar, about Hulan's K-theory and showing that sort of K4 of Z was trivial, modulus on two and three torsion. And so Kurihara then showed that a certain H2 is a sum n of that K group and then used that in order to show this. Okay, so that's Okay, so that's the background there. And so today what I'd like to talk about is an action of the absolute Gallo group G10 on a tall homology of the curve with coefficients of V minus P. So So, and then as an application, this is that. I have one more detail to check, but pretty sure that this then is enough to show that Curry-Harlow's result, this gives sort of a new method to show Greenberg's result. And it also gives a little bit more information. Can I ask you a question? So is this H1, this homology, is this defined to be the dual of the Hulk homology? So this is the I'm not sure, Jordan, but I'm going to at some point. But I'm going to at some point make it isomorphic. This is then going to be isomorphic to the Peteborg. Does that answer your question? Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, thank you. So, how does this give a little more information? Well, I'll say more about this later, but the one thing that you might want to really understand. One thing that you might want to really understand is rather than dealing with the action of this absolute Galois group, which I should mention that nobody actually knows what that absolute Galois group is because it's an infinite pro-finite group. And that's what the inverse Galois problem is about, is even showing what its finite quotients are. So we'd sort of like to not really work with that group, but with only a finite quotient of it. And in order to do that, we need to, so you see, So you see, so both Greenberg and Anderson had some results about which field does this action factor through and it turns out that I can show that these I can show that these fields are optimal. So, another thing you could maybe say is that this is this proof that's a little bit more modern because we're essentially replacing all those things I just mentioned in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. Arithmetic geometry with some work on Anderson on cancerology and some work of Rachel Davis, myself, Besnes Lojanoska, and Kirsten Likkelbren. About this Galois action of the markers. And then we can also, as a corollary, also figure out the field of definition of the 5 torsion on the Jacobian. It turns out that the 5 torsion of the Jacobian is defined over a field T, where T Where t is found by taking the cyclotomic field and enjoining the p-th root of z. What is z given by a power of zeta p times powers of one minus zeta p to the minus phi raised to the i squared as i goes from one to p minus one over two and this one over two and this this number or zero is one half of the sum of the cubes what p wishes minus one squared us one squared over to the sound yeah let's see any questions So, okay, let's start with just some facts about these curves. So, we already talked about the cyclic Bailey curve, but there's another curve hanging out in the background, which is the Fermat curve of degree P. So maybe I should have said this is the most famous curve of all time. And this curve dominates x to the k, and it has genus minus one over two times minus. Now the second fact that Jora already mentioned is that this p-torsion on the Jacobian On the Jacobian isomorphic as a Gao module to the homology with coefficients with mod p. And because of that, you can also see that the torsion points that are rational over any number field F are going to be the GF invariance of that homology. Of that homology. Now, what's special about these curves is they have a lot of geometric automorphisms. So the Fermant curve actually has two automorphisms of order P acting on X and Y. And one thing that's important is that the action of the arithmetic automorphisms commutes with these geometric. Well, no, because these curves have CM, they have really a lot, a lot of morphisms. And in fact, if you work not exactly with the homology, but maybe with the relative homology, you can then in fact show that the relative homology is a free. Show that the relative homology is a free module for the action of certain group rings. So, in our particular case, let's say we look at xk, and then we have the Jacobian of XK has an action of Z zeta. And so, working with dimensions and ranks and things, we can then in fact. Some things, we can then, in fact, say that the that this monology, I'm gonna search, there's a little technical thing happening here where we're just gonna like add on the end points of this path as in terms of making a relative homology. But this is a three And so of rank one, and so its basis is then the class of the path E0. And this is important because what it means is that if you want to understand the action of an If you want to understand the action of an arithmetic automorphism, its action is determined by what it does on and furthermore. This action of this arithmetic automorphism on E naught has to be inside this relative homology. So it has to be something in this module multiplied by E naught. And so we're going to define E sigma bar to be the element in Z mod P sable P. Say with p such that the action of sigma on e naught is just multiplication of e naught by that by that element. So think about all the simplifications that have happened here. So we've worked, rather than working with this, we have this absolute galaxy acting on the homology. Now we've said using this fact, we really only need to figure out what that action is doing to Ethan. And there is a similar fact about the Vermont group. Okay. Any questions? So, what Anderson proved in this context is that the GK action on the On the homologies of the Mahara, coefficients of Greek mod P, it factors through a field L, which is the splitting field of the polynomial one minus one minus x to the p over p. And this you know Field is not so complicated if you could think about it as an extension of this atomic field where you join peak roots of certain things. So we have q, then we have k, which is q zeta p. And then we could join the pth root of zeta p and we could have. And we could adjoin the pth root of 1 minus theta p to the minus i as i ranges from 1 to p minus 1 over 2. And it turns out that the field L is the composite of those states. So this field L, I should mention, also contains the field where you would join the Where you would join the peef roots of the circle time of the unit. And as such, the Gadelog group of L over K, let's call that Q is an elementary abelian T group. The elementary abelian p group. Frank, P plus one over two. Here is an assumption of Vanderburgh's conjecture that P doesn't divide the size of the class group of the real cyclotarmic field group. And so what Anderson did was to give away a stigma. You have a way of thinking. So, what this means is that in order to understand the GK action, we really only need to understand the action of Q, all the other representation Q. And Anderson gave sort of a theoretical setup for how to do this. And with Richard Davis and Kristen, we actually found these formulas. So this is on the floor. Now, unfortunately, those formulas were really complicated. And one way of thinking about that is the Fermat has these two automorphisms of order P. And as such, the relative homology is a module for this group ring. And this group ring is much more complicated than just a group ring with one generator here. And so recently this spring, And so recently this spring, I started thinking, well, what would happen if we just looked at these formulas on the curve XK rather than on the Fermat curve? And there was this huge collapsing of the formulas, and they could be understood a lot more in terms of the augmentation ideal because this group ring is so much easier than this group ring. Which time do I have? 15 minutes. Oh, great. Let's see. Any questions? So, I think, so it was very frustrating for me for many years trying to explain these formulas. Trying to explain these formulas on the Fermat curve, and I would do these Beamer slides, but the formulas wouldn't even fit on one Beamer slide. And so that was discouraging for me. And so I want to show you those formulas just because they are possible to write down here on one blackboard. So these are the formulas for the action of Q and Q based on the homology of the curve. Of the curve xk, holding coefficients theta, q acting on e naught should be the q bar times e naught. And so we just need to write down what pq bar is. So for all people. So, for all p and for all k in this range, the first thing to notice is that there are two automorphisms that act trivially. Oh, I need to explain what this notation means. So, because this group is an elementary abelian p-group, we can write down things in this group by how they act on these fields right here. So, let's write up. So let's write Q as just a tuple, C0 through Cp minus 1 over 2. And C0 tells you how it acts on the pth root of zeta p. pth root of zeta p should be zeta p to this zero times the pth root of zeta p and for all the other ones it tells you how it acts on this part here so q Here so q of the pth root of one minus eta p minus i tells you how this automorphism should act on this generator of this field. So it turns out there are two automorphisms. This one 011111 and this one minus 212 up to p minus 1 over 2. But these But these act trivially on H or XAZ1. Now, this was already proved by Greenberg because these two are the automorphisms that generate the Galois group of L over the cyclotomic field. And Greenberg had proved that the action on this homology factor through L. On this molecule factor through L's atomic field. The one thing that neither Anderson nor Greenberg proved is that they do not act trivially. When I say act trivially, I mean as by the identity, meaning that their Gala representation is trivial. They don't act trivially on the topology of the marker. Okay, so once we've nailed down what's happening with those automorphisms, we can then focus on the automorphisms that generate the cyclotomic, the L-cyclotoma plus over K. And those can be characterized by writing Q in terms of a zero component. So it fixes the P root of theta P and that then all of these. And that then all these other entries have to sum to zero odd p. And in this case, in this case, we can say that EQ bar is going to be a truncated exponential nerve acting on a particular thing that I'm going to call W. So this truncated So, this truncated exponential map is just the exponential, but you stop. You stop at after the terms. And this W is sum as I goes from one to K minus one of Ci over I gamma. gamma i plus gamma k i plus where this gamma i and right here c p minus i right so um so these are the formulas I hope I'll have time to explain why the exponential map and why this kind of other structure of this map show up Other structure in this map show up, but I'm not sure if that was good or not. Okay, so once you have those formulas then, the question is, how does this connect back to Greenberg? The idea then is that you can just actually look at what these formulas are telling you. We want to switch a basis because We want to switch a basis because gamma has a nice property that its p power is one. But if we switch to pi, which remember is gamma minus one, then we have the nice property that will support the milk hook basis because its pth power is zero. And so just using the binomial theorem, you can look at these formulas and check out that. And check out that O cubed, Bq minus one is in the ideal generated by pi cubed. And that then immediately shows that the pi cubed origin is contained in the p to find over k. Let's just think about that for a minute. Why is that? That means that if you take something in the kernel of If you take something in the kernel of pi cubed and then you multiply by b cubed minus one, that's like multiplying by pi cubed, so you get zero. And so that shows that b cubed bar acts like the identity on the on the kernel of pi cubed. Okay, and then the other thing you can say is that if p is rare for planner, the condition of being Of being in the ideal pi to the fourth is true if and only if well the sum of ci times i squared is zero mark and so you can then check that this is not true um for the whole And then I should just mention that in the background here, if you want to understand the action of all the automorphisms, then you end up with sort of a Vandermont matrix for this action. And as long as P doesn't divide certain binomial coefficients, then you can see that for every Q which is not in the subject. Which is not in the subgroup generated by Q1 and Q2, Q will act non-trivially on H1XKZ mod P for some K. So I think I have five minutes left. All right. So I just want to say a little bit more about Anderson's result because that's really the what makes this whole Galois action thing work is some theory that he set up. So what was his theory? So, what was his theory? So, he looked at this group frame. So, he was, Anderson was working on the Vermont group. And he set up a whole inductive structure of Vermont varieties of increasing dimension and thought of them in an intuitive way. One thing, but just using the geometric automorphisms of the curve and also. Morphisms of the curve and also all the symmetries of the Fermat curve and the Fermat surface. He was able to show that this element Bq should be symmetric as you switch these two automorphisms and that also it should be a unit and then he also defines some sort of differential map. Sort of differential map, and working with the Fermant curve and the Fermat surface, he showed that this PQ had to be in the kernel of that differential map, which meant that it had to be in the image of some earlier differential map coming from this group ring on just one variable, Zp, which I'm zeta p. So, in other words, there's some element gamma q that maps to pq. And this differential map here is kind of the underlying reason for the structure of this W. Although this W is simpler on the quotient curve than it is on the Fermat curve. Then he thought about the differential log map going to the Kayler differentials and maps. And mapped gamma q down to ψ q and its logarithmic differentials. This was really interesting to me because logarithms show up in Greenberg's paper too and the really crux part of his proof. And so, and then these logarithmic differentials, it turns out that they end up being isomorphic to the. To the homology of the affine line minus the non-trivial peak interior relative to the line segment 0, 1 with the coefficients in 0 p. And so, what I did with the three cooperous Davis Bergenoscar Jokelbrain was to show that. Was to show that at least over the cyclotronic field, this breaks up into the homology of TM, a bunch of copies of that. And then we use Kumar maps to express what was happening around each of these missing points in terms of a Cumber map. And that is how, and then we sort of backtracked this map using. Through this map, using this truncated exponential map, and that's where our formulas of the Fermat curve came out, which then vastly simplify when we look at them on the curve XK. I think it's a good time to stop. Thanks for your morning.
