This meeting is being recorded. Okay. Yes, yes, you can start. So let us listen to Vadim Kaloshin talk about the non-coexistence of two and three rational caustics in nearly circular video tables. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, thank you for the invitation. So, um So the main topic of my talk is going to be not directly related to celestial mechanics, but it will be related to a conservative dynamics. And what I'm going to study, I'm going to study billiards in the convex domain. So it is a conservative system. So maybe you flip to the next page. So let me briefly. Let me briefly describe the plan of my talk. So, I start by showing you what dynamical system I'm going to study. Namely, I'm going to study billiards in a convex region. And the fundamental topic of my research are going to be chaotistics, or more precisely, rational chaotistics. Rational chaotistics are Rational chaistics are curves which consist of periodic orbits. I will give a more precise definition later. And probably the most famous example of a curve with a rational chaotistic is the curve of a constant width. When you take a circle, then certainly a circle has a constant width because in every direction you could pass the diameter passing through the origin. But it turns out that there are many. Origin, but it turns out that there are many curves of a constant width. And in terms of billiard dynamics, they correspond to orbits which bounce back and forth, back and forth in any direction. And what I'm going to do, I'm going to show you using so-called supporting functions, that actually there is an infinite-dimensional manifold of those domains. And the first main result will be that it turns out that it is not possible. Out that it is not possible to have a domain which is nearly circular, for which there is a family of period two orbit or two chaustic and family of period three orbit. And this is what I call three chaustic. So it shows quite remarkable rigidity because to a billiard map I will associate a twist map. And what I insist is that this twist map will have two. Gwyze map will have two families of periodic orbits. Then I will speculate a little bit, and I think the result is surprising because the result shows that one-half plus two-thirds is less than one. And I'll try to explain why it is surprising. And I will tell you that we are missing some regularity statement which is which may Which may explain what happens. And could you flip one more time? Then the next main result is going to be about coexistence of three and five caustics, which means coexistence of a family of period three orbit and family of period five orbit. And we couldn't prove it, but we gave a part. Prove it, but we gave a partial result that it may be possible that there are nearly circular domains which are not ellipses and for which three and five calistics do exist. And I don't know how much time I will have, but I may or may not talk about ideas which are involved into the proof and it's so-called KAM scheme. KAM scheme for an associated conservative system. So the model which I will be studying are convex billiards. So you take a convex domain and you send a massless particle. And whenever massless particle hits the boundary, then reflection is elastic. And it means. Elastic, and it means that angle of incidence is equal to angle of reflection. So, my goal to understand this dynamical system, understand the families of periodic orbits which arise here. But that is a dynamical system. So, when you study billiards, usually there are two ways you could think about billiards. One way is you have a billiard table. Way is you have a billiard table and you are basically drawing rays and you are drawing the reflected rays. But a different way to do it is look at so-called billiard map. And what billiard map? It takes a point on the boundary, it parametrizes the boundary by lens, and it picks a point on the boundary and gives it a coordinate S in terms of lens parameterization and an angle of reflection. And the billiard map takes. And the billiard map takes a particle which starts at the point x with an angle theta, and then you wait until the associated ray hits the boundary again. And if it hits at the point with a length parameterization S prime and the angle of incidence theta prime, you are saying that they have a billiard map which sends S theta into S prime theta prime. So the simplest example of billiards. The simplest example of billiards is billiards in a circle. So for billiards in a circle, I hope you could guess that you could compute these billiard maps quite easily. So since the picture has a lot of details, let me try to do it in steps. So if you want to see periodic orbit of period two, I hope it is quite easy to see. Hope it is quite easy to see on a circle. You are simply shooting in the direction of the center, it reflects and comes back. So, for period two orbits, it's very easy to construct period two orbits, just draw the diameters of the circle. Then, the next is you ask yourself whether you could construct period three orbits, and here there is a violet, or is it? Violet, or is it a pink triangle? It corresponds to a period 3 orbit. And if I draw one period 3 orbit, then I could simply rotate this period 3 orbit relative to the origin. And having one period 3 orbit, there will be the whole family of period 3 orbits. And if you start to look at the billiard map, then you will actually see this family of period 3 orbits. Family of period 3 orbits as an invariant curve. And I try to show the pink triangle on the billiard table and the pink invariant curve on the actual cylinder. Then you ask yourself, can I see higher period orbits? And for example, if you look at violet, I hope you could see the pentagon: one reflection, two reflections, three reflections, four reflections. Three reflections, four reflections, five reflections. So it gives you a period, five periodic orbit. And if you start rotating this pentagon, then there will be a curve which corresponds to period five periodic orbits. Or in more dynamical terms, on this picture, you see one parameter family of period 3 orbits, which is pink. You have one. Which is pink, you have one parameter family of period five orbits, which is violet. And actually, if you look a bit more carefully, then for light green, my memory is that this is period eight orbit. So the reason I'm telling you this, because there are two ways to think about periodic orbits on the billiard table, is one way, and for the billiard map, is the other way. And the formula for the billiard map in this Formula for the billiard map in the circle allows you to do the calculation of periodic orbits. So the important notion for the billiard dynamics is a notion of a caustic. So what is the notion of a caustic? So cowistic is in the case of the In the case of the circle, the circular billiard, it's a coccentric circle. For example, if you look at the blue orbits, then I hope you see that the blue orbits, they are all tangent to a circle. They more or less envelope a circle, what is inside. And this concentric circle is called a chaistic. And the main property is that if I send a ball tangential to the associated circle, then after reflection, it is again tangential. Reflection, it is again tangential. Then I'm saying that I have a caustic, and caustics actually correspond to invariant curves of the associated billiard map. And on the previous slide, I showed you that there is a caustic which is associated to pink triangles. And actually, I didn't want to make the picture even more messy. The picture even more messy, but here there should be a pink circle concentric to the orange centric circle, which is tangent to all the pink triangles. And similarly, there is a violet circle which will be tangent to all pentagons. So, can we flip? So, now let me give you a definition which is now not only for this. Which is now not only for the circle but for any convex domain, and the definition is the definition of a chaustric. So, a chaustric is actually a curve which satisfies the following property. I take an orbit which is tangent to this curve gamma, and after it deflects, I want it again to be tangent. So, in the case of a circle, you saw a concentric circle. You saw a concentric circle, but the definition makes sense. And the next two definitions are not directly relevant to my talk, so you could well skip it. So just keep in mind the first definition. So I will be interested in invariant curves for the billiard map, or I will be interested in curves on the billiard table for which if you will. Which, if you are tangent, if one ray of a billiard orbit is tangent, one inch, then after reflection, it's a gain tangent. So here's an example of billiard and an ellipse, and this is beautiful picture was produced by Alfonso Sarintina. So in contrast to orbits inside of a circle, you see two types of orbits. You see two types of orbits. You see blue orbits which go around the center of the ellipse. You also see green orbits which also go around the center of the ellipse. But you also see non-trivial collection of orbits which go up and down. And if I use a classical definition, then this violet orbit is also. Violet orbit is also having a caustic, but it's just harder to visualize. So let me don't talk about caustics which are not closed curves. And the caustics which I will be interested in the case of ellipse are cofocal ellipses. So there is a Lerma of Ponsilier, and I hope you see on the picture the blue chaustic that you have a blue orbit which is tangent to the blue ellipse. To the blue ellipse. After reflection, it is again tangent. And what is important for me is that for this blue caustic, there will be an invariant curve. So the upshot of a billiard dynamics is that caustics are co-focal ellipses. And I will be interested in capturing domains which have families of periodic orbits. So in this So, in this case, it's harder to see rotation number, but my memory is still that the light green is a family of periodic orbits of period 8, and the corresponding caustic is going to be an invariant curve which consists of period 8 orbit for the billiard map. Okay, so first I gave you two you two two uh examples one trivial is uh uh is a circular uh billiard dynamics the second is uh is fairly simple but not trivial is uh billiard and an ellipse but i i would like to understand what happens for general domains and the first question which arises with is if i give you a general convex domain whether you can find periodic orbits and the answer is actually 100 And the answer is actually 100 years old. And the answer is yes for any period. You always have at least two periodic orbits. As a result, for any convex domains, I will have infinitely many periodic orbits. But my goal is not to find periodic orbits. My goal will be to find the means for which there is a one parameter family of periodic orbits. For example, you saw a family of triangles in Scotland. A family of triangles inscribed onto the circle, which is a family of periodic orbits of period three. Or one thing is to see this family of periodic orbits on the billiard table, or another is to see an invariant curve for the billiard map, which will consist of periodic orbits. And for the future terminology, I will say that I have P rationally integral. P rationally integrable chaustic, or in short, p chaustic, if there is an invariant curve which consists of periodic orbits of period two. So for p equal to two, there will be an invariant curve which consists of period two orbits. For period three, there will be an invariant curve which consists of period three periodic orbits. And I will start with an assumption that I want to have these chaustics, and I will try to understand which domains such as. Try to understand which domains satisfy it. But the key, the central notion of this talk is a notion of p-rationally integrable chaustic or p-chaustic. And this is the one parameter family of periodic coordinates. So in the case of the circle, it's an easy exercise to construct a p-chaustic. On the screen, you have four rational chaos. Four rational caustics, so four caustics. So you just need to look at the angle of reflection 2π over p, and then you will easily construct a peak causic. So in the case of the circle for all p, peak haustics do exist. And as I said, one way to view them is not to view them on the billiard table, but to view them on the cylinder. On the cylinder where the billiard map acts, and then on a cylinder where billiard map acts, I just want to have an invariant curve which consists of periodic orbits. And you see pink invariant curve consists of period 3 orbits, and violet invariant curve consists of period 5 orbits, and the light green invariant curve consists of period 8 orbits. So now This picture might look simple, but the next slide you will see that I want to give it some dynamical meaning. So the top left is period 2 orbit. The top right is period 3 orbit. The bottom left is period 4 orbit. And bottom right is period 5 orbit. Now, what I want you to have in mind is I want to consider mind is I want to consider a families of periodic orbits. And for example, on the top left, I want to consider a domain for which there is a family of period two orbits. And it should be as a whole one parameter family. And if you think about it, actually you do need some hint. Each periodic orbit is a critical point of the certain Of the certain lens function. And if you want to have a family of periodic orbits, then you could, it's not too difficult to see that actually all lenses of the periodic perimeters of all periodic orbits are going to be the same. So for two chaustic, I will be interested in domains for which the period two orbits in every direction they have constant lengths, or I'll give a precise. Or, I'll give a precise definition, these are so-called domains of a constant width. And similarly, on the top right, you'll see that I have, I would like to look for domains for which there is a family of inscribed triangles, which also have the same perimeter. So, if you will try to memorize the picture from my talk, I will be interested in domains for which families which you see on this picture. Which families which you see on this picture exist, namely, for which there exists a family of periodic orbits which goes from one color to another color. And you see either going from black color to a red color a family or from a green color to a pink color. So these are the domains I will be interested in, where you could have a family of periodic orbits, and this family of periodic orbits covers the whole boundary, or for the billiard map, you have an For the billiard map, you have an invariant curve with consistent periodic orbits of period P. Okay, so first, I don't know what is your immediate reaction, but first, when somebody tells you construct a curve of a constant width, I mean, it's not immediate that you come what that it will come to your mind, but the first non-trivial example of a curve of a constant width. Trivial example of a curve over constant width is so-called Reliat triangle. And the way you could think of this triangle, imagine that you have a carriage and the carriage has wheels. And what you want to have, you want to have that the wheels, if you put a platform on top, that the platform will be on the same height as the carriage moves. And it turns out that if I put platform out that if I put platform on the circular wheel and on relief wheel I put a platform and I start to roll it then the platform is going to be horizontal or in other words this will be a curve of a constant width the yellow one and it definitely is not a circle but it does have a constant width and it has a constant width in every direction so So now let me give a definition. Let me say that a curve of a constant width is a simple closed curve in a plane whose width is the same in all directions. But if you prefer definition with a carriage and a platform on top, it may be as good. So now, no, go ahead. Now, there are many different ways to characterize a curve of a constant. A curve of a constant width. One is that it has two rational caustic, which means that in every direction there is a period to orbit. Second characterization is that if I try to put two parallel planes touching this curve in every direction, then the distance between them is going to be constant. The third one is that in each direction there is a diameter. There is a diameter. And if you see that, actually, every two normals do intersect. I don't want to put all the equivalent definitions, but there are many different definitions of curve of constant width. In terms of my discussion, these are domains for which there is a family of period 2 orbits. Now, you could ask yourself, is it easier to describe domains for which there is a constant width? And it turns out that there is a good coordinate system, which was exploited recently with great success by Biale on proving some form of a Birgov conjecture. And the coordinate system is called a support function. So, what is a support function? Support function is: I give you a domain. I give you a domain, and when I give you a domain, a convex domain. I put that domain on the plane so that the origin is inside. And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to consider a collection of tangent lines to the boundary. And I start, for example, with a horizontal tangent line. And when I start with the horizontal tangent line, then I want to see the distance to the horizontal tangent line. Horizontal tangent line, and this is going to be P of zero. And then I start to slowly move the tangent line. So you see the blue line as I rotate a horizontal tangent line to an angle pi over six. And then for the blue line, I again measure the distance to the porting plane. So I get again some number. So I keep rotating the plane, the lines which are tangent to the boundary, and for each one. And for each one, there will be an angle with the horizontal and the distance to the origin. And this is a supporting function. If you like more dynamical pictures, then there is an oscillating triangle. For example, for the blue horizontal line, the triangle consists of just two coinciding segments. But then as you rotate, there is a Uh, there is a segment which connects with the point of the tangency, and there is a segment which is perpendicular to the line. So, here you have a triangle, a right triangle which depends on the angle, and this triangle osculates and gives you the distance to the corresponding line. So, it's actually fairly easy to compute this support from the. Compute this support functions in the case of ellipse and in the case of the circle. If you want, try. It's a fairly simple exercise. And these supporting functions are very useful to identify curves of a constant width. So if you want to have a curve of a constant width, what you need to do, you need to have a line in the direction t. line in the direction theta and the line which goes 180 degrees and in the direction theta plus p, you want this to be a constant because these should be parallel lines. Now you expand in the Fourier and you see that in order to have a curve of a constant width you just need to kill even Fourier coefficients. So as a result you start to have infinitely many You start to have infinitely many parameters to create curves of a constant width. And more specifically, for any convex domain, there is a non-negative support function. And for any non-negative support function, which doesn't have a first Fourier coefficient, there is a convex domain. So you could characterize convex domains with these support functions. With their support functions. Now, I want to speculate that the space, the subspace of curves of constant domain, and now I'm going to infinite dimensions, I'm going to dimensions to the space of a convex domains, then it has half of the dimension of the phase space. Now, let me try to keep track of period 3 orbits and I will And I will be keeping track of period 3 orbits by perturbing the main a little bit. And as I said, it is an exercise that if you have a family of period 3 periodic orbits, then they all have to have the same perimeter. And in the case of the circle, it's almost obvious. It is obvious. Now, let me deform the circle and I want to see which harmonics. See which harmonics do what kind of effect on these triangles. And let me perturb with a third harmonic. So, if I'm perturbing with a third harmonic, then I hope you could see it, even though it's with support functions, the green triangles become bigger because the sine three theta function in the direction of touching of triangles pushes the domain outside. Pushes the domain outside, and at the same time, in the direction of a pink triangle, it pushes things inside. As a result, the new pink triangle is less than the new green triangle, and as a result, the corresponding three-caustic is destroyed. Well, you see that this happened after you perturb with the third harmonic, but actually, you could draw pictures which are a little bit more sophisticated. Pictures which are a little bit more sophisticated. The fact of the matter is that if you're perturbing with resonant harmonics, where resonant means whose index is divisible by three, then you actually destroy the chaustic. So if you want to destroy three chaustic, perturb with a Fourier harmonics divisible by three, or so-called resonant Fourier harmonics. Resonance for year harmonics. There is a theorem of Baryzhnikov and Zarninsky, which says that if you fix Q and you want to look at this set of domains which have a Q chaustic, then it's actually an infinite dimensional manifold. And now, close to the circle, let me decompose the space of functions into those which Into those which correspond to resonant Fourier harmonics, and this is the first one, and those which correspond to non-resonant Fourier harmonics. Then it is a theorem which is partially satisfactory that if I look at the sorry, it should be non-resonant. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, if I consider the non-resonant Fourier harmonics and I consider a map in the space of domains, then I could actually preserve the Q caustic. So the Q caustics, they do form an infinite dimensional manifold. And in a weaker version, we proved a little bit less than this. This is a meaningful. This is a manifold which has the same dimension as non-resonant harmonics, non-resonant subspace. And actually, at the moment, we don't know whether this graph is smooth. And sorry, in both cases, it should be non-resonant. But we did prove that the space of domains with Q caustic contains a manifold, infinite dimensional one. Infinite dimensional one. So now let me state two questions of Tabachnikov, actually, three questions of Tabrashnikov. So the question is when families of periodic orbits can coexist. And the first one, is it possible for period 2 orbits or 2 chaustic coexists with period 3 orbit and 3 chaustic? And a very natural next question: Is it possible for, for example, period 3 and period 5 to coexist and not to be an ellipse? And you could ask about three caustics. So the question becomes: you want to intersect infinite-dimensional manifolds in infinite-dimensional space. Space. So, the first main result, and this is a joint work with Edmund Kozdinand and Kizan, and Edmund was the main driving force of the project. So, it is not possible to have two and three caustics. So, it is not possible to have near the circle. It's not possible to have a family of period two orbits and a family of period three orbits, or it is. Period three orbits, or it is not possible to have a curve of a constant width, which has a family of triangles. So this is basically the main result of the talk. Period two and period three cannot coexist. And it is surprising because this heuristic discussion which I gave you for half of the dimension of the space for period two and two-thirds of the dimension of the space. And two-thirds of the dimension of the space for period three, one-half plus two-thirds should be more than one. And as a result, they seem to they should intersect, but they don't, which maybe is a reflection that the corresponding manifolds have weird shape. So this is the main result of the talk, but let me show you a little bit more that we managed to prove. Prove so maybe let's skip this one here. I just try to give a more version of this phenomena. You do not have too chaistic when you do have even Fourier coefficients. So, this is where. Coefficients. So, this is where you do not have even Fourier coefficients. When you do have even Fourier coefficients, so this is when you do not have coefficients which are divisible by three. But here, actually, there should be coefficients which are divisible by six. And it seems that when you look at the coefficients divisible by six, you might be able to find something, but we didn't. But we didn't. So maybe let's go to the next slide. So the result can be improved for two cow sticks and five calor sticks, two cal sticks and a seven cow stick, two cow sticks and a nine caiostic. So actually the technique does allow this. So the result is a little bit more general than I stated. So for period two, So, for period two and odd period, chaos chicks is coexistence is not possible. Finally, let me tell you that when we were trying to prove coexistence of three cow sticks and a five cowstick, then a surprise was waiting for us because it seems that it is possible to have three cow sticks and a five cow stick. Caustics and a five calistic, and we managed to solve only two steps of approximation theory, where epsilon is a small parameter. So we managed to prove that at the order epsilon, this three and five chaustics can coexist. At the order epsilon square, three and five chaos can coexist. And the order epsilon Q. And the water epsilon cubes, the formula started to be too complicated. Maybe I'll say a few words of how the theorem is proved and stop. So it turns out that you could write down a functional equation for those invariant curves to exist. In order to write this functional equation, functional means in the functional space, you need to use so-called. You need to use so-called generating function and need to use so-called Euler-Lagrange equation. We were inspired by Moser and Levy approach to KAM. And maybe could you flip to the next one just to flush it? So maybe some more. So when you write down this functional equation which you want to solve, so we want to. Which you want to solve. So, we want to solve the equation this function e is equal to zero, and for epsilon equal to zero, the function e is zero. So, first, we want to look at the first Taylor series of the expansion, and we derive the corresponding equations for the first Taylor series of the expansion. And this one is actually not so difficult to solve, so we managed to solve it. And then And then you need to go to the next order in epsilon. So you need to go to order epsilon square. And this is actually the order in which we managed to prove that two and three caustics cannot coexist. And at the same time, we managed to prove that at the order epsilon square, three and five caustics can coexist. And maybe we will understand the principle behind it, but at the moment, Principle behind it, but at the moment we could only handle two steps of this approximation theory. So maybe it's a good time for me to stop here. Okay, so thank you very much. Are there some questions? So in fact, just to be sure that I understand the result, so the result is that for billiard table close to circular, so the circle is the only one that has two and three caustic, if I understand. Yes, this is caustic. Okay, yes. Okay, okay. Okay, so in fact, thank you again. Okay, so
