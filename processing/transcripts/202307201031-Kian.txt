Different notions that I will try to clarify for this talk. And I would like to say that this talk is based on a joint work with Gilter Road. Okay, so I will start by describing the photoacoustic tomography. Let me give the description of this modality, which is a biomedical imaging modalities based on the photoacoustic image. So these modalities, in this modality, the goal is to detect different The goal is to detect different tissues inside biological medium and determine either they are safe or not. This modality has many applications, including detection of tumors, diagnostic of breast cancers, and several other applications. So here the idea of this modality will be based on properties of each one of the waves that will be described a little later on. Be described a little later on. And according to the work of Su and Wang and Li and Wang, this modality can be described as follows. So let us consider this with a patient. We have a patient. The skin of this patient will be illuminated by a laser pulse. Part of the energy of this laser pulse will be transferred inside the body and transformed into heat. This heat, through a dilatation process, will generate propagation of acoustic. Propagation of acoustic waves, and these acoustic waves will be measured by means of ultrasonic detectors, which are placed around the body of the patient. And this type of measurement are then analyzed in order to generate an image of what happened inside the body. You will have here a picture that will describe this with a mouse. So the skin of the mouse is illuminated by this laser pulse. By this laser pulse. Laser pulse, which through a dilatation process will generate propagation of acoustic waves. Acoustic waves which are then measured by these detectors in order to generate image of what happened inside the body of the waves. So here, as I said, this photoacoustic tomography problem is based on properties of two waves, and this is the way we give a mathematical model for. We give a mathematical model for this photoacoustic tomography modality. So, as I said, there is a first step, which is the step of absorption of the laser pulse, which generates diffusion of optic waves. This is a direct connection between the laser pulse which is applied at the boundary of the biological medium with what happened inside the body of or inside the biological medium. Inside the biological media. Then the diffusion of these optic waves through a dilatation process generates propagation of alcohol waves. So we will give a model, mathematical model, for each of these two properties, starting with the diffusion of the optic waves. So among the different models that have been considered for the diffusion of optic waves, one of the most simplified one, maybe not the most simplified one, but one of the simplified ones can be described as follows. One can be described as follows. So here we fix capital O to be a bonded open set of R3 corresponding to the biological medium. And in this biological medium, the diffusion of the optic waves will be described by the following stationary diffusion equation, where we have capital D, which will be the diffusion coefficient, and mu the absorption coefficient. And in this model, the laser dues correspond to the directly data that we impose to the solution. That we impose to the solution of the following class of stationary diffusion function. So, this is the first step where we have this effect of these laser fields. And now let us move to the second step, that is the propagation of the acoustic waves. So, the propagation of the acoustic waves will be considered through this initial value problem, where we consider the wave equation with the sound speed coefficient, which will The sound speed coefficient, which will admit variations. The variation of the sound speed coefficient will be related to the properties of the biological medium which generate this variation of the sound speed. So we have here our wave, and these waves will be generated by an initial value, which will be the initial pressure. And the connection between the diffusion of the optic waves and the propagation of the acoustic waves will be given by the following coupling term, which will term which will connect this initial pressure with the following expression where this expression will be nothing but the solution of this stationary diffusion equation multiplied by the absorption coefficient. So in addition to this we have an additional coefficient which is the thermodynamic coefficient allowing to connect the diffusion of the optic waves with the propagation of the acoustic waves. So now that we have the complete model we can So now that we have the complete model, we can describe the photoacoustic tomography problem as follows. So we give here the full model, including the diffusion of the optic waves and the propagation of the acoustic waves. And we consider this not just for one laser use, but for capital N laser use. And now the photoacoustic tomography problem would be divided into two classes of inversion. So the first inversion would be the So, the first inversion would be the acoustic inversion. So, in this acoustic inversion, we will mainly consider the solution of this wave equation. So, here we fix omega. It's not necessary of gold. You don't want to draw a ball, anyway. And consider the boundary of omega. So, here the gold will be for The goal would be for this first inversion to consider in terms of measurement the restriction of the solution of this wave equation with the space variable lying on the boundary of this open central media and this along the time interval 0 plus infinity. And from this type of measurement associated with each of these laser clouds, we would like to determine the initial measure. So this is the first inversion in this tomography problem, namely the acoustic inversion. Once we have determined Once we have determined this initial pressure, now we can consider the second inversion, which could be the acoustic inversion. The optic inversion, sorry, because the acoustic, the optic inversion. So the goal of the optic inversion is to consider in terms of the measurement what we have already recovered in the acoustic inversion, namely the initial pressure. But we should not forget that this is given by means of the coupling term in terms of influence. term in terms of information internal information of this diffusion equation and this will be the class of data that we will consider in terms of the second inversion namely the optic inversion and now the goal will be to use this type of data in order to determine actually the properties of the biological medium given by the diffusion coefficient and the absorption coefficient. So this is the full description of the photoacoustic tomography problem and the goal at the Problem and the goal at the end will be to determine this type of return. Okay, so in our case, we will focus our attention on the acoustic inversion. So we'll consider the first inversion in this photoacoustic tomography problem. So let me give you the model that we consider, which will be more general than the one that I've introduced you before, in the sense that we do not consider just the Laplacian, but more a general ethical. But more a general elliptic operator of divergence form, allowing variable coefficients in this type of elliptic operator, which can be associated, for instance, to some properties of density of the metal. So in this context, what we consider again is this set omega, capital omega. And here we will assume that we have an initial pressure, whose support will be contained to the closure of omega, and the sun-speed coefficient. Omega, and the sun-speed coefficient, which would be constant and known outside this set omega. And now our inverse problem can be stated as follows. So we consider again in terms of measurement, knowledge of the solution of this equation, with the space variable lying on the boundary of this set omega and the time variable from zero to plus infinity. And from this type of data, we want to determine simultaneously the initial pressure. The initial pressure and the sound speed gradient. So, in some sense, you can ask yourself what is the connection between this and what I've described before. So, the connection comes from the fact that in many practical situations, the sound speed is not known inside the biological measure. So, in order to determine correctly and to fully answer to this acoustic inversion, you do not just need to determine the initial pressure, but also the sounds. Pressure, but also the sound speed. And this has been already, for instance, observed by Gene L. Wong. And the goal here would be to fully treat this acoustic inversion by determining simultaneously these two classes of coefficients. Now, what I would like also to say is that I have stated everything in terms of photoacoustic tomography problem, but this can be also connected to the thermoacoustic tomography problem, where the laser impulse will be replaced by microwave exhibitions. Microwave exhibitions. Okay, so I will be really quick on the known result. I'm sorry, but lack of time, I wanted to do something more in detail. But so here I will start with what has been done when the sun speed coefficient is known. And what I can say is that there is many, many, many authors that have considered this problem in this situation. Brief result of uniqueness, stability, reconstruction, theoretical reconstruction, numerical. Reconstruction, theoretical reconstruction, numerical reconstruction. So almost everything has been done for this project. This is what we can say. But if you start to consider different type of frameworks, so for instance, you assume that the initial pressure is known, but you want to determine the sun speed coefficient. On my side, I know only this result. General result. Maybe there is some others that can be found and connected to this problem, but exactly connected to this problem. But exactly connected to this problem, only know this one, which is based on the Kerala Man estimate. And when you try to determine Wolf, there is two works that have been devoted to this problem, the work of Liu Ullmann and Knox Modern Pan. And the idea is that they have been stated under really strong assumptions. And the goal would be to extend this type of result by giving more general conditions, more More general condition, more suitable condition in terms of potential application for this problem, so the determination of both, of course. And for this, we will try to consider a new strategy that I will not be able also to present here. But anyway, keep in mind that it's good. Okay, so let me state the result. But before giving the statement of the result, I will need to specify the class. I will need to specify the class of sun-speed coefficients that I will consider here. We will state everything in terms of admissible class of sun-speed coefficients, since we cannot consider anything in terms of sun-speed coefficients. There is a first restriction that we will need to consider that I will describe here. In order to introduce this class of admissible sun-speed coefficients, let me consider the following initial value problem, where we have the wave equation with initial data. With initial data that are not just given by the initial value of the solution, but also its time data. So we have both here. And both of them will be, we have their support, which will be contained on the closure of our centrometer. So in this context, we introduce what we call the local energy. And this local energy would be considered on a ball of center zero and of radius R, R being sufficiently large in such a way that it contains. In such a way that it contains this set omega. So, this local energy would be given by the following quantities, namely the norm H1 and the norm L2 of the function its time derivative that we restrict to the ball of center 0 and of reduced ball. So, this is why we call local energy because it is localized on the spot. And we say here that our sun speed coefficient is admissible if this local energy. If this local energy decays exponentially with respect to the time variable, and this independently of the choice of the initial report. So, this is the assumption that we impose to our class of sound speed coefficients. So, more precisely, what we would like to impose in terms of condition to this sound speed coefficient is that our sound speed coefficients are admissible if the following estimates hold true. So, in order to explain So, in order to explain where these estimates come from, let me first recall what happened if you consider the same equation but with constant coefficients. So, I assume that here C is constant and A is minus Laplacian. So, in this context, what we know from the strong Newton's principle is that provided that the time variable is sufficiently large, the local energy is zero. And this is true, of course, in our context. Context. So these properties have been extended to the set of equations with variable coefficients. And with variable coefficients, the natural extension of these properties is what we call the local energy decay. So the local energy decay is exactly the same kind of estimate that we have here, except the fact that instead of this exponential function, you have a function that decays to zero at plus infinity. In addition to that, what we know from In addition to that, what we know from the work of Moravets is that in our context, a local energy decay should be exponential. There is no other way of decay of the local energy than the exponential one. So, of course, everything that I say here is true and it's due to the fact that we are in dimension 3. So, we are in all dimensions. In even dimension, all of this is not true. Okay, so this is the kind of assumption that we would. The kind of assumption that we would like to consider, but the first question would be: what kind of condition implies this local energy decay? So, the most natural one and the one that has been considered so far is the non-trapping condition that, for instance, has been considered by Beinberg, saying that the singularities of the wave equation with respect to the space variable and parameterize with respect to the time variable will leave any compact set for the time variable. Compact set for the time variable being sufficiently large. So, this is the first condition that may apply this local energy detail. But of course, this condition is not equivalent to the local energy detail. And for an equivalent condition, one can refer to the work of Godev, which has been able to explicitly establish an equivalent condition to this local energy decay. And again, either you look at the work of whatever or other people that have been working with. Or other people that have been working with this type of equation, most of them have been considering smooth coefficients. So even the smoothness is not completely clear in our condition. And for instance, we expect this local energy decay to be true if the sun's fit coefficient is sufficiently close to a constant variable. So we have a small perturbation of a constant function. We believe that this local energy decay would be. This local energy decay would be still true. So, for all this reason, our assumption is directly stated with this local energy decay and not the conditions that implies this local energy decay in order to be able to consider this problem in its more general formula. This is why we have started our assumption that this local energy detection. Okay, so now let me move to the statement of our result, and I will start with the first result. Result. So here we consider the capital N compact set with no empty interior, which are located inside the closure of our open set of media. And we assume that each of this compact set will not meet each other. So they are dissolved. And under this assumption, our first result can be stated as follows. So it's a uniqueness result. For this, we fix two class of parameters. We fix two classes of parameters, so two classes of initial pressure and sound speed coefficient. The sound speed coefficient would be assumed to be admissible in the sense that I described just before. And we impose several classes of assumption, the most important one being the following one, namely that the difference of the two sons fit coefficient, which is the part that we would like to determine, is given in terms of the sum of function hg, each of them being of constant sign. them being of constant sign and supported into each of this compact set kg. And under this assumption, what we show is that if the measurement that we have considered, so the knowledge of the solution on the boundary of this open set omega, coincide for the two systems, then the sound speed coefficient and the initial pressure coincide for these two systems. So let me give you some information about the novelty of this result. So the first novelty is that we do not make The first novelty is that we do not make any assumption on the initial pressure, except the fact that the initial pressure is not uniformly vamissing, which is a natural assumption. The second one comes from the fact that we do not consider just the Laplacian in contrast to the model that I have described before. We can consider general class of elliptic operator of divergence form. And finally, we have this condition of local monotonicity imposed to the sound speed coefficient that allows us to fully determine this class of coefficients. Fully determine this class of coefficients. And provided that the admissible condition is fulfilled, this could be, for instance, applied to a piecewise constant function, which can be rather interesting in terms of potential application of this result. So we have also an extension of this result, but we need more information. More information about the class of measurement that we have access to. So here we consider the measurement that... We consider the measurement that we have access to, namely the solution of this initial value problem, the space variable restricted to the boundary of our open set omega. And to this measurement, we consider the following class of function corresponding to the integration from 0 to plus infinity with respect to the time variable, multiplied by the time variable to some even power. So here, using this type of function, This type of function, we can state our second result by considering this set, namely the class of power for which this type of function restricted to the boundary of our open set omega are not uniformly vanishing. So here we have two class of parameters and two classes of solutions of the equation of index one and two. So we consider all of this for the one of index one, not of index two. This is why you have this index one. And after that, we fix k0 to be the index. That we fix k0 to be the infimum of this set, with k0 which will be infinite if this set is empty and f if this set is not empty. We introduce this Dirichlet boundary condition corresponding to this expression with n equal to kc. And here our assumption is that this data is of constant sign. And provided that this condition is fulfilled, we can now consider some speed coefficient with difference. speed coefficient with difference will be given by the function hg that we have seen before multiplied by the function cg where the function cg will be solution of the following elliptic equation. So for instance if you have just a Laplacian think of an harmonic function and under this assumption we have the same result. So here in addition to this result we confirm also the condition that we have imposed here to this data by giving Here to this data by giving explicit examples where this condition is fulfilled. So, the explicit example would be given with this elliptic operator associated with Mainz Laplacian. And the first condition that implies our condition will be given by the following properties, namely that the sound speed coefficient and the initial pressure are related with this condition. But the assumptions that we have imposed in our second theorem are not. In our second term, are not restricted to this condition, we can also prove it by considering the more complicated function, which is given here, and assuming that this one is non-uniformly vanishing and of constant sign. Okay, so this is for the second result and the proposition that confirms our condition. And the novelty comes here from the fact that we extend the local monotonicity into some kind of mix of local monotonicity. Kind of mix of local monotonicity and harmonicity. And we provide here actually the most general unswear known so far for this problem, as far as I know. And the most general according to the condition that we impose to the sun-speed curve chain. Because here we need at some point also some assumption on the initial pressure. The first one was no condition on the initial pressure. But in addition to that, we have this sign condition imposed into Condition imposed into our data, which is confirmed by the proposition one. And finally, if you take a look at proposition one, in some sense, in proposition one, we obtain in our example a situation which has been already considered by Knox and Modern. This is this condition. This condition is the one that has been considered by Knox and Modern Fab. So among the two results, it was the most general. The most general one associated with this problem. And in a sense, our tourism to extend this work by including or introducing a condition that includes also the condition considered by this efforts. Okay, so I will give quickly a description of this last result that we have. Last result, which will be the connection that we establish between our problem. That we established between our problem and the transmission eigenvalues problem. So, for this, let me recall what is a transmission eigenvalue. So, a transmission eigenvalues would be a complex number for which we will have a set, a pair of two functions, w1 and w2 in h1, which will not be uniformly vanishing, and for which this transmission condition will be fulfilled. And what we show here is the following. Is the following. So here consider in the complex plan a band. We'll have a band here. Hence R. And in this band, infinite band, you consider the set NTE sound speed coefficient C1, C2, and R to be the set of complex numbers in this band, which are In this band, which are not a transmission against. And what we show here in this result is that if the data of the photoacoustic tomography problem coincide, then this set NTE, considered with some suitable values delta suit positive, this set will consist of complex numbers which are discrete and isolated. And this is at most the properties of this. So here, this is. The properties of this. So, here this will be at most discrete and isolated complex models. This is what we obtain in this last result, and I will give a brief description of this last result before I'm finishing my talk. So, here the idea is that we make a connection between this tomography photoacoustic problem and this transmission again values problem considered by many authors. This list actually is not exhaustive. And the goal will be that, actually, in order to complete That actually, in order to complete this photoacoustic tomography problem, one needs to extract information about the difference of the sound speed coefficient from such a properties of the transmission eigenvalues. Okay, so I think I will stop here. I'm sorry, I did not talk about the postcard. But with the question, maybe it's stupid, but nevertheless. So this moment condition which you impose on your data which defines the stat B. Yes. So how does it enter? It was too quick for me. Actually, it's when you take the Laplace transform of your data, each of the coefficients of this Laplace transform make a pure. Of this Laplace transform make appearance of this class of momentum to mention. And this is where we use it actually. Just to say one word also, I have not made connection with the inverse problem for non-linear equations, but behind the approach that I've used here, there is the infinite order linearization. I've used it in this context, actually. So there is a connection. We have a short technical break, but constantly. So it's actually uh fairly general. So we have some.
