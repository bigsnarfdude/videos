Okay, perfect. Okay, hi, everybody. So, I'm a postdoc at the University of Oxford with Alando Yeli and Derek Morton. And today, I would like to present you a mathematical framework we have developed to study general tropisms in plants. So, this is the nymph Clitia, who is depicted in Ovid's metamorphosis in particular. Demorphosis, in particular. Clitia is madly in love with the sun god Helios. Unfortunately, this love is unrequited, and in her distress, Venus turns her into a flower. And in this outward form, she turns her head and she follows the course of her lover, Helios, in the sky. So this is a lovely example of mythological heliotropism, which is the behavior that some plants exhibit. Some plants exhibit following the course of the sun in the sky. And tropism, in general, refers to the directed motion of a plant or part of the plant in response to a directional stimulus that can be light or gravity, for example. From a general abstract point of view, we can see the problem of structism as a feedback loop, where we start by seeing the plants or the shoot as a filament embedded in. Filament embedded in a 3D space. And in this 3D space, there is a field of stimulus that can be gravity or light. But in order to understand the response of the plant to this stimulus, we need to zoom in and look at individual cells that respond to the stimulus in different ways by transporting and secreting hormones and by adapting their mechanical response. Mechanical response. Now, in order to understand this response at the scale of the cross-section, we need to consider the differential growth that develops at the scale of the cross-section. And to understand the evolution of the shape of the plant, we need to again zoom out and reinterpret this differential growth in terms of curvature of the filament. And by integrating this curvature, we obtain a new shape of the plant. That means that. And that means that the stimuli that are felt by the cells are now updated because the cells have moved with respect to this stimulus, which means that tropism has this kind of feedback loop structure that has the potential to generate non-intuitive non-linear behaviors. And this is what we have studied. The first step of a multi-scale theory of planthropism is to represent the flow. Plantropism is to represent the flow of oxygen, that is the main hormone involved in entropism. So, oxygen at the scale of the cells can be seen as a substance that travels in a continuum domain. So, it can travel along the axis or it can be transported along the cross-section. And in this view, we can represent the concentration of oxygen following the classic continuity equation that expresses the conservation of mass of oxygen. Conservation of mass of oxygen. And this equation, in particular, features a flux term, which will be adapted to represent different stimuli, such as gravitropism or phototropism. For example, in the case of phototropism, there is the classic Colodny-Vett model that was proposed by Colony and Vent in the 30s independently and building on previous work by Charles Darwin and then Reus and Jensen. So essentially, the colony model says that the light stimulus is felt by the tip of the plant, so at the meristem, and the meristem establishes a gradient of oxygen across the top cross-section, where oxy accumulates in the shaded part of the plant. Then, this oxygen is transported basipetale, which creates a gradient of oxygen from the light, from the bright. From the light, from the bright side to the shady side. And we know that in shoots, higher levels of oxygen are generally associated with faster growth, which then results in bending of the whole plant. And considering this simple mechanism, we can obtain a closed-form expression for the concentration of oxygen. So we have here on the right-hand side a left term, which is the concentration of oxygen at the Is the concentration of oxygen at the tip minus some delay, which represents the fact that oxygen migrates with a finite velocity, and an exponential decay that accounts for the fact that oxygen is absorbed by the plant, which defines a typical length scale for the process. Now, in order to compute the movement of the plant, we need to associate oxygen with growth. And to do so, we use the classic theory of So, we use the classic theory of morphoelasticity, which very briefly represents growth as a mathematical tensor that expresses the dilation of the material in three directions of space and in particular along the axis. Now, we can model growth as a function of oxygen with various levels of detail, and we know that oxygen is involved in the acidification of the cell wall that in turn. Acidification of the cell wall that in turn results in higher extensibility of the cell wall. And people have used computational models to represent this process. But here, for the sake of mathematical tractability, we simply relate the growth tensor to the concentration of oxygen using an affine relationship where we have added another term that accounts for autotropism, the tendency of the plant to correct its posture and to adopt a straight shape. Straight shape. Now, knowing the growth field, we can compute the shape of the plant. And I would like to repeat that the growth field at this stage is really a field of the 3D continuum. And so if we want to understand the new shape of the plant, we need to integrate this growth field, resolve for the possible incompatibilities resulting from this growth field, resolve for the mechanical equilibrium. For the mechanical equilibrium, in order to obtain the shape. And this is generally a difficult problem that requires dedicated computational methods, such as finite elements. Now, to simplify the problem, we can actually make use of the fact that most plants are filaments and can be seen as a curve in space and can be described using what is called the Kirchhoff theory. What is called the Kirchhoff theory of rods, but essentially associates physical properties to a curve. And these physical properties are expressed in terms of stiffnesses and intrinsic curvatures. So the crucial last step of the model is to express the intrinsic curvatures associated with this curve and its stiffnesses as a function of the growth tensor in the 3D domain. And this is something that has been done previously. Is something that has been done previously by Derek and Anna and Tomalisine at Brussels. And this is the resulting pipeline that we obtain. So we start from R, so the position of the plant in the 3D field of stimulus, from which we obtain the concentration of oxygen at every point of the 3D domain. Then we relate oxygen concentration to the growth tensor. Concentration to the growth tensor, from which we obtain by dimensional reduction the intrinsic curvatures of the shoot. Now, in reality, the plant is also subject to a number of loads, in particular, typically the self-weight of the plant. So the actual shape that the plant adopts is a little bit different from its natural shape, and we can obtain this shape by resolving Kirchhoff's equations, which allows us to. Which allows us to update the shape and reiterate the process. Now, to finish, I would like to give you a few examples of application of this model. This is, for example, phototropism. We have a flower that initially follows the sun with a certain delay. And when the sun sets, the plant goes back to its vertical position because of autotropism. Because of autotropism. So that's a very basic application of the colon event model. Another interesting case study is the case of gravitropism. So you might be familiar with the fact that gravitropism relies on the avalanche of starch particles located in statocyst that basically indicates at every cross-section where the direction of the vertical. The direction of the vertical, which allows the plant to correct its posture. So we have modeled gravitropism and we have, in particular, looked at an interesting experiment, a thought experiment, where we put the plant on the kleinostat, which is essentially a platform that rotates. And for this experiment, we plot three quantities, which are the alignment of the plants. So basically, how aligned with vertical. Aligned with vertical, it is. There is also the integrated curvature of the plant and the integrated torsion. Now, torsion basically quantifies the non-planarity of the curve. So we see that in the case where the platform rotates quite fast compared to the time scale of the plant, there's really no interesting response because the plant is actually effectively confused as the platform rotates too fast. Platform rotates too fast and it cannot develop any gravitropic response. But if we slow down the platform, now we see interesting kinds of behaviors where the plant initially straightens and then there is a formation of a torsion at the base of the plant because the platform continues to rotate, creating these waves of torsions that travel from the base to the tip. And interestingly, you can see in the bottom And interestingly, you can see in the bottom curves that, in contrast to the previous example, there seems to be no clear periodicity in the response of the plant, which suggests that for a given threshold of the ratio between the time scale of the plant and the time scale of the platform, there is an emergence of some chaotic behavior in the system. And this is something that we are currently. Studying. So, in conclusion, I have developed tissue-to-organ multi-scale theory. And I'm sure that people know here that a crucial challenge in modded biology is how to combine processes that operate at different scales in order to understand and to establish an integrating understanding of the behavior of the system. And this is something we have tried to do in the case of. Tried to do in the case of simple filaments and in the case of general tropisms. And interestingly, using very simple mathematical assumptions inspired by biological theories, we obtain complex behaviors and in particular, potentially chaotic behaviors, which are very interesting. And this is a general theory that I would like to stress can be adapted to particular experiments and include more references. And include more refined biological assumptions. Now, to as open questions that I would like to submit to you, we would like to first test this chaotic behavior entropism. And I think the problem would be how to test this experimentally because plants also have memory effects that need to be included. And another aspect we are studying at the moment is the Moment is the case of autotropism, so the sensing of the plant, the sensing of the curvature, which is a problem that I think is not well known and involves a lot of mechanosensing. And this is something we would like to explore. So thank you very much. I would like to acknowledge my collaborators, Alan and Derek, and this is a reference to the paper published in PNAS. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I can't see anyone anymore. Stop sharing. Give me a second. Oh, should I stop sharing? Where am I? Oh, yeah. Okay. Beautiful, yeah, very interesting talk. Would you mind? interesting would you mind um repeating briefly what are the physical properties of the road like what are its mechanics so we we use the theory of kirker flot that um um so you have a spatial curve in 3d which has a torsion and a curvature and to this curve you can associate uh essentially an elastic energy Essentially, an elastic energy which is expressed in terms of its bending modulus and torsional and twist modulus. And essentially, the mechanical energy is a quadratic form on the curvatures. I see. And so, what are the is that generalizable to a plane to a planar structure? Sorry, second. Is that general? How does it generate? That general, how does it generalize to a plane with distinct top and bottom? I mean, is it what do you mean a plane? I'm not sure I understand. Let's say you try to model a leaf in this way. Oh, I see. So that's a good question. There are analogous theories of place, in particular the Foppel-Punkaman theory of place, which might indeed provide. Which might indeed provide an interesting extension to the model. But this is not something we have tried. Yeah. But you think it's tractable, or for example, a curved shell. Is that tractable? Like that? I mean, I have not tried myself, but I think things can get quite nasty when you consider surfaces and. Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much. Thank you. Question from Bruno. Yep. Thanks, Adrian, for very nice talk. I have one comment and one point I wanted to raise. So the comment is with the Kleinostat. Actually, starting with the plant which is straight and just keeping it straight, what you just maintain because you avoid it to sense that is not sensing the angle to the gravity. Sensing the angle to the gravity. So it's not very interesting. But you might, what we're doing in the experiment, and I show you this in the plant biomechanics conference, is that we start having them to bend, and then we start linal stating. So then you start with the curvature. And then it's interesting to check that the time scale for the plant to get straight again, not back to this situation at the beginning. Because when you tell the plant, it bends back down. Down when you get the bends up actively, tropically, then you start the clinostap and you see it comes back, but not to the vertical, but to straight, not to the initial situation, but a more straighter situation, much more so. And that's interesting. And so maybe it will be interesting to check. And now I came with you to your last comment about autotrophism and what is the control of it. And it's very important to, it's a very important question, I think, to Important question, I think, to how can plant set its own curvature? Because there are two ways to measure curvature. One is to measure the change in angle, but then you have to kind of exchange information from one place to the other. So because you need to divide to the arc length, and this is not easy. And the alternative is stretch, I mean strain somewhere, but then you have to have a reference that is telling you where was the Where was at the beginning, at least at the beginning of the tropism. And so the two things are not very easy to work out. The only thing I can say from the experiment we just ran recently is that we were able to prove that this is an active process. It's not just springing back. So it is release sense and then control. But the way it's sense, it's still an open question, I think. Okay. Thank you, Bruno. That's very interesting. Thank you, Bruno. That was very interesting. There is a question in the chat. Yep. Daniel will read it. I'll read the question out. So this is from Olivier Martin. Quote, you mentioned memory effects. In the case of phototropism, the circadian rhythm probably is such a form of memory. Does the plant facing the rising sun direction before, does the plant face the rising sun direction before? Plant face the rising sun direction before the light signal arises? Is it a question on the model or on real plants? Yeah, it's for the real plant. You mentioned in your simulation that the plant comes back up to the vertical. That's in the model, I guess. It's a consequence, but in fact, is there anticipation because of the circadian? Yeah, yeah. So, in the model, it's a purely phototropic plant, indeed. Needs. But I think sunflowers, for example, which are often used as an example of heliotropic plants, actually depend very much on the circadian ribbon and things like this. And they actually do not face the sun, at least not in the adult stage, as far as I know. But this is not something we have studied in detail. Just a quick follow-up to that, there's a paper in. Follow-up to that, there's a paper in 2016 in Science that talks about the ability of young sunflowers to anticipate sunrise and faces. Yeah, yeah. Johnnika. So it's a comment for one of the comments that said there were only two ways for the curvature to be sensed. So either through mechanics or curvature sensing. So oxygen transport, if you consider it actually going through cells, so this would be the mesoscale. This would be the mesoscale again. The longer the cell is, and you have the same flux of oxygen going through a segment of roots, you linearly have an increase in the concentration of oxygen in that cell. So we've been making models where we show that if you curve a root or you curve a stem, you will get accumulation of oxygen on the outside, a slight accumulation of oxygen on the outside of the curve. So basically, the cellular nature of how oxygen is flowing, which is not being incorporated. Is flowing, which is not being incorporated in this model, which is not a problem, it would already be able to sense curvature. And that's one thing that, you know, some years ago we thought was actually very important for lateral root formation because the curvature could be sensed locally and pericyclos could pick that up. So it's just to illustrate that sometimes, I mean, I mean, this model is perfect, but if you want to address the question of how curvature can be sensed, it could be sensed through the mesoscale of oxygen transporting cells. So do you mean that oxygen accumulates due to That oxygen accumulates due to a mechanical effect, or is it just a geometric effect due to the fact that the organism is? Totally geometric, totally geometric. So, yeah, so just the fact that you can consider two ways because the cells have become longer on the outside of the curve, right? And inside that cell, you will have diffusion. So you're going to have your J equals your nabla diffusion, right? What you can see is because the length is longer. Is because the length is longer of that cell and your flux is the same over it, your average concentration is higher, right? And so there's no way around it. And what's also quite cool is that you also have feedback systems where the aux lags family, which is like import of auxin, responds to internal auxin. So you will even amplify that. And moreover, because you have two streams of auxin, you will have even more non-linear effects going in. So just by geometry, without any invocation of mechanics, you can. Of mechanics, you could get a feedback of oxidant curvature if you include the mesoscale. But it wouldn't change any of your results. Your results are great. I'm just saying that there is a way of sensing curvature which could go through the mesoscale of your auxin on a local level. Would you be able to send me a reference to that? I think that's very interesting. Yeah, I can send you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Isaac. I wrote it in the chat. Chat do it on Slack good then. Uh no more questions, no more questions. Then thanks a lot, Adria. Thank you and we'll move to the following talk by Clinton Bernie. Are you told you're here? Yes. Now we can hear you. Yes. You can't hear me now. Good, great. Glad I sorted that out. Good, great. Glad I sorted that out. Perfect. So, Clinton introduced himself earlier. He's going to talk about tomato.
