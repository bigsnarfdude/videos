Thank you for participating in this session. It's you do Danielada. I'm going to talk about health weather. Please, you have the space. Thank you. Hello. Good evening, everything. Thank you for being here today. My name is Luis Daniel Rada Hernandez. And the objective of this presentation is to talk about the theory behind the studio. Theory behind the study of some Hamiltonians, in particular the Van Hogg Hamiltonian. For this, we need to start with a separable Hilbert space, H, and with this, we can construct a symmetric Fokker space given by this expression. And with this other symbol, we denote the finite particles symmetric focus space that is the dense linear. Space that is the dense linear manifold generate but all n particles vectors. Okay, in the symmetric focus space, we distinguish the vacuum element and the exponential vector associated with an element of the Hilbert space, H. And we define it by these expressions here. The set of all exponential vectors is linearly independent and total on the symmetric focus. And total on the symmetric focus space. Here, linear span is called the exponential domain, and we denote it by calligraphical E. Now, we consider UH the group of all unitary operators acting on the Hilbert space H, then this Euclidean group is a non-complete and separable topological group with multiplication defined by this equation. For each element on the Euclidean group, we consider the action induced on the exponential domain by this map. Then, this expression generates an isometry from the exponential domain into itself. The operator W zeta u c u can be extended to the symmetric focus space and its. The symmetric focus space, and it is called the Bile operator or displacement operator associated with this element on the Euclidean group. For now, we consider these special cases, Wc and gamma of U. Here, some properties of these operators in the sense of the take-off adjoint and the multiplication operators. And the third item, we can deduce the property of the semi-group. Now, for each fixed element on the Hilbert space, this family is a one-parametric unitary group, which is strongly continuous. We denote the infinitesimal generator of this one-parametric group by P of C. This is the infinite mode P of C. This is the infinite mode field operator. So these equations hold. For each element on the Hilbert space, the operator P of C is unbounded and self-adjoint with dense domain in the symmetric focus space, which contains the exponential domain. The operator gamma of u is called the second quantization of u from this relation, this relation here. This relation here. For every one parameter unitary group you see acting on the Hilbert space with this relation, the corresponding family gamma U of T, sorry, gamma of U T is a one parameter unitary group acting on the symmetric focus space. Well, with lambda H, we denote the stone generator of this group. The stone generator of this group. And it is called the differential second equation, second, sorry, this is called the differential second quantization of H. So these relations hold. For H element on the Hilbert space, we define the position, annihilation, and creation operators by means of this expression. For any bounded operator, for any bounded operator acting on the Hilbert space sorry for any bounded operator H acting on the Hilbert space we can write lambda H by this decomposition and the adjoint by this equation ah for now we consider the hero space like the space of all summable quadratic sequence and on the natural numbers And on the natural numbers, we consider the pointing measure. So, if we take a canonical basis of this space, and then we can define these operators, P of G, Q of G, that are called the restricted momentum and position respectively, and Ag, AG star, that are called the restricted annihilation and crater operators. Now, for every element on this space, on this Hilbert space, the following representations falls true on the finite particle symmetric Fock space. And the last expression, H, denote the multiplication operator by H and element on this space.  Yeah, you do have dragons of the main of the right then. Stops at some point and then zero size was it at some point. But that is possible to write a meaningful operative idea. Thanks. That's where I'll start. Okay, continue. If we consider the continuation on the natural numbers, then the last expression can be rewritten as integral forms in this form. Well, with this notation, we can construct the Van Hog Hamiltonian give else for this expression here. Now it's time to generalize this concept. So now we consider an H and positive. H and positive self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space H with domain denote by D of H. With D H star, we denote the space of all antilinear functionals acting on the domain of H. Then, if we take one element on the domain of H and one antilinear acting on the domain of H, with this symbol, we denote the action of the antilinear form in the element. Anti-linear form in the element. This is necessary for the next definition. With the rule of the job doing the same thing, Well, if we take an antilinear form W acting on the Hilbert space with domain W continued on the Hilbert space, we define the annihilation operator W L acting on this finite particle symmetric focus space by means of this equation. Now, for any For any result is give this is due for Derenzinski. And this says that for any element on the antilinear forms, the operator, the annihilator operator associated is clausable if and only if the element belongs into the Hilbert space. Now, for the antilinear form W, the corresponding crater operator is defined by this way, the adjoin. With this, we can define the corresponding field operator by this equation. That the operator, the field operator, is self-adjoint in the domain of the. Adjoint in the domain of the annihilator operator, and the bile operator is defined by this expression. Well, the interesting case is when the element, the antilinear form, is not belong on the Hilbert space. And then the crater operator is not densely defined. Well, now this works. Now, this work aims on the future study of the Van Hoek-Hamiltonian. Even the case when the operator associated on the antilinear form is not possible. Thanks.
