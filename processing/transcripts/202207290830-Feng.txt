Take it away. Thank you. So, today I'm glad to share some of our recent work about shape programming and the pattern formation in liquid crystal elastomers. And this is a joint work with some of my colleagues in our group. Daniel did some simulations, Morgan did this experiment, and John is actually the real boss. So liquefaction elastomers are active materials that can have shape change upon Can have shape change upon external stimuli, such as heat or illumination. So, for the shape programming problem, I'm going to talk about today is about how to design this shape change of LC sheets in 2D, then activated it to 3D to obtain like a very special curved fold. And this pane formation problem actually has puzzled us for a long time. So, it's a pan-information workshop. So it's a pan information workshop. So I put it here. It would be great to have some comments from the panel information experts. However, it's very unlikely to have enough time, so I'm going to just say a few words about this panel information. So we know when we squeeze ordinary software material passing some critical point, the surface instability is going to be triggered. Triggered and we'll see some kind of wrinkling. And the wave vector is parallel to the direction of compression. But in LCEs, we experimentally observe that this instability, sorry, I'm going to use this pointer. Okay. The instability also emerges, but the direction of the wave vector is not parallel. Actually, it has Is not parallel, actually, it has a like a 45-degree relative to the direction of compression. So this is quite different. And it turns out that it's quite hard, this problem. So now let's forget about this pattern formation for a while and focus ourselves on this very interesting fourth problem. I'd like to start with a very simple example. Start with a very simple experiment that everybody can do at home. So, take two arc strips, then draw them together along the outer boundary with tapes, for example. Then you can get a curved fold. Then you pull it transversely. You'll see that those two ends would approach each other. Actually, Joe and I did make one, and we were trying to use this magnet. And we are trying to use this mechanism to lift this little fox. Okay, success. Actually, in literature, there are many curved fold origami. Sorry, Pollyor's is not curved. And all these origami structures are folded from the flat sheet. You can imagine that if you pull the fold, it will go back to the flat configuration. So this geometrical behavior is quite different from the Is quite different from the one we just saw. So now we can ask this question: why the geometrical behaviors of those two different faults are quite different. And furthermore, we are trying to understand the mechanical response of the new fault and how this fault can be fabricated, and are there any possible applications? So, this is the sort of motivation of this work. To understand this, we are. To understand this, we are going to learn some basic geometry in the following two slides. So first, Gaussian curvature. Suppose we have a curved surface and we can draw two principal curves across each other perpendicularly at a point. Okay, locally, those two curves can be approximated by those two circles with R1 and R2 respectively. The Gaussian curvature is just one upon the multiplication of those. Just one upon the multiplication of those two radiuses. Another way of seeing this is that we can use a curvature vector. So this vector, the norm of this vector is one upon r, one upon the radius. And it is a vector. So it can represent how much this line curves. And also it can show the curving direction. But that's a two-way. But that's the two ways. Okay, now there are two theorems associated with the Gaussian curvature. The first one, maybe the most famous one, is called Gauss-Deramer equation or another name, remarkable theorem. This theorem says the Gaussian curvature is determined by the metric, which is the local length change, and it cannot be changed without, so the Gaussian curvature cannot be changed without a stretch. So that's why we can isometrically. Why we can isometrically deform a flat sheet to a cylinder because they have they both both of them have zero Gaussian curvature, but we cannot deform it without stretch to be a like a spherical surface because the sphere has a positive Gaussian curvature. Okay, the Thanksgiving theorem is a little bit more complicated. It's called the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. So this theorem says if we integrate the Gaussian curvature, integrate the Gaussian curvature over a surface and plus the integration of the GDC curvature along its boundary. The GDC curvature can be viewed as a projection of the previous curvature vector onto this tangent plane. And somehow it shows how the boundary curves within the tangent plane of the surface. Okay. The uray is called kaba-g, but I'll call it kgi for But I will call it kg for just for simplicity. So if you have sharp corners, add them, and the right-hand side is 2Ï€ times this Euler characteristic, which characterizes the topology of the surface. So the beauty of this theorem is that it links the Gaussian curvature and somehow the property of the boundary to the topology of the surface. Okay, this curvature Kg is also determined by the metric, which has a similar property as K. So now let's go to this curved fold. Remember that this fold is made by drawing those two boundaries. So, and we can use R of S to describe the shape of the fold in the deformed configuration. And S is arclined. But take the first derivative, you gotta. But take the first derivative, you get a tangent. Take the second derivative, you got the curvature vector, which describes how the ridge curves in 3D. So remember, if we project this curvature vector onto the plane, we got the geodesic curvature because it is determined by the metric, and we assume the deformation doesn't change the metric. So this geodesic curvature Kg equals kg equals the the original the kg on this plane on the reference configuration a similar situation for kg2 so now this is the trick so uh we we have a curved fault curved for we have the ridge and we apply the gauss final theorem on the domain which contains the rich okay we have then we have the integrated Then we have the integrated Gaussian curvature. So, next, we make the width of the ridge go to zero, zero. So, the G DC curvature just converges to the GDC curvature of the ridge itself. And you can choose the boundary correctly. So, those two terms are cancelled out. The result is that the curvature, the integrated Gaussian curvature per unit length of the Curvature per unit length of the ridge is the sum of those two G-Descript curvatures. So, those two G-Description curvatures are computed from the same ridge as well as the same curvature vector, but projected onto those two different planes. So, generically, they can be different. Okay, now we can somehow understand our thought in our experiment. I'm sorry, I forgot to explain. I'm sorry, I forgot to explain that the sign of J this curvature. Okay, so if the curvature vector projects onto the hand plane, which is the vector of this GDC curvature, if it points into the plane, it is positive. If it points outwards, it's negative. So for those two strips, both GD curvatures point into the plane. Curvature is points into the plane. So both of them are positive. Then we have a positive concentrated Gaussian curvature along these lines. So it's not zero. So this explains why we cannot flatten the fold. But to understand the geometrical behavior, this is not enough. We need a more precise description of the shape of the surface itself. So Oderlinch. So, Uder Lynch studied this isometric deformation of a ribbon to a mobile span in space. The bottom one, the straight stripe, is the reference domain. As we can see here, it has a center line. And these lines are the rulings in Dick's language, but I usually call them the generators. I usually call them the generators, okay? In the deformed configuration, the center line is deformed into a curve, and you can prove that these generators remain straight in the deformed configuration. Okay, what's more important, the directions of those generators are determined by the shape of the deformed center line. Now, this means if you hand me the shape of the center line, If you hand me the shape of the center line, I can compute those generators at each point of the center line. Okay, then construct the entire surface. A more precise description is the following. So, I mean, the reverse I mean doesn't have to be a straight strip. It can be curved. And since it's on this 2D, it's And since it's on this 2D, its curvature is described by the G-dist curvature kg, and we deform this isometrically to some curve, to some curve in 3D. Okay, so L is the generator. So this is what usually geometric people do. They construct a frame associated with this deformed curve, then compute the surface. Okay, so actually, my brain is not. Uh, actually, my brain is not geometric, so I solve this problem algebraically and realize that what is generally overlooked by physicists is that given the reference forming and the deformed curve, actually there are two solutions. You can see here, so for one for one solution, the surface is below the deformed curve, and for the other one, the surface is above the deformed curve. Of the deformed curve. A little summary: the shape of the surface is determined by the deformed curve and the reference curve or the reference grid up to those two solutions. We know that our fold has two surfaces and each surface has two solutions. So we have four in total. For physicists, you really choose to study one of them because to study one of them because because one of them might be have might have some interesting properties or it is energetically favorable oh now let's look at how the fuel deforms rs is the uh curved fault curved ridge in space okay and we know from the differential geometry that uh kg is k projected on onto the surface Projected onto the surface. So it has a cosine alpha one, where alpha is the angle between the curvature vector and the surface, similar for kg2. This is from the period geometry. To have a solution, this k must be greater or equal to those kgs. This means the fault in space should be more curved than the fault at the flat state, because at the flat state, it is. Because at the flat state, it is characterized by a kg. Then, if the deformation isometric, it's isometric, kg won't be changed. And the only thing that can change is k. So changing k, we can compute those two angles. If you think about that, a bigger k is going to have a bigger opening angle, and vice versa. So, a little summary is that, so a bigger k means a bigger angle. So, a bigger k means a more curved ridge that will give you a more open field. Okay, let's look at those four solutions. For those two solutions, we can decrease k and it will open until a state this curvature equal to this curvature. Because this one should be k normal k should be greater or equal to kg, then it cannot be opened further. Be open further. However, we can at this state at this stage, okay, it has a so one strip is flat, then we can flip it over, then continuously then increase this k so to deform it into the other solution. Okay, what does this mean? So this means this one solution can be isometrically deformed to the other solution and there exists a continuous isometric deformation. Continuous isometric deformation or an homotopy, similar for those two. But those two are not connected. Okay. This is more clear in this video. So we make a curved fold here and deform it isometrically. You can see that this surface can be on one side of the ridge or on the other. Of the ridge or on the other side of the ridge. That's those two different solutions. And what's more interesting is that there is an intermediate state. At this state, this strip is flat and the curve cannot be further open. This means this surface is going to provide some strength to the band and prevent... And prevent the structure from bending further. And for the symmetric case, you can also deform it isometrically, but it has a state when one surface touches the other. And it can continuously deform as a ribbon, as a single ribbon. We can see in nature, there are many these lines of Gaussian curvature. So, how to make them from paper? Actually, we cannot make them. From paper. Actually, we cannot make them with a single sheet of paper because the isometric deformation preserves Gaussian curvature, you always get a zero-Gaussian curvature concentrated along the ridge. I think the only way to make a ridge with non-zero-Gaussian curvature is that you cut off two strips from the paper with different curved bounds. The different curved boundaries, they join them together with glue or tapes, then deform it into 3D by fixing the deformed ridge. That sounds very stupid, right? Because actually, I made one. So let me ask this question. Can we have a smarter way? Say if we can design the crease on a single sheet, then deform it magically to have a form it magically to have a to have a ridge with non-zero Gaussian coverage. So this is where liquid crystal elastomer comes. The liquid crystal elastomers are made by cross-linking liquid crystals into polymer networks. And I don't want to explain more, but we only need to know that this liquid based elastomer can change its shape by feeding it, by feeding it. And the shape change can change. And the shape change can be programmed, for example, programmed by this so-called director. For example, this director distribution is uniform. And by heating it, it will contract along the director and expand perpendicularly. Okay, so now the deformation is not asometric, which gives you some hope to generate a non-zero Gaussian curvature. This is what we did from LCEs. We have a director pattern, then we combine it with the other one, satisfying this condition, because the interface is going to change its length after actuation. So we make sure the local length change are consistent from those two patterns. Actually, we don't need two patterns. We only need one single pattern and design the direction of shape change. Shape change on this pattern and make sure that the interface satisfies this compatibility condition. And we simulated it. This is the result from DAN simulation. We can see that there are positive Gaussian curvatures and negative Gaussian curvatures. And actually, there are more features. For example, the Gaussian curvature is mirrored out within the narrow domain. And the ridge is not sharp, it is smooth and black. It's not sharp, it is smooth and blunted. So now more problems arise. So, how can we understand the mechanics and how can we predict the shape? To make our life easier, we assume we have a director pattern which will deform into a surface of revolution, which has the rotational symmetry. And it has a sharper ridge here. It has a sharper ridge here. Okay, so this one is deformed following the exact isometry, exact deformation. Then it will blend to some blended structure with smooth ridge because a short ridge has infinite bending energy. Okay, the final state has three parts, two flanks and one ridge. The total energy is just the sum of those energy from those three parts. From those three parts. Then, for each part, we use a shell energy, which has stretch and bang. Then the final state is going to minimize the total energy. Okay, let's start with the blanking first. So take a slice. The ridge has a sharp wedge. Okay, it will blend here to be a smooth ridge. Okay, the energy of the smooth ridge has stretching and bending. We are all familiar with this one because the stretching scales as thickness and the bending scales as thickness cube. So we assume R is big and planting is gonna make some small changes of radius here, delta R. And this is gonna induce a whole And this can induce a hook string or the osmodal strain, like this. Then we substitute this back into the energy. Oh, sorry. We got that. And because R is big and the other modal bending can be neglected, neglect, neglected. So we only have the bending along the red curve, which is that. Okay, now it becomes easier. So let's estimate. So let's estimate the length scale of the blanket domain first. Okay, if the length scale of the blanket domain is L, we have the delta R is in the is in the order of L substitute that delta R in here, and this bending is in the order of one upon L. So we have two terms here. And these two terms are gonna compete with each other to have like a mini. Other to have like a minimal energy to minimize this over L, we got a scale, a length scale which is square root RT. This is an intermediate length scale between the smallest length scale thickness and the large length scale, this R. Okay. And the energy per unit length of the ridge has this form, and it has a t to the five-half scale, which is The 5 half scaling, which is an intermediate scaling between stretch T and the bend TQ. This makes sense because the energy is from competition between those two terms, right? Okay, so now we are ambitious to compute this actually the energetic form, the substitute everything into the energy form and compute the Euler Law Bagration equation. Bagroundian equation, we solve it with some boundary condition. We got this analytical form, and it has a length scale, which is exactly the square root rt. In this form, it has exponential form, which means our analytical solution will converge to the original veg. Okay, we tested our analyst solution with a numerical simulation, and they match well. simulation and they match well within a large range of open angle of okay so if we look if we look at this effective energy more carefully and we we have the total curvature which is one upon r and we have the relation between the k and kg and substitute this back injury we have the this energy form the beauty of this energy form is that it links the energy It links the energy to the concentrated Gaussian curvature. And K, normal K is in the denominator. So if it goes up, the energy goes down. And we can compute the, don't forget the bending energy. We can compute this bending energy fairly easily. Okay, the result is that if K goes up, the The energy goes down. So, those two are different. In a summary, in a little summary about geometry and mechanics, we know large k gives a large opening angle. And the blending of ridge gives you the ridge energy, which favors large k and large opening angle. And the blending of flags favors small opening angle and small k. You might know what I'm going to do, right? Because. I'm going to do right because as you can see here, there's another competition. So we compete this rich energy against flat energy and minimize the total energy over K. It gives you equilibrium state K, K norm. And it has a concentrated Gaussian curvature term and it has a T, the thickness dependent term, which diverges as T goes to zero. So this. So, this means if we decrease the thickness, the radius of the curvature is going to increase and the radius of the ridge is going to decrease. So, we also do some simulations which match the result well. So, how much time do I have? Sorry. You still have another five or so minutes? Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, sorry. Yeah, because I'm trying to mess up. Okay. So the last task is how to use the liquid asteroid sheets to design this crypto. Because the idea is the following. So we design the direct pattern, which gives you the metric. And following this blanking effect, we got an activated configuration. Okay. And we know that the direct pattern determines the metric, and the metric determines the Gaussian curvature and the GDC curvature. And the mechanics are determined by the Gaussian curvature and the GDC curvature from our previous analysis, right? Okay, actually, we can compute the lines of Gaussian curvature, and I won't explain this in detail. In detail. Okay, so we actually have a formula for the concentrated Gaussian curvature which explains the simulation. So finally, so there are several design principles for computing, for constructing this curve to fault from LC sheet. One, the last changes are determined. The last changes are determined by those directors and which should be consistent at the interface. And the second one is that the Gaussian curvature after activation at the flank should be zero so that we can use the bending energy form. And the third, the GDC curvatures and the concentrated Gaussian curvatures should be programmable because we want to design a To design like a cryptophone which has certain mechanical response. So, satisfying all these conditions, we can have analytical form of the director pattern and as a result. So, we can have this symmetric positive fold and symmetric negative fold. An asymmetric positive fold and asymmetric negative fold. Oh, we'll wait until it is in equilibrium. Okay, so our experimentalists are working hard to make actually make these LCE LCs maybe. Maybe there's another way. So, from Jones's talk, we know he has a way to make this non-isometric deformation. So, maybe we can buy that as well. Okay, that gets to the end of my talk. Here are some take-home messages I want to deliver. First one is isometric deformation of this curved folder with non-zero Gaussian curvature. The fold with non-zero Gaussian curvature, or you can call it non-eucliding curved fold. The first one is the relation between the curvature and the angle. It is a projection relation. And the second one is that the Gaussian curvature along these lines is the sum of those 2G disc curvatures. The third is that there are four solutions given the deformed range and the reference strokes. And for the mechanics part, you want to know that this director pattern determines the metric and the metric goes in curvature, geodesic curvature, and therefore the mechanics. So the blending of which will give you like an energy, it goes as heat five halves, which is in the middle of bending and scaling and stretching. And this energy favors. And this anonymity favors large opening angle and large curvature. And the blending of flanks favors small curvature and small opening angle. And the equilibrium curvature is thickness dependent. It scales as t to the minus one seventh. For some filter work, the current fold we got from L C are all on the plane. So it's total frame. Torture-free. If I think about how to design some pattern to generate non-zero torsion in space, and more, for example, we can apply this to design some actuators as the application. I think that's the end of my talk. Just a second. So I would like to thank this is Daniel, who did some experiment, did some simulation, and Morgan did some experiment. And this is John. And I would like to thank my previous advisor, Mark Warner at Calvendish. Actually, this work is inspired by his work on this point source of Gaussian coverage. And unfortunately, he passed away last year, but he has been very supportive during the pandemic. During the pandemic. So, this is a social distance walk with him. And okay, I'll stop here and I'd like to take any questions.
