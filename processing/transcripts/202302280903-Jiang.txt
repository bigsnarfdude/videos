Sorry, but this is a lot for today, so we're pleased to have you thank Jonathan from Canvas and we'll talk about virtual content last time. Thank you so much. First, I thank you the organizers, you know, and to invite me to come here. I'm very happy to talk this stuff in front of so many experts in environmental geometry. I'm in numerical geometry, as we introduced yesterday, but I But I'm using a lot of time to learn this stuff. I hope I won't make a big mistake. So, my goal is to try to construct some virtual fundamental class on the multiple space of surface genotype, as Julie talked about yesterday morning, right? So, oh, yeah. So, here is my goal. And I first want to introduce the worst module space of similar conditions surfaces. And maybe yesterday, you know, morning talk, we introduced a lot, right, a lot of examples. And also, thank you for Julie's talk. And I want to talk about much of the background. So our motivation is: you know, I was studying a witness theory, but I just Studying a Kubernetes theory, but I just arrived at the UBC almost 15 years ago or 10 years ago, more than 10 years ago. And at that time, the Kubernetes theory was very popular, right? And then, you know, if we have a family of a stable DSD curve, and then you can push forward, you know, the first chain of the relative Eulining sheaf, which is a line bundle, and the tick some power to push forward, you get the so-called Kafka class, and also some other technological class, so-called hold. Technological class, or so-called holder class here. And you can put these chain classes of these bundles, right? And we make the integration over the fundamental class of MGBAR because MGBAR is smooth. It's a smooth projective Daniel stack. Okay? And then you can get a lot of interesting environment which was studied a lot of years. I guess I don't know how many, 20 or 25 or 30 years? Yeah. 25 or 30 years? So now we can ask: what's the dimension higher? Maybe I guess some experts already talked about this question a long time ago, which I recently heard from many mathematicians from, for example, Kai talked to him last December. So first I want to introduce what's the modular space as in the instant talk, we already know the modular space, right? Already know the modulus, right? Which this background I will go quickly. This slide for Dubi's talk. And as it's a perfect surface, we have the topological environment, right? And in the cube, you know, dimension. And, you know, this, some inequalities we saw yesterday. And this is, I borrowed from the picture from Wikipedia. So this is like your geography of the surface, right? And which also draws here, yesterday. So now, let's formally introduce what semi-local condonial surface. So, a projective semi-local condonial surface is the following, which is a surface, right, and which satisfies the following conditions. First, S is reduced and called by Holy and had only double normal crossing singularity in conduction one. All the other singularities isolated, right? Finite set of them. Set of them. And if you have normalization of S so that delta of nu is the inverse of the image double curve, then this pair has a lot of canonical similarities, which you guys already very familiar, which I am not, right? But anyway, this is a slogan in virtual young here. And also, another condition is that there exists an integer m bigger than 0 such that the n-thereal. zero such that the n-3 flex to tensor power of this one is invertible. It's a requirement. And then the least m I call the index of x. So this is a geometry. So this is a formal definition of the semi-logocorical, right? Which I don't really express. And a stable surface, S, is a semi-logocorical. S is a semi-local connotation surface so that the omega s is unknown, the dual angle. Now, let's introduce index one Karwa and also in yesterday talk, in Harwa's talk, also use that. I don't know, I will learn this, right? For me, take a long time to learn this index first. So suppose Ss is a similar canonical singularity term. If there exists R bigger than zero, If there exists r bigger than zero, an integer, right? So that if we are taken locally around the singularity, the tensor power, this bracket r means tensor r and then take the double n, right? That means you power. And it's invertible. And then I call this list r, which is called the logo index of the similarity. This is from biochronometry. And also, we can think about here, if I have a global index, capital N, about Global index capital N, above, in the above slice, if you have the local power, then small r must be y n, right? Okay, this is a first effect. And also, if I take around the singularity, I take an isomorphic amorphism between this line bundle and OS, because it's a locally tribute, right? And then I can define a scheme at Z like this. I think also this notion is directly. And Z is And z is a Goring state because I take some power. And then this Z is called Macaulay, and the omega Z is invertible. Really, it's a Goring stand already. So now I suppose two X passes the map, then this is the so-called index of R power. Because Z has a new R action, right? Secure group of all the R actions, so that the quotient is S around the signal. So this is called the index of nau. Over now. And in my essence, right now, here I take this around this singularity. The more Î¼r, I think this as a dynamo step, as always. So now, the Q-Gorian stand deformation, you guys are not better than me, and here is a deformation of a surface, right? Similar colonial surface S, near, you know, 0 belong to a scheme T, is a Q. 0 belongs to a scheme T is Q Gore instant if it is induced by an aggravand deformation of the equals 1 power. A Q Gore stand formation. And this means there exists a mu R aggranda deformation Z, you know, which quotient is the curve X over T. This is the Q Registered deformation. So now the module functor is to consider volume. is to consider all the Q Goldenstein deformations, right? So I fix topology invent k square and chi here. So k square is the volume, chi is the holomorphic logarithmic. And then I think it's also a capital M bigger than zero in India. And I consider this modular functor, which sends any scheme T to the family, right? I summarize the classes of family or T of the similar orbital surfaces, so that the following conditions satisfy. And the first is the Q Boris standard information. And the first execute borrowed standard information are stable, right? We write quite stable. And for each fiber, this one is invertible and ample. And for each fiber, we fix the topological invariant. And also, this one is isomorphic. And the basic, I think. This one, this last condition implies that the module space will be separate. I hope I'm okay. So this is the module function. Actually, I learned from Sharp. Land in a from Claude Chapo there, 1988. You mentioned, just to help me understand this, there will be fewer deformations of the orbithold than of the singular things, right? Yep. So this is not parameterizing deformations of the singular thing. You put an orbit hold structure and now we're parameterizing really. I use the orbifold structure to get the downscale. They make sure that's it. Sorry. Can you um if I I didn't understand the role of Atlanta. Wait, which one? N is the index, right? N is the global index. I can put the n integer I want now. For example, I can put the n equal to capital A equal to 1. Then you will lose all the boundary because you consider all the smooth parts. Oh, sorry, maybe I'm wrong. If I put the n equal to 1, right, maybe you only consider the double. One, right? Maybe you only consider Doris named ones. If Q golden stand, you must have an index bigger than one. Right? Am I right? Yeah. So that's, right now I put up any n. Okay? I will talk about when n sufficient large, then you will get the comeback. Thanks for the question. Maybe as a comment for Jim, the point of considering these two informations is if you don't cons if you consider all of them, then case Okay, so I learned this, yeah, and also yesterday in the morning talk, Rudy already said, right? So, in Guess if first started the question, they proved that before you prove the boundary, right, then the module space is represented by a quote-projective speed cost module. And then, and then the in the sharp operation, right? Then, and then they interchapere, right? Clara Sharp-Berry in 1988, and Alec Sieve, and then they defined this biomodular functor. And of course, later on, Hakima Shi they proved the boundaries for any log general type variety, including dimension two varieties. And also, Shandong and Patawavi prove the projectivity of the modular login writing. They prove the modular space is a diamond step, right? Projective. Delimorphal stack, right? Projective. Oh, sorry, I should say. Then, from their result, the function m is represented by a dilemma for stack at finite height. And if n is sufficiently large enough, then m is supported with the last time. I'm right? Yeah, I learned. So because the bounding line is also, maybe Alexin proved in dimension two piece, and then here proved all the dimension piece, right? Then you can find a uniform bound capital N. And then, you know, this all there, right? So sufficient, if n is sufficiently divided. So, if n is sufficiently divisible enough, large enough, then m is pretty true. But in my construction, I can construct for any capital N, right? If we want a Buddha modular and then I take the transport. So, is it a fixed end for any individual connected component, or is there an end that works for all connected components of like data type services? Maybe you only get what question I actually need to think about. Maybe you only get some component. Definitely, if n is smaller, it's not a compact. If you increase the invariance of the surfaces, then you can get higher and higher index. Yeah. And just with usual portion singularities. Fixed invariance. Yeah, for you know if you you if you let the capital M equal to one then you just get the Orange diagrams, yeah, as I said all Borest. Okay, so this is an example right which I guess this is for how I cover yesterday's talk, right? And Julie Rana, he did the M55 for the quintic surface inside P three. I got a numerical quintic and then she didn't talk about that today. And then I roughly write down this picture. So this moduli, Porakava already proved that this moduli, right? Numerical quintic M55 is a two-component, irreducible component, M0, M1. And here's the surface of M0 is 1, right? Here's 1, A1, B on the boundary. Each component is 40-dimensional. And it connects in a 39-dimensional way. And she also constructs a boundary, which I call 1, 2, A, 2B, right? She constructed 2B right here, which is the surface per bound, only one singularity. It's a wild type, right? 1 force, 1, 1. So this, she didn't talk about that yesterday, but the method is very similar, I guess. And then this example. But still, this modular space M55 bar, if I want to know what's the whole thing, but I don't know. But I don't know. I think maybe still not known. Only know some boundaries. So, this is the first example. The second example, which I learned from Professor, you know, Francis Hadidi Rana and Rolensky, right? So, they talk, they think about, for example, the modulus with numerical. Oh, sorry, I made a mistake here. Please delete this. Delay this. So, this new real surface genotype with PG equals 2 and the C1 squared. And this M13 bar defined the two components. This is the component, M13, this is a smooth part, and then this is a boundary with only one singularity, 1411. Here's a singularity of 1 over 1815. I will introduce a common name, this is all type T singularities. And here, type 1 over 25, 114 is another type. Or 25, 114 is another anyway. I guess this example is still not complete. And maybe on Thursday, I think Luca will talk about another similarity from this one, right? I'm right? Yes. As maybe not from the T similarity, I guess. So another boundary divider theta. So i you so I I feel this uh this uh I explained the example is so difficult, right, so hard. Is so difficult, right? So hard. So now, yeah, and now I introduce this, all these stuff about type similarity is type T similarity given by this formula, which also was written down yesterday morning, right? And especially when the very special P R equal to 2S equal to 1, this is the one force 1 value called Wow singularity, so this you can easily write down a smooth singularity. So this is a simple thing like now I will introduce another for me it's a very important notion so-called the index of my power denim first stack or I also can call it called the hacking stack because hacking first bindings. Now I said remember when I take the index one tower right I take When I take the index one tower, right, I take every singularity germ. Because there are only finite set of isolated singularities will have index big one in a similar number of surface. And then for each germ, I take a like the index one curve. I take the corresponding Dalmato stack. So this is called the glue them together. I get an index one curve, Daly Marfo stack, or before. I call the close S to S for any seven or combo seven. And Dr. Keikin already proved that there exists a one-to-one correbundance between the P-Grainstep family of semi-local canon surfaces to the index one-power the remote state, flat family. This is a one-to-one row, which is very good. And also, for the family over here, you can take the indefinite curve also like that, using the relative deolini of the factor. Okay. Then, so I don't know if maybe this one is already known for the x-ray barcodeometer, but for me, I put these things together, right? Because I can detail. If I can only introduce the index one cover than the model stack, I can use that to study the modulo of the log pair for the P2 with a high-degree divider, you know, in the heses, I guess. And then I found that maybe I can put all these things together to define a moduli of index. moduli of index someone currently stacks so that the cost moduli is your semi-log of modulus. And then I prove that there is a fine modular dynamofost, I mean, you know, which with projective cost modular space projectualize the, you know, parameterize the index of one cover dynamical steps over semi-like status. Suppose I'm my global index density sufficient value. And also, there exists a finite morphism between So there exists a finite morphism between these two nanoparticles, that is, which induces bijection from Cosmo. Why is it isomorphism? No, no isomorphism. It's a finite morphism, I can't show. But the cosmopolitan is the same. But is it clear that it's not an isomorphism? Yeah, that's my question. I don't know. I guess, yesterday, remember when you talk about the significant quotient stuff, right? I guess if you have a semi-lock control surface, maybe all these You're a semi-local surface, maybe all these KLT, and then the singularity quotient singularity may be about the remote set locally above C2 more something, right? The quotient stack, and the cosmodule have the same automorphic group. That's I bet. But it's true. But I don't know here for some other bad similarity I will introduce, for example, casp and this all this similarity. If I take the index one cover, then the index one cover automobile group. Then the index of a car or the mobile group is the same thing as downstairs. Yes. Yes? Okay, then this size of what? No, no. I will talk to the guys. I'm very bad on this. To show is a financial. Okay, very good. Thank you. Anyway, maybe this is isomorphic. Yeah, some people already told me maybe this is isomorphic. It's only a different uh formulation, right, for the modular. The formulation for the modular states using index one code. Now, now I introduce what's the similarity of the semi-log canonical surface, which you can find in various papers and also maybe yesterday some, I guess, asked some questions. Here is the list. Semi-log canonical surface similarities are the following: one, two, three. Semi-log terminal similarities and the Gorenstan semi-log canonical similarities and D2, D3, D4, DC quotient of simply late. Research this is the quotient of simple electric and the data quotient of cas. So here, simple elliptic means you the isolated simple corner, you have the resolution, but it's a locus is a simple elliptic curve. And the casper means you have a circle of regional curves. And the degenerate curve is also like that, but you require the similarity to non-normal. This is the piece. And the Shabbat third. And the Shaper variant here, semi-log the terminal was, if I remember correctly, this contain quotient singularity, except the locally complete intersections. At least the first one. Second one, except the locally complete intersection similarities, they contain the simple elliptic similarities class and the degenerate class. Because simple elliptic class and the degenerate class are all Boren stands in there. Are all Gorians and single. Right? I think I'm right. So, and then the utilians will not be Gorians. It's Q worse. So now, a good thing for me is actually this project start at the beginning for this, I realized this is if the quotient similarity of a similar governance surface S made pure golden small things or pure deformations, then the similarity must be class T singular. Class T singularity. That's here, in here, all the quotient singularity is here. When I take the index one power, the singularity becomes here. It's class T singularity, which is here, right? Yeah, sorry. Yeah. You will see that the class T singularities, if you take an index of one carbon, I will show, you will get A type similarity, which is L C I, which is very important for me. That this effect I But this fact actually tells me that after I take the index one tower, then the index of one kauwa of a semi-local condominium surface only has locally complete intersection similarities plus single elliptic similarity cusp and the digital cusp. This is all the similarities they can have. They just want to have that. Now my task is to analyze these similarities to see Analyze these similarities to see in which case this kind of similarity when you deform, you will get a higher obstruction. If no, I'm lucky I get it there. If yes, then I have to find a method to control it. Look, now high abstraction space is given by the following. I take an index of one tower, right? The limit for stack. Then I take this escape rule. So here, L is curl S. So here, L is curl S is the quote complex of the index one correlative number step. This is the higher construction space. So for example, T0 and T1, T2, you may have T3, T4, and so on. And you don't have T0 because we consider geroty. So now, the fact is I showed that this one, for simple elliptic similarity custom zero customer with higher embedded dimension, this one really non-zero. This one really non-the earth. Especially when the local, the singularity local embedded dimension big or equal to five, I guess. Less than or equal to four, all LCR. And I cannot find the literature so that this one calculate, which I use some known fact papers to calculate some for the task. And the later I heard from Kai, then he told me that in some German literature, Some German literature, they already calculated non-literal. Now, so for example, for this kind of singularity, how you do that, right? Because they have high level structure, and we already know that in a smooth part, like a basic modular space, we only have, for each different type of surface S, we only have H1 TS, right, this garment deformation, and H2TS, the tangent bundle, the tangent shift or garment of a structure. What diameter of a structure. You don't have H2 equals dimension, in a smooth sense. But now, my S is singular, right? The singular point when you deform a surface, if the surface is singular, you have a global one coming from the global TS, right? And also you have the contribution from the local Y. So you have to consider. Why do you care about deciding higher obstructions? Because I want a perfect obstruction. I want a perfect obstruction theory, and then if here T3 exists, then never, the bare fatigue lithian style perfect obstruction never exists for this. You have to find some other. So you want only two non-zeros? Yeah, I only want here T1 and T2. I don't have T3, T4. Now, to control this, I use known theory. Known theory, so-called I product LCI power, but in a, you know, if I power SS is a simple similarity constant and so on, for example, then there exists a finite power as t 2s with finite transformation over g. This is from Newman-Waus theorem. Deconstructed this probably not a long time ago, but I don't know, maybe 10 years ago. And yes, and then, but because I don't have time to talk the data, right? But anyway, this finite colour really depends on the link of the germ similarity. And if you have a similarity germ here, you take the link, you take a neighborhood around S. Now we go to real world. Take a link, sorry, a neighborhood and consider boundary is a link. The boundary is the real oriented three-dimensional manual. Sorry, can you just go back to the previous page with the higher obstructions? Are these local instructions or global instructions? Thesis are global. These is global. It's a full service, not just the germ. Thesis are global. That sounds like a very negative result, like you have no hope. Oh, no, but you'll be at this one? The fact that there's higher obstructions sounds like a negative result that you're not going to be able to construct. We're trying to change a surface. You change your surface. But then now I have to change my framework. I go to another modular every time. Okay. Because if you're only on here, if you're only on the modular of index of carbs, there's no hope. That's my point. And this one can be calculated by the spectral sequence, right? You go to the global and go to the local singularity given. Anyway, yeah. So now real diamond mathematics. Link is a real dominant metric, and then you know how to use the fundamental group of the link. There's two cases that we consider, right? And then they can construct some finite account. And the good thing is here, S tilde is L C R. L C I is not really completely who constructs this a new man wall, W A H R L. Okay, so for me, I mean I was wondering about which degree and photos is what I mean the simple elliptics are CI up to degree four or something and then how about? I would take before that should be okay. It's the LCNI space. Yeah, then I have to take a cover, then I reduce the self-intersection, that becomes LCI. But you have to take a move of action, I guess. Do you have any example? I have a lot of examples. Okay, we can discuss. Simply take a yeah, okay. Okay. Now, uh Okay, now for every simple germ still I perform the same thing as the index one power keys and then I take the L C I power locally and then glue them together I get an L C I power delemother stack. But the only thing right now is you may receive some local overflow structure or delemorphostack structure so that your local action group will not be a needed anymore. Yeah, I will talk. No, I don't I don't know it's a unique. But the index one is also unique. And now I consider the Quarter static formation of SM and allocated surfaces and the deformation of the L C I colour, that logos that's called the uh You know, what's our meaning called potion cars? It's binary, right? Yeah. So that's I my I come on this idea, but I, you know, this would contain a lot of things I need to pay attention, right? To be more careful here. So for me, I will consider all the, because I did this some kind of Because I did this some kind of colour exists, then I will consider all of these LCI colours, so a flat family of these LCI colours, so that they induce the family of seminal concern surface I want in the borderline. So that's why I define a family over skin T of the volume. Here FOR is the family of seminal conclusion surfaces, and here is the indesomal colour of the limorphosca, and here is the family of the leaf LC colours. LCMS, both less than minutes, and this is the condition they need to satisfy. And from the LCI colour construction from the functional group, right, and then I know that any LCI cover must affect through the index model. So this is the condition I need to write. And furthermore, I yeah, and the cost moduli of And the cost moduli of this LCI cover must set up the condition in the module function I define. And also, here I should, I see when I talk, I didn't, but here I need to put another condition is for my LCI cover and then the singularity if I have the following, you know whenever I have a non-trivial LCI cover, I like the cards or simplicity give you Simple unit UU, then in a smoothing component, I require the volume. This is the, I think, you know, this locally completed intersection one, admins IG, I render smoothing, right? The local transformation volume is G, so that the induced downstairs is a motion. Exactly. In an universal ideal case, exactly. Yeah, maybe I should see more here. The disclaimer simply limits the keys. These are called the local log canonical surface singularities, right? A log canonical surface similarities contain two cases. KC1 is the index one, right? Index one is the cast for simple elliptic existing. In this case, the fundamental group of the link is not a finite, right? Because it's not a recognized reality. Right? Because it's not a recognition singularity, it's a minimum elitist similarity. So the funnel group is this where semi-product z. Then you have to take some finite cover. That's why the transformation group will not be a minimum. In the second case, it's the index bigger than one. It's the D2, D3, D4, DC quotient of the C4 elliptic when the D2 quotient of the class. For example, D2 quotient of CASA has index 2. And then the singularity becomes rational singularity. You know, these trees. You know, these trees, you know, that is simply look at I've got. And then, in this case, since the rational singularity, I guess it's a known fact, the fundamental group of a link is finite. And then you take the universal, I mean, finite power. Then you get also. And also now, the second condition I put is if the component like in yesterday is top, right, if in on another irreducible component. I think the fundamental group is finite if and only Fundamental group is finite if and only if its function similarity. Really? I think it follows Chrome first. No, normal surface reference email should be finite. That's Chrome very well. I think with that functionality. Okay, in the other component I require, right, all the stair components, all the different variations coming from LCI flat band induced downstairs deformation. And then in this case, so here's an example, sorry, I put it. Suppose S there is a Cushion-Cuff simulation. This is a cusp. This is given by the resolution cycle. And of each E2, this is And each E2, this is the self-intersection number. And each EIE2, this is this bigger integer, right? Positive integer. And when you take the D2 quotient, you get this. This is the resolution. So this is a tree, look. So this is a rational single, the D2 quotient. But this one, no. This is elliptic, like minimum elliptic. So this one has a fundamental rule, but which is a finite. This is so-called retinal homology speed, the link. Then in this case, you can take the universal meaning curve, then you get LCL. This LCL is a locally complete intersection. We can actually, Newman Wall actually write down this explicitly. Look, you first say form similarity, you can associate mononymics using the self-meta number, you write this. And then this universal meaning power, which So there's also a venue power, which is a group of G with order 16B given by this matrix B in our n. And if I define a group like this, define the group using this AY234, the diagonal matrix given by the Z is the root of unity. And then you put together this four elements of generated a finite unit group. And then this group acts on the local neighborhood of your singularity. Co-neighborhood of your singularity, your Causion cost singularity, then you get the Louvre equation of the LCI curve. They're given by the group action, the quotient is the Cauchy constant. And also in this case, look, everything, these two equations, right, inside the C4, case. And then you can take the group Gx of that, you can find. X of that, you can find accurate smoothie. So this is a quotient casp case. Causion casp case is referencing dynamic particularity. The finite abelian curve always abelian. The finite colour always are either. But in a case, if in the index one case you have a casp, then the finite curve may be nothing. This this is only one example. There's two cases, uh the index one case and the index bigger than one case. The biggest than one case is seems better, I guess, in my sense. In any case, maybe I should say here still means important progress. But anyway, I hope I think I can show that I put together these things, I can show to exist a fine dilemma for. I can show the exists a fun dalmouth modulo, the limo stack MILCI, which parametrize the index one, sorry, the LCI covers, right? The family of that, so that the cosmodule is semi-local surface. And moreover, there exists a propomorphism from LDCI. Before, I am not so better. I mean, I hope it is finite, but I cannot. I only can't prove the problem. Yeah, that's I want to ask that. I hope I'm asking myself, right, I'm asking myself in which pieces, maybe the sub pieces you get a finite level. You get a only finite level. I don't know if this is true or not. The fibers parameterize the different possible covers of a given portable LCI cover. Different the portable L C L covers yeah I mean the the the condition is so I don't know how to find the maybe but the covers are local I mean local yeah the covers local and then you can put them yeah as a stack I blue as a stack that's not yeah but you have many choices yeah but why do you write that Yeah. But why do you write that it induces bijection some cosmological space? Oh, sorry, I've I've I hear the wrong. Sorry, I showed. So here, under cosmodule, there should be also proper. Sorry. These are bad for me, actually. Because before I want this finite, but let me get wrong. I want them. Oh, no, I cannot see it wrong, but I cannot prove it. Isn't locally the cover unique, though? But then why doesn't it lose sort of to a unique object? I cannot prove that's unique because I don't know how to prove it's unique. Probably there exists some other singularity, probably exists some other LCI, right? The cover, so there's a locally complete intersection, the cushion still there. Yeah, if you can, maybe you can help me. I'm not just the basic thing. So now just the easiest example, A1, this is the portion of A2 of the affine spaces. But I'm going to say what now if you have two L C I columns. It says the factors doesn't say that one the L C I puppets it doesn't do anything. So if the index one cupboard is L C I doesn't do anything. If that CI doesn't do that. At least. Or maybe I have a computer. Sorry. So if your index one cover is at CI, you allow further covers or not? Yeah, maybe I don't require it. LCI already okay. But or I need to simply Point is that on LCI modes you can have a virtual functor size. Yes, yes. Maybe I require, but I know it's okay. I put the order together, but in my module functor, but I require they set it by some conditions. Yes, I know. Yeah, I tried a very good question. I didn't think about it. Sorry, I just don't have the next question. Sorry, you know, a lot of questions. Maybe I missed yeah. But I guess even if you take some preferred L C I cover, like its deformations might not be the preferred L C I'm sure. Yes, that's why I require from the flat feminine of L C I I want to reduce the deformation I want. Yeah, you are right. Maybe you come with some L C I you don't have a good deformation. It's a example to say of a server server, right? Yeah, then, as Dan said, right? The problem is, if I go to the level of CI, then I can define the overtross cycle. Why? Because the LCI similarity, there is no higher obstruction. You only have T1. Remember that the locally complement intersection, the tangent shift, you only have T0 and T1. Yeah, T2 is 0 because T1 not 0 marriage. T1 non-true variety that locally calculated the sector. And then you're using special sequence to calculate the global higher constraint I define before using EST proven or vanish the higher. You only have T1. That's the point. So can I go back to the previous morphism is proper, do we actually know the fibers are finite? Ah, fibrant, finite or not. Like you just no. As you said, there is no preferred LCI cover. But is it possible that because the fundamental group is infinite abelian, then there are actually infinitely many LCI covers that you can, yeah, I thought by uh I thought by that question, but I put it in the beginning of my model functor, I require some condition when I prove the properties that I use in the vali valuity of criteria for properties. A criterion for programs to model. Maybe cancels that. We talked about it. That's, yeah, that's, I said, I'm still, you know, think about this way. I hope I can show this problem. Your expectations that it's actually finite, not. I want, but I don't know. I cannot. I have a hard time imagining where higher-dimensional libraries are. You can help me find, for example, if I fix a cost, how many LCI cars I can have, or fix some condition I can have finite. Then it will be very good. Then you get a finite model. So the thing is, if you have a suppose we have this thing, right? Then you can take a uh like the family of that, right? Universal family, and then I take the following. And then I take the following complex. Here, this L M L C L O M C I is the relative cotanic complex. And then you will get a coffee or strong theorem in the sense of variant value in the DTN from this adult to the potential complex L C R. Why? Because this one is really the, you know, if you have five multiples, you have the Kodai bar. Is you have the Kodaiba, sorry, like a clock. You know, you have a relative tangent of the moduli to the relative tangent of the universal tangent, right? And then you take a dual of that, you get this. And then you can show this one is a perfect obstruction theory in the sense of bare finality. Because this only two terms. You don't have a higher term level. And then if you have this, And then, if you have this, then the generality of virtual, I don't calculate it, I don't forget here, right? Then implied that you will have a virtual fundamental class which belongs to the child group of MLCR. It's a projective dynamical stand. Vd is the virtual dimension. And then you can calculate the virtual dimension, which and then in the case, this one big or even bigger, you get a virtual cycle. And then for some cases, this one less than zero, like this. This is zero, right? This is the Euro, right? That is dear. Not chi square, chi. Oh, yeah. Ah, I made mistake. Yeah, this is chi, sorry. Chi minus two chi square. That chi square. Yeah. A lot of variables, sorry. And then, sorry. Yeah, for me, and then I want a virtual cycle on the, you know, where's my, yeah. And then I define a virtual cycle on my modular. Cycle on my modular space M, right? And then, because of problem, I take the push forward. So, this though just so if you have the virtual cycle, and then you can define the so-called technological environment using, I here I've only using the CM line model. If you have a newer family of the modules, similar conditions surfaces is flat and projective, and this canonical dual lighting, sorry, this relative Sorry, this relative divider, right? Monitor divider is Q katia and a relative ample. And from Bruce and the Manfo, which Harold talked about yesterday afternoon, you can take a large bundle, maybe Lampuna, right? You can take a determinant of lower p. Okay, case of a large, then we will write this. So this is a unique line model, lambda 0, 1, 2, 3, because of this relative dimension 2. And then you can write down this. And then you can write down this formula. And you can calculate, in this case, you can calculate the CM line bundle as defined by Harold yesterday, very similar to this. And I guess this CM line bundle proved to be amplified by a pathological issue. And then now, if I have the virtual class, then I can define the one catalog we rent. One catalogue we're going to take a first change glass of the CM and R not take a voltage D, right? However, then take integration. While constructing, if you have your new model a space and LCI, you just do there, is it? Why don't you just work there? Okay, yeah, sure. Buddha suggests that actually. Yeah, I think this type also suggested. Anyway. Okay, good, good. And also here address a question is again by maybe called a question by Donasen. He predicts that, or he asked that if you can extend all the technological classes coming from the characteristic class of the diffimorphy group of the services for real time, go to this case BA come back dedication. Cas BA combat duplication. I don't know how to do that. I only know this same last morphology because I already done. That again, what classes? They said if you have a germ type of surface, right, as a reminder, maybe it contains all the different morphology groups. Consider the characteristic class of the diffimorph. The decade defines on the smooth part, but he his question is to extend this class to the class BA convi identification. Combat application. Maybe like the holder bundle or this stuff in the MG barcase. But I don't know how to explore it. Okay. So now, maybe quickly I talk an example because it's very important. As yesterday there were a lot of examples, right? But not compact, I guess. We cannot find an explicit compact example. But now I give a compact example of surfaces, but given some other But given some other conditions, I consider 16 surfaces in P3, degree 6. You can calculate in the smooth surface, 6 degree 6, 60. You can calculate the p t equal to 10, k squared equal to 24, and then this is 11, right? The hologram like RC. And then the modular space, this one is very complicated, I guess. Much more complicated maybe than M55 bar. But if I take this hypersurface degree 6 subsurfaces, and then I make a finite group action, this is. I made a finite group action. This is Dannerson's example. Doneson calculated this example. Let G belong to G is the following group given by the action by this. And the data is the root of unity of all the six. And then you can consider the aggregant degree six homogeneous phenomenon. And then this gain by this. And here Q, how do you minus gain? Here q, total q minus q minus the coordinate is this is the coordinate, right, of the P3, homogeneous coordinate. And then you can write down the invariant part of this degree six polynomial and the sister x on this t4, right? By this, and the sister action on this coefficient that you get. On this coefficient that you get, given by this. And then the G and red decreases homogeneous polynomial given by the following form. And this is unique up to a change of sine of alpha for the surface. So that you consider for the smooth surface given by the finite group of actions, then you get the modular space is really like C2 more C2. And then you have a GIT compactification inside the P2. This is easy, and this is P2 modulation. You add up infinity divider. But the GIT equal to the infinity divider, you can write down explicitly of the local equation of the surface, which is very similar. It's not a similar command. So the general method, how you do, then if we want to get the KCB combatification of M by the M D I T, then I perform with, you know. Then I perform with a you know blow up and blow down because this is a Tauric surface. Or you can, as a step, this is a Tauric Delemorphos that, which I'm very familiar. I start my career from that. So now you can take the picture, roughly. So forget about this, right? And the original surface, the torque survey P2 modulum mu2 is given by this and this, right? And this. Forget about these two. Right, and this forget about these two at the moment. So, this and the kong and kong. Right? I like the fan picture, that's why I write a fan picture. If you like the political, you can write a political picture. And then, the thing is, you add these three is the infinity divider of the P1 you add on the P2 more mu2, on C2 mall mu2. Then, these infinity divider contain a lot of parametrized surfaces which are very similar. Which are very similar. And the thing is, you consider inside this cone, and then inside that cone, you do two with the blowouts. Right? Then cancel this one. And then eventually in the top picture, you blow down this. Forget about this thing. And then about another toric surface which contains one, two, three, four points. That's the KCA convectivity. It's a projective toric dynamo. Toring the demo stack two-dimensional. And you know, there are no other components? No. This is the only thing. Very complete. This is what I know, the complete example for Tauric surface, so for general type surface, semi-note monitor, but you have a finite group actually. You put some position. And yeah, that's the idea. And then in this case, you can calculate the event. Look, the total variety dimension. Look, the total variety M has dimension 2, and then you can calculate the H1 STS given by the group G at the environment is 2. And the H2 of the environment is 1. Look, the torque dynamos is smooth, right? The modulus is smooth, but it has wrong dimension. So this is the obstruction 1, so that you have a global obstruction bundle. You can construct from the total picture. And you can calculate the virtual formula class, it's given by the The virtual Fermi class is given by the obstruction bundle, that first chain class, with the Fanny class. But in this case, it's smoother, right? You have a fund class. So, and then you can calculate the catalogical invariant. It's given by the CMLR bound C1 over the virtual class. I think it's non-V calculator, sorry. This Donaldson calculator is one over time. In this case, do you have any non-LCI surfaces in the boundary? In the boundary, no, yeah, that's the only. Yeah, I want to mention. Sorry, let's just forget. Yeah, in this example, all the surfaces is LCI, given by local equation. So, yeah, there's new equation which I very much want to know if there exists a concrete example of semi-local control surfaces so that you have some non-LCIC value, for example, pushing or cusp. So, you can calculate this. So you can calculate this category, this Donaldson category. And also in Donaldson's paper, he comes out of this example, right? And then he thinks that it's very reasonable. You put this M virtual is the line amount of refund with the fundamental class. And because at that time, you don't have this form of this stuff to show the existence of virtual class. You just said, oh, I just agree. This is the virtual model class. I give a premise, right? I do what parameters I assume there exists, and then he calculated this. And then my, I think I might construct it if you correct. I think that for this example, definitely, okay, it already confirmed this one is the one. And are things in the boundary cornerstone or do you need the LCI? I think the LCI is all grains there. All Greenstead. They're all Google Star. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, thank you uh thank you very much. Are there other questions? I didn't understand this space you consider here in the example? Like the subset of sex sticks with like an equilibrium copular space where you have a group action? Yeah. You have a final group action. I consider all the key. The final group actually considers all the irregular surfaces, hyper surfaces. Two dimensional instead of the model is two-dimensional. It's a toriple toric surface. All torik dynamic status. Which is very beautiful. I remember. I just read Donaldson's paper and if there are any other examples you actually calculated everything which includes. Which includes non-concrete intersection features? Very difficult, no. Probably I'm thinking if you go to the log denote type case, right? There exists a lot of examples from Hagging Csis, for example, and also from Brenda's original paper, modulo of P2 with degree 4 curve. Am I right? I think the example correctly. Then probably you have more examples. I don't know. I plan to study that later. Log, you go to the log. And what I present here is correct. I'm still working, right? I need to make sure all the things correct. Then this one can be generalized to the log. And maybe even the stable map, I guess. Then you have a length three hours, right? Oh, yeah. But in the simple map, if I restrict the market. If I restrict my surface, log surface for P2D, then I don't think there is any map. Only it's perfect, I think. Yeah, if you consider any general text that's at least a device, then you will have a certain Adil Khan's uh theory of uh classes. Serial things. I think that's all today. Any other questions? Look at the portions of these surfaces by the group action. Oh no. I didn't know. I only get to continue the first surface of which you ran. The third surface which we ran. Yes, I was just wondering if you get general type portion to work. The portion will be not general type, but maybe. I don't know if it's not. It could be toric. Because then that would explain why the moduli space is toric. That would be the secondary polytope of the group in there. You have to look at the dimension of the fixed glow side. Anyway, this example is very interesting in my sense. And also inside the example, if you compatibly subject even with the group action, it under a lot of good relationships to other theory. To other theory, if I wanted to compatify this one to relate to the maybe Umunton theory of M25 dot, because the surface inside you have the curve, right, in the linear system. Which I guess which Kenning and Dory did, they also studied that before. I hope we have a relationship. Yeah, but it's not like that. Is there something special about six? Or can you do it for different this kind of I thought about that? No, I cannot. For seven and higher? I didn't think of it. Maybe five is okay, but the six is the most the minimal one. The five I tried. No. No. Difficult. Why if you the five is okay, you'll start from five because five is easier, right? The six. No, I don't I can't. No, I don't I guess. I was thinking higher, yeah. Higher, maybe okay. Other questions? Okay, let's thank the speaker again.
