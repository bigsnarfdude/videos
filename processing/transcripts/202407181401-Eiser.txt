The last afternoon session, we have three talks. There's been a slight change in the schedule. So the last talk of the day has been moved into this session after Erica's talk. So three talks and then a couple of break and then two talks. Okay, so first we have Erica Iser going to talk to us about the micro-reality of hydrogels. Get away. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So I was worrying the whole week because everybody talks about the flow of viscolastic fluids in forest media, and I will only talk about equilibrium micromheology. But I think it is really interesting to know that you can do it. And I will talk about passive micromiology, that means only a few beads and nothing dynamic. Nevertheless, I think I want to show you. I want to show you with microbiology, you can actually measure the viscoelastic properties in a medium in very confined media and with very small volumes. And that's very important if you have a microporous material. Okay, so the work that I present today is some stuff that I have done that I have done. that I have done still in Cambridge at the Cavendish Laboratory, but I continue working on this in different ways also now at CORMA. Now, oh it works. So the interesting thing is, first before I start telling you a little bit about micronology, I wanted to thank my group back in Cambridge. They all worked in some way. They all worked in some way with DNA, in different ways, theories, simulations, experiments, but also a lot on developing tools. And in particular, Alessio Cacciani, he developed all the software needed to extract from thermal fluctuations of either intensities or particles, the positions of particles, and to extract from that viscoelastic. From that, viscoelastic properties. And so these are some of our funding agencies, but the most important we collaborated also with Hassan Li, a professor in Tsinghua University, because all the DNA that I show you, they produced for us for nothing, for free. And we used a lot, and that is really expensive. And that's also why you prefer to do. That's also why you prefer to do microbiology on an expensive sample than with regular bulk geology. Now, I will talk about hydrogels. And I told you on Sunday evening in the start of the sort of two slides, that when you take egg white, already when the fresh egg white is there, you feel already there is some elasticity in the system. In the system. But not changing the concentration or the content of the material, you rearrange them, you make them aggregate in different ways, and you can increase the elasticity by four orders of magnitude. So when you hard boil an egg, that's an irreversible hydrogel. But there are also other hydrogels that are called transient networks, and they are very interesting because they have. Interesting because they have bonds that connect or are responsible for the network formation, but they can break and make. So they are only weak bond strength of the order of few kTs, not like a covalent bond like 50 or 100 kT. That's very different. So you can shear them actually and immediately recover their elasticity when you stop shearing them. Typical examples are telecaps. Vitromirs are very interesting. That's the only thing that was actually introduced by, I think, Ludwig Leibniz. When you look at a glass, it's a covalently bonded network of silicate, silicon oxide. And when we heat it, we don't break the bonds between them, but it's But it still flows. And these are very strong covalent bonds. So you wonder why it is still flowing. And that's only because the bonds, when they come very close, when we strain the system, then they can swap. And that is how they can actually flow. Other ones are, of course, agarose and gelatin. Here, many people like for breakfast, maybe a fruit yellow or dessert. This is nice. This is 90% or 95% water that industry sells to you. Really expensive. Okay. Now I want to talk about a different transient network and that is thoroughly fully reversible and that is made of DNA. Now Ned Siemen was a great guy. He already started in the 70s, 80s to look at DNA holiday injunctions. I don't know whether you're Junctions. I don't know whether you're aware of that, what these are, but you have in the body when two DNA wants, genomes want to exchange strands, they have to cross and they form these four-way junctions. This is also used today in modern applications like gene editing. But he also recognized that this is a great building material and you can Material and you can do DNA tiling, DNA origami, you may have heard about, and you can program the self-assembly that you want to have, how it looks like in the end. And you can also do finite size subset. So you don't have a volume spanning system. Now, the DNA, the strength of DNA, it's highly specific. So this is a real experiment that I'll show you. So, this is a real experiment that I show you here. This is the sequence of two complementary strands. And we can measure the melting of these strands into two separate ones or cooling into the duplex directly with looking at the adsorption of this solution of theirs at 260 nanometers. That's important because at this wavelength, single strands simply absorb much stronger. Strands simply absorb much stronger than this wavelength than the double strand. And that's nice. And you see, these are actually measured, you can measure forth and back. Here it's all double strand when it reaches this steady slope. Here it's all single strands. And this region is very wide, 20 to 30 degrees centigrade. Moreover, we can define a melting point. It is the point at which half of all hydrogen bonds. Which half of all hydrogen bonds are broken in the system. So you can switch on and off the bonds, so you can switch on and off the attraction between them at will by playing with the temperature. Alright. Now, people use these type of things to do nanostars. If you attach a single-stranded strand here at the ends, you can make them. At the ends, you can make them self-assemble into a hydrogel, and you can design them to be Y-shaped, X-shaped, and T-shaped. It's not quite as simple as you need some bit of design rules for that. Interesting, what is also you can do with DNA is if you have systems with a lot of Cs in between, at a given pH, these C's will. A given pH, these C's will bind to each other and form what is called an IMOT. And people use that nanomachines actually to measure the pH inside the cell very low by attaching, for instance, complementary fluorophores at the ends. So you can make also big hydrogels that can swell or deswell on demand by changing the pH. So it's really a lot of. So, it's really a lot of interesting stuff you can do. Sorry, it was a bit too fast. And here, this one, you can, people started using DNA in combination with different other biomolecules as bio-imprinting material. So, it's an interesting material and it's fun, it's well controlled, and we know what to do. Now, one thing before I go into the micro-biology of these type of systems is These types of systems is the question is: what does it do when we have different valencies? Now, the valency of a nanostar is very important because it determines how the phase diagram will look like. Just to remind you, of course, when we have Leonard-Jones potentials, we have steep repulsion to prevent them to sit on top of each other, but you have also attraction. Now, the typical phase diagram. Now, the typical phase diagram is you have gas, liquid, a gas-liquid phase separation, but then they are connected through the triple point to also the liquid-solid and solid phase. There's no way of moving down here so easily without going into a phase separation regime. Now, this is important because this is isotropic interactions. But when you have no valency on your Valency on your beads, that's shown by Francesco Sciotino. Is if you only have attraction through these stickers and you start reducing the number of stickers, you reduce the two-phase separation between gas and liquid dramatically. So you actually open up the entire phase space here between the two phase region between gas and solid. Between gas and solid, as gas and liquid and liquid insolvent. So you can go straight from high temperatures to low temperatures, from a liquid to an equilibrium gel phase. And this is actually what we wanted to do with this. We measured the viscoelasticity and micro rheology of these type of systems. This is just a simulation where we ran the bar system on. System on SENOMA to check our experimental data and to see how the structure locally looks like. Now, when you do, as I said, DNA in small quantities is cheap. DNA in big quantities, milliliters and more, is expensive. And you need a DNA synthesizer for that.
