So we have a let's X to be a topological manifold and the question is so how many smooth structures does it support? And I will restrict this question, so I will always assume that X is connected, closed. Closed, so compact and empty boundary, and most of the time it will be oriental. And so this is the question. You know the yoga. If the dimension of x is less than or equal to 3, then smooth structure always exists and it is essential unique. If the dimension is bigger than 5, or at least 5, then Or at least five, then there are manifolds which do not support any smooth structures. And in any case, any such example can support at most finite humanity. And in dimension four, it's not true. There are many examples where the manifold admits infinitely many distinct structures. And indeed, we do not have a single example where we would know that the manifold has finitely many unless this finite number is zero. So here is a possibility. So here is a possibility x4, so such a topological four manifold of dimension four, we don't need that. Did I just projector off okay? Logic. So it's a possibility that the four-dimensional Possibility that the four-dimensional topological manifolds hold zero or infinitely many snu structures. Okay? So for a while I also added the possibility to support the unique one just of out of respect to the generalized Poincar√© conjecture, but still I don't believe in that. I just skipped that possibility. I just skipped that possibility. So, um, okay. Um, so here is a theorem I would like to talk about today. So, this is a result of Inanj Baikur, me, and Zoltan, which says that, so fix an integer m, a negative integer, and if If my four-manifold X has a fundamental group isomorphic to the cyclic group on 4n plus 2 elements. So this just means that it's twice an odd number. And Qx, the intersection for manifold, sorry, should remind you that this is the most important topic. That this is the most important topological invariant of a four-body flow. It's the intersection form on the second cohomology math portion. And we assume that it's odd then with possibly seven exceptions so there are seven exceptions for every fixed L. So there are like infinitely many, but okay. Infinitely many, but okay. X either has no smooth structure or it carries infinite number. So this is somehow justifies my dichotomy here, either zero or infinity. This is a very restricted but still quite But still, quite large family of four manifolds, where we have non-trivial fundamental groups, and we assume that the intersection for these are. Okay, so I would like to give some ideas what goes into the proof of this theorem. But before doing that, I'd like to just make a little detour. So you remember in the simply connected case, there are like two types of four-manifolds. There are the spin and the non-spin ones, which is sort of Spin ones, which is sort of reflected in the parity of intersection for spin means even intersection for non-spin means R. Well, if you have non-trivial fundamental groups, there are like three types of manifolds. There are the spin ones, and then if the manifold is spin, then the universal cover will be also spin. And then there are the non-spin ones, and they fall into two categories, whether the universal cover is spin or not spin. And so this assumption sort of puts us into the category. Puts us into the category where the manifold is non-spin and the universal cover is also non-spin. So these are the manifolds we are focusing on. So let me, yeah, so here's a little fact. So manifolds of this type, it's a cyclic fundamental group. So such X is characterized By the intersection form up to homeomorphism. And as always, this is not an absolutely correct statement as it stands, but morally it's true. So if you have two such four manifolds which do admit smooth structures, then they are homeomorphic if and only if they have the same fundamental group and they have isomorphic Group when they have isomorphic intersection forms. So, this is an extension of Friedman's famous theorem from the simply connected case to these finite cyclic groups, which is due to Hamilton and Crack. So, okay. So, here are some examples. So, let's take m to be zero. So, we are really focusing on the smallest possible non-trivial fundamental. As possible non-trivial fundamental groups Z2. And so here is a fantastic example of such a four-manifold. Consider S2 cross S2, and there is a free Z2 action on this manifold, namely you take the antipodal map on each coordinate. So the antipodal map is orientation reversing, and we sort of consider all the oriented manifolds. But if you do it twice, then you get an orientation preserving map. So I call it. Map, so I call it A, so you take A plus A, and so this is the benefit that you denote by L2, because 2 is because the fundamental is A2, and L, I have no idea, but that's what it is. And so there is an easy way to describe that manifold using Kirby calculus. This is like, that's a Kirby diagram for this manifold. And using this picture, you can easily generalize it to any Lms by taking this circle sort of spiraling at times. So using this fact, indeed, the proof of this theorem relies on the following facts. So the problem find infinitely many smooth structures. Smooth structures on L2 connected some, some copies of C D2 and some other copies of Cb2 part. I mean the problem to prove this theorem, at least in the m equals zero case, is exactly this. Because the intersection form is either definite or indefinite. If it is definite, then by Donaldson's theorem, we only have to consider the die. Theorem: We only have to consider the diagonal ones. So, this is a couple of CP2s, a couple of CP2 bars. And for the indefinite odd case, this fact just tells us that these are the topological four manifolds we have to work with. And as we are here, I can explain or I can tell you what are the possible exceptions. So, the exceptions are when But n is equal to n and they are less than 7, less than or equal to 7. N equals k. So this is like signature 0, right? It is the fancy way to say it. So the signature 0 guys give the headache when the other characteristic is sort of too small. Too small. Okay. Any questions? So this is what we would like to prove that these manifolds admit infinitely many smooth structures unless we have this condition where we have no idea. We have only one example, we don't know how to proceed. And so, okay, so what are the two tricks? Let's say, I don't see. Yeah, I don't see. So observation X and minus X admit infinitely many smooth structures at the same time. So you can always flick the orientation. If you see a four manifold and you have no idea what to do, flick the orientation. If you still don't know what to do, If you still don't know what to do, well, then you are probably in this regime. That's one thing. And the other thing is how to distinguish manifolds. So, you know, there are many variants of cyber-britten theory, of Dalton invariants, and RODIS gauge theory originated invariants, and this is what we will use. But how to do? So, for example, you can face the problem when you take this two and say, 2 and say both n and k are even numbers. This means that the b2 plus invariant of the manifold is even, meaning that all these cybergrid moduli spaces are of odd dimension, and you have no idea how to squeeze out any information from those. And this is where my next trick comes, that you don't work with the manifolds themselves, but you go for the covers. So let's stick to the m equals zero case, so you just go to the universe. So you just go to the universe and overcover. So suppose you have x1 and x2, and we would like to see whether there is a diffeomorphism. So is there a diffeomorphism? Well, we go to the universal covers, x2 tilde, x1 tilde, and it's easy to see that if there is a diffeomorphism, then you can just take this composition and this map can be lifted to here. Can be lifted to here, and since this being a diffeomorphism is sort of being smooth, is a local property, which is already satisfied for the left, this will be a differomorphism. So, this was a long sentence saying that if downstairs you have a diffomorphism, upstairs you have a differ morphism. So, what you can do is you pass to the universal cover and construct four manifolds there. And a simple observation, you know, you just compute the characteristic number. You just compute the characteristic numbers of the double cover. The signature multiplies by 2, the other characteristic multiplies by 2, big one is 0 upstairs. So what will happen is that all these universal covers will have odd B2 plus. So this is where you can use your theory, and this is what we will actually do. So instead of distinguishing or constructing four manifolds with these properties, we construct simply connected four manifolds. We construct simply connected four manifolds with three zip to actions, three orientation preserved in z-two actions. And that's the same. Is that an explanation for the kind of my4 here? Yeah, so well, so for Z2, you don't need any explanation there. And what will happen is that we will have an equipment that you can inject fundamental to the manifold. To the manifold, and it turns out that what you will face is a Z2 expansion. If you go downstairs, a Z2 extension, and it turns out to be a trivial extension. So, what we will get is four manifolds which fundamentally would Z2 times a cyclic. And then if that other cyclic is odd, then you get this one. If not, then you get Z2 times something. And then we have less classification results. We have less classification results of this type for non-sexual fundamentals. So you still get a bunch of exotics, but you cannot phrase it so nicely. Does it make sense? Okay, so this is the plan. And before moving on, let me just point out a few sort of particular cases. So the theorem addresses the case when Qx is just the simplest odd intersection for the one-by-one matrix. The self-intersection is one. So here is the definition. So the four manifold X is a faint projective plane if H, if its co-modering with rational coefficients is the same as the co-logying of Cp two with rational coefficients and x is irreducible. X is irreducible. I mean, if we skip that, then we can come up with examples of this type by taking CT2 and taking rational homology spheres and we just collect some of them. So that's not so exciting. The question is whether there are manifolds of this type. And so this question goes back to, I don't know, Severi, like 70 years ago, maybe more, asking what happens if you are looking for complex manifolds. Are you looking for complex manifolds of this type? And that question has been actually answered by Mumford. He constructed the first such example, and then it was a long history. And now we have a complete classification. There are exactly 50 such complex surfaces, or 100 if you were up to birational isomorphism, because you can take the complex structure and it's conjugate in the same manifold. And somehow it has been reduced to a It has been reduced to a group theory question. And so notice that Order theorem, which I noticed in raised, gives a whole bunch of new examples of this type with fundamental Z2. So it's like really close to CP2, so to exotic CP2s. You just perturb the fundamental group, but then somehow you are there. So that's really the motivation of studying these manifolds to actually understand them better and see a good way to. And see a good way to construct the CPU tools. And so we have, let me just study out. So, what's the statement? So, it is this next theorem. And this is again with Enange and Solton. And so, it just says that there are infinitely many non-diffeomorphic, homeomorphic, Homeomorphic fake projective planes with fundamental group. And so for example, we can do G cross Z2 for all G, which is a fundamental group of rational homology in 20 sphere. Or slightly different. Slightly different type of a cyclic time sedium. So there are plenty of groups. We have no idea what the limitation of these fundamental groups of fake projective planes could be. None of these examples are complex, and none of these examples are symplectic. So it would be fantastic to find symplectic examples. And of course, we construct these manifolds. We construct these manifolds by using the first trick. Oh, yeah, this one, where we just flip the orientation. And then instead of having intersection for one, we just consider intersection for minus one. Okay, so let me just give you a sort of a taste of how to construct metaphors of this type. But before that, maybe I'm going to spell out one further special case that you know that they're not complex because of the classification. No, they are not complex because of this. They are not even C plus. You will see. We just reverse the orientation and they have no chance to be complex or simple. So that would be an interesting. I mean, I spent a lot of time trying to understand what Monfort did. That was like 78. He had a much bigger time spent to understand what he did. But I don't. So, yeah, I wanted to. I wanted to spell out one special case. So notice that we showed that if x4 has fundamental groups, say Z2 and QX is definite, and furthermore, B2 of X is positive, then X has infinity. Has infinitely many smooth structures. And this is in very sharp contrast with the simply connected case. If you take a simply connected four-manifold and it admits a smooth structure, then, so let me just say that if X of Z is simply connected and definite, then it's homeomorphic. Then it's homeomorphic to a connected set of CP2s or CP2 bars. And we have not a single example for these guys to admit a smooth structure. We don't know that. And once we go to fundamental group Z2, then we essentially know that all of them admit infinitely smooth structures. There is one assumption on the B2. is one assumption on the B2 because my manifold L2 is still open. You see this is a definite four manifold with fundamental group Z2 and second BETI number is zero. So for this one we don't know. That's sort of justified by the fact that the universal cover is S2 cross S2 and we have no idea what's going on in S2 process2. Okay so these are the statements and then I will These are the statements, and then I will try to give you some ideas how to construct. And we will start with the simplest construction we found. So consider S2 cross T2. And so there is the convention that S is always shorter than T2. So this is the S2 side, this is T2, and we take. And we take a complex curve in it or a smooth surface by taking twice the fiber and once the section. So that has two singular points. We just designularize there. So we just resolve the singularity by replacing it with this resolution in four dimensions and blowing it up four times. So we get a genus II surface because when we snoop these intersection points we have these two tori connected by the sphere so by resolving the intersection points you get the genus II surface and it's easy to see that it has self-intersection four. So if you blow up those surface four times you will get a genus II surface You will get a genus 2 surface inside S2 plus T2 done up four times itself intersection 0 with trivial normal number. Okay, so that's our building block. And so I take two copies of that. So here is my schematic for that. This is one S2 process. Um s to cross s s to cross t two blown up four times minus the tubular neighborhood of this blown up sigma two and I take two copies of these and I will try to glue them together so far so good so we will glue them together using a glue map fly and the expectation is that it should be a fixed point free Fixed point free orientation reversing involution. Once you have that, then there is an obvious involution between the two copies. They are just the same twice. So on the glued up manifold, you will get fixed point free orientation preserving involution. And when we take the quotient, we'll actually get one of these definite four manifolds. I don't tell you which one. The question is whether can you fix phi in such a way that you can use the Fixed phi in such a way that what you get is simply collective. So, you know, after spending so many years in gate theory, so now we sort of understand that computing cyber-britten variants, it's okay. I mean, it's not trivial, but not hard. But computing the fundamental group, that's a real challenge. Although, I say it always, we teach kids to compute the fundamental group of a manifold root from two pieces by putting the From two pieces by putting the base point in the intersection. And we don't do that. We fear those kids who don't put the base point there, but then we feel the same problem. Anyway, so the question is whether can you find a file? And so the answer is yes. I will not give you the argument, but let me sort of give you why, what are the chances? So what's the fundamental group here? So the fundamental group of this manifold is z plus z. Group of this manifold is z plus z. The fundamental group of this manifold is z plus z as well. And when you take out the tubercular neighborhood of this surface, it stays the same because the normal to the surface can be contracted along one of these bonus spheres. So the fundamental group here is z plus z, and the fundamental group here is z plus z as well. So all you need to try to pass. All you need to try to patch them together in a way that, okay, and what's the fundamental group in the middle? This has four generals. This is just the fundamental group of S1 cross sigma G, but this S1 factor bounds of this, so you don't have to worry about that. And then you have the genus 2 surface, which has like four generators, and you hope that you can arrange that two generators die on this side, and the other two generators die on the other side. And what it means. The other side, but it may catch them together, and that can be done. I will not give you the, you know, you need to go through quite the yoga of like how to identify the master genus to surface with the actual ones, and then what is the moving back. It's not very complicated, but sort of tiresome. So, this is what we get. So, two copies of the four-fold blow-up can be grouped together to get a four-manifold with a With an evolution. So, the homeomorphism type, the result will be homeomorphic to CP2 going up nine times, which boils down to a single eigen characteristic and signature computation. The signature you see immediately, because the signature of this guy is minus four. You take two copies, so it adds up to minus eight. Like this one, you have to check the other characteristic. The other characteristic, and for simply connected manifolds, you have to worry a little bit about the even and not. Not in this case, actually. If it's smoothable than by Rockling, you know that you cannot mistake. So this is what we get together with the Z2 action. If you quotient out by this involution, so the involution is just this flipping the two sides and the way you glue them together. If you do this yoga, if there are two. Yoga, you get L2, 4 times C2. Now it needs a little bit of a justification why the result of the gluing is exotic. So why we do get up to homeomorphism this standard blown up complex projective plane, but why are the negative homomorphic? And well, there are two options. Either you invoke Usher's theorem, saying that what we get here will be a minimum supply planifold. Minimum manifold, or you just compute the small perturbation several units, and then you see that it's constant zero for this manifold, and you will get two basic classes for that one. So, this is how you get exotic structures on this manifold, and then I will just mention how to do some others. Same again? How did you see the melanoma sympathetic? This one? Yeah. Well, either, so this is a symplectic, this is a conf sum. So this is a symplectic submanifold, so it will be symplectic. And either you say that Usher's theorem tells you that if they are relatively unable, then after the gluing, you will get a universal symplectic manifold, or you just compute the Bayesian classes. We'll have one pair of Bayesian classes. And that's enough. Okay, so this gives you S2 cross T2 plus 4 blow up gives you L2 4 times CP2 R. And so here we took S2 cross P2, two fiber intersection. So now we can modify this construction a little bit and we take still S2 cross T222222222 And we take still S2 plus T2, but now three blow-outs. And instead of taking, we take one copy of S2, one copy of the fiber, and then we take that graded fiber. I will not explain how to do that, but this is like a torus. Instead of representing once the fiber, it represents the homological as twice the fiber. You just do it the local reading. Here, what you do is you smooth this interface. Do is you smooth this intersection, you smooth this one, and you blow up this intersection point. And then you still need to apply two more blow-ups somewhere, and then you just use the same principle as here. Everything will be exactly the same. It will need a little more of a fundamental calculation, but you get exotic 2, 3 times CP2 power. Notice that I gave you 1, and the That I gave you one, and the theorem promised infinitely many. So you will see how correctly it's mathematically. So far, so good. But if it's not good, well, I can do my figures, which is too late. The next idea is to take T4, T2 cross T2, and now we take two blow-ups. And in this case, we take... And in this case, we take a fiber and a section. So that will be already, once you smooth the intersection point, it will be a torus, a genus to surface. And you have to blow it up twice to get a trivial normal bundle. And you will get L2 twice CP2 bar, but you need to do something else because this fantastic principle of having Z plus Z on each side now stops being true. You will have Z4 here and Z4. Have Z4 here and Z4 here. So this matching will not work. You can't do that. And so here we have to do plus additional torus surgeries. So you have these two other pairs of embedded self-intersection zero tori, and then you have to four-dimensional. Four-dimensional version of day and search, I need to kill the fundamental groups. So, first, the homology, and then you realize that you can kill the fundamental group. This is a really complicated step, unfortunately. So far, so good. And if you sort of combine all these ideas, and you take T2 cross T2 and one blow-up, and now you take one section and this braided file. And this braided fiber, and then you blow up this point and smooth here, then we get two connectors from CP2R. So this is like a fake projective plane with the reverse orientation. Again, you will still have lots of fundamental groups, so you need plus two certainties. And once again, you have to go through the yoga of computing not only the fundamentals. Computing not only the fundamental but the cyber written invariants. So, this is like almost a fake projective plane. It's not symplectic because beta plus is zero, but you can flip the orientation. You get an exotic, you get a fake projective plane, but that's not symplectic. Talking about a braided fiber, I mean this is like a vibration in two ways. See if you get when you're saying a braided fiber, it's just a multiple When you're saying the graded fiber is just a multi-section of the other fibers, yeah. So, or I don't know. I really know. It's like a point, which is like S1 cross a little disk, and then you take two points, and then you just introduce a brake. Or you can imagine that the torus covers itself twice, and then you have to convince yourself that you can do it in DT cross continuity. You can do it in Dicky Crosscutting. This is not a new trick, I should point out, that goes back to. I was wondering if, you know, that trick's that always you just turn it on its side. So you want to do it twice? Oh, just like turn your head, and that's like, you know, people are always using these grated surfaces. So you like better sections than fibers? Yeah, I think it's a good idea. But I mean they're both. I think they were created equal. That's what I'm saying, I mean in this example. Yeah, I know. It's a vibration in both ways. Yeah, so this is how I use it. It doesn't work. Okay, so how to inject fundamental. Yeah, and so to complete the theorem, so this gives you sort of these low negative definite manifolds. In order to complete the proof, you just take those and you blow them up. And of course, they have. And of course, they have vanishing cyber invariants, but not their double cover. So, you know, once you blow up here, it results twice the blow-up upstairs, and you have a blow-up formula. So, it's really a simple exercise to sort of cover all the possibilities. And if we go back to the theorem, we have many more examples, but of course, you can do the same trick by taking, instead of T2 cross T2, you take some large genus surface cross T2. Large genus surface plus P2, you will need more total surgeries, but the main principle will be the same. And so, how to change the fundamental group? And that requires a little bit of consideration so for that we use the solution. We use the so to modify pi one, apply circle sign. So here is the two ingredients. So we have X, which is simply connected, and it has a fixed point free involution. That's the one part of the input plus my Y besombology thesis. Then let's take X and we consider a circle which has this property that it's tau invariant. So tau just rotates it by 100 degrees. If you have a hard time picturing that such a circle exists, you just go downstairs and you pick the generator of the fundamental group and you just put it back. So this has the Back. So this has the property that tau sort of rotates it by 180 degrees. And we take S1 cross y and the z2 action here will be the antipodal cross the identity. So this is also a four manifold with a free z2 action. And we just take S1 cross a point here as any value. As an invariant circle, and then you have to do a little bit of a yoga. What happens in the tubular neighborhood of these circles? But you can sort of glue that together not only the two four manifolds along the boundary of the tubular neighborhood, but you can glue together the evolutions as well. So, does that make sense? So, I cut out a little tubular neighborhood, which is just S1 cross D3. I cut out a little tubular neighborhood. I cut out the little tubular neighborhood, which is also S1 cross D3. I glue them together and I patch together the orientation preserved being 3. So we get something on this x and let's call it, I will call this circle gamma. So this gamma equals gamma prime of S1 plus Y, which is not hard to see that it's actually X. To see that it's actually X connected some three manifold, where you sort of take this S1 cross y and you take this circle and you do surgery on that. So you cut out the remote of this guy and you blow back S2 plus S2. And you take the connected side. So we sort of understand this four manifold. Notice that this is not minimal in our sense, but when we want to construct these fake projective planes, These fake projective planes, they have to be minimal and not upstairs. And of course, if upstairs is minimal, then downstairs is minimal, but vice versa, it might not be true. So it can happen that this decomposes, but when we portioned out by tau, we get a thick ejective plane provided X looks like say homeomorphic to this manifold, which To this manifold, which we constructed by my pretense, you know, by so it needs a little bit of a thinking that we know what the fundamental loop upstairs here is. This is just pi one is just pi one of y. And then we go to the, we caution out, so it will be an index to subgroup in the fundamental group of the microphone downstairs, and then you have to understand. Downstairs, then you have to understand what is this group extension, and it turns out to be always trivial. So it's always Z2 times this function. So then you can use whatever you want. So for the 4m plus 2, you pick an appropriate left space. And then there are all kinds of statements you can make, like what kind of first topologies you can have. Tomologies you can have for say projective planes, you know, you can connect some sort of net spaces together, all kinds of crazy homologies. So let me just close with three questions with some results here. Give some results too that like, you know, for any three manifold group or something, you know, C2 plus any three manifold group, there that's there's some smooth four manifold, but then we don't have any errors. Yeah, I mean, for any, so for rational homology spheres. So if you take a rational homology sphere, then for the fundamental group Z to cross that fundamental group, you have infinitely many fake rejective planes. And they are all Fake retractive kinds, and they are all homeomorphic. There is no classification for those groups, but you know, homeomorphisms of these guys. You know, you can have various choices of exotic CP23 for blow-ups, and then you have to follow what happens with this homeomorphism. So they are all homeomorphic, they are all non-discomorphic. That's what we've got to get. And the three questions is, of course, the first is the symplectic. Sympletic projective planes, we don't know. I'm sure they exist, we just have no idea how to construct at this moment. The second is not a question, it's like a project. Understand their topologies better. And the third is that Third, that's the easy one. Exotic CP2. We are so close. I mean, you know, you just have to erase somehow, you know, take this sandpaper and just erase the fundamental. So, that's it. Thank you. Okay. Do we have questions for Albert? Okay, we have that. What happens if you just surger the generator of the pipeline? I mean, you don't get it. It's no longer any other changes you do. So you you I mean, but you get anything interesting? I don't know. I mean, you just surger out that circle. You just completely change the second petty number. Change the second petty number. Probably you get something, you can't say anything from John. I don't know. I mean, this is part of that, I think, right? So you would like to understand that quality a bit better. Okay. I guess I'm gonna hit the screen. There you go. Hit that button. The red one. Yeah. There you go.
