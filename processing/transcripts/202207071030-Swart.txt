So the last thing I did, last time I must tell you about this theorem, that if you take the collection of all upward paths in a narrow column configuration, you close it, you rescale it diffusively, and look at its law that converges as epsilon to zero to the law of a random compact set of parts that is called the Brown younger. And I was mainly spent And I was mainly spending time on explaining this: what this convergence precisely means. Quick recapture: if you start with the real numbers, then you can take a spectrify it by adding the points plus minus infinity. And then you can construct a squeezed space over it that we had last time, this picture of a ball. And you can look at all the positive non-empty compact subsets of the... The compact subset of the squeezed space, and then you can take a particular subset of that, which is a set of parts. And then you can look at all momentum contract subsets of the set of parts. And finally, you can look at the space of all probability measures on that. And you equip that. So you equip this one with no serial topology, then you have your squeeze. Topology, then you have the exquisite topology, you have the Hausdorff topology, induced topology, again, Hausdorff topology, and finally, cotopology of the convergence. And that's the space, and that's the topology. So, now the aim of today is to give an idea how this is proved and to understand the limiting objects. And these are sort of coalescing random walk paths that start. Random walk paths that start from every point in the even sub-lattice. And as you rescale, you should get something like colestric boundary motion starting from every point in space and time. And the tricky part is that you really want from every point in space and time, in a sense, which is uncountable. So what is actually quite easy is to construct coalescing value and oceans from countably many points, so we can just start in space-time. So my time. In space-time, so my time is always going up, and it is the space. You can take one point here and start a Brownian motion there, let it run. And you can pick another point, start a Brownian motion at some point, not hit the other one. And from that moment on, you let it coalesce, which means that this path, which is also the path that goes through infinity, just coalesces. It follows exactly the path you already have. And you can put in a third point that. That server point that was the same, so whenever you can add one point after the other, as soon as they hit, they start following that path that they have actually advanced. It's well defined. And then you can prove also fairly easily that if you look at coalescing random walks starting from finitely many points, and these points are chosen in the situation after rescaling the converse to finitely many points in the real. Finally many points in the real line plane. Then these coalescing random walks, they actually also coalesce. So that random walk converges after scaling to Brownian motion is what you all know. Now you have to be a bit careful because it's possible for two parts to do this actually. So they could have two paths that are discrete paths that sort of stay for a while very close to each other. Maybe then they can. Other, and then they go less. And so, what you have in this particular case is that actually you have something slightly stronger. You have that not only do these paths converge, but that rescaled coalescence time also converges. And that in general, if you have two paths that, you know, in this path space that converge to a limit, then the coalescence time doesn't have to converge. Converge because they could do this, right? So, this is the true coalescence prime of the approximating paths, but now as this becomes smaller and smaller, the limiting coalescence prime is easy. But if you have Brownian paths, so if you start two independent Brownian motions, then as soon as they hit, they will start to cross each other many times. And you can use it to say that, you know, if you now approximate these things with anything, local uniform. With anything unit local uniformly, then the coalescence bands must also converge. So if you take two Brownian paths that cross immunity and you now approximate them globally uniformly with any other paths, then these paths must also cross at almost immunity and therefore. Do you think in high dimension you could have something which is not convergent? As long as you have two dimensions, two brown emotions don't code. Dimensions two brown emotions don't go meet each other, right? Yeah. So, in dimensions two and more, this whole thing sort of completely breaks. The two is sort of interesting because then on books mean the grounding motions. So, grounding motions are recurrent, but on points recurrent. Okay, so let me not say more about this. I hope I have convinced you now that you can construct. This issue now that you can construct something. So, what I can do is I can choose out a set B such that A that is countable and then this construction you can also show that it actually doesn't depend on the order, it's the indistributor points that you get in the MDC point distribution all the time. Over time, and it's consistent if you remove some points, and so you can do it for finitely many, and then, of course, because it's consistent, you can apply a common border to say that you can actually construct countably many coalescing random models. So each finite subset of them has this distribution, and this is this whole countable collection. You know what law that has. There can construct quite easily coalescing down in motion. Easily coalescing down your motions started from this fixed, countable, and then safe. And now the first objective or statement is that now if you look at this collection of parts, that is pretty compact. So then the idea is to now take the closure and get a compact. Take the closure and get a compact set of parts that will be the brown number. But let's first see that it's pre-compact. So we have seen that we have last time we've seen that to be pre-compact, you have to be uniformly. So we are working in this closed thing, so compact containment is no issue. So the only thing you have to check is that these parts are equally continuous. And this formally, as we did it, you would have to. Formally, as we did, you would have to choose a metric that generates a topology of the close rigor line and then check, use the modulus of continuity with respect to that. But if you can think of how that works, it becomes really loadable. So what it means is that you must show that if you take a big box, a finite, any finite box in space-time, that here, in here, you can't make arbitrarily big jumps in arbitrarily small times. That is the continuity that you have to. That is the continuity that you have to check, and as soon as you have that, it will be pre-compact. So, how do you check that? So, you define G epsilon delta. For me, this is going to be the set of all points of the form one-third epsilon k delta m I hold. So, I put some sort of Tool, so I put some sort of final bit and let's enlarge things a bit. So, this distance now is delta, and this distance is one-third epsilon. And now the plane is so what you can always do, I mean, you can always. Can always do, I mean, you can always, this is a countable set, so without loss of generality, you can assume that it's included in this because you can just add these points, it's still countable and it's consistent. So that means that from all of these points, I have a path, a coalescing around motion that is starting there. And now I'm interested in all the others. So, I mean, this delta has many points, other points in here. And my claim is now that if Is now that if for some path in this whole big collection I have the property that p u minus that makes a jump that is big or if an epsilon while the times u and t are closer than delta to each other, then I claim that I can find a path. So let's say then I claim So let's say then I claim that there exists a point Z in this grid. So that the path that starts from this point Z must make, so let's call it, so that the path B, let's call it XS at this point. So the path started at this particular point, I called phi XS. Now actually, it must make a journey. It must make a jump immediately that is big, so that s time plus r minus x, it's the starting point, is now bigger or equal than one-third of epsilon for some where R here lies between zero and two delta. So I lose a bit and so let's see why that is. So imagine And so let's see why that is. So imagine that I have a path here, any path that makes a very big jump. So it could draw a quite extreme case. It could be something like this. Now, thank you back. So this is my eye. You see this distance here is epsilon. So this was one third of epsilon. So this has epsilon. And this time it's from here to here. Here for here, that's delta, right? So within time delta makes a jump of at least epsilon. So I've sort of here it's exactly delta, not any shorter, and it's exactly epsilon, not anymore. So it's sort of in case. And I've also put the point where this, it could do something before, this path, I don't care. And I've also put it sort of at the fairly extreme points, these two. But I claim that now I can always find. But I claim that now I can always find one point that lies, so this point here is now guaranteed to be at least epsilon over three in this direction and in this direction. I have at least one point in the grid that if it wants to go around, it has to move at least epsilon over three. And so the shortest way is here. So and it has to go around because these paths can't cross each other, right? Because they're all co- That are all coalescing clouding motions. If it would hit, it would coalesce. And so now it's forced actually to. Now, I don't know if it has to do with delta, but at least within time, within some time that is closer than two delta, it has to make this move of one-third epsilon at least. So what I can show in this way is that, you know, if there are some paths that are badly behaved, then there must be paths nearby. Then there must be parts nearby in this grid that are badly behaved. And for these things, I can have basic estimates. And also looking at the details here, you can check them in there. Note that if you have a Brownian motion, then you can check that. So this is standard Brownian motion. I look at it. Maximal absolute value between time. Maximal absolute value between time zero and time two delta motion. I ask for the probability that it is bigger than one third of epsilon. And I say that's less or equal than some constant, exponential e to another constant, and it's called epsilon squared divided by delta. You can check that. And now And now imagine that in my box, so I put here, say size T here, size T and I want to know if there is somewhere in here that is a path that makes within delta a jump of size epsilon. Then I know that at least one of these ridges points, one started Brownian motion, makes a jump of at least one third of epsilon in times two delta. two delta and now i can count and i get the probability that uh yeah that plans on path and makes a big jump in the end what you want to estimate is this and i think you can translate it in the end you can control the reversal continuity Continuity for this D. You can estimate and you get some constants. It depends on G. Then you get how many grid points there are. So that is epsilon minus one. It's of order epsilon minus one, delta minus one. And then you get for each grid point this probability. So you get. probability so you get e to the minus c actually squared delta and this for each fixed t means this hugely beats the number of these points so it is just if you send for fixed epsilon you send delta to zero this is that's the proof that this thing is really pre-compact so you can take the closure and get a compact setup Now we can define, you know, yeah, let me use notations, but in general, if I have a set of parts to my parts, I have a set of paths, so my parts here are always going up, so it's this space, paths that go up, and I have some set in the plane, maybe in the including these points at infinity, then I will write A D my notation for the set of all parts in the set whose starting point lies in this set. It would be very convenient, of course. Okay, then there's a C1 that says that there exists a compact set a random variable over you in this space, compact sets of parts. Compact sets of paths that have the following properties. First, for all points Z, the plane, almost surely, nobody said consists of a single path, and I will denote by deep paths starting in Z. The second property is then that if I pick That if I pick finitely many points, sorry, z. was the starting point of the yeah, z of five is the starting point. And five of z is the time starting at zero point. So if I pick now finitely many points, then I know that almost surely there are at least one that starts precisely one path and then I want deep. Precisely one part, and I want these parts to be distributed as coalescing value motions. And thirdly, I wondered if for each countable and then set It should be true that W is the closure of a set of parts. So, this is my notation for the set of parts that start in this D. Then I take the closure, that should give me the whole thing. That should be true. Again, almost sure. And I should say, here in point one, the proof we will get quite a bit later, but you should realize this statement. Realize this statement for all and almost sure you must put in the right order. So, if you pick a point, then you have what you wanted at that point that starts a single path. Nevertheless, we will prove that there are many points where there start more than one. This has to do with the fact that I can maybe quickly indicate. So, you can think of this function. First of all, you think that each point that starts the path. So, I can look at the function that associates. Can look at the function that associates with a point in the plane a path. But this function is not continuous. This has many jumps. If I fix T and I move in the X direction, I will see jumps. And this is actually how Vendoline Brandon and Balden Toto originally did it, and they chose a version to say, okay, I'm going to say, try it continuously. But here the idea is different. Here, the idea is we're going to have a set of parts that is compact. Have a set of parts that is compact, which means that if you now approximate such a jump from the left or from the right, in both cases, you should have a limit because your compact all the limit points are there. So it means that at such a point you will have two paths. And you can actually go further and see that if you approximate it the right way from below and above, you can actually even have three paths. We'll get to that, but it's important to realize that it's important that only for deterministic ones. Okay, so let's show. Okay, so let's show how that is proved. The first thing, of course, you do is you fix one particular countable data set and you use what we already showed at it. You can then take a close fix some debates. So d base is countable and then we just define this as the closure of D. That's okay. And now you show that it has all the properties that you want. That's basically the idea. The first thing you can notice actually is that it's true that our paths can't cross, right? You cannot have two paths that really change, but that really changes. Have two paths that really change, but with crossing, I mean actually that you have two paths cross if there exists times where they are strictly ordered one way and another time that was strictly ordered in the other way. And you can see quite easily that that is a property that is preserved under taking limits. And therefore, even after taking closure, I will still have the property that pass cannot cross each other. And the other thing is. Now, let's first try to see why it will still be true that the deterministic points you have only one path. So, what you do then, so you have a, you fix a deterministic space time point, and now you're going to approximate it from the left and right. So, you take all this x, this is x minus small, x. Small x minus epsilon x plus epsilon and then you can have i mean you you can always add some points to these deterministic setup i said so we assume that there are paths here in the original one that are already here and then they are here so here's a coalescing value in motion but if exome is small then with high probability the time i mean if it's recurs so eventually the two graphs will coalesce but this time it's very likely to be small Likely to be small. So this is T epsilon. So let's call this epsilon one. So this is T1. Now we can take a sequence of epsilons, epsilon two, that converge to zero. And for each of them, we can look. So because of non-crossing, if I take the smaller epsilon, they have to coalesce already at an earlier time. And then it's not so difficult to show that almost surely these times decrease to zero. Just basic estimates about, yes, but there's a probability grounding motion it's zero before it's a large exposure value, but it's marking here. So then you see that these parts are containing what happens here. Now, the only way for if you start here, you have a cart cross, so you have to stay between these two. Cross, so you have to stay between these two. So there's only a single path available for you. So that looks part one. Okay, so part two is very easy. I said, I mean, you just make sure that these points are not at least B because you like consistency, you can add them, and then you'll have coalescing Brownian motion. So that is basically it. The third part is now you have to show that actually That actually you have to be careful. I call the D here as well. Here it says for every, so yeah, I have to show that what I get doesn't depend on my choice of the counter. I mean in normal rights. But actually you can do it somewhat more strict. So you can so let's say that we have a set D and we have a D prime, different countable dense sets. And I want to make this construction for each of them. I want to show that what I get. For each of them, I want to show that what I get is equal in law. It is, of course, sufficient for me to construct a coupling so that they're almost surely equal. That's what I do. So, what I can do is I can construct BZ lie in B union. And then such a collection naturally contains this one and the other one as well. And then, yes, I do the niggas. Uh, yes, I do. Then I define W is the closure of all P sets in P closure and this prime is this one and W double prime. This is the closure of these sets and they can be in the union of two of now you have pick a point set in B. Instead of in Europe, then it lies and yeah, then the path that starts there certainly lies in this one, set of all things inside here, which contains actually this as well. But by what I already have proved, is that all paths in this map starting at this point, that's a singleton. There's only one path in here. And here's also only one path. So that means that these unique paths in this one that starts at Z must be the unique path in here that starts at Z. Right, so I have shown that the consequence of that is that twice that for each set in B. Z in D, it is now true that pi z is an element of go to prime. This means that this thing, this whole collection is a subset of y prime. I take the closure here, I get w. I take the closure here, that does nothing because this is already closed. So I have shown that w lies in w prime. We will try. And by second speech, I get the other one as well. So I have shown that they're almost dual equal and sequel. So that's yeah. But here, when you say w subs of w prime, you mean it for all z in w pi z. So, but okay, but it's the almost surely part. Thanks. Okay. I do it only for the counting object. Okay. For the country all set, okay. Yeah, for all sets in D, I know that this half lies in this thing, okay. And then, yeah, and then I take closures, and I show that for all sets of D, it lies in this without the closure. This is a subset of the closure on both sides. Okay, so that's this one. Um yeah and again you can uh yeah again you can actually check what I have we remember this uh squeezed face that looked like this, right? And because we have taken the closure, we have again added trivial parts, but again you can check that the only trivial parts are the same. But again, you can check that the only trivial paths that you have added are the ones that are on the time plus or minus infinity. So this W has a property that a path in it either lies entirely in the real plane or is entirely minus infinity or it's entirely plus infinity. Okay, so now let's try to understand the structure a bit more that impose duality. Because I was going to, there are points where three parts start, and first it sounds very miscarried. But there is a good way to understand this. Go back to how we approximate it. To first under that is set to like this, and then we were looking at the even sub values, right? So points. And we had for each of these. And we had for each one we chose an arrow to go to left or right. What you now can do is use the odd sublets as well and draw them, use them to draw arrows down. So I always sort of link up an econom point with the An ego point with the odd point that lies above it. And now I want to draw an arrow down that doesn't cross the other one, for which I have only one choice. So here, if this one goes like this, the other one goes like this. Let's see if it looks like this. You're missing an arrow. Which one am I missing? Here, this one? No, I meant to. Ah, here we're missing. You're right. So then I have two choices. Yes, you're right. So then I have two choices because I forgot to draw the arrows all completely right. Yeah, as you can see from this, of course, is this, or this is already outside. You can see from this, these arrows are again IID and the whole picture is actually sort of turned over under 90 degrees. Of turned over 190 degrees, it's the same picture. So, to each arrow configuration, there exists a dual arrow configuration that is equally distributed, goes down after the rotation, and it is uniquely characterized by the fact that the forward and dual arrows come across each other. And now, this thing, of course, we have a limit as well. Uh and in the limits you want to sort of characterize the so you know privately already yeah, but we haven't shown actually convergence so we're going to do things a little bit the other way around. Um yeah, I can certainly construct a dual web as well, which is just my old web, which I terminal for 180 degrees, and I will show that if I Degrees, and I will show that if I fix that one, the dual one, and what I will do the other way. I will start with the dual one and use it to immediately define the forward one. And for that definition, that's a wedge. So, this is the curly W should be a red, and the state one is a red. So, it's clear. So, a far side, I have to. So a path I have my space of downward paths. These are paths which have starting time, minus infinity, but possibly finite ending time. And then I have a path in this, so my notation later for a dual there will be a head. And a dual path, I will use a boot ahead to indicate that it's dual. So if I take two paths in the So when I take two parts in this race, I have to make sure to know that they're going down. And if I can define a wedge in the following way. So these two parts, they may or may not coalesce, but if they at some point meet, this is I one, they don't have to have the same. So let's say this one starts at a different time. At some point they meet, and after that, I actually got. And after that, I actually don't care. So let's say that they're coalescing because that would be the important case, but they could do anything at this moment. Then I define this wedge, it's going to be this open set. So it's all points that lie strictly between the two paths up to the first time they meet. So it's this thing is defined. It's this thing is defined as the set of all space time points, points t such that star is less than t is strictly less than the starting. No, now it's at the final time. Minimum and it should be true that P H P at one of t is strictly less than and x is strictly less than these space time points, but this opens without this path. And first thing to observe is that if you now look at this picture and you look at two dual parts, so we say that these are Say that these are more paths and they coalesce at some point, then a forward path cannot enter this wedge from outside. So you can't have this, because you can't cross. The other thing it can do is it can sort of sneak in from the bottom. And you could imagine that somehow they're very close at the same place and they never actually cross, but it sneaks into the bottom. But both are not possible because they actually see. Are not possible because you see that maybe these two collects and all parts can get through this point, but these two have and the idea is to use this in the lines to define the format in terms of the dual part. So let me now fix D and the D h that are both countable and dense could be the same. Then I can construct paths, forward paths starting from this V and I can all I think are emotions and I can also construct this. Construct this dual coalescing boundary motions, but I claim that I can construct them together on one probability space in such a way that Iz does not enter any wage of the form. And vice versa, the dual paths don't enter versus of the turnaround. And how do you prove that? Basically, you can prove it by finite approximation. So you can take first finitely many points for the forward, finitely many dual parts, see that they don't enter vertices. That they don't end to vertices. We know that finite collections of passing distribution converge to finite collections of coalescing clouding motions. This property is preserved. So, if you take a discrete approximation, you can say that you can actually, and then you take use consistency and get it. So, it's actually funny that it's consistent. It's not so obvious. So, you have this funny statement that if you take a brown motion like this, that you have this other one, it doesn't cross. It doesn't cross, but now I can forget about the forward one. This dual one is actually just a brownie mouse. So you can ask what is happening here. I'm not going to go into details, but this is the name right. So Sadiutz, Toad and Bernach in 2000 have studied this, and they showed actually that if you now look at the fine dimensional distributions, that if you condition on this forward path, then the path is reflected. The path is reflected of it, it is from a score of reflection. So it moves down and then it immediately reflects. So it does hit the dual one. And then the interesting thing, if you construct a forward path, a dual path and you reflect it off, but then you forget about this one, that this one is just a normal brownie motion. You don't notice at all that the forward one has been there in your construct. And if you think how you prove that, the only proof known is by this discrete approach. The only proof known is by discrete approximation. We could try to prove it directly via some clever stochastic analysis, but so far nobody has done this. Okay, so I said you can construct this, and now you can, of course, take again closes. You can use this collection of parts, you take the clothes, you get the web, you get closure. This, so you can construct now two webs. And then you can again take on the limit and show that phi this one does not enter. This thing goes to the end. Goes to the first statement I wanted to make is so let's let's first do it only for a count as a set that as I said they can certainly do it you can take these counts for collections and then later you can of course take closures but I want to show actually there are two ways to do it so I first of all before we did this we defined the plowing vertices as the closure of all Of all by set is set in the closure. I call it W minus now for some reason you'll see in a moment. There's not a construction, and that is just I'm going to look at all parts, really all in this output set of output parts, which have the property that pi does not enter the lash. The latch set one by set two for each set one and set two in this country then set. And my claim is these two are equal. So actually, I have now sort of two ways to define the Brownian web. My only Define the Brownian web, my old way, and a new way in terms of first of all that this is easy. Why is it easy? So then it means that if I take that, that is fairly easy. If I fix the wedge, so I have a fixed, I'm only looking at the Fixed, I'm only looking at the discount sets starting points on this counter. So I fixed fixed tools, I have my wedge, and now I know that all these paths don't enter it. They don't do this, and they also don't sneak into the bottom point. Now I take a closure, then I can more path, so I can take all limits of these paths, but you can easily see that if a path starts outside, I'm just entering, I should say, yeah, entering means that you start. Yeah, the entering means that you start outside the closure of the vex and you enter inside the vet. This is not entering for me, that you start on the boundary and go. So then if you're strictly outside the closure of the vet and you go into the inside, this is preserved under the limit because you have to be at least an absence from the boundary here and here. So you can see that if you take limits, it is preserved. So this is why I say this is this is this. So now let's do the other ones. It's the funny argument. So now I have a path I that lies in this W plus. So all I know about it is that it doesn't enter any wedges. I claim that it lies in here, so I claim that it can be approximated bypass starting from this country. Guide path starting from this countable tensor. So the first thing I do is I fix just finitely many times. Let's fix four of them, T1, T2, T3, and T4. And I fix some positive epsilon. And I'm trying to construct a path in this. I'm trying to find a path in this set that at least time stays within epsilon. Fixed time space within epsilon of this chosen path. And if I can do it for any finite number of paths and for any epsilon, then it's fairly easy to see that I can approximate. Because then you can take a sequence where you send these epsilons to zero, the number of points goes to infinity, but then you use the compactness to say that actually all sub-sequence must, yeah, yeah, that it's high, so every sub-sequence has a further sub-sequence that converges actually. As the further subsequent converges locally uniformly, hence you know that this thing actually converges to this one. So it's sufficient to, for every finite number of points, to find a path in here that throws an offer. So how do I find it? First of all, I take dual paths. So you can find it and choose a point close enough to this line so that the dual path crosses and goes on. And it goes on some way, and here I can do the same. But this path, this dual path, cannot cross this one because, yeah, if it would do that, then this path, together with some other one, would form a bridge, and this forward one would enter that bridge. So I know that if I start a dual path on the left, it has to stay on the left at least till this time. To stay on the left at least till this time, and I can do this. So, this is another one, I can choose one here. So, this here do the same here. So, I can this I can choose to do a class like this. And as I said, they cannot meet before this and they cannot cross because then they would create a wax that is entering. Because then they would create a wax that is entered by this path, and that contradicts the definition of this. So now I have these. I can just choose anything that points in my country, then set that lies between these two before time t1. So somewhere in here, I choose a point in my country of that set D. And now the forward path cannot cross these dual bonds. So it has to stay between them and it's forced to stay within epsilon. Them and it's forced to stay within epsilon distance. And since I can do this for every epsilon, every finite number of points, so now I have constructed a z with z d that is close to that, and I can take the limit and show the other equation. And this is very convenient to have. So now I can actually grow convergence over here and browse. Curves in your boundary, which will stay in the big scale. I'll pull actually a bit more. So I'll do a slightly from the statement. I say that I can construct in my parallel configuration, I construct all parts. I take the closure, but I also do that. So, take the closure, but I also do a dual parts. So, this is a whole collection of dual collecting parts in dual arrow configuration. I rescale everything. Epsilon and I say that converges as epsilon things to zero to two compact sets, which are the web and web. And uh so how do you do that? Well, the first thing you have to show, and you have to show tightness of these things. So you have to show that you can get and that is actually very similar to the proof that I showed you that. That I showed you that this collection is pre-complex. And it's a bit more technical, I'm going to skip it, but it's using the same sort of ideas to show that these parts, if you send epsilon to zero, they can't make big jumps, hence their laws are tight. Hence, I know that it's a fair system to show that so I can choose a sub-sequence that converges and needs to show that all sub-sequential limits are equal in law and that. Equal in law, and then there it is. And then so I choose such a sub-sequence, I choose x to n zero so that these things converge in law, but now I can use a scalar hot representation theorem so that I cannot only get convergence in law, but I can make a coupling for every n, so that it's actually almost sure. So that it's actually almost dual convergence. This is a very convenient thing to have. So now I'm going to use that topic as I said. So I can, so for each set in my set P, I choose some approximating Z N in the even thing so that if I scale, then I go to Z. Then I go to z and I have to define by n of z to be the rescale star starting at this point. So the discrete, this is the discrete one. Maybe I should have excited at this second. So this is the new and rescale. So this is And we scaled it. So, this is so now I have for each point in this, I have an approximating sequence of discrete parts. And I can do this in such a way that I can score hot so that this pi and z converges to pi z almost surely for all sets in the and I can just also for all in a dual way I can also do that. So for all, do all things almost slowly. And it can also arrange things in such a way that coalescence times also converge almost slowly. And can of the same volume. Make everything go almost in the For a graph content almost surely. How do I go on? Okay. So now I also have this tightness that I said. So now I can go even further on. I can also use this tightness to again use the problem to say, well, then this thing goes on. I can construct it in such a way, but now also this. This should also converge to something on a push or let's call it B and B H and these are compact sets of points because I have tightness so I just want to make this almost sure okay so everything is almost sure and now I claim I just erase it minus Mine has I have very easily this product. This is filier because of this, right? So every for every set in D, I have an approximating sequence of discrete parts. So every part of this formula set in D must lie in this set. And then by taking closure, which is also closed, I know that this whole thing, which is the closest. This whole thing, which is the closure of these things, must be contained in here. But they also very easily get this inclusion. Um, because I know that if I have a yeah, so I know that if I have a path in here, then that is a limit of paths in here. That was the definition of this, uh, the Hausworld topology. The Hausworth topology, the conversion criterion. So there are the paths in here that approximate this one. But then these ones do not enter edges here. And I can take the limit and say that they also don't enter ledges here. So I know that this path cannot enter ledges of this one. So I mean, no, actually, I only want to do it for the counter demand. So I only need to show the definition. This would define only as fast as I do not enter. As fast that do not enter, where you started from this deterministic that I get by building. Yeah, so I get this both, and now I've just shown that these two are equal, so I have convergence. That's the proof. So I have about a bit more than five minutes, I could say. So let's do a few properties still of the battery. Now I have really constructed something like collapsing Brownian motions, starting from every point in space and time. And one thing I can do is ask, so in particular, I can fix the time and everything zero. I'm going to go start there. So I'm going to go to the i zero zero. So these are sort of coalescing value functions for every point in A, where A is a closed subset of the real line. And in particular, I can look at all paths starting everywhere. And I claim that for now, if I look. And I claim that now, if I look at this set, so that this, I claim that this set actually, even though A means maybe the whole real line, at each positive time, this is a locally finite set. And it suffices to check that to start in the whole real line by monotonicity, claim that the expected number of points in a finite interval is exactly b minus a. Exactly, B minus A square root of T. And I do prove that quickly, the first thing you do is want to know, so I give you the fact time zero or give you time T and here you have the points A and B. So let's first ask, is that at all a path in the web? It starts at time zero and passes between. It starts at time zero and passes between these two. I claim that is equivalent to saying, well, I'm looking at the dual paths. I'm looking at start my dual path here and dual path here. In this case, there will be one because any path in the forward one that starts between here has to stay between, no path between. On the other hand, if these two meet fitly before, then they create a Then they create a wedge and nothing can go. So this is the equivalent. And if you use that, then you can, if you now want to know the number of points here, you can cut this into small pieces and do the calculation for each small piece, send the epsilon to zero and put this in. Because you have a good you you have very good control and the probability that how the motions meet each other in an explicit form by the reflection. Explicit form by the reflection. So that means that this thing, although it's uh it sort of comes down from infinity and yeah, let me do the final thing, which is convincing. Is convincing you that there are points there are three parts. Thank you. That's the most important calculation, somehow we need to assume that you could have at most one path at a very small interval, as epsilon goes to zero. I was also worried about this. But this is a bit I won't do it now because we must. I won't do it now because we will spend 10 minutes on the internet. So I'll trust you. But if you look in the lecture notes, which are on my home page, then you can find a precise proof of your interest. So I'm claiming that actually, so I cannot ask, so I said that typically I think I make a deterministic point, that there is just one path starting there, and of course there's also one path. And of course, there's also one path, your path starting there. But I'm claiming that there are also points where you have two paths starting, and you have even points where there are three starting. And I also claim that you have sort of funny points where the path passes through and then another path starts there. True, and then another path starts there. So, let me explain why this is true. So, first of all, some things that are obvious: you have paths where the path passes through the line. These are clearly there. You have points where this happens. But now, if you think of the dual paths, if I start a dual path here on the left, it cannot cross this one. And here's um and if I take two on each side, they cannot coalesce because of the weight. Cannot coalesce because of the weights. Now I can take epsilon to zero and say I'm compact, there must be a subsequential limit. What can that subsequent limit do? It can't be anything else than that there is a dual path here. There is a dual path at that point, right now, and the limit is at that point, and they don't meet up to this time. So you have the dual picture must be like this. And now I also know that there are actually points. That are actually points where two paths meet. Even I think about the dual picture, these paths separate the dual ones, so the dual picture is like this. And what you actually realize is that these mysterious points in the dual picture look very simple. And the final thing that you know is there are, I said that if you look at a single neural path and if you fix a forward path, then you start to... And if you fix a forward path, then you start a dual path, then the dual path doesn't know because different disjoint parts of space-time are independent. So as long as it doesn't hit one, it doesn't feel it. So it must hit it. There's a point in the center doing sort of reflection. So anyway, there are points where the rule path hits the forward path and goes on in something. And now if you again think about the picture mark, there must be another rule path on this side. On this side, that again by the same idea. So, and similarly, in the forward picture, this and this is sort of very similar. These two are the operational differences. And these points are then called the this is a classification of points, so this is called the point of type 0, 1, which means there are 0. Which means there are zero light paths coming in, and there's only one going out. This is type one, which is two, one. And this is called one to right, which means there's one coming in, two out, and the incoming path continues on the right. This is then a one to left path. This is the zero three. This is the 03 and a 02. And then there is a theorem that every point in the space-time must be a one-long status. You don't have anything. But there's a deterministic answer like this. Now, if I fix a time, a deterministic time, then actually I claim that all points are of these three points. Well, definitely at the deterministic time you will see these things crossing. See these things crossing, and so these must be there, then by the relative is one as well. But then you can check that. So, this certainly doesn't happen. So, Brownian portions meet exactly at the deterministic time. And you can check that this also doesn't. Yeah, this also doesn't happen because it means that a forward and new path would have to meet exactly at the deterministic time. So Okay. I don't feel slightly handsome. You are certainly doing that.  Or any thought of doing specification of points. Okay, thank you very much.
