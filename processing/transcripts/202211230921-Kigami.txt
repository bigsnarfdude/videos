And we know the asymptotic behavior of the heat canals possibly. I think the behavior of the heat panel and the spectrum of the applicant. So So, and so, in this case, you know, the domain of the delegation reform associated with this degree of process should be some kind of uh some kind of W1 sort of space, you know. World of space. I hope that. And so, let me talk about superhero spaces on Euclidean spaces. And you have seen the same equation before. And so I have nothing to add. So ordinarily we we have the you know pump here. Like E P U B is the you know the defined by this integral. By this integral, and Epu is the p-energy of the ordinary function. It's defined by mapra u to the p here. And one piece of space is defined the function which is in L P and this energy is finite. So naturally, you know, people have think about, so how about the cases? So, how about the cases of metal dispatches? And the first answer is: so, what is the counterpart of this NABRAF? And the natural answer was, so for rip sheet functions, this, you know, the up this one, you know, this row, you know, rip sheet, you know, you know, constant. It uh should be a counterpart of, you know, Should be a counterpart of the gradient. So there is some generalization with this notion, which is called apagradient. And you have seen this many times in the former talks. And so using the notion of apagradiant, you can define a kind of p-energy here. And based on this idea, you know, there are several. There are several works by Haiwus and Chiga and Negas. There are several type spaces. And the definitions are a little bit different, but it is known that if we are dealing with a nice space, then those three spaces are the same. And so, and you know, we have seen the many nice spaces. you know, we have seen the many nice result on you know those solar spaces. And but why I want uh another construction. So the reason is where just from home I work with the mentor. You know, you have already had you know now taka talk and you know and that is if you have a you know nice regular local dish report here. Nice one. And then, you know, there is a heat kernel. But the heat kernel changes when you change the metric and measure here. And this exponent of beta depends on metric and measure. So what they have done is: so if you change the metric and measure in a conformal way, In a conformal way, I mean that D is cardiac conformal to the original one and mu has a boring double property with respect to D, and take an intimate, then they found that this intimate is true. And also, what Nautaka told us is for Shiropinski carpet, this intim is not pate, so it's never true. Okay, and that's the work for And but the work for the Shimpinski gasket actually is bad. And so why this is terrible? Because so the, you know, under the nice situation of the, you know, so the, you know, formal definition of so-world spaces, actually, so if they have, it has a, you know, the, it is a language reform, you know, for the case of P or Z, if it is a, you know, Langular. 2. If it is a regular DC reform, then the heat cannot estimate should be Gaussian. So beta should be 2. So that means for the 60 cupboard, you know, no matter how you change the metric and measure, the domain of the distribution form never equals the, you know, H12SC D to the metric. DJ meet Judah. So, so, you know, that's why I want to construct some new software space where the W12 equals this, you know, domain of the division. And, but actually, you know, in the case of Shierpinski gasket, you know, so then if you properly change. If you pro properly change the the metric meta, then we can apply the chivalrous. And for me, I thought, you know, this is the general situation, and so we can use, if you change the metric of the measure, then we can always use this, you know, the Riga or a Newtonian space. But my my conjecture was wrong. And there are lots of examples where, no, zoo is not a thing. So it's not okay. So what is my idea? And this is very naive idea. You know, this is very elementary fact. You see? If you have a function f on the interval, and if you think about this, you know, some, you know, to the p, so I define this as ENPF. This is the kind of distance. This is the kind of discrete of P energy, P i. And if you scale this E and P by 2, P minus 1, 2 to the P minus 1 to the N, and take a limit, then you have this P energy of the limit. So this is my naive idea. So that's what I will do. My idea. Will do, my idea is that, okay, let's have a, you know, think about a compact metal space. And what we did here is, you know, approximate the long interval by the discrete graph and using the discrete energy here and taking a scaling an image. So, and so, okay, so in general, we have a component. Okay, so in general, we have a compact metric space and take some good discrete approximation by finite graph and think about the discrete energy here. And the problem is, well, are there any good sigma which is scaling constant here? And this well, this you know discrete scaling limit of discrete energy is convergent. Well this is convergent. Well, this convergent means, you know, there are many meanings, but uh as n to the infinity, and such a function uh has a rich structure. That is my question here. And I want to emphasize that you know we will not care about the existence of the gradient, so we will forget the gradient, but think about the p-energy, convergence of the p-energy. And my purpose is first, so when in general this strategy works, what kind of metric space this strategy works? I want to seek a general condition. What we get as a new example, okay? So we we eventually know that the Sielpinski carpet is, you know, we. Carpet is, you know, we can work the strategy works, but I want to have a new kind of network case. And oh, this is an example of the rough approximation for the case of C15 carbon. And so, actually, for P equals, you know, the construction of the Brownian motion on the GPS key carpet was fast. But first done by Barrow and the bus, and they used the scaling limit of Brownian motion. But afterwards, Husslow actually, you know, shows that comparisons of two energies. So that this corresponds to the peak or two case of my strategy. And they got a local regular judicial reform on two-dimensional judicial. On two-dimensional generalized copies. And my work is, in a sense, the generalization of tools work or general P. And my new example is like this one or this one. So, you know, this one is, there is no global symmetry and that. Actually, I like this video, but it's kind of, you know, exotic. Kind of exotic structure. It is still a self-stimulation, but there is no global symmetry. And this one, this one is called Shieropinski Cross. I call it this cloth, but somebody called this Shieropinski Greybeard. I don't know which one is a good name for this. But anyway, so you know, this. So, you know, these are the two different scales. And at that time, I wrote the paper and I submitted it. This was a new example, but afterwards, yesterday, she's been told that he has, in a sense, generalized this type of shape. And also, you had another interesting work in this election for people, too, isn't it? They know, you know, and concerning carpets by Carop and he told about it. So, the first I should do is find discrete approximation of space. And my idea is convective division of space. Okay, so I call it. So I call it the partition, but it is, you know, almost the same as the dyadic fields, which is, you know, known in the harmonic analysis. And what I will do is, so first, I have the four space here. Don't know why this doesn't work, but anyway. So this is the fourth space. And first I will divide this space. You know, this is zero nebula. You know, this is zero level. At one level, I will divide this space into the finite number of subsets. And the next level, I will divide each of these by finite number of spaces. And so, first I will attach the symbol P here, and then this is 1, 2, 3, plus T1 is 1, 2, 3. 1 is 123 and next level, you know, under K1, we have 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3. And this means, this means, you know, 11, 1, 2, 1, 3 are kind of children of one. So, and in this way, you know, I will keep going with this, you know, division of the space. And, okay, this is. Okay. And okay, this is the the case of carpet. And for the you know, celestial acid, this kind of partition is very natural, you know. So you have first eight pieces here, and then you will divide each piece in, you know, eight pieces. Okay. And so what's the, you know, how I can introduce the graph structure here. Structure here on this partition. That is simply, I will, you know, have H, I will put H when two pieces have an intersection. So like, you know, in this case, this is the T1 path level. So one and two have an intersection like here. So I put this H. H here. And so. Oh, yeah. Also, so this is vertices and this is edges. Yeah, sorry, sorry. So each piece of partition corresponds to the vertices. And the second view, as you see, I have this graph here. So, and I will assume that in this case, in today's talk, In this case, in today's talk, Xt is connected. Because I want to, for P equals 2, I want to construct a diffusion process. And so that if X is connected, then this graph is always connected. So next I will introduce some neighborhood and notions. Or notion of a neighborhood on this graph. And so this one was not work. It's just work. Anyway, so let's see. So the okay, so this figure is, you know, the imitating the You know, the imitating the Shippinski-Cupid case, but the notion of rho n is a graph distance of E n, T n, E n star. That means in this case, this one and this one, the graph distance is the minimum steps to go from here to here. Okay, and so that it is one. One, two, three, I suppose. Yeah. So, so in this way, this is the graph distance. And so, this gamma M W is M neighbor of W. So, for example here, you know, we have W here and this is one neighborhood, this blue region. This blue region is a one neighborhood. And here's B here, and this red region is a gamma 2 double. And next, what I will do is, okay, pick up a point X and I will construct a kind of neighborhood based on this, you know, very structure. And that is, you know, you just choose every. Choose every piece, Kw and take a union of the gamma Fw or every B. I mean that, you know, for example, this X here, this X here, has a, you know, belong to these three P's. And think about, you know, every one neighborhood of this. No, one neighborhood of this is like this, and one neighborhood. Is like this, and one neighborhood of this is like this, and one neighborhood of this is like this. So that's taking a union. You know, this is a kind of neighborhood of x at this scale. In the formula you wrote for that, should it be K V, not K W? Sorry, I meant to ask the last time I saw this slide. I think so, but that that one should be K V, right? K. Here? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. KV. Okay. Yeah, so sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you, you, you, yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah. Well, here I have a typos. Well, the number of typos is monotonically decreasing, but never zero. So this is a universal zero. I suppose. Okay. Okay? So, you know, of course I need some assumption. Okay? So, yes, this neighborhood, my assumption is this neighborhood constructed from the graph structure is actually can be compared with actual whole with this distant thing. This is my assumption. And I will work under this assumption. And also, there exists mu, which is a very regular problem with image. Which is a volume regular probability measure on x t, and which has a volume double probability. Okay, this is this I I need this assumption. And under these assumptions, you know, I will, you know, you know, define the energy of the function f. So, you know, I take some subset of tn okay and then so energy of the function. So energy of the function f energy of the function f in this A is just the sum of these differences over the edges which belong to A. This is the partial energy. And next, what I will do is, you know, define the peak conductance between two subsets. Okay, so this edge is a subset. This A is a subset of TN, like this one. So, this is the MS level and take two subsets, A1 and A2 here. And what I will do is, okay, divide these pieces for the M states. So that I will think N plus M energy. And put the, you know, the value 1. The body one here and zero here. And think about the inman of the P energy for all those functions which are one and zero line. And of course, this value depends on m. So, and you know, I suppose that you know the behavior of this EPM. Of this EPM with redx to M will show some scaling constant. And there are two key constants in my talk. And the first one is the conductance constant. And that is, you know, defined in this way. So pick up any W and think about the M. And think about the M, you know, complement of M neighborhood. I mean that this is a complement of one neighbor here. And divide this region for the M steps. And think about the conductors between this piece and the compute. So this is the EMPM. And take a supremum of this one all over the entire. All over the W. Okay. And so this EMP is a key concept here. And actually, so yesterday Martha told about the classical theatre's work. And actually, I will put it in this way. So now about EMPM plus M. We can show that the We have we can show that this satisfies some you know sub-multiplicative inequality like this one and some multiple inequality implies the existence of this limit and this limit I denote it by R sub k and and I I showed that this R p is continuous and monotonically non increasing. Increasing. So, and the important fact is if this line, when this line has hit this value one here, this is R43 dimension. So, this is essentially the work by Karasko Piacho. So, and so naturally, you know, so the You know, so my strategy is to normalize the p-energy. And the normalized constant is, you know, this sigma p here. Okay? Should be. And if you look at this relation, so if my strategy works, so the, you know, R sports may lack multi-mention and soft space has very natural dimension. Very job. Okay. So, should. And the second one is, so, okay. I will finish by 10. Yeah. And the second constant I need is neighbor disparity constant. And this is a variant of Bank constant. And for the case of P equals 2, this was introduced by Kusokan Sor. By Kusoka and Soro. And what I want to do is: okay, let's pick up any, you know, that pair of H from E N star, like, you know, these two, W and B, and divide it into the further nth level. And think about the function on this final level. And take, you know, this is average over here, and this is average. Over here, and this is a rate over here. And take a difference to the P divided by this, you know, NFT. And, you know, and take the sufferer all over the function f and take a suffrum all over WB in all the 80s. And then again take a suffering all over N. So this is called, I call this a neighbor dis. I call it this neighbor disparity concept because the value of the neighbors is how different. And the proportion, general proportion is, you see that this is the conductance constant and this is the neighborhood by the constant. And this product is always uniformly larger than zero. Than zero. So, this I can get free. And the condition for the success of my strategy is that the other direction is also true. This is condition. I have to check. And why this is called homogeneity. Because under this P contact p homogeneity. P contact P commodity, this condition. So we find sigma P, and that sigma P is actually this one. And that, you know, for any W, E M P W behaves like sigma p to the minus n. This Shiwa and Shi to a uniform of constant. And sigma p and m behaves like sigma p to the n. And Xi Wan Shi2 is a uniform of constant. And she one, she two is a unit of constant. So this means under this condition, this two constants behave very homogeneously. So I call this homogeneity. And so what, and when we have a, you know, the P conductive homogeneity, so what I will get is that, you know, and in this case, assume I only get the result. Well, I only get the result for P larger than the actual circular component momentum. Okay? And if X T is P conductively homogeneous, then call any F in L P, define that this unormalized energy of the supram all over M and define this as N P F. And define WP as a WP as a correction of the whole LP function, where this NPF is finite. Then, this NP is actually a seminal of WP, and NPF equals zero means F is a constant function. And secondly, this WP and Lp norm plus this same norm is a reflective ball space. And actually, reflectivity is. And actually, if reactivity is due to real estimate. And so, in this regime, WP is contained in the continuous functions, and this inclusion is continuous. And moreover, if you divide fx minus fy to the p by n p f and taking a supreme all over f, then this is, you know, behaves like d. You know, behave like dxy. This is the original method to the tau p. So this is, and so this is, and I propose this is, you know, the source case we want, I want it. And for case p equals, and in this case, if you know, uh, you know, alpha sigma component is less than. Dimension is less than 2 and x d is true conductive homogeneous. Then, you know, I can replace this n by w e2, which is, of course, equivalent to n2, and which is so-called the resistance form. And this is becomes a local regular judicial form, and we have a nice heat to current estimate for free. Estimate for free. And so the problem is, one one of the the open problem is, so what happened for, you know, P is equal or less than an alpha cereal component? And so far, I know that, you know, this is a serial band space, and W is a tense subset of L T, but But you know, I want to know that this intersection is dense in CK or this intersection is dense in here or you have an elliptic Hanach principle of the Hamach function with respect to this energy. But this is work in progress by Massa and Debyevskaya. Okay, so the APSs. Yeah. And you know, so my conjecture is, I said before that so my construction, this construction of source phases closely related to this alpha sphere of what measure. And that means my conjecture is, you know, the source phase. So so well where I I may not call it this sort of phase, but whatever it is, is included in CK. Included in CK, if and only if you know T is larger than this, R was real of multiple menu. And I know this direction. This direction is not known, but I suppose it's included in the work. But you only deal with self-c carpets, so I don't know what generators. Sorry. Did you prove that the space was Did you prove that the space for the provider should exist? No, no, no, but so so I will talk about it as an open forum, but in the case of Ushikin's carpet, again, real sketchimits show not in general, yeah. And so you see, so this alpha's real concomitant dimension, you know the ordinary software embedded server. So ordinary software embedded. So, ordinary so-called embedded theorem, when this happens, is at the dimension of n. So, you know, so in this theorem, so the ordinary R to the n of n is replaced by the r for sigma form. And, you know, so what is what is so how to show So, how to show the conductive homogeneity? And this is a given condition for the conductive homogeneity for P rather than dimension R for silica dimension. As I say, I want some general criterion for my strategy success. And this condition says, okay, let's choose any. Says, okay, let's choose any W, child, and W, well, independently. And on this side, think about the conductance. Here, this is one, but you know, in general, the M conductance, and divided further M states. And in this side, okay, go further taste level and pick up any U and B. Pick up any U and B here, then the conductance between this and this at M's further level and the conductance here can be compared. But the constant here is not dependent on M but depends only on K. And that is, you know, the well actually equivalent condition of P conductive quantity. Conducted continuity. And if you look at this condition, so you notice that there is no, you know, Siguma MPM. I mean, there were, you know, never disparity concepts, but never disparity constant doesn't appear here. So that, you know, the conductive homogeneity is only determined by the conductive conductive constant. That's why I call this conductive homogeneity. Conductive homogeneity. And actually, this condition is a distant offspring of the night move condition in Barova's paper and Kusokato's paper. And well, there is a little connection. We no longer see any nitrogen here. But anyway, so. But anyway, so it's closely related to KM, and I call Knight Group. And next three minutes? Four minutes, okay. I gave one minute, okay. That's very nice. Okay, so the problem is: okay, then when I can show the night move condition, and well, let's say for salesman assets and the And you know, my only tool is to use a combinator of your modulus, I borrowed Reiner. And actually, so this notion was introduced much at his talk. And the fact is, actually, P modulus between passes between two sets is comparable with the P conductors between two sets in general. Serve set, okay, in general. So that if we want to prove something about p conductance, you can prove something for modulus, p modulus. And well, I don't have enough time to explain the details, but I will jump to the examples where I can show the conductive homogeneity. And okay, okay, this one. So the key properties. So the key properties are the local symmetry plus some global symmetry. And look at this one. This line not has no you know less symmetry than the D4 symmetry, but this has you know rotational symmetry. So that we have, you know, we can change this direction to this direction by global symmetry. And global symmetry means if you look at this piece and this piece, then it has This piece, then it has the symmetry over this boundary line. And this has the same one, but in this case, symmetry is with respect to this one, so that we can change the vertical direction and horizontal direction. And so the higher dimensional shift is the carpet. But in that case, I don't know the alpha circle component dimensional results were not many nodes. Maybe not. And so that I can't construct this way from, but still I can construct some sort of spaces for P that has an upper post-figure of the medium. And I say, I just said, some growers may be, but next one I say, well, it is okay, still okay if you don't have If you don't have any global symmetry, like this one. But this case, where I choose the value of m here, I mean that this is how large you should take the neighborhood. And in such a case, you should take the size of the neighborhood, quite large. And so no global security. But still we need local. But still we need local similar. And the next one is, these are the square-based ones. And the next one is a polygon-based one. And actually, I think that these two examples are included in the Nacao's release paper. And this is the Pentagon-based selection of self-somehow I call it Chris. Somehow I call it a Christmas star day. And this is a famous octocar. And this is the final example. But, you know, this is the octagon, but this shape, you know, I added these center pieces so that, you know, this shape has the only D4 shin metal. Shin metal is a square. You know, this shin metal. And this sh And this she went to look. And even no symmetry of the, you know. So, you know, I have these examples, and so this is the end of the talk. Am I a bit lucky? There are any questions? Got that. Oh yes yes of course uh partition yeah initial choose partition but there is some robustness of the the you know choosing the the partition so you can change the partition in some kind of you know the regular way then you don't change the you know the the constant The you know the constant and the sigma p and our key. And even if you change so it's taking both numbers, you can maybe kind of, you know, the covering by the by some balls. And so that's, you know, you you can of course have the same theory as this. And that also works. And that also works. I I suppose, yes. So I I know those two people know it, you know. Master it's it's okay. Yeah, yeah, well, even if I extend the, you know, the partition by the, you know, covering by bones, it's it's it's the same story. But you know, uh I'm from the the world of the self-singer set and for me The self-semier set, and for me, the distribution was more natural and more easy, it's a highway. This construction, you can do it also on non-fractals. Normal fractals, yes. As long as they have a p-conductive point in ID. What this conductivity means. Because you know, this construction is, you know, some similar maybe corner shows. Maybe something becomes local. And I would say that you watch at least gamma converges always to something and see. So this conductance is saying what? Because I assume that it's saying something like one karma point, something like that, because you have a heat of an yeah, in particular p equals two. And well, I I just checked that for the ordinary, you know, the two are n. For example, the higher dimensional cubes, this theory and the ordinary theory is exactly the same. But the other examples, I don't know. And I strongly suspect that for the case where the ordinary theory of the Newtonian space works, then it is the same. So then it is the same thing. But I have no proof. I hope somebody tries to see what happened. And so this theory just behind. I have just studied this and so I know very little. I guess Padris and Patrice, yeah, you have something with the construction box using the Yeah, I'm actually using correlation. So, yeah, so some his you know question is related and I will sh show you this again at my well another time. I hope I will get some programming sessions. Programme sessions. Yeah, yeah. So I have several open programs and also, you know, so is this P conducted from United? How should she also conduct it from the United Podis one? Well, I know very little and there are so many questions. Any other questions? Any other questions? If not, let's thank June again. And WIA at a coffee break will reconvene at 10:40 for the next three years.  This one is okay, but I've read that one before. So you can pizza. I guess you could because the one who's I for example. Yeah, exactly. So I'm thinking what we have done. I know what's based on fixed stuff. What about the opposite process? Okay, let's do this technology. Let's do this type of test. Yeah, let's go. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think it was. Yeah, that's mostly better. That's what the party does. So you can take that.
