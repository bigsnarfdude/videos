The title I'm going to talk today is Mechanobiology of the Liver Regeneration and Reconstruction. So first, let's review a little bit about the physiology of the liver, which is the largest internal organ in the human body. Have the two block supply. One is a portal win cost about the seventy five percent. 75% of the blood supply, and other is hepatic artery, which costs the remaining 25%. So the basic unit of the liver is sort of the liver lobule, which looks like a hexagodor shape, in which the radio direction microvessel, which was called the hepatic sinusoidal, it's a main site for the nutrient supply. For the nutrient supply. Here we have the liver and the little cell, which has different kinds of pores we call the fallostral, which is a diameter about 50 to 200 nanometer. On the top of the endothelium, which is the cofercel, which is kind of the embryotic derived macrophage. Underneath is a sectary cell, looks like the muscle. Cell looks like the smooth muscle cell, and the main body of the cells is sort of the pesochemia cell, is hepatocytes. So my draw the cartoon to illustrate the mechanical microenvironment inside a single liver sinusoidal, plus four types of cells, and also the blood flow. Not only the blood flow is in mainstream, Blood flowing mainstream in the diverse musoidal bow also, so they have a kind of the interstitial flow in this gap. We call it the space of this, this gap, which is very flow, very slow flow. So another important mechanical factor is a stiffness, which means that when the liver starts from the hepatitis to the fibrosis to cirrhosis. To the fibrosis, to cirrhosis, the stiffness of tissue goes up to tenfold higher compared with the normal values. So, those two main mechanical factors is the key points we are looking for in our labs. So, come back to the topic of this symposium or workshop, we first look at the mechanical issue. So, sort of, have we already quantified the mechanics of the liver? Without the mechanics of the liver, the answer is no. So, if you look at the literature, of course, we can get different types of the numbers from literature, including tissue stiffness, start from the normal 140 Pascal up to the 1.2 mega Pascal for the in virtual engineering reconstruction. For the shear stress, we start from 0.01 up to the 49%. Up to the 40 diameter per square centimeter. Even if you look at institutions flow, we don't have experimental data because the gap is very narrow, one to two micron, the flow is very slow. So it's hard to do the measurement experimentally. So all this type of issues are not accurately quantified, no absent of the data, as well as we can do. As well as we can do only single factor test, how to do the investigation for combined factor big example shear stress plus tissue stiffness. So we start from very beginning. I'm not very mathematical people or the modeling people, but we have to go back because we don't have data. So first we go back to the 2017, we just 2017, we just started to do the hemodynamics analysis in liver lobial. The size is about one millimeter down to several hundred micrometer. So we use a very simple model, looks to mimic the geometry of the liver lobule, which is a prism-like with a 3 to 8H and the discontinuously capillary, which is a sinusoidal, and also print of the folestule as well as. Of the flash troll as well as the high disk gap. So, taking all the factors together, we want to ask how the flow mechanics like the pressure and velocity look like in the liver's lobules under physical or pathological conditions. So, just with a very simple modeling, you say just assume this globular is the forest media. Meteor just solve the equation dash flow. I'm not good to very detail to the mathematics and the modeling. So from there one, we can mimic the flow hemodynamics for the normal condition as well as the pathological condition, such as the fibrotic or serotic levels. So, secondly, we go down a little bit. So secondly, we go down a little bit to the little bit low scales up to the several tens micrometer to 100 micrometer. We use a single sinusoidal. We built up in virtual and sinusoidal soil model, try to understand how to replicate the diverse microenvironment, especially the three, the two layer and four type of Layer and four types of cells structures in the individual microfluidic chips. This work has been done by Dr. Yuidu. He's in the audience a couple of years ago. So from that on, we also do the simulations, try to apply the computational flow mechanics simulation as well as the particle tracking. The velocimetries to visualize the flow mechanics inside the microchips. We can also easily look at this flow streamline as well as the flow inside the blood chips or underneath the gaps. The point is the data from the PIV. Be this second level as and also this kind of the universal sinusoid is complicated because the size varies significantly. So we do kind of the parametric optimization in this sinusoidal chip, including quantify the correlation between the diversity of the channel geometry, membrane probability, as well as to check out the route flow features. Check out the route flow features inside this kind of chips, which can be used to mimic physiological flow invisible. Here, for the modeling here, I just employed immersed boundary methods simulation to solve the equation not only the Daesh flow, but also the momentary conservative equation as well as the continuity equation for the flow mechanics. Finally, get the Mechanics. Finally, get the picture of the pressure drop and shear stress inside a single chip or the single single soil. Again, we further go down a little bit on lower scale to the cell, a few micron. For example, we check how the cell, including leukocyte, as well as the circulating tumor cell, trafficking inside the sinusoidal. Trafficking inside the sinusoidal, we try to understand the liver sinusoidal unique environment, they affect the flow behaviors as well as the cell deformability. So we take into account the plasma penetration, metabolic exchange, and mechanical environment into account to try to get the full picture of how the CL moves through the. This cell moves through the very relateral size comparable micro sinusoidal. Here, for the modeling, here, we just add one more terms, which is the mechanics of the leukocyte, including the cell stretching, bending, as well as the error construct into the above equations to do the kind of the liquid. do the kind of the liquid solid coupling analyze. So all of this modeling try to give us an idea, say how the mechanics or flow mechanics, cell deformability looks like inside a liver and solosodal under the pathological or physiological shear flow. So of course now we are doing one more We are doing one more experiment to use the MOS level to visualize the particle movement inside the real level and finally compare with the data from this numerical simulations. So with this, when we have this kind of idea about what mechanical parameters in vivo are even in virtual, and then we can. In virtual, and then we can ask the next question about biological question. Here, I'll give the two examples if I have time. So, first example is about the mechanical stretch. How to mechanical stretch initiate or mediate liver regeneration? This paper is just published two months ago, just record the mechanical cry from the mechanical stretch. Uh, from the mechanical stretch. Um, the idea is came from the uh kind of the surgery in the liver we call the partial uh hypotectomy, which means a partial cutoff of the liver, which is a good model for a physiologist or physician to understand how the liver regeneration enable. Once the liver cut off, for example, one-third or two-thirds, the liver can easily recover. The liver can easily recover in a very short time, several weeks, invisible in the human body. So, after the liver cotting, the blood flow should be redistributed. If you look at the literature, we find that the partial cotton, we call the PHX, can dilute the sinusoidal diameter up to 20%. As well as we have the four or four. The uh four or three or four uh foot higher shear flow, which means higher shear stress. So, also the feature of this sort of kind of mechanical stimuli compared with the chemical stimuli, our mechanical stimuli are very directly embedded and dramatic. So, the questions are whether stretch can prove promotes expression of the generation factors. Of the generation factors, especially in the lumen phase of the blood vessel, I mean sinusoidal and the zelda cells. So the issue we are going to ask is to whether the mechanical stretch induce the expression of one kind of this growth factor we call the hyperin binding epithelial growth factor we call shortly HBHF in HS. HF in HS and Z here. The second we are going to ask is what's the underlying mechanism of the HBA HF expression induced by the stretch? So the aim of this kind of the study is try to understand the correlation between mechanical and chemical groups as well as the correlation with the non-pesochemical cell, which is the three types of cell here, and also the pesochemia cell, which is the Also, the pesochemia cell, which is a hepatocytes here. So, we start from the invaluable study to look at the surgery for the mice. If you do the one-third or two-thirds of POTX up to the 72 hours, the liver body weight goes down quickly and goes up. The higher the cutoff amplitude, the quicker the recovery of the liver. The recovery of the liver mass. Also, if you look at the diameter of the blood vessel, this is the central vessel, they goes up with the amplitude of the PHX. Also, the HPEGF expression goes up quickly, especially on the two-thirds, as well as the proliferation of the hypothesis. If you look at you use the PC. If you look at using PC and nitrogen staining to stain the cells, this goes up very quickly as compared with the one-third or control. Okay, this one, another, to exclude the underlying by chemical factors inside, we just do the X-favor proposition to check if this kind of the generation regeneration happens. So if you the two different flow rates to Two different flow rates to perfuse the level, you can find similar data with that we have seen in this available cutoff. It means that if you two to four eight milliliter per minute, per minute, you get a higher diameter, higher expression of HP, HGF. Pressure of HPHF of, of course, the higher proliferation of the hepatocytes. The third phenomenological data came from the cell. So if you take the plane cell and the literal cell, also the herpicocytes out of the animal, you can do the two things. Number one, you put cell into the flex cell. This is the commercial devices which can Devices which can apply a mechanical stretch on the cell. So, of course, after the 24 hours, you connect the superlatant, put it into another dish, co-culture with the primary hepatocytes to see if stretch-induced superlatant can promote the hepatocytes proliferation. So, the data comes from two sides for the zitto cell. For the zero cell, you can you have a very good HP EGF segregation with amplitude dependent and duration dependent patterns. So if you put this kind of the superlatant into the primary hepatocytes, you check the hepatocytes HBEGF receptor as well as what we call the As well as what we call the proliferation index, which is the expression of the PCNA, as well as another bimarker, we call the cycling D1. This one is the cell cycle by marker. All the data show that the stretch-induced pyroclass such as HBGF can promote proliferation because it goes on monopolically. Monatolically. Okay, from this experimental observation, next we're going to ask what's underlying mechanics. So first, since we check the kind of the mechanical sensitive pathway, of course, we do that of the RNA-seq test. We skip all this gene data. Here we find that, yeah, it's also very important. It's also a very important candidate to do the mechanical transduction. Here we get with the 20% phosphoryl stretch, the cell can be activated because the phosphorate goes down. If you look at the nuclear translocation, the stretch can get a higher translocation ratio. So it means that has been. means that yep has been activated next we can do the loss of function uh manipulation use the death this is an inhibitor for the yacht trans entry into the nucleus so the difference between number one to number three has been uh body abolished with the dash inhibitor or getting out function test if you Function test, if you use the AMB to maintain the YAP inside the nuclei, the difference between one, two, three goes a little bit higher to two, two, four. So it means that sort of the up-regulated. So all this data indicated that YAP activation is quite important in this stretch in media pro process. This is quite under uh downstream events. Downstream events. How about the upstream? What say stretch can be sensed by the cells? We check about F-actin, which sort of mechanical sensitive proton. So yes, the data show that the HP effect goes up also together with HPGF. But if you use cyto-D inhibitor to depolymerize. Inhibitor to depolymerize the effectant stress fiber, the difference between one to three disappeared for from two to four. Again, not only for the HPEGF, but also for the P frustrated proton. So, how the between what again between yeah versus effect? So, we saw that there are kind of two pathways. Number one is Number one is a passive pathway, which means that affected stress fiber can pull open the nuclear pore, which means that the yacht goes into the nucleus. So we to do the TEM test to find that this twitch can open the nuclear pores. However, if you use a cyto-D to inhibit the effect and the difference disappears again. So it means that this process So it means that this process works like the effect induced way. Only the passive pathway, we may all have the active ways because our gene data show that it's kind of the proto-shaft flow, which we call the BNG3, which is a shaftlong with a yap. This kind of shaft can heal, yapp, get into the nucleus. Get into the nucleus because they can easily lose up expression. I also, if you the co-IP test, you can pull down the yap, which means that they're both both proton working together. Of course, if you do the loss of function to use the lockdown, the VH3, the difference between one, two, three disappeared, not only in the gene level, but also in the Level, but also in the protein level, even you use the UVAC cell. Again, also the activation still disappeared because there's a little difference between two and four. But after here, we just use the biological data to validate to elucidate the mechanics. How about the go back to the environment? So we work with our collective. So we work with our collaborator, Dr. Ai Ding from Tengying Medical University. They give us a yeah, and the radial cell specific lockout mesh. We also take two things. Number one, take the cells out to put on the flex cell to see what happened. Data told that the difference between the control mass disappeared when you applied you the When you apply to the YAP1 locker mesh, there's no difference here. This sort of this lunar label data. Go back to the invable data. This HBEGF expression, as well as the proliferation of the hypothesis, still goes down or even disappeared when you use the lock of the mesh. So all this data support the next. For the next working model here. If we do the partial cutoff level, which can expand the sinusoidal vessels, this type of the dilution can induce effectant obligation to open the nuclear pore, make the yacht get into the nucleus. This sort of the passive way. This sort of the passive way. Another way is that such protein travel BNG3 can bend to the yacht to help yup get into the nucleus. Both of the events can induce a zeal-secret hyperinbanding growth factor, HBGF, which finally to promote the heptoside or inflation and also to get a function. How many links I have? Okay, all right. So, this is the first issue. Just talk about the mechanical stretch. Another issue is about the stiffness. As I told, I described at the beginning of this talk, we have the huge stiffness variation for the liver from lormal to fibrotic to cirrhotic, about tenfold higher of the stiffness. About tenfold higher of the stiffness. So, can we, how can this stiffness teach you to stiffness regulate liver fibrosis? So, of course, we have, we also go back to look at the literature. We've learned that the liver injury makes the liver sinusoidal cells frustration, which means that the normal cell. The normal cell, the little cell have a lot of the follow-up on the which cross the cell tech from the normal side to the basal side. Once the liver is injured, this pause disappeared, which we call defalstrition, which means that this came into the sort of the liver fibrosis. So once this event happened, Once this event happens, the hepatosis is activated, ECM is over-deposited, deposits, and also heposites is functional. So finally, we came to the liver fibrosis. But we still don't know what the underlying mechanisms, especially mechanical transduction pathway, for how metrics. For how a metric stiffness regulates liver RSECD flustration. Again, we learned from the experts from the biomaterial use hydrogel to build up this sort of initial model, which you can, it's very simple, regular way, use the actual lightweight, different ratio to get different ratios, polyachrometic stiffness. Polyachromatic stiffness. I put the collagen on the top and I put the cell on the top of the collagen layer, get a cell model, in vitro model. Of course, we can use the AFM to measure the elastic marginers. One kilopascal means that close to the normal or physiological level, and 70 kilopascals means very surreal. Sereal fibrosis close to the cirrhosis. We also developed kind of the deep learning method to count this kind of the philosophy number, which is a lot of hundreds of philosophy in a single cell. So you can't do manually. So you have to use kind of the code to come automatically. Automatically. With all this preparation, we came into our issues. So, how the stiffness should affect inverse fibrosis? We'll have two data. Number one is the lump of the falloster. Number two is a porosity of the falloster, which means the total error of the fallosture divided by total error of this. Divided by total area of these cells. This two data is quite similar, so we only focus one data. So, of course, you have a higher stiffness, you have a low number of the pores. Biologically, the biomarker, PCOM1, step one, PNOS, VGFR2, all of this goes down with an increase of difference, except for the one of the molecules 331, which means that by mark. Which means that by marker for the conventional category, this is true. So this fits our hypothesis, say our in-vital model works. Number two, we say what's the underlying mechanism. So of course, the effectant is the first candidate, just like I described in my first part of the talk. So of the higher stiffness, the higher expression of effectant. Also, if you depolarize You depolarize stress fiber, you'll get a low lump, you get back to the normal comparable lumbar fallostru, which means that the stiffness induced difference disappeared after you use the COD inhibitor. How about in between the mechanical circular pathway, FAC is also a candidate, came from our gene data. From our gene data. I just escaped the gene data. So with a higher stiffness, we have a low lumber of the volume. But if you use the inhibitor of the FEC, the difference goes back to the normal. So it means that FAC plays a role in the process. In the beginning, we focus on another pathway. Focus on another pathway we call the P3038 and MAC2, which is a kind of the MAPK pathway. Again, if you focus this data, if you use the inhibitor to inhibit the cell, the difference between the stiff and the soft substrate disappeared again. So this means that this one is also pretty low and also it's a downstream of the FAK. Of the FAK pathway. So this is not the end of the story because it's just sort of the pathway. What is any application in kinetic or potentially potentially? We just built up the liver fibrosis model from one to eight weeks to injection to carbon chloride for up to six weeks. This kind of fibrosis color appeared in the gap between different liver lobules. Also, to energize goes up with the time and the stiffness also goes up. All this data means that the model works. Of course, it's a very standard conventional model for the test. The key data is this finger. We just focus the first row because it's two, one is longer, another one is the priority, it's the same. If you use the one two injection inhibitor into the model, this one is a fat inhibitor, this one is a WebK P38. The dot line is a control. So normally. So normally the stiffness, the higher stiffness of the substrate, the lower lung bra of foster. Once we inhibit the first weeks, it goes back, the difference between those two substrate disappear. Even the lump bra is over back up to the control level. For the eight weeks, which means that there's a little heavy. Which means that with a heavy or with a severe fibrosis, the effect of this two inhibitors goes down because the even goes back a bit, but close to the control. And the difference between soft and stiff still there, but even has less difference between the two groups. So this data, at least this data, validate the function of the two inhibitors. The function of the two inhibitors, FAC and P38MACK, in this process of the liver fibrosis. So finally, we come to this working model. So once the teacher ESM stiffness becomes stiffer, they can upregulate effect. This process is regulated by FAC focal adhesion mechanics as with P38 passway. As with P38 pathway, once you block this two pathway user to inhibitor, it is possible to recover the process of fibrosis. So finally, I'm going to get a quick remarks. Number one, for this physiological point of view, it's hard to get very accurate mechanical data in women, not only in women, but also. Women, not only in women, but also even in mouse in the model. So, I have to do kind of the mechanical modeling to check the to predict the mechanical parameters in different level, millimeter, several hundred millimeter micrometer, sorry, and also even to micrometer levels. Of course, we have to compare with the state prediction with sort of the mechanics. With the sort of mechanical environment, experimental environment measurements. Number two, mechanical stretch, we call the mechanical cry, is very important for liver regeneration. In our case, it triggers HPEGF separation through the YAP activation passively and actively, which works for the future, for the liver regeneration. For in a typical pathological case, In a typical pathological cases, for example, liver fibrosis, a metric stiffness is important, but everybody knows that. But for the mechanistically, we understand that this stiffness can upregulate RCEC deflustration through a specific password, which could serve as in the future the potential maybe a target for target for reverting liver fibrosis. We call it kind of the mechanical target or mechanical intervention.
