It's been a wonderful conference so far. And in particular, it's a pleasure to go directly after Samuel's excellent talk. As we'll see, there's a lot of similarity in the kind of questions we're considering and some of the issues we have to overcome. So I'll be speaking today about joint work with Henri Berysticki on reaction diffusion equations in the half-speak. Half space. So, to set up the problem a little bit, I want to recall as motivation some classical results that, of course, we're all very familiar with. So, I want to think about just homogeneous reaction diffusion equations in the whole space. And these are sort of due originally to the pioneering works of Aaronson and Weinberger and Pfeiffer McLeod. So, broadly, we have some, again, very familiar behavior. Again, very familiar behavior. Typically, we see solutions of the Cauchy problem converging to constant steady states. And often, this convergence propagates in every direction at some known speed C star, which is in turn related to the existence of traveling waves. So, in particular, there exist planar traveling waves that have that speed C star. And I should mention that some of these behaviors And I should mention that some of these behaviors are conditional. So, for instance, if you have a bistable nonlinearity, then you expect small initial conditions to go extinct as t goes to infinity. But once they're sufficiently large, they will converge to one, and this propagation will proceed, as I describe here. So more recently, there's been a great deal of interest in introducing forms of inhomogeneity into this problem, and we've seen many references to this so far. Seen many references to this so far. So, a direction I want to focus on here today is constraining your domain, in particular, working on cylinders. So, we can think about domains of the form R cross omega, where omega is some compact subset of Rd. And again, there's been a great deal of work in this direction, but I want to highlight some of the results on traveling waves due to Berry Sticky and Nuremberg. Due to Beristicki and Nirenberg, propagation results of Rokujov and Malodi, and more recent analysis of Muratov and Novaga. And in particular, I want to consider some of the differences between the cylindrical case and the whole space. So an important distinction is typically you expect the steady states now to be non-constant. You expect some influence from the domain boundary, whatever. The domain boundary, whatever boundary conditions you impose. On the other hand, you only have to consider the propagation of your solutions in one direction, or technically two directions, x1 alone. So in that sense, your analysis is a little simpler. But you lose something, and of course, your traveling waves, much like your steady states, generally have no hope of being planar. And so we can't use phase plane methods. We can't use phase plane methods, etc. So the analysis becomes more complicated. So I want to think of the half space as an intermediate case. It sort of interpolates the setting on the whole space and on cylinders, and it has features of both of these. So if we have some non-trivial, say, Dirichlet boundary condition on the half space, we expect to see non-constant steady states now. Steady states now. On the other hand, there are many directions in which propagation can occur. You can move in any direction in the interior as well as along the boundary. So that evolution is perhaps a little more elaborate to get a handle on. But again, we run into this issue that your traveling waves cannot depend on one spatial variable alone. They'll also depend on your distance from the boundary. So they'll be non-planar. Non-planar. And there's an additional complication in the half-space situation, which is again that all these directions to look in, you have asymptotic convergence to different numbers in all these directions. And it leads to some difficult analysis of the asymptotic behavior of traveling waves, most of which we haven't yet resolved. As a second piece of motivation, I want to recall. Second piece of motivation, I want to recall the road field model recently introduced by Veristicky Rukhjov and Niram, excuse me, and Rossi, of course. So this involves the interaction between a population in a half plane and a population on the boundary. And so we can think of some of the problems that we'll be studying here as a kind of degenerate case of this model when the feedback between these two populations is broken. So, without further ado, I'd like to present the setup, the setting of our problem today. So, we'll be working on the half space, which I'll be denoting as Rd cross R plus with coordinates x prime and y. So for us, y is sort of the important variable, denotes your distance from the boundary, and is always positive in our domain. And we're studying the classic. We're studying the classic reaction diffusion equation, now homogeneous in space, but it has this interaction at the boundary. And we'll consider a broad set of boundary conditions, both Robin and Dirichlet. So we can formally interpret that second boundary condition as a Dirichlet condition by moving rho to the other side and setting it to be zero. When rho is positive, we have a Robin condition. Have a Robin condition. I do want to point out that there's no sense in studying the Neumann case because that reduces to the whole space setting with even conditions in Y. So these are sort of the whole universe of constant boundary conditions we can be interested in. And then one of the main goals of the work was to attack the problem from a very general perspective and General perspective and hope to achieve some results that apply for a broad variety of reactions. So, we'll be considering three main classes, all very well known, monostable, ignition, and bistable, with corresponding caricatures presented here. Monostable case is that we do not rely on the KPP condition. Condition. So the monostable plot here certainly is not KPP, it is not dominated by its tangent line at the origin. So we really develop a nonlinear analysis to handle all these cases. So again, we are worried about steady states, and this takes up a great deal of our attention. So as we've been seeing, we expect solutions of the Cauchy problem to converge to some steady state as t goes to infinity. To some steady state as t goes to infinity, perhaps depending on the initial condition. And so we need to classify such states. And it turns out this classification is relatively straightforward in the monostable setting. So then there is a unique non-zero bounded steady state, which we call phi, under any of those boundary conditions we mentioned before. And it is one-dimensional, so it has the symmetry that we. As the symmetry that we were just hearing about. So it only depends on y. It's between 0 and 1. It increases away from the boundary and it converges to 1. So the farther you look from the boundary, the more you just see the behavior as if you were in the whole space. So just a plot of an example of phi to kind of fix the idea in your head. Now the situation for ignition and bistable reactions is a bit more complicated. Reactions is a bit more complicated. So, among other issues, even if you are in one dimension on the line, we have more than just zero and one steady states. For instance, we have the intermediate unstable zero theta. And if you're bi-stable, you have these oscillatory solutions as well, or a kind of soliton. But we can ask, you know, what about on the half-line? Half line. And so we expect symmetric steady states, so we should first understand things on the half-line. And it turns out that ignition reactions, at least, are very well behaved on the half-line. So again, there's a unique non-zero bounded steady state for ignition reactions. Bistable reactions are more of a problem. So again, even on the half line, we cannot rule out the soliton solution or an unscilatory solution. An unscilatory solution. So we need to impose more conditions. So we choose to work solely in the Dirichlet case with bistable reactions. Once we do that, we're specifying that our function is always zero at the boundary. That means we need an additional assumption on our reaction. We need that its integral be positive. In other words, that its wave speed be positive in one dimension. And this is, in a sense, saying that the In a sense, saying that the stable zero, one, is more stable than the zero at zero, which prevents the initial boundary value, zero, from just invading your whole space and resulting in an identically zero solution everywhere. So once we restrict it to the Dirichlet setting, we can't help but make this assumption. And I want to highlight some very nice work by members of the By members of the audience and speakers today, so by Chen, Lozhou, and Giovetti, concerning the robin setting on the half-line with a bistable reaction. So they have quite wonderful work that with the great precision determines the evolutionary behavior of the Cauchy problem. It identifies the kind of threshold case between extinction and propagation, looks at the steady states you can. Looks at the steady states you converge to and things like that. So we are not going in that direction. We choose to simplify things greatly. And Yu and Lowe have also done some very nice work on a free boundary problem related to the Robin bistable case. So again, we'll be restricting to a Dirichlet case with a positive wave speed. And from now on, whenever I refer to a bistable reaction, I'll be implicitly assuming that condition. Assuming that condition. Now we're not out of the weeds yet. As we were just discussing, DeGeorgi's problem looms here. In high enough dimensions, it still seems quite possible that there may be steady states which are not one-dimensional. And we don't have a great way of handling those except by proving a conditional uniqueness result. So, what we can show is that So, what we can show is that if we have an ignition or bistable reaction, there is a unique non-zero bounded steady state, which is large on large balls. Large meaning it exceeds this threshold temperature theta on large enough balls. So there's only one state, again, which exceeds theta on large balls. It is one-dimensional and looks exactly like the caricature I presented on the previous slide. I presented on the previous slide. So, with that conditional understanding of steady states under our belt, we can turn to the questions of propagation in the Cauchy problem. So, we can turn back to the parabolic reaction diffusion equation brought up at the start. So we're given some initial condition, and we want to understand the quantitative evolution of our solution as t goes to infinity. So, again, in the monostable setting, we have another. Stable setting, we have a nice hair-trigger effect. This famous term coined by Ernst and Weinberger, saying that any non-trivial initial condition will propagate, it will not go extinct, and it will ultimately spread at the minimal one-dimensional wave speed, C star. So, we attained the same result in the half space. So, of course, the first equation. Of course, the first equation here just says that when you look at any speed slower than C star, you see uniform convergence to this steady state phi. Of course, we can't converge to one here. And on the other hand, if you move faster than C star, you will not see anything. You will uniformly converge to zero because the reaction has not propagated out that far yet. And I want to compare this result to, again, a very This results to again a very nice recent paper of Lo and Liu, who study very similar questions in general convex cones under Dirichlet conditions and under what we call strong KPP reactions. So of course the conical setting is far more general than our domain, just the half space. And it's a very nice work to be able to examine carefully what is going on in the propagation. What is going on in the propagation in such settings. But on the other hand, they do use some fairly strong conditions, including this KPP hypothesis that you lie underneath your tangent line at zero. And in fact, they use a strong KPP assumption that the sort of secant, the secant lines in your reaction graph are strictly decreasing. This plays a pretty strong role in their proof. So, our results are sort of in a different direction. We make more restrictions on the domain, but we try to approach the problem for more general reactions and more general boundary conditions. So next, I would like to discuss, again, the sort of more troublesome setting, the bistable and ignition reactions. So, as we mentioned before, small initial conditions will inevitably go extinct. Same is true in the half-space as in the whole space. In the whole space. On the other hand, here again, if you have a sufficiently large initial condition, that will survive to t goes to infinity. It will propagate and will ultimately converge to this unique, large, steady state that we classified earlier. And the propagation occurs at the unique 1D wave speed C star, just as in the whole space. So, again, here's the wall of text describing all that. So, the first statement is That. So the first statement is just recalling that small data will go extinct. And then again, if your initial condition is larger than this threshold temperature theta on a large enough ball, then you will propagate in the sense that you ultimately converge to this steady state phi, and you do so at the speed C star. And I should mention here many. And I should mention here, many members of the audience and organizers as well have done some really nice work on the exact threshold between extinction and invasion in exactly these kinds of problems. That's not something we've explored, but definitely an interesting question for the future to think: you know, if I have a monotone family of initial conditions, how can I understand what happens in between these two conditions given here? These two conditions given here. So, to finish things up, I'd like to turn to traveling waves. So, our domain is translation invariant along the boundary in the x prime directions. So, we should look for traveling waves that move parallel to the boundary in some direction e prime, again, just in the x prime direction, and some speed c. So, the simplest example of such a wave would depend only on two spatial coordinates, just on the direction e prime and on your distance from the boundary y. And in that setting, this function, phi, would solve your reaction diffusion equation. So this has to translate in the direction e prime at speed c. So that's the kind of traveling wave we'll be examining in detail. And that Detail. And that means that we can reduce the question to just the two-dimensional case, just a half-plane, because we're choosing to study sort of analogs of the planar traveling wave now with codimension two level sets rather than codimension one. So in the half plane, we can denote coordinates simply by x and y. And we want our traveling wave to connect the steady states we've been studying. The steady states we've been studying so far. So we'd like the wave to connect the stable, large, steady state to zero. So I choose my wave to move left to right, steadily invading the zero region. And I want these limits here to hold locally uniformly in R plus. Whether they hold uniformly, I think, is a very interesting question, which we haven't resolved yet. So we were able to. So, we're able to construct traveling waves that have the same speed that you would expect from the one-dimensional case. So, first of all, we can show using the propagation results mentioned earlier that no waves can have a speed slower than C star. But on the other hand, if you are monostable, there exist traveling waves for any speed greater than or equal to C star. And when you're ignition or bistable, there exists. ignition or bistable, there exists at least a traveling wave of speed c star. And all the waves that we construct satisfy some convenient monotonicity properties. So they're decreasing in x and they're increasing as you move away from the boundary. So I want to mention there's a small part of this which may appear to be missing from the one-dimensional perspective. So again, if we were just in one dimension, there'd be a further result that says that bistable and ignition reactions do not That bistable and ignition reactions do not emit faster traveling waves. But we don't expect that to be the case in higher dimensions because of waves with a sort of conical shape, which can indeed move faster than C star. So these have been constructed in the whole space by many people. I want to highlight works of Amel Manon Rokzhov and Wang and Bu. So we So, we anticipate that these conical waves exist in the half-space setting as well, but we haven't constructed them yet. And I think a big piece of the puzzle is missing here, which is the uniqueness of these waves. And this is a tricky question for us, something we would like to resolve in the future. But it's related intimately to the asymptotic behavior of your waves. Behavior of your waves, particularly as they approach zero on the right, and as they approach something that we haven't identified when you take y to infinity. So we don't yet have a good handle on the asymptotic behavior of our wave in every direction, and that's stymying efforts to prove uniqueness using standard kind of comparison methods. And I think this difficulty is. This difficulty is new in the sense that it doesn't occur when you're studying waves in a cylinder with a compact cross-section. Because then you have a discrete spectrum in the transverse direction, and you have a very good understanding of how your waves look in each direction asymptotically. But here, once you have this non-compact cross-section, the analysis becomes quite a bit more difficult. So that's everything for me. So that's everything for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for the very nice talk, and to be very precise with the timing. So are there questions or comments? I have a question myself about the weights. So the last slide that you showed. That you showed. So I'm quite surprised. So you don't get the asymptotic as y tends to plus infinity. So you don't get the standard wave, 1D wave as y goes to plus infinity? We are not sure. Okay. And there's sort of two possibilities. You could converge to the standard 1D wave. This meter non-uniform. Non-uniformly, of course. But we actually, so I suspect that in the KPP setting, you may converge to one locally uniformly rather than to the 1D wave. I think it has to do with a kind of linear expansion performed on the right. So we have to kind of understand the linear steady states there a little bit better. And yeah, it seems to be tricky. And it's not something that we're able to handle very well just using our construction that sort of starts from a box and moves outward because it's sort of indeterminate what you're converging to at your various limits. So definitely something I'm super interested in. The level sets could be very, very, very weird, do you think? Yes, yes. I suspect or hope that there's something kind of unusual going on with the level size. Numerically, you cannot see something numerically? We actually haven't done numerics yet. And that's something we should do. Okay. Okay, because this could be like a way for the uniqueness, maybe imposing a condition of y equals to pos infinity. Maybe there one can hope to have uniqueness. Absolutely. And it would have something to do, presumably. It would have something to do, presumably, with kind of the finer asymptotics of your propagation in different directions as well. So, also something we're very interested in. Thank you. Luca, can I ask a question? Yes, of course. Okay. Thank you for your talk. So if you change the hyperkine by a more general surface, obviously the last part on traveling waves does not apply. Part on traveling waves does not apply, but do you know if regarding the rest of your talk anything changes? So that's a direction we're thinking about. Kind of the first thing we should consider is the uniqueness of steady states. There, for monostable reactions, we have in work in progress, we can establish the same kind of result that there is a Kind of result that there's a unique steady state on such a domain. And I think we could probably show, you know, if you are asymptotically planar in some sense, then you would end up being asymptotically one-dimensional. Ignition and bistable seems a little bit trickier by our methods, but also something we're thinking about. So I think that's open in our mind. And we definitely anticipate that the kind of asymptotic propagation results here should extend to. Here should extend to kind of perturbations like you describe as well. Okay, and what if it's not asymptotically planar? What if it's like a cone, precisely? Yeah, so again, so if it is a cone, in the monostable case, we believe we can show the uniqueness of the steady state. And then I think if we sort of combine some of the approaches of low and loo with methods we use here, I expect we could show profit. I expect we could show propagation in the expected sense as well in that setting. But again, that's just for monostable reactions. So the methods maybe become a little bit more difficult, particularly regarding this uniqueness issue for bi-stable ignition. Okay, thank you. Okay, so are there other questions? Are there other questions or comments? Otherwise, we can hear this day workshop exact time. So, let's thank Cole again and all the speakers of today's workshop. And thank you very much. And so we will meet tomorrow, same time. Same time. So, thank you. Thank you, everyone.
