Thank you so much for the opportunity to talk and the invitation to come to the conference. It's been really fun so far, and I'm excited for the rest. Okay, so today I'm going to be talking about card shuffling, queue analogs, and arrangements. And this is joint work with Patty Cummins and Vic Reiner, both at University of Minnesota. Okay, so the sort of big idea of what I'm going to say today is I want to think about questions that are motivated by probability theory that we can answer using combination. That we can answer using combinatorics and representation theory. So, what I'm going to do is I'll tell you about card shuffling. And I think for the sake of time, I'm just going to talk about one type of card shuffling today. So, this is like the sort of classical stuff. And then I'm going to tell you about a generalization to Q analogs or to the Hecke algebra. And then I'll tell you about what we understand about both of these shuffling processes. So, in particular, I'm going to be interested in spectral properties. So, eigenvalue. In spectral properties, so eigenvalues, and understanding eigenspaces as representations. Okay, so here's how this shuffling will work. I have a deck of cards. Let's just say I just have three cards. And I'm going to shuffle via what's called the random to top process, or sometimes people call this the Zeppelin library. And so the way that it works is I pick a card at random from my deck, and I move it to the top of my deck with equal probability. Probability. So in this three-card case, with probability one-third, I'll just take the first card up and I'll put it back down. With probability one-third, I'll take the second card and move it to the top. And then with one-third, I'll take the third and move it to the top. And so this is sort of a basic way to shuffle cards. But the question is, how many times would I need to do this if I wanted to have a well-mixed deck of cards? Okay, so more generally, I'm going to think about, instead of a deck of cards, I'm going to think about a permutation of size n or a word where the numbers 1 to n appear once. Okay, and I'm going to think about random to top as an element of the group algebra of the symmetric group that acts on words or permutations via right multiplication. So by that I mean position. So here's an example of a permutation acting by position. So for example, one is sent to two. That means that position one is sent to two. That means that position one is set to position two. Okay, so again, random to top brings a card to the front with equal probability. How do we define this formally? If I take SI to be an adjacent transposition, and I write my word with brackets here, I'll think of random to top as acting on a permutation as multiplication on the right by this group algebra element. So here, each sum n, like the ith. Sumand, like the ith sumand here, is moving the ith card, like sort of making adjacent swaps until I get to the top of my word. Okay? So, for example, here's what this would look like with the word 1, 2, 3. I would apply this group algebra element, and what I would get in the end is something that looks like this, a linear combination of permutations. And the way that I read this is that the coefficient of this permutation tells me the probability that if I started at word w, I ended up word. That if I started at word w, I end up at that permutation. So, for example, this says I have a one-third chance of getting 2, 1, 3, and a 0 chance of getting 1, 3, 2. Okay, and so really I'm thinking of random to top here as a map from the root algebra back to itself. And I want to encode the action of this shuffling process on all possible permutations via a probability matrix. So, here, the rows and columns of my matrix will be indexed by the states of this. Be indexed by the states of this Markov chain, which for us will just be permutations. And the jth column in ith row will tell me the probability if I start at position or state j, I end up at state i. So for example, when n is 3 and I'm looking at random to top, I told you that random to top on 1, 2, 3 gives me this linear combination. This would be one column in my matrix, and I could fill out the rest of the matrix if I wanted to. And for the rest of the talk, I'm going to scale these matrices so that they're all. To scale these matrices so that they're all integers. Okay, so initially we wanted to know how many times do we need to apply this shuffling operator to have a well-mixed deck of cards, if that's how I'm going to shuffle my deck. And my claim is that the eigenvalues of that probability matrix will tell me the answer to this. So, from my perspective as a combinatorialist, I sort of figure out the eigenvalues, give them to a probabilist, and they will then compute how long. And they will then compute how long it would, how many times I would need to shuffle. So that's going to be our first goal: to understand the eigenvalues of random to top. So this is a big matrix. It's an n factorial by n factorial matrix. And then, so that's the sort of probabilistically motivated question. And then the more combinatorial or representation theory question is that I want to understand the eigenspaces of this operator as symmetric group representations. So why would I? So, why would I want to do that? Yeah. I'm so sorry. Could you use the laser pointer just a little bit less? It's making me super vision sick, and I just, this is so fascinating. Okay, yeah, I'll try and use my hands. I'm time short, but if it's unclear, let me know. Okay, so why would we want to study these eigenspace representations? Well, the first reason is that sometimes it can help answer eigenvalue questions. It can help answer eigenvalue questions. So there are more complicated shuffling processes. And sometimes you need to understand the structure of the eigenspaces to be able to tell you what the eigenvalues are. So this is true for something called random to random and a bunch of other operators that were studied by Nadia and her thesis. The second motivation came from, and this is how Vic and Patty and I started to look at this. We were thinking about what's called the invariant theory of the free left regular variant. Theory of the free left regular band, which is a type of monoid, and somehow random to top and the Q analog that I'm going to tell you about showed up there. And then the third reason is that the kernel of random to top is known to have a very nice description called the derangement representation, which I'll define in a second, but that sort of hints that maybe the other eigenspaces also have nice representations just here. Okay, so I'm not going to. Okay, so I'm not going to talk too much about the details of representation theory today, but sort of the big ideas. We're going to use the combinatorics of Tableau. The smallest building blocks that I'm going to use to describe these representations will be labeled by partitions. And I'm going to encode all my representations as symmetric functions via the provenious characteristic map. So this will take irreducibles to sure functions and the trivial representation to the homogeneous symmetric functions. Functions. Okay, so now I want to tell you what the derangement representation is. So this was the kernel of random to top. So it's defined via what's called a desarrangement tableau. So this is a standard Young Tableau. So an ascent is a statistic you can define on a tableau, similar to an ascent of a permutation. And it's going to be the tableaus who have minimum ascent even. Even. Okay, so it's sort of an odd definition, but it turns out we can define a representation in this way. So the derangement representation will be the symmetric function that I get that sums over all possible Desarrangement Tableau. So the idea is for each tableau, it will contribute a share function. So here when n is 4, we have 4 possible Desarrangement Tableau, and each one will give us exactly one share function. So in general, you could just define this. So in general, you could just define this as a representation abstractly, but it's interesting because it actually shows up, for example, as the kernel of random to tell. Okay, so you might wonder where is this name from? So the derangement numbers are given by this formula here. And they count the number of permutations in the centric group that have no fixed points. So these are literally called derangements. They also count, it also counts the dimension of the It also counts the dimension of this derangement representation that I told you about. And then finally, it counts the number of permutations in this metric group that are so-called desarrangements. So I haven't defined this, but it's defined similarly to the Tableau definition. And so for this reason, like because derangements and desarrangements are so closely related, I think that's why they need to pass. Okay, questions before I move to the Q world? To the keyworld. Okay, so now the idea is that I'm going to introduce a new parameter into this setting. Okay, and I'll recover classical objects if I set Q to be 1. So maybe the most classical object in algebraic combinatorics is a non-negative integer, and its Q analog will be this polynomial in Q. So you can see that if I set Q to be 1, I'll get K back. And in the algebra, Back. And in the algebraic setting, the classical object that we've been thinking about is the group algebra, the symmetric group. And today, what I want to think about, the sort of Q algebra, or sorry, the Q analog of this algebraic setting is going to be the type A Heck algebra. Okay, so maybe some context here. Bufatov showed that many interacting particle systems with multiple species can actually be viewed in this context. Can actually be viewed in this context of random walks on heck algebra. So, many processes that I think people in the audience have studied. Yeah. Just to remind you about the point. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm too used to that. Okay, so that's going to be sort of the context that this research fits into. Although, this is not actually how we initially came to it. We were originally thinking about. To it. We were originally thinking about Q shuffling on the space of complete flags of FQ to the N. So everything I say can be requraced in that language. Okay, so I'm going to define the NEC algebra just by comparing it to the group algebra. So if I wanted to define the group algebra, the symmetric group via generators and relations, I would say that it's generated by S1 to Sn. So those are these adjacent transpositions, subject to these k. Transpositions subject to these three conditions here. And today I want you to think about the type A Hec algebra as being generated by t1 to tn minus 1, subject to almost the same three conditions. The second two are exactly the same. And the first one is going to be a slight, the slight difference is that here I have si squared is 1, which I can rewrite as this product. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to deform the And what I'm going to do is I'm going to deform the minus 1 to a q. So this will then change the entire algebra structure. Okay, so importantly, there's the reason why we can define these random walks on Hecke algebras is that there's a natural right action by the Hecke algebra on words. So the element ti will act on a word here by, so if wi is less than wi plus 1, it will swap these elements, sort of exactly what the Elements, sort of exactly what the symmetric group does. But if wi is bigger than wi plus 1, then I get a linear combination of two words. So it gets slightly more complicated. So here's an example. If I act by ti, I sort of get exactly what you expect. But if I act by t1 and t2 here, because 3 is bigger than 2, I get this linear combination. Okay, so we defined random to top as multiplication by Random to top as multiplication by this group algebra element. Now I want to think about the Q-shuffling operator in sort of the most naive generalization possible, which is just taking these SI's and turning them into TI's. So this is actually not how we initially defined it, and sort of in hindsight, this is, I think, the way that makes the most sense. So you can see now if I act by this Q analog on a word, I get sort of, and I do out the work, I get like a more complicated. Get a more complicated version of a linear combination of permutations. Okay, and so we're going to be thinking about eigenspaces here, and today I'm going to assume that I'm in the semi-simple setting, so meaning that Q is not zero or a root of unity. And in this case, a lot of the representation theory that we're going to use is sort of going to go through as we want. So the irreducibles will be indexed by partitions. And importantly, I'll have a Q for Benius characteristic map, which means that I can take my Map, which means that I can take my Hec algebra representations and turn them into symmetric functions. So the representations over here are more complicated, the character formulas are complicated, but the point is that I can still express them in symmetric functions. Okay, so now I want to tell you about the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of this sort of classical object and its Q analog. Okay, so random to top is very well known. Top is very well known. Fodderford showed that the eigenvalues are 0, 1, 2, up to n minus 2n. And then Uyamari-Reya showed that the J eigenspace of random to top has this for Benius average. So it's the n minus j derangement representation times hj, this jth homogeneous symmetric function. Okay? And what we showed is that in this semi-simple case, Is that in this semi-simple case, the Q analogous result is true. So the eigenvalues will be the Q integers, and sort of more interestingly, the JQ eigenspace will have the exact same Frobenius characteristic. So it'll be the n minus J derangement number times this Jth homogeneous symmetric function. How am I in time? I should be done. Okay. We have five minutes. What? We have five minutes to set up the next. Okay, okay, okay. So let me just say: here's an example of how this would work. I sort of take my derangement representation and then I multiply by a homogeneous symmetric function. And then the last thing I'll say, just like very briefly, is that there are other types of shuffling operators that I'm interested in, and you can sort of generalize them in a very simple You can sort of generalize them in a very similar way by taking their expression in the group algebra, turning them into an element of the Hec algebra, and studying their eigenvalues. And that's sort of ongoing work now. So we have a conjecture of exactly what the eigenvalues should be for a more complicated operator called random to random. And we're hoping that we can prove this. But I will leave it at that. Thank you. Any questions? What about putting different probabilities? You use the same probability pipeline. And sometimes it's easier to sort it, but such a function allow for arbitrary problems. That's a good question. I don't think we've thought about that from the eigenspace perspective. I don't even know. Perspective. I don't even know in Q equals in like the classical random to top if the eigenvalue. It does exist. Is the eigenspace the same? Or the eigenvalues would be different. Yeah, I don't know. I haven't thought about that. That's a good question. If you have the eigenvalues in the Q setting, is it equally easy as in the regular setting, or equally hard as in the regular setting, to find the mixing time? Like how long you should shut it? Like, how long you should show? That's a good question. I think it's harder. So, I was talking to Alexei Bufatov about this result and asking him about the mixing time. And he was saying that actually, there's, I think, some probabilistic hurdles as well, like, interesting things to do, but yeah, it's not as, or I think more theory needs to be developed than this heck out of workies. Hack out working is.
