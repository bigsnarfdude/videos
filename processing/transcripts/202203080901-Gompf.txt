Um do it again. Um okay, I uh if you're not seeing my screen, I'm not sure what is going on here. Uh, are you allowing me to share a screen? Allowing me to share a screen? I think so. Maybe I should ask the birds now. You should be seeing my title. That's strange. It's not showing up. I don't know. I wonder if it has something to do with having two screens or I guess I could have an iPad screen or something? No, this is a. Well, I've got a PC in front of me, a laptop, and I've got a side monitor, and I'm trying to share my laptop screen. Laptop screen. That's me. Oh, so I'll stop sharing. So I think I can share a screen. And in Zoom, I just went down and clicked on the green button, share a screen. Yeah, I have tried that several times. Well, what it does is it, wait a second, select. Oh, oh, oh, I see. It's giving me options for what. Giving me options for what to share. So share. All right. That's great. All right. Okay, so you're seeing my talk title now, right? Yes. Okay. So, and I've got a And I've got a panel up at the top that says you were screen sharing and stuff. You're not seeing that, right? We are not seeing that. That's correct. Okay, good. All right. So now I know what I'm doing. So, all right. This is going to be a talk on very recent research, like weeks to days. Some of it's older. But the origin of it is. The origin of it is about five years ago in spring of 2017, there was this AIM conference on Engel manifolds. And El Yushberg asked a question there that a bunch of us kicked around for a while and didn't come up with any results worth mentioning, and things seemed to kind of fizzle out after a while. But just Just like a month and a half ago, in the middle of January, I started thinking about it again, and everything opened up. I've got these recent results now that I want to talk about. So throughout the talk, we're going to assume that everything is oriented and, in fact, compatibly oriented, whatever that means. Hang in just a second. Figure if I let the cat in, he'll stop meowing at me. Maybe that'll solve the problem. All right. So everything is oriented. And we'll start with something hopefully everyone's comfortable with at this point: contact structures. Of course, hopefully we all know those. Of course, hopefully, we all know those are hyperplane fields in odd-dimensional manifolds, and they're characterized as being maximally non-integrable in the sense that are you still there? All right. Is everything still working? The cat seems to have gone after my question. Gone after my cord or something. Everything's fine. Okay, great. So, anyway, we have what maximally non-integrable here means is that the hyperplane field is never closed under Lee bracket, that everywhere we look, we're getting the entire tangent space under the Lie bracket. And so, in particular, just from basic differential. In particular, just from basic differential geometry that gives a non-degenerate form, we pair the hyperplane field with itself and then mod out the hyperplane field so that the target is one-dimensional. That has the effect of getting rid of all the terms that are not pointwise. And so then we have this non-degenerate form, which in fact is the restriction of our usual contact form. Restriction of our usual contact form, well, up to an annoying sign that I'm not going to talk about anymore. And so there are two very fundamental aspects to this that I want to talk about. First of all, context structures are all the same locally, and that if I take two points in If I take two points in contact end manifolds, they're always going to have neighborhoods that are contact amorphic to each other. Now, that property is shared by foliations, for example, but what isn't shared is that the contact condition is an open condition. So in fact, if you perturb the hyperplane field a small amount, it's still going to be a contact. It's still going to be a contact hyperplane field. And so then a natural question we could ask, as Cartan did a long time ago, is what are all the distributions that satisfy these two conditions of we have an open condition that has no local structure in the same sense as contact structures. And so it turns out. So it turns out then that contact structures are part of a larger family of so-called topologically stable distributions that were completely classified by Carton. So there's one other sort of obvious example for us, and that is line fields obviously satisfy these conditions in manifolds of any dimension because all line fields are the same locally. So there's not much to say. There's not much to say there for our purposes, although, of course, dynamical systems people spend their whole lives studying that situation. So we'll move on then. And we have what are called even contact structures that now live in even dimensional manifolds. And they are again hyperplane fields, and they're defined by the same condition as before, that we want them to be maximally non-integrable. Be maximally non-integrable. So there's no place that they're closed under the Lie bracket. And once again, we have this maximal rank form on the field that I'm now calling E. But the difference now is that because we're in an even-dimensional manifold, the hyperplanes E are now odd-dimensional. And that means that unlike Unlike what we had before, we can't have a non-degenerate form on an odd-dimensional manifesto, on odd-dimensional vector space. So, what we have instead is something that has a one-dimensional kernel and is non-degenerate in the transverse directions to that kernel. So, I will call the kernel, I'll call the kernel W. It's again, it gives us a line field, so there's a foliation associated to it and dynamic. Associated to it and dynamics and so on. And just like before, we noticed that we can cut out the hyperplane field by a one-form whose restriction up to sine is this thing we were talking about. So one nice aspect of having a non-degenerate form transverse to W is that whenever we take a hypersurface in our manifold, Surface in our manifold that's transverse to w it automatically inherits a contact structure. So it's well, in fact, that's a very, very stable sort of contact structure in that if we flow along any vector field that's tangent to this kernel W, the contact structure is going to be preserved on the nose. Or another way of saying that is that if we take any open subset in our ambient Any open subset in our ambient manifold on which it makes sense to mod out the foliation and still have a Hausdorff manifold. That Hausdorff manifold canonically inherits a contact structure. And so that makes it sort of clear that if we flow along W or something, that's not going to change anything. Sorry, can I ask a silly question? Yeah. What do you mean by saying that this bilinear skew form extends? Bilinear skew form extends to a one form. Well, okay, there is a one form on the ambient manifold whose restriction to each of these, well, whose restriction to each of these hyperplanes is this maximum form. Just like on a contact manifold. Oh, what did I mean to say there? Yeah, sorry, I meant to say that D of it is this one-dimensional, is this two-form. Yeah, sorry, that should be so there's a one-form whose derivative is this bilinear form? Yes, yes, that's what I meant to say. So in fact, we have a in fact, we have a right transverse manifolds then are automatically contact manifolds inherited in D alpha as the. Alpha as the contact form. Sorry. All right. So one difference. Difference here between contact structures and even contact structures. I guess the reason we really don't hear much about even contact structures is that if we ask about classifying, well, the natural thing to do is classify up to homotopy because small perturbations can change the dynamics of this field. But we could ask about classifying up to homotopy through even contact structures. Even contact structures. And well, if we do that in the context of contact structures, then what happens is that we have the over-twisted ones, which are classified up to homotopian and up and in fact up to equivalence in the compact world by their homotopy theoretic data. They satisfy the H principle, in other words. So it's like. In other words, so it's like classifying over-twisted contact structures, it is pretty much like classifying hyperplane fields with some minimal algebraic data. But then there are these tight contact structures that occur sort of sporadically. They don't fit the pattern, and that's what we spend most of our time studying. Well, even contact structures actually don't have, I mean, well, there's no such thing as in. I mean, well, there's no such thing as a tight, even context structure. They all satisfy the H principle, which some people would say makes them boring. I'm not sure that really makes them boring in the sense that the same words apply to open contact manifolds, and yet R3, for example, has infinitely many different contact structures on it up to equivalence. They just all happen to be homotopic. So you can take that however you like, but some people would say they're not very interesting. That seems to be the That seems to be the consensus that nowadays they're not very interesting to us, although maybe dynamical systems people should be interested in them. So that, in fact, well, to sum up what we've got so far is that Cartan classified these topologically stable distributions and we have line fields and in every even dimension we have one other example. Dimension: We have one other example: the other contact structure or an even contact structure, and that's the whole family. Well, except like a lot of families, there's this one crazy uncle that no one really understands, and that is Uncle Engel. So, aside from these infinite families, we have one more example that only exists in dimension four. It consists of two. Or it consists of two plane fields that are, in some sense, maximally integrable. And since this bit about only existing in dimension four should get the attention of low-dimensional topologists, let's look at that more closely. Well, what does maximally non-integral mean? First of all, it means that it's never closed under the bracket, and somehow the biggest And somehow, the biggest you can get by lee bracketing these two-dimensional spaces is to get a three-dimensional field. And then we could ask for that three-dimensional field itself to be nowhere closed under Lie bracket, which means that that three-dimensional field is the contact structure that's automatically inherited. Whenever you have an angle plane field, there's automatically an even contact structure in the background. The background. And that gives us an entire flag field. Because once we have our D, we have our E, and E has associated to it a line field, and the line field always happens to be in D. And so the reason that W has to be in D is because remember, W is the kernel of Of this bilinear form right here. And so if W were not in D, then D would be non-degenerate under this bilinear form. We've explicitly modded it out as being a subspace of E. So that's a contradiction, meaning that in fact we always have a flag, something one-dimensional inside a two-dimensional, inside a three-dimensional, inside a four-dimensional. So we're automatically looking at parallelization. Parallelizable formifolds, for example. Now, like I said, these things are not well understood. Unlike the previous examples, it's not known whether the H principle applies. So, really, the biggest open problem in the area right now is whether tight angle structures exist or not. There's sort of partial results, they're candidates for. Results, they're candidates for something like over-twisted angle structures, but we don't know whether that's the whole story or what. So that's a wide open question. But let's look at an example. This is sort of the main classical example of a prolongation. I think it was known to Cartan or at least to Engel. And this, if you've ever looked at If you've ever looked at the contact structure canonically associated to the unit cotangent bundle of a surface, then this should seem really familiar to you, namely, we start out with an arbitrary contact 3 manifold. And then over that contact 3 manifold, we think of the contact planes as forming a plane bundle. Is forming a plane bundle, and we take the circle bundle in there as our format. And then, and then so now we have a natural foliation on that circle bundle, namely that the circles themselves. So, W is going to end up being tangent to those fibers. And then that says that the three-plane field E. That says that the three-plane field E should project down to a two-plane field, and the obvious candidate for that is C. But then, what's really deep here is what are the angle planes? And those angle planes are going to project down to lines. And so we remember every point in the prolongation, this four-manifold, is really a point in the three-manifold together. Three manifold together with a point in a circle, or let's think of an oriented line inside of C. Well, over that oriented line, there's a plane that projects onto that, and that's what we will call D. So that is our prolongation with its two-plane field. And that gives us a very visual way of A visual way of understanding prolongation, namely, what are sections of this bundle? Well, they're exactly the same thing as line fields inside of T. So if you want a section of the bundle, you just put a line field in your contact plane field, and there you've got it. Excuse me a moment. All right, there goes the cap. So then, again, we can visualize points in this four-manifold as just being lines inside of our contact planes. So then, as we already observed, inside of every even contact manifold, the hypersurfaces automatically inherit contact structure. So, similarly, inside of every angle four manifold, it's transverse to anything. Transverse to any three manifold that's transverse to W, that's going to have a neighborhood, well, that's identified with one in the prolongation of N. So we start out with this W transverse 3 manifold. It's automatically a contact manifold, so it has a prolongation. And then the line field that it inherits just from the angle structure identifies. Identifies it as a section in the prolongation, its own prolongation. And we can, in fact, embed a whole neighborhood of it from the original angle manifold into the prolongation just by saying, well, we move in the W direction by rotating the line field a little bit. So With that, we can actually see. Oh, is there a question? Can you repeat the definition of B in prolongation example? Okay. So we start out with an arbitrary contact three manifold and we think of the plane field as being a plane bundle over it. Look at the unit circle bundle in C and then a point in the form. And then a point in the form manifold is a point in that circle bundle, or if you like, it'd say it's an oriented line inside of xi at a particular point in n. So we not only see the point in the prolongation that way, but we see the two-plane as being the two-plane that projects onto that line. Does that answer your question? Question? Well, I don't hear anything, so I assume so. All right, so all right. So then, since any contact tree manifold, any point in the contact tree manifold has a neighborhood that can be identified with R3 with its usual contact form right here. Right here. That means that any point in the prolongation of a three-manifold has a neighborhood that looks like the prolongation of R3. And so then it has the same form alpha, but now we pull it back to the four manifold and interpret it as being the kernel of the three-plane table. And that actually gives us local coordinates in any angle. Local coordinates in any angle manifold because locally we're just seeing a little piece of the projectivization of R3 with its contact form and this auxiliary line field that if you wriggle a little to move in the W direction. So then the way we actually see those contact planes is, again, they're supposed to be lines inside of E, or actually inside of C in the three manifold. Three manifold. So, what we need to do is take our kernel of alpha, which is E, and cut it down to a plane projecting onto a line. And we'll do that by introducing another one form. And it's easy to write down what that one form is. It looks like this. What this is telling us is that as we travel once around a fiber in the prolongation, the line should rotate once. And one other observation I want to make is that, in fact, if we forget about the z-coordinate and just look in wxy space, this beta is itself a context structure. It's not canonical the way alpha is being the kernel of this canonical plane field, but it is a context structure in that. A contact structure, and that is a useful observation. So hopefully now we have a sense of what these angle manifolds look like. And so let's go back and compare with contact topology. And one thing we observe is that if you take an arbitrary knot in a contact tree manifold, Not in a contact-free manifold, you can always make it transverse to C just by this standard trick of turning it into a well, okay, I think we all know the details. Let me not go into the details so much. But not only can it be perturbed to be made transverse to C. Be made transverse to Q, we can do that infinitely many ways under suitable hypotheses. Namely, if the knot is null-homologous, then it has a self-linking number, and we can use that to distinguish infinitely many transverse knots, all isotopic to each other. And of course, we know that transverse knots are a very important thing in contact topology. For example, the tight over-twisted dichotomy can be expressed easily in terms of transverse knots. Not so that's what led El Joshberg to ask a question at this AIM conference: namely, what can we say about taking an arbitrary surface in an angle manifold and making it transverse to the two planes? Well, there's an easy observation we can make, namely, if you have a surface that is transverse to D, it has to be. Transverse to D, it has to be a torus with trivial normal bundle. We knew that back at the AN conference. But the reason for that is that transversality implies the normal bundle is essentially the plane field D restricted to the surface. And the tangent bundle is gotten by taking the ambient tangent bundle, modding out D and restricting that to the surface. And both of those things are trivialized by this. Are trivialized by this angle flag. And so we have a surface with a trivial normal bundle and a trivial tangent bundle, which makes it a torus. So then the really interesting question is, what can we say about the converse? And the answer turns out to be that, in fact, every torus with a transverse, with a trivial normal bundle is C0 small isotopic to a transverse torus, precisely analogously. Precisely analogously to knots inside of contact-free manifolds. And furthermore, just like knots in transverse three-manifolds, if we have suitable homological triviality, then the torus in fact realizes infinitely many transverse isotopy. Infinitely many transverse isotopy classes similarly to the case of knots in content-free manifolds. And in fact, the invariant is rather similar. That's why we need these certain homological triviality. And all these examples are, in fact, transversely, regularly homotopic to each other, which is, again, what you'd expect from. Which is again what you'd expect from knots, where you change the self-linking number by a little twist, which can be undone by a transverse regular homotopy. But what is actually true for angle manifolds, which doesn't seem to have any analog for contact manifolds, is that, in fact, there are a lot of examples where not only can you do the above, but you can actually find infinitely many transverse regular homotopies. The transverse regular homotopy classes, each of which can be varied as in the previous example. So that's, well, that's the easier of the two theorems. And we've actually seen already how to distinguish all these examples. So let me talk about that a little bit. And what we Notice is that, well, we've already seen that the angle structure trivializes both the tangent and normal bundle of the surface. And so what that means is that if we can find some topologically defined trivialization by the nose, then we can compare the topological trivialization against the angle trivialization. That's essentially a map from the torus to a circle. Essentially, a map from the torus to a circle, and then there's a cohomology class in Z plus, it's essentially an element of Z plus C. So we get one of those for the tangent bundle and one of those for the normal bundle. And the one for the normal bundle is the one that's very similar to the self-linking number. Again, the definition of the self-linking number is a similar sort of thing that you're comparing. A similar sort of thing that you're comparing a contact-induced trivialization against the trivialization coming from a ciphered surface. But what's different is you also have this trivialization for the tangent bundle. And well, in fact, that's the easier one in some sense because anytime you have a torus, its tangent bundle is canonically trivial just by. Was canonically trivial just by its r2 mod z2, and you just take the constant trivialization. So then without any further messing around, you automatically have an absolute invariant. And that invariant is, well, it's very robust. It doesn't change under transverse regular homotopy. So that's how we get this. That's how we got this stronger statement here. Keep losing my cursor here. All right. I think I'm going to. All right. So let me do. All right. So, a question that you may have already thought of is this is all about surfaces that are analogous to transverse knots. So, what can we say about things that are analogous to Legendrean knots? And well, the most direct Uh, well, the most direct analog would be a surface that's tangent to the two planes everywhere, and those things actually exist, they're not terribly common. But if we're in a prolongation, those are, well, take any Legendre and not and look at the circle bundle over that, and that's a torus, and it's easy to see that it's everywhere tangent to the two planes. So these things exist, but of course, a lot of Legendre and not so we can start with, but it's not very enlightening. But it's not very enlightening to just take something we already know and look at the circle bundle over it. So, what in fact turns out to be a lot more interesting is what I'm calling Haf-Legendre and Torle. So, we take the tangent bundle of the surface and intersect it with D. And well, in the transverse case, the dimension of that is zero everywhere. We've just talked about the cases of dimension two. So now Case of dimension two. So now we look at where the dimension is one everywhere. And those things are more complicated even algebraically. I haven't tried to look at them systematically, but there's an important insight here, namely, if we want to take an arbitrary torus and isotope it to be transverse. Isotope it to be transverse, then in fact, we can, well, it turns out, well, one thing we can do is first construct a half Legendrean torus, and then there's a transverse push-off operation, just like there is for transverse knots and Legendrean and transverse knots. So we can take this half Legendrean torus and turn it into a transverse torus. And for some reason, Taurus. And for some reason, it is much more tractable to aim for a half-Legendrean torus rather than a transverse torus. I think that's the main reason we didn't get very far back five years ago in 2017. All right. All right. So now that we now that we see that insight, how would you go about actually making a half-Legendrean torus? Well, if we start with a completely arbitrary torus or any arbitrary surface inside of an Engel manifold, what we generically expect is to see a finite collection of W tangencies. In fact, these W tangencies are W tangencies are, well, if we just mod out the tangent bundle to get the normal bundle, they really correspond to zeros of a section of the normal bundle. So there are finitely many of them. And precisely when the normal Euler characteristic is zero, turns out we can cancel these in pairs. That's not too hard to do. So let's assume we've done that. And then We can, once we know our surface is transverse to W, well, we can just take a normal vector field of the surface that's also transverse to the W, and we can push it in that direction. And when we do that, we get a, say, a germ of a three-manifold that's transverse to W. It'll be something diffeomorphic to the surface cross R. And Well, once we've got that, as we've already seen in the discussion of half, sorry, in the discussion of even contact structures, that manifold will automatically inherit a contact structure. So now we have a surface and a contact manifold. And once you've got that, there are all kinds of tools from contact topology that we can bring to bear on this. So the first observation. First observation is that by a C infinity small perturbation of the surface inside of a three-manifold n, we can assume it's convex. And now, what does a contact topologist want to do once he has a convex surface? Well, that convex surface has a dividing set, and you want to simplify the dividing set. It's a one-manifold, and you want it to be as simple a one-manifold as possible. So, what we want to do is to Well, the canonical way to simplify the dividing set after Honda's work on lens spaces and such is we want to find bypass disks. So the well, what's this bypass operation? Well, we find a suitable arc inside of our surface, and if we can find a half-disk. We can find a half-disk that's attached transversely to the surface along the arc and satisfies certain conditions. Then we can push the surface across that disk and simplify the dividing set that way. But then the problem that always arises is how do you know which arcs extend to these nice bypass disks? And that is in general a difficult problem. So it might seem surprising. It might seem surprising that in our context, bypass disks always exist. You can always find bypass disks wherever you want them. So that is a rather simple and yet very powerful trick. So let me explain it. So to begin with, we start with a bypass arc inside. With a bypass arc inside of our surface, inside of our contact 3 manifold, which is itself inside of our angle manifold. But we'll forget about the angle manifold for a moment. And then the bypass arc is characterized by having a standard local model, which we can take to be this. So, first of all, we have R3 with contact form given this way. Form given this way. It's tight. We can think of it if we like as the universal cover of the standard tight contact structure in the three Taurus. But well, we can also think about its front projection. That's what I really want to think about. And so now, if you have a, well, in the usual contact structure, in the usual front projection, we have, as you go. As you go into the in or out of the screen, the contact planes rotate through a full turn, or sorry, a half turn, pi radians. The only difference with this thing we're talking about now is that if we do the front projection, well, the planes keep rotating infinitely often. So we have to compensate for that. But other than that, we can do front projections the same way. Can do front projections the same way. And okay, so now we have our contact three meter from the surface I want to model by the xy plane inside of here. And inside of that surface, we have the interval from negative pi to pi on the x-axis. And that's supposed to be our bypass arc. So just as a check that this all Is a check that this all works the way we want it to to see that this really has the right properties. Well, there's this unit vertical vector field parallel to the z-axis that obviously preserves the contact structure and it's obviously transverse to the x-y plane. So that is the contact vector field exhibiting the plane as being convex and then the Then the dividing set of that is where the contact planes are vertical, which happens when x is an arbitrary multiple of pi. So then our contact form is just plus or minus dy, and then this thing is vertical. So then that dividing set intersects C transversely in exactly three points, namely the two endpoints and the origin. So in fact, So, in fact, this model looks just like we want it to. And so now what I want to do is exhibit a bypass disk here, and so I'll exhibit. So I'll exhibit it as a front projection. And since Valentine's Day was just a few weeks ago, there is my Legendrean knot, or my Legendrean arc. And so what I claim is that this is a smooth Legendrean arc with the same endpoints as our bypass arc C. So in the front projection, first of all, the xy plane is going to project, we're projecting out the y-axis, sorry, we're projecting out the x-axis, projecting onto the y-axis. So it just becomes a line. And of course, this segment on the x-axis is projecting to the origin. And now this Legendrean curve here, well, at this end point, it's vertical. Point, it's vertical, so that's x equals pi. And then as the slope gets less steep, we're heading into the screen until at the vertical slope, we pass through the yz plane and we're behind the yz plane for a while. The slope gets steeper again until finally we come back to the yzz plane traveling in the positive x direction. And we keep going in the positive x direction, but gradually level. But gradually level off, but go back into the YZ plane again behind the screen, and then we come back and hit the x-axis at negative pi. So that, in fact, is a smooth arc with the same endpoints as C. And so together, they're obviously forming an unknot, which means they span some disk. And furthermore, the next thing to ask is. To ask is what's the first and bank invariant of this boundary circle? And in fact, it's negative one. I'll leave it to you to check it. But basically, if you push off in the direction transverse to x, well, the two cusps, it turns out, contribute canceling half twists. Turns out contribute canceling half twists. But if you traverse C, then there's this full rotation that we see in the one form, and that contributes the negative full twist that makes T be equal negative one. Well, since we're in a tight contact structure now, it follows that the dividing set of that disk is a single arc hitting C in two points. And so, in fact, this is exactly what we want for a bipedal. Want for a bypass. Well, so what is that disk then? Well, it looks perfect right here along C where it meets our surface. But then there's this big problem that as we move around the disk, we hit this other arc. This other arc is where it crashes through the original surface in a place we don't want it to crash through. And so, if we were just doing contact topology now, we'd be really stuck. We'd just this just wouldn't work at all. But here's where we remember that we're actually in a four-manifold. And so, what we're going to do is take this disk, think of it as being exactly what I've described here near C, but as we move upward away from C, we're going to push just a little. We're going to push just a little bit into that W direction that we can't see in the model. And so by the time we get back around here, that intersection is gone because now those arcs are at two different values of W. And so we've gotten rid of the intersection. Well, of course, we've fallen out of the three-manifold that was our original model, but that doesn't make. But that doesn't matter because we don't actually care about that three-manifold. What we care about is the surface. And so, what I'm going to do is define a new contact three-manifold. It looks just the same as before in some smaller neighborhood of the surface. But as we move away, it follows the disk extending in the direction transverse to W. And so then, once again, the disk. Once again, the disk and the surface lie in this one contact three manifold, which we can still visualize here because it has a local contact amorphism that it's got a local contact amorphism into our original model, but it's just not one-to-one on the disk. It's pushing the disk in from a slightly different value of y. But still, we can see that disk, we can see that it's there, and in that. There and in that new contact three manifold, we can push along the bypass, and so that means we can do bypasses wherever we want. Again, these are not usual bypasses in the sense that we had to change our three-manifold. So maybe I should give these a new name. And I'm thinking this should be called a coronary bypass. But anyway. Anyway, was there a question or just a comment? Just a general objection to the term. Sorry. So anyway, now that we see that, I can actually sketch out how you would go about making a torus transverse. So now we've got, we assume our surface is a torus for the last. Our surface is a torus for the last little bit, we didn't have to. But once we have a torus, then since we can do bypasses everywhere, we want to do bypasses. Well, we can simplify the dividing set until it just consists of two parallel curves, our sort of standard model of a torus. Taurus. So they're two dividing curves. And I'm going to assume, well, by the flexibility theorem, we can assume they're two closed leaves. And we're going to take those closed leaves to run in the same direction. Let's see what's going on with this. Oh, I'm missing it. Okay. So here's the picture I want to see now. We have our torus, and the important thing is we've got a nice non-singular foliation. A nice non-singular foliation that's running always around the torus transverse to the vertical circles. So we get that just by basic contact topology once we know we can do bypasses anywhere we want them. And all right, so because this is a non-singular foliation, we know that the surface is transverse to the Transverse to the contact planes in the three-manifold, which is the same as saying it's transverse to the three-plane field in the angle of the four-manifold. But it's still not transverse to the two-plane field because remember what the two-plane field looks like in this picture. It's going to project into the three-manifold as a line field inside of C. And we haven't said anything about where that line field is. Said anything about where that line field is. So it could be spinning around in all sorts of crazy ways inside of C as we move along these leaves of foliation. But we can fix that as well. Now, the problem we have is that if we perturb Is that if we perturb, if we try to perturb the lines, if we try to move those lines, we're moving in the w direction, and we've already got lots of sheets of this stacked up in the w direction from all the bypasses. So we're not allowed to move that thing very far. You can at least push it enough to see that L is tangent to QC L is tangent to the surface rather. L is tangent to the surface, rather, along a one-manifold, and then even though we can't move L very much, we can move the tangent spaces to F. So, what we do is take some arc that's transverse to the foliation, and we leave the arc fixed, but twist its normal directions so that the normal directions change a lot relative to L. And by playing games like that, we can simplify the tangencies of L to C. Tangencies of L to sigma so that they're just a bunch of vertical circles all transverse to the foliation, so, like these red curves here. And then what we want to do is we want to take each one of these white endula between two red curves and now it. And now it has a local model. These curves, these defoliation just runs transversely through it. So we can just take a local model where these are constant Z curves. And so then in that local model, we, well, what we want to do is let Z be constant and look in the W direction instead. And what we see there, once we're in W X Y space, is remember that we've got this. that we've got this this other contact form beta and so one of these one of these leaves is just a curve in wxy space which is legendary in at the two endpoints and transverse in the middle well there's a standard way of taking such a curve and and making it legendarian by putting a tight little legendrean spiral from Putting a tight little agendrine spiral from here to here. So we just do that, parametrized by a circle in each one of these white annuli. And now all the leaves are tangent to the kernel of beta. Well, we've moved them a little so they're no longer quite tangent to the kernel of alpha, but with a little diddling around, we can straighten everything up at this point. So then these These curves are actually in the intersection of the two kernels, which is the plane field D, and that's exactly what we want. So that completes the proof and completes the talk as well. Thank you. Are there any other questions? Bob, can I ask some question? Yes. So, the thing I didn't quite understand is: so, you have some sort of bypass, and bypasses are generally if you don't care whether it's embedded or not, right? It usually comes for free, right? And then you're saying you're doing some sort of operation to perturb. I didn't quite understand how you do this, getting rid of the intersection part. Oh, how to get rid of the intersection in four-dimensional space? Yeah, okay. So the okay, so we see this model in three-dimensional space, and what we want to do is perturb this disk, and so we're going to leave it fixed close to C. But then as we move away from C up in this direction, what we're going to do is push just a tiny little bit in the Do is push just a tiny little bit in the fourth coordinate, the W coordinate. So that's pushed out of our model in the direction we can't see very well. And we just keep pushing a little so that by the time we get around to here, the disk D is no longer in our three-dimensional space that we were in before. It's been pushed out a little bit. So our disk has been pushed out of the model when we do that. But at least near C. Near C, it's just what it was before. It looks just like we need. So, what we do is change our three manifold. We leave the three manifold the same really close to sigma, but then we throw away, well, what we do is, yeah, we cut it off here and then extend it in a new direction. We move it sort of, we push it a little bit out of this three-dimensional space so that we. So, that we get a new three-plane which is still transverse to W. And the way we see it in this picture is that we conject it, we can project it back into our original picture contactomorphically, locally contactomorphically, but now it's no longer one-to-one on most of the disk because most of the disk is sitting out in a parallel contact manner. Okay, I think I understand. So, you're using there's some. I understand. So you're using there's some freedom to move the three modes. Okay, yeah, it's sometimes it's really helpful to know that that fourth direction is there when you need it. Thank you. Jake, did you have a question? Yeah, are there any sort of local surgical modifications that having a transverse torus to the angle structure would let you do to produce new angle structures on? Angle structures on new four manifolds? Yeah, that is a yeah, I haven't actually thought a whole lot about it. Other people have thought about in certain circumstances, you can get transverse tori. Like if you have a if you have a suitable circle, you can find transverse tori near that circle. And so, one game that can be played is there's an angle that's twist that you can do. Let's see, that was Del Pino and Fogel, I believe. They invented this angle Litz twist, where it's basically a Litz twist cross S1. You look at how you make a Litz twist near a transverse circle. You're a transverse circle, and you just cross the whole picture with S1. And then they actually use that in their construction of what they call over-twisted angle structures, which satisfy the H principle. So that's sort of one direction you can take this. But then, as far as surgery, I mean, yeah, one might hope to do things like logarithmic transformations or the Finchell-Stern construction. Or, you know, the finish hell stern construction, or you know, something like that. And I actually haven't given it much thought at this point. I guess, really, the main question is, first of all, are there any tight angle manifolds to play around with to begin with? And then it becomes an interesting question. Nice. Were there any further questions? So a follow-up question. So, a follow-up question actually there. So, do you think this kind of argument then can be helpful to also understand exotic structures and four manifolds? Exotic smooth structure, you mean? Yeah, that's another wide open question. I don't know anything about that. The angle topology is still in a rather primitive state that we don't even know that tight angle structures exist. And one would hope that they exist and that they tell us something. They exist and that they tell us something about smooth topology being something that's sort of intrinsically connected to four manifolds. But that's, you know, these questions are, as Claire Poves would say, getting into the realm of science fiction at this point. But, you know, that's what we can hope for. Maybe that's maybe in 2032, we can all be talking about this sort of thing. sort of thing maybe you have time for one last question if there is one um yeah maybe one maybe i missed that um do you have any understanding of injectivity in the sense that maybe you take two logent representatives maybe max db of of the same smooth knot and you create the half legendary tori you transverse push off them I you transverse push off them. Are they transverse isotopic? This sort of questions. Well, of course, the transverse pushoff in angle manifolds is pretty much the obvious extension of what it is in contact-free manifolds. So if you were to take a half-Legendrean
