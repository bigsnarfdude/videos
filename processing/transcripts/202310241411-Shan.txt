I've been enjoying my stay here tremendously. So I plan to talk about turn insulators from experimentalist point of view. Since I'm one of the two experimentalists and the last experimentalist speaker, I would like to give you kind of a summary of the current experimental capabilities and then move on to my experiment. On my experiment. So, this is kind of the general scheme of how in different labs people make maurine materials. So, we start with usually a crystal of millimeter to centimeter size, and then we expool it down to very thin layers. Then, using optics, we can determine the layer thickness, crystal graphic orientation. Crystal graphic orientation, and then you can come in with a polymer stamp, pick them up layer by layer with a precision of less than micron in XY, XY, and then in terms of angle, something like active precision. So then you have a spec. Next, we do, we shape Shape the structure and pattern it. So you can put the leads on, the channel, and maybe gates. So this is kind of a typical device. And note that the scale bar here is 10 microns. And this is like a typical side view. So in the middle, we have the material of interest. And then we usually use hydronoboronitride as dielectric material. Material for the gates. Metallic gate could be real metal or feudal graphite. The thickness vary from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. So screening could be important from the metallic gates. And yesterday we talked about the dielectric constant, that's the hazagnobol nitride backlog dielectric constant. So a lot has already been said about the tunability of the Marais system. So we can change correlation, topological properties, even lattice type. And Hamiltonian described the system. Ellen said that yesterday each is like the Moray atom and because we have two gates, these two degrees. These two degrees of freedom give us the independent control of the charge density and also a vertical electrical field that can tune the system parameters. So we can put ranging from zero to many charge per Mori unit cell. So this gives you a periodic table of Moray atoms and helps you to scan. Atoms and help you to scan through many interesting phases in a single device. And the platform is also good not just for electrons and also for bosons. So some of the current capabilities and the limitations. So in terms of the sample quality, we do have Moray disorder. That means at different locations, the twisting angle is different. And this is a The threat. And this is a particular problem for homo bilayers, and that applies to a twisted bilayer graphene and also this twisted homo bilayer of transition metal dicharcogenides. We are against the nature, so this is something that experimentalists are struggling. But you know, with hero bilayer, like what Pink Fi showed you yesterday, you can get I showed you yesterday, you can get a beautiful TEM picture of atoms and the Moray structures. And this is because the Moray period is determined by lattice mismatch between the two materials. So with heterobile, we get more uniform regeneral Moray structure. Can I ask, is there an improvement in reducing the disorder? Yeah, in the heterobio layers. Heterobilayers or Homo? Homo, again. Homo, yeah, yeah. So, of course, you know, over the years, since the first TPG work, you know, different labs, different students, postdocs are working very hard to come up with tricks to make more homogeneous samples, you know, using AFM, something like to sweep, to massage, you know. To massage, you know, but you know, we are against the nature, you know, this is something that they don't like to be, so it is hard. And then there's a string, you know, string could be used to create interesting patterns, but often we have unintentional string, so that will also introduce inhomogeneity, defects, impurities in the material itself. But we are reasonably good with this, especially with baffling. You know, you can have less than a single defect over many marine periods. And the typical size is on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 lanes size. That's micron, a few micron size. Tunability, this is something we are good at. I already mentioned about the doping density, so you can About the domain density. So you can tune continuously over many events. We can change the system parameters, you know, hopping, on-site, long-range, coulomb interaction, turn number, by those gates. And recent development with this quantum twister microscope, you know, putting two layers, one non-moving, the other one on AFM, and you can Or AFM, and you can introduce relative rotation between the two layers that continuously tune through the tested angle while doing the measurement. And this is something can be done with graphene, but with TMBs still needs to be done. The thermal energy can be reached at much lower. A much lower value than any of those energy skills. Oops. What did I do? Sorry about that. Yeah. So I was saying. Yeah, um so I was saying you know thermal excitation can be uh much lower than any any of the energy scales in the system so you can reach the ground state. Uh lattice type but triangular and hexagonal can be done easily but other lattice symmetry types still difficult. That's because of the intrinsic symmetry of those starting materials. In terms of probes, we can do electrical transport measurements straightforwardly with the flating system, but with the TMDs, because we have large gap material, it's difficult to put context on those materials because of the large gap. Experimental methods have been developed to put a good context. To put a good context on certain types of TMDs or combinations, but this is still very limited. Optical measurements are good for TMD materials because we are talking about one to two EV gap. But with graphing, it's difficult because interesting things happen in the mid and high infrared. So we don't have good sources and detectors. Magnetic. Magnetical properties, you know, probe time reversal symmetry working with TMD. You heard Ginfi talking about magneto-circular dichrism in the reflection geometry. So this is very sensitive to time reversal symmetry breaking. With one thing, you can do transport looking at anonymous call. Sorry. Yeah, that's what I mean. And then you can do a squid measurement, for example. Thermodynamics, we can measure electronic compressibility, chemical potential for both systems. Site-resolved measurements are still quite limited, especially with materials with two gates because it's invetted. Two gates because it's invented. So if you don't require two gates, there have been beautiful experiments showing STM results, but with two gates, it's a little hard. Thermal transport, spin transport, very, very hard. So that's something we're still working on. So with this summary, next I would like to Next, I would like to move on to the topic of today's discussion about the integer nephractional quantum Hall states at zero magnetic field. So I totally agree with Cynthio that integer nephractional quantum Hall effects are some of the most profound and beautiful discoveries of physics of last century. Of the last century. And I don't need to go through the details. So I just want to draw your attention to the experimental signatures. So if you measure heart resistance, we see those plateaus at those fillings, and that's the filling for the ground electrodes. In the 2D electron gas under magnetic field, you can tune through them by tuning the magnetic field. them by tuning the magnetic field. And correspondingly, you get dip in the longitudinal resistance. So this is something to look for in the experiment. So very early on after observing the interto-pony hall, people have already asked whether you can observe this effect under zero magnetic field. Zero magnetic field. And there is this toy model proposed by Hodan. You can do the analog or Landau level to be two bands. And in that case, if you are in the right regime, you should be able to observe quantum Hall effect at a zero magnetic field. And we call this state term insulin state. And a little bit later, you know, there are. A little bit later, there are other studies, Fourier model studies of the fractional quantum analysis effect. So Moray comes in very conveniently. So Alan mentioned yesterday that in the long wavelength limit, if we put Moray periodicity on a semiconductor. Periodicity on a semiconductor, in this case, we can generate a very flat band. So from the bouillon zone to mini bouillon zone. If this band is isolated or decoupled from the rest, then we can project the physics to something like a Hubble model. And in this case, this band is not topological. So, in order to introduce topology, we need two bands, and if you can intertwine the two bands, it is possible to get non-zero churn number. So, for example, you know, this band would be plus one for the k value, and this would be minus one for the same value, and if you go to the other value, it will be minus one plus one. So, here is kind of a cartoonish realization of Realization of this kind of model. So let's imagine we have binary orbital of one layer. I'm showing them in green, sitting in this triangle. And then the one-year orbital from the other layer, for example, they also form a triangular lattice, but you know, different the sub-lattice of the honeycomb. So they together form a honeycomb, but you know. Form a honeycomb, but you know, each triangle reside in a separate layer. So, in that case, the hopping of intra-layer hopping and interlayer hopping. So, this so this, you know, if we have a plus one and minus one at home bands, we just have two copies. We just have two copies of the Hauden model. So, this is the K-Malay model. So, you can get topological effects. So, for example, when the two states are hybridized, we get those non-zero turn numbers. Then, if we fully fill the top band, then we get the quantum spin hog insulator. And then, if we And then, if we half-fill the first band and the interaction is strong, then potentially you can get the quantum anomaly part effect, which is then integer translator. And when the interaction is so strong and your quantum geometry is correct, that it is also possible to get interaction-driven fractional term misled states. And in this And in this system, because the two states live in two layers, you can apply a vertical electrical field to put them at different potential. And when the field is large enough to layer polarize the states and the two states are no longer coupled, then you get into non-topological states. So, this is a knob to use to study a topological phase transition. Okay, and this idea has been proposed earlier by Alan and his former student Fenken a few years back. So this is the case of a twisted moly pterolyte at a small angle about one degree-ish. About one degree-ish. And this is the result of a continuum model with parameters from the initial percolation DFT. And Alan described how to get something like this yesterday. So we have, you know, turn minus one, one states in this case. And this picture shows the distribution of a barycurvature. So the system. So, the system has the potential to demonstrate the interesting states I just discussed. And here's another example a few years later demonstrated by Liang Fu's group on twisted tungsten solenite using the same technique. And the general conclusion is similar, but in this case the bands are a little more dispersive, you know, for similar angle. Similar angle, but for some angle you can get something very flat. I also want to mention one other fact. If you just look at the turn number, so for very small angle, you have two topological bands. But when you get into large angle, I think it's similar for Alan's case, you know, you get three topological bands. Topological bands, you know, plus one, plus one, and minus two. So three bands are relevant. So that's kind of the early theoretical studies. So we went ahead and searched for different experimental realization of the effects. So we realized the key ingredients. We realize the key ingredient is to hybridize two bands from two different materials and they form some kind of a honeycomb structure. And this is a system we initially find in experiment. And we like it very much because it's a hetero bilayer, so we can get a very uniform samples. And we work very hard to develop context to this material. This material. And after some work, we were able to do a transform measurement on this type of device. So because the band alignment initially is such that the two bands are pretty far away. But if you apply a large displacement field, you can invert the bands and make them topological. So here's some examples of the Topological. So here's some experimental evidence to show that this system indeed gives you non-zero troll bank. So this is just one type of measurement. So we park a filling at 2. So in that case, we expect to see point in spin hole, and you have a helical edge state. And ideally, you would like to do. And ideally, you would like to do spin transport. Since we cannot do it, so we just measure full-terminal resistance as showing in this picture. So at the small electrical field, we are in this case, it's a band insulator. So when you lower temperature, resistance goes up like crazy. But now at this critical electrical field, we hybridize the two bands. And at low time, Two bands. And at low temperature, the photominal resistance reaches reasonably well quantized value of H over 2E squared because we have two channels. And we've also done non-local measurements and other experiments to support that this indeed is a point speed fault. So, next, and of course, is to And of course is to go half filling of this band and in this case you know expect to see a quantum anomalous Hall effect and this is the result. So below temperature about 2 Kelvin you can see that the Hall resistance is very well quantized. It's H over E squared and you see the robust piece vises. Histus. And at the same time, you know, the longitudinal resistance becomes very small. So, this is the signature we have seen earlier in Point-Hall effect, but this happens at the zero magnetic field. And the quantization stays reasonably well around about 0.2 Kelvin, and the magnetism actually survives at much higher temperatures. Survives at much higher temperature, 67. Whatever electric field here. Yeah, so this is tuning to this case. But once you apply electric field away from this range, then you kill the state. It becomes insulable. So, and this system also has an insulating state at a fraction of filling, but unfortunately. But unfortunately, those states are not fractional churn insulator. So we've looked, looked, we haven't been able to find any FCI in this system. And I think, you know, we sort of understand why. And this is showing in this cartoon. So we have a relatively flat moly band, but we have a rather dispersive tungsten band. So the So the bands probably are not flat enough. That's one of the reasons I think we didn't see FCI here. So how long does the dynamarization survive when you dope? This I would say 10%-ish, but I need to look at the data. Yeah. So um now it is time to uh go back to uh what's originally been studied in you know these models. So we would like to research for integer and the fractional transistors in the twisted homo bodies. And this is a kind of a typical electrostatic phase diagram. Electrostatic phase diagram as a function of filling and displacement field. So when the displacement field is relatively small, the two layers stay hybridized and in that case you can get non-zero term bands. But then if you apply a too large displacement field, the states become layer polarized, then you kill the states. So we understand that this is the phase base where we need to look. And how about the experimental signatures? A few things we can do. We can measure x, y, the Hall resistance, and the longitudinal resistance. So if the Hall resistance is quantized, H over E squared quantum divided by the Philly. Divide by the filling, and then the corresponding longitudinal resistance is anish. So that's one way to look for FCI. And another way is to look at the thermodynamics. So measure chemical potential. As Alan mentioned, there will be a jump in the chemical potential when you have the insulating state. And then when you apply a magnetic field, it's like adding Like adding flux into the system, then you should see that insulin state will shift. So, equivalently, adding one point of flux to the system is like adding T more charge. So, by looking at this, we can also tell whether this is FCI or not. So, this summer, there have been This summer, there have been quite a few papers. So the transport signature of FCI has been reported by two groups, the Shaotong Shu's group at the Washington and also this Ting Jing Li's group at Shanghai Jiao University. And in terms of thermodynamics measurements, we did some studies at Some studies and the Washington group also look at the photoluminescence emission from this. So indeed SDI has been observed in this system both from transport and thermodynamics. So next I would like to describe our studies. But before I do that, I just want to put the I just want to put the different results on a single page. So those are the systems that integer churn insulators have been observed. So magnetic doped TI, that's the Tsinghua work, intrinsic magnetic TI, that's from Fudan. Graphene array, this has been shown. Good times at this conference from Stanford and UC Santa Barbara and AB stacked moly terrorite and constant satellite from our lab. Fractional term, but now of course also added twisted moly terroid. Fractional term, you know, initially there's some indication in twisted baleography from Amir Kovis group. Amir Covis group are looking at the compressibility under magnetic fields above five Tesla, that you talked about this morning, and the small angle twisted a multi-terrolite. And then you heard from Sendio this exciting result from IMIT of five-layer ABC graphene on HPF, and they have seen many more FTIs. Okay. Okay, so now I would like to talk a little bit about the local compressibility measurement, a new technique that we developed in our group. So I told you that in this case you need to have the sample embedded in two gates. And the usual compressibility measurement, you know, often you come in with a CT tip. So that that's not. That's not available because it's embedded. So we developed this optical readout of electronic compressibility. So this is pretty much just like a doing transport, but in terms of this contacts, but it gives us the capability of coming probe local. Probe locally. This is very important with the disordered samples. So the idea is pretty straightforward in this case. So in addition to the dual gate device structure, we introduce another layer, which is a single layer of a TMD, very clean one. And then you connect them electrically. And then you connect them electrically like this. So, by just this scheme, you know that the chemical potential of the sample and the chemical potential of this TMD layer are locked by the voltage you apply and also the geometrical capacitance in your system. So, if I can measure my chemical potential of my this sensor layer, then I know. Sensorier, then I know the chemical potential of the sample I'm going to measure. And so the next ingredient is how to read out the chemical potential of the sensor layer. And we use the property that this material, the optical material, is very sensitive to doping or to shift of chemical potential. So you can think of this as like an edge sensor, and then you can read out. And then you can read out from optical reflection. So we use this as feedback, and this gives us the chance to read out the chemical potential in the sample. So let me just show you. And this has a very high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and you can also be imaging. Okay, so here are some results. Okay, so here are some results. So, this is the chemical potential as a function of the whole doping density. And you can see some jumps. And if you take a derivative, you can see peaks a little bit better. So, if you look at this jump size, you know, it gives you chemical potential change at a filling equal to 1 on the order of 5 milliV. And for this 2-third states, the chemical potential jump is around 1. Is around one millEV. And we can also look at reflection of MCD, magneto circular dichlorism, and you see this hysteresis loop. And this is just noise. This is due to the main. So at filling one and the two-thirds, you have broken time-reversal symmetry. And then we can apply magnetic field and see how the How the you know, compressible income, see how the insulin states evolve with magnetic field, and from the soap, you can determine what is that quantum number T. And indeed, this is very close to two-thirds, and this is close to one. Okay, and we look at other examples. Look at other examples. So, for example, you know, this is a little bit different to twisted angle. You can see this filling equal to one state disperse with slope one, two-thirds. And then if some imagination, maybe there is three divided by five. I'm not going to quote this. But then they have two other insulin states at once. Other insulating states at one third and one quarter, they do not disperse with magnetic field within our experimental certainty. So they are likely charge-densid. Okay, Alan asked me to finish. So I just want to comment that we do not see symmetry about one half. One half, it's asymmetric. So perhaps it's unlike Lambda folks. And here's some transport results. So that's from our lab. You see this plateau at 3 over 2 HOV squared, and that's the integer one. And this is really consistent with the Washington. the Washington results and also the Shanghai Jiao Tongue results, you know, those plateaus, this plateau, at 230. Okay, I can quickly go through some of the dispersive field induced quantum phase transition. So here is a compressibility incompressibility map. Incompressibility map for a 3.4-degree sample, and you can see the insulin state line up as those red lines. We see one, two-thirds, one-third, one-quarter in this case. And on the right, we show the spontaneous MCD, but that's ferromagnetism. And you can see that the magnetism sort of extends to somewhere, you know. TO somewhere, you know, around this filling, and that's temperature 1.6, you know, and lower temperature, maybe more. So, we did a careful study of the magnetic susceptibility as function of temperature, determining the QA wise temperature throughout this filling range, and the TC is the ordering temperature. So, they sort of Ordering temperature. So they sort of agree with each other and sort of magnetism sort of disappear around 0.4 inch filling and 1.6 Kelvin. So let's just quickly take a look at the sum of the phase transition. So fitting equal to 1 and so the top I'm showing magnetism. So the black is the So, the black is the Curieweiss temperature, and the red is the ordering temperature. And the bottom is the chemical potential jump of the insulating state. So, I'm tuning the displacement field, and in the middle is the layer hybridized regime, and outside is polarized. So, you can see that those two transitions pretty much occur at the same time. Pretty much occur at the same critical electrical field. In the middle, we have turned insulator and it's ferromagnetic. Outside it becomes insulator, likely a mod insulator, and it's non-magnetic. It's likely non-ferromagnetic, it's likely anti-ferromagnetic. And then we see this dip in the gap size. So maybe if sample is. If sample is cleaner enough, you see a dip down to zero. So that means we'll be gap closure and some continuous phase transition. That's the case for two-thirds. Adam probably wants me to stop. I just mentioned two-thirds, then I'll stop. Okay. So for two-thirds, if you look at the The gap size, you know, in the layer hybridized regime, it's not zero, outside it is zero. So again, the two transitions occur at the same critical electrical fields. In the middle, it's FCI and the ferromagnetic, and outside, it becomes compressible because the gap disappears. And we combine with our transport and the Washington Coastal Transport, it shows insulating behavior around this critical field. So most likely this is some kind of an Anderson insulator. And we see continuous closure of charge gap at this field. And for one-third, it's likely It's likely C D W to C D W. So I'll skip that and I'll put up my summary. So we observe zero field turn and a fractional turn in TMD Marais in those systems. In terms of FCI, so far has been reported at two-thirds, three-fifths, and over a pretty wide angle range. Angle range from two to four degrees. That's from our studies. It's really exciting. So you ask, you know, whether there could be some billion states, states at higher temperature, you know, can you use this for quantum computing? But really, experimenters like myself shout very loud. We have to look, you know. We are to look, you know. I shared with you a little bit of our dirty secret that, you know, with those heliobilayers, very reliable. We have many samples showing good quantization and everything, but with this twisted multi-terabyte, the yield is very low, single digits in terms of percentage, and because you require good contacts over an area of Over an area of uniform moray. So that's the current status. So a little help from folks here will be very, very helpful. So I'll stop here and then maybe just show. Yeah, so those guys play the key role. Former student, Kaifeng, graduate student, Gen Zhao, and the postdoc. and the post-duff ehao.
