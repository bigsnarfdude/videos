And maps this into using power scale. And what it does, it takes the trajectory x solution. So there is a linear system and takes it into just values exit c1, exit c two, and so now c two. Okay, so Okay, so basically I assume that we have some starting point, that we find the horizon, and compact control. So essentially, like you're not writing too far away. So the image of this is open just in simplicity, you know, let's assume that our Let's assume that our controls are just open boundaries, etc. Open context, etc. This is open ball and this convex boundary convex boundary domain. Corporate party domain. And then we have the images of obstacles. So we'll still be calling the obstacles OG sitting in this V K right the I will just give it this name Oj, it's just the collection of all vectors x1 up to xj such that xj is sitting in our obstacle j. So we started with the starting with this picture O1, O2, O3. Those are sits in the nature of our spaces V. But now we're considering like all possible other coordinates. So it still will be a fine linear subspace there of the same co-dimension. So co-dimension of j will be still CJ plus y. In this case, so that there's all different co-dimensions. Yeah, principally that could be different. This is the situation. So this is the ball. So we are not going outside this ball and we are not trying not to hit those subspaces. Some subspaces may be just too far away. Some such spaces may be just too far away. One of these poles, the slalom slope, will be just positioned strongly. You cannot get there. Of course, it can be allowed. This is the situation we want to consider. Again, we consider this augmented obstacles. So this each obstacle plus V minus our wall. So take this obstacle and add. So take this obstacle and add everything outside. So now we get the union of the obstacles which look like that. So this is all star one. This will be all star two, and so on. And as I mentioned, to compute the cohomology, what we wanted, we'll get the cohomology of, again, what we know is that cohomology of the obstacle where you path, because this is quantum equivalent to our whole minus union of those OJ's. This is our Motob equivalence, just evaluation map. That's this Motob equivalence. This is sort of analytic statement. And this will be, this is a duality. It will be n, this is the overall dimension of So, the overall dimension of the union of this OJ star. For example, it tells you: okay, so if you want to split the sphere into two pieces, you have to create a loop there. You have to create something which has non-trivial first homology. So if this set has, you know, this is H. You know, this is H1 is non-trivial, right? And it tells you, so this is one, so this is two-dimensional sphere, this zero-dimension two. So it means that h2 minus one minus one, so zero-dimensional homology now gets an extra dimension. So yeah, we get an extra component here. If what we are removing is If what you're removing is a point, so you have something with zero dimension homology, then you're generating something with dimension one. Indeed, you're creating a class, not quite here, but you need to have some point to begin with. That's what happens. You have to create a class, you have to remove a base point, like you should have a base point there to work. So we can. So, again, this design of duality relates the homology in one dimension and the homology of approximately complementary dimension in the sphere. This is hugely useful. Because it allows you to go from this open set into this closed set. This is the standard trick. This is exactly the same trick which, say, you know, Vasilyv used to define this finite type invariance of nodes. Rather than looking at the nodes, which are like Fizzy conditions of nodes, Which are like Fising condition of not itself intersecting. He was looking at the intersecting nodes, the nodes which, you know, heat the point, you know, like goes through heat through itself, it's self-intersection. This is, again, absolutely standard, but hugely useful trick when people use inside topology, and that's what we will be using. Okay. So now it seems that we have to study this case. We want to study this case, we want to study, you know. Study, you know, the study of homologies of this space. The union of these guys. So you have these guys. Again, you can imagine that they're sitting in a sphere. So this is my shaded area. This is this banded field here. Those are my obstacles. So I'm looking at the what happens at the homologies of this compact subset of the Of this compact subset of this large-dimensional sphere. And that's where the techniques of diagrams of spaces come into play. So, enter diagrams of spaces. So the engineer's species is again it's a sort of topological technique which people use a lot when they study topologies of various objects but you know not enough and especially not enough in like our like places like ours that can apply more applied parts so how it works the you know the diagrams of species is just what what it says you have this connection of It says. So you have this collection of spaces which, you know, and you want to study the unit. But, you know, they intersect. So, like, it's important how these guys intersect. So, like, imagine. So, if you have the sphere, this is your portion. You know, you have this one guy, another guy. So, like, what is the apology? How many loops are there? One, two, three looks, right? You have to save two guys. Behaving like that, you have just two loops. So, how these guys intersect? So, the guys themselves are not just all stories. You need to understand also how the guys intersect. So, you're not just looking at the diagrams of spaces, not just looking at the spaces, you look at what, you know, the overall intersections, right? So, you consider the intersectional lattice of these guys. You consider all possible intersections of these obstacles. This is good news because intersectional. Good news because intersection of these obstacles is something we know, it's the chains of obstacles. So if these obstacles intersect, so if there is intersection, means there is a trajectory which goes through both of them. So intersections, those guys correspond to obstacles, those guys correspond to intersections. The combinatoric of intersections is essentially captured by the combinatorics of our chains of obstacles. All good news. Okay, so what people say about those diagrams of spaces? Diagrams and pieces. So the language is quite, quite often, somewhat abstract, unnecessarily so. But the standard language is consider a small category and it's factor for the small category in the topological spaces. Forget about it. So you can see the partial order itself. Oh, the term. P taken or taken that's S sphere taken with all your partial model itself. So like points, you know, beating other points, you know. This is the JRL with This is the general, it's everybody else, and so on. So, this is partially what I'll say, something like this. Okay? And consider the mapping of this, each point is going to, so like this is point P, it's point Q. Consider the mapping from this into spaces, T, let's call it W P. W P is just apological space. Okay? And for each arrow, for example here we have this partial order set, partial order of zero transitivity, we say this is this, this is that, so we have also this arrow. So for each relation, for any pair P and Q, so if you have P and Q like that, then it should be mapping from one topological space into another topological space. And this connection So this connection is called the diagram of spaces. So this collection of data is called diagram of spaces. Okay? And once again, each vertex goes into some topological space and each arrow should be mapping the corresponding topological spaces. One standard example is, of course, this, you know, the lattice of intersection. So you have this, like, for example, you have these three spaces. A, B, and C. So you have this A, B, and C. There's no natural mapping from A, B to they are completely disjoint, right? Where we can take the intersection. Have the intersection, A, B. Those two guys. And this guy is an actual metric from this guy to A, right? Because it's subset, it's just they can end to B. Here they can end to B. This intersection AC and this intersection B C so B C again it might be empty somebody tells me it can be like that but they can form something like this. So this is partially ordered set, clearly and this partially ordered set, you know, like I know how to Like I know how to associate topological space to each of these guys, just spaces themselves. And we can take these guys on top of them as intersections and relational matrix for them, right? So I have a question. The staggering form on the top right, that's essentially the nerve. Yeah, yeah, like the nerve is a kind of topological space to which we'll come in the second. But you're right. The nerve will appear in the second. You're right. The North will appear in the second. Yeah, so if some spaces are empty, you know, I'm not contracient, I would like to introduce them, but no, why not? Might be an empty space. We can't, you know, format. It's allowed to do that. Anyway, so this particular diagram of spaces, so again, like, there might be more general diagram spaces, right? So the mapping state is not trivial. For example, we can't, like, one. Treatable. For example, we can't like one example of this another type of diagrams of species is diagram of species with the constant map. So we assume that each space is pointed, so there's a point there, right? Just. Well, each space has a point, right? So we have radio spaces. So we have video spaces, each of them has a point, and whenever we have a matrix, we just collapse everything to this one point. So constant matrix, also diagram of spaces. Both seems like more boring, but you know, as right to exist. Anyway, so but the diagrams of this So the if first, you know, for any mapping, so if first, any mapping P to U is just inclusion, like here, right? And the second, if you know, like we, you know the sort of form, you know. But sort of form, you know. We can consider the okay, so we can consider. So if all this EP is sitting at some bigger space, it's called X, and any intersection, so WP and WQ is sitting there, you know, is part is part of the diagram. Then such, you know, the Such, you know, if those definitions are satisfied, then those diagrams of species are called just called arrangements. The terminology and lots of facts are coming from this beautiful paper by Ziegler and Zimalovich. Which really lays out all the theory here. Anyway, so if you have this arrangement, so essentially all spaces are just like, you know, like split into, like, if you have maybe one space into another, you have just subspace. You know, one space is part of the other. Then it is a thing if people call, you know, so we have this, you know, we have this WPs and we have this name. And we have this lidings, LP F the Q of all readings, inclusions. Then we can form what is, you know, pretentiously called limit of this diagram. But in fact, it's just a union. We can form a big space W, which is the union of those W. I mean, again, the union is the sort of what, you know, so you have this guy, you have So you have this guy, you have this guy, we have the intersections, which is mapped into each of them. You can say, okay, so you can take this point, this point, this map here, just identify those two points. It's not also here, we identify those points. If we glue and call pieces together, we're gluing them part by part, and we'll get the union. So, again, this is called the limit of this diagram. The red limit of this diagram is W. That's the UN. Definitely you can. So, I have just a clarification for myself from the progression. So, he formed essentially a post-net category over topological spaces here with the maps FPQ and spaces built in W somewhere. The diagram of spaces from Funter into the cabin, getting you this limit here. Yes. Here. Yes. That's the whole. Right. Yeah. So if you have, yeah, so if those, in general, yeah, so we can always form the limit. You know, for any, if you take any point, take any point since MWP, you have this heading FPQ, and so it will go down to a point, x, fpq all to x. And we just identify those two points. So we'll take the disjoint union of those two spaces. So take all these unions and then identify each points which are mapped to each other. So then that's a continuous thing this category. Yeah, this is the code the limit of this of the diagram. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Those limits is what we want, obviously. But those are sort of hard to work here. Because there is nothing like. The problem is it's very... the substance is very The problem is it's very, the substance is very rigid. You cannot, you know. Imagine you change this f a little bit. And we like changing functions because they give us flexibility. But then the whole construction is completely messed. This rigidity, like the fixation, everything is so fixed, in some sense, just so, because that's what we want. We want this union, we want to understand the structure of this union. This is. This is, again, not flexible enough. Well, there's a reason people work with a different construct. So this is what we want for this union of our star obstacles. That's what we want. This is the topological space we want to understand. That's hard. So, what people do, they consider a different thesis, which is called Matopyl. Which is much harder to not harder, takes more work to define, it's much easier to work with. So, let me just briefly define it. We create a couple of results about those about the limits. About those minutes. Remember what happened here. So, here we just took these points and identified them. This point was glued too bad. We just said, okay, this is hological space. Just identify those two points at the same point. But the believer tells, you know, like not so fast. They say, you know what, if you've had this guy, you know, you have one. You have one WB and WU, you have a mimic F from one to another. You keep those spaces separate. You don't identify them. What you do, you have this space and this is another space. What you do is take the space and multiply it by sigma. You create a cylinder over the space. And then keep this space unblocked. So this is your WP, but this space. WP, but this case is also WP, but you just glue it to where F tells you to go. So you have this big construct, and again, the people who took their algebraic topology recognize, it's called so-called mapping cylinder. Biological space, which is called mapping cylinder of this map. So it looks like a like tall hat. Tall hat. That's why synonyms have all synods. So, okay. What happens if we have several of those guys? You know, like FPQ and FQR. That's because it's much in other set. Of course, we have, like, so we have not just one, not just two arrows, we have three arrows. Not just two arrows, we have three arrows, right? See, we have three medic cylinders. We have medicine for this, for that, and for this. What's okay? We'll keep all three of them. But what we'll do, we also take a triangle here and in some sense glue it. So we'll have this, you know, the cylinder there, this guy will be a cylinder there. It will be a compatible map from here to there. And then we'll just taking, you know, for each point here, it will take. So for each point here, it will take, you know, the point here will go, you know, like all the ways this way and that way, and it will take a triangle and glue it in. So we'll have this huge family of triangles, which will form some pretty typical, pretty unpleasant to look at, to define a topological space. This is called, you know, this space is called commodity limit. So yeah, commodity limit is a. Sorry, can you say what's the last thesis you had? So you really had five theses. For this equation, we have these pages. Let's just double these cases. So that is the test. We have WE, we have WQ, and we have WR, right? We have maybe from here to there, maybe from here to there. And we have, because it's more easy, so like the arrows. Morphism, so like the arrows should be commutative. So mapping from here to there will be compatible mapping from here to there, right? Composition of those arrows. So take any point here, it will go somewhere here, this point will go somewhere here, this point will also go at exactly the same point. You'll have this three, like by construction, we'll have this, this segment will be there in our topological space, this signment will be there, this sign will be there. We just edit them, right? But now we. Edit them, right? But now we also take this triangle and glue it in. For each point, you produce this triangle and identify the sides of this triangle with the sides which you already had from the previous step. Topology on the resulting space here? Yeah, so topology is like, again, there is a natural topology here, right? So this is topology of, you know, you can take the financial triangles by the trialized performance here, which is natural topology. Which is natural topology. Types have a topology. So you just take that and identify the sides. And if you have chains of errors, three errors, you have the simplets of three-dimensional siblings and so on and so forth. The result you can get somewhat ugly. Construction. Okay, so let's consider it like situation. You have these three lines. Three lines. It's W1, W2, W3. So our diagram will be looking. So this is intersection. So you'll have this line here, line there, line here, and point here, and it will be maybe cylinder 1, maybe cylinder 2, maybe cylinder 3. This is our homatophyte. The usual limit is this. This is our homatophyment. This is how Hamat would be able to. You see, it's more like more constructive construction material goes into it. But this is equivalent to that. Because, you know, you just take this tripod, this tripod, you know, if you have collapsed, it sucks back and backwards. This is... So let me just uh begin. This construction is uh not enough. So so the point of moving the triangles is so that the final space has the photographic type of WR instead of contact. Maybe cylinders will always have the like the bottom. Maybe accelerators are always collapsible to the bottom. Right, yeah, but when there is. Yeah, the same way. You don't do it in theory, of course. You first collapse with the top to the intermediate guy. But when there's two arrows coming out of the guy, then you can't do it right. Okay. There are those like degeneration operators and so on and so forth. So compatibility of everything is sort of taken care of by this slash. Anyway, so there you have this. There you have this guy and this construction and the the the nice part so let me just quickly the couple of theorems the first is called projection the game it's uh all materials are absolutely classical or by the six yes but you know like the accessible paper is uh by signatures of average The projection theramer is saying that this Matopyl unit had, you know, partition with this Matopyl linear from W partition was just this one. So the linear, so the union of these spaces is homotopy equivalent to the So, if we want to take the union of our species, then going passing the homotopy limit will not disturb our life. We'll get exactly the same homotopy time. Of course, the question is, why? Why are we doing that? Why are we doing some complicated construction rather than leading to the easy construction? The answer to the so-called apology, which says the following. So assume you have two diagrams of spaces. So with the same partial order set, the partial order set W the same, you have this, you know, you have this, you know, you have this collection document and you have collected W prime and FPQ. This is one diagram, and we have another diagram. So you have two diagrams. So two sets, two collections of topological spaces. And assume, let's assume that those spaces are the same. Let's assume that the spaces are the same, just the hapex are different. Assume that for any E dgq, this PQ is Hamatude equivalent to a plus PQ. So you have one mapping and you have another mapping, but you can always deform one into another. Always deform one into another. We don't ask about any compatibility conditions. So you can do it arrow by arrow. Everything can be done completely separately. This is the flexibility. So each of these pieces, each of these matrix, we can deform into something else. But then it turns out that the diagram for the W is for the Is for the one of them is material equivalent to the other. So taking those mappings and shifting them arbitrarily, just continuously, is not changing homotopy. Of course, there is no way to say what happens about, you know, like directly we couldn't, you know, say, like, it it won't be arrangement of spaces anymore. It would like be it's not an inclusion. It's not inclusive. It can be a completely different space, a completely different condition of methods. So, this is the extremely powerful result. And this is how used for so let me just quickly say how it can be used for like So let's consider some simple example which Fred was alluding to. So consider this diagram of spaces where this, you know, consider arrangements. Be it contractible or empty or empty WTs. So each intersection is called good cover, right? For example, something like this. So of all intersections, we have this AB, AC. Uh A C B C A B C Right So the find that all is contractual means we can replace each of this mapping by just mapping to a point. So essentially we can reduce each of these guys to a point and so we have this just point mapping to And so you have this just point mapped into these two spaces and another point mapped into so you have this collection of spaces. If this guy is contracts, we can pull them together, so you'll get a circle right away. You can see how to equip class of circle. Again, it's sort of not super important, but you know, this is how you reconstruct the NIRF. So this is contractible, then, you know, then this WP is called NIRF. is called nerve of this partial order set W. And again, it's just, you can think about the simplicial complex where for, you know, you just for, you know, like gluing, you know, you take the segment for each chip, for each for each chip, you take the point, you know. So this this Neuromo set turns out this motor to the union of those like the the the union of the the sin is Be the union of the sinities if all the sinities are compact. Anyway, let us go back to our situation. Our situation is you mentioned here that the front, you know, it doesn't even need to be the inclusion anymore, right? No, no, no, even the mm-hmm. And even the intersections that you can that's that's what how we will be using. We will be actually, you know, commatoping everything to a point. Everything to a point. So, like it will be constant map, not inclusion, just a constant map. It will be super super useful. Okay, so here's the really, you know, indicate this like run that looks like. So, this is super powerful Gautich Lamb. Assume again we have this diagram, this collection of topological species and maps and assumed. And assume that each of the spaces, each WQ has some, it's a pointed spaces. So each space will have a point. And each if you If Q is equivalent to this constant mapping isomatopic to the constant mapping from P into this point, everything is mapped into Q. So that's in a situation where they, like all our mappings, conclusions or something else, they can be just constructed to point. Then it is a remarkable formula that this diagram, this motobile This uh auto equilibrium on this diagram is auto-equivalent to the edge of some species which are very easy to describe. So gauge means you have the spaces which you glued at some point. So you have some electrons of spaces and each of them has a point but you glue them at this point. Sometimes called bouquet. Here the witch for all The pitch or the wall points, what we have here, we have the this is the nerve of W less than P, let's say separately this join. There's several options, right? W P. Okay. For the VH I already described, so VH. What the pH I already described, so pH of spaces, so pH of spaces A K is just to take the spaces AK, A1, K2, and so on, AK, and glue them at one point. So each of the spaces has a select point, you just identify this point as it's. Okay, what's delta? What's W? So this is just the partial order. Consider the this partial order itself. Maybe the The delta of partial order set is simplicial complex of chains, of L's and this other. Yeah, it's implicational components. Okay, so what happens is you take for any composable collection, so this means that this bits, this guy, this bits, this guy, and you glue in. This is like, and you glue in the simplex of the corresponding chain. So, whenever you have a chain of elements which feeds each other, you glue in a simplex of that. The distinctivity property of the partial ordered set means that every subset will be blue. So, what we have here, we'll take the partial ordered set, we'll take everything below element p. So, for example, w Your definite P is the part of a subset which is everything which is below P but not P. For example, if you have, if your partial border set is the again intersectional lettuce for three elements, without the bottom line. This is your functional data set. This guy meets everybody. So let's call it one. This is the largest area. So the W less than one, so this Less than one, so you take everything because everything is less than one and remove one. So you have this you have this six points and you glue in six edges, so you get a circle. The nerve of this partial of the set is a circle. Okay, this is okay. Again, this is completely curved. Is that guy? Again, this is completely combinatorial guy. We know everything about it. And the last one is just our space. What's this symbol? This symbol is the joint. The joint of two spaces. So you have two spaces A and B, you kind of imagine that they're sitting in two linear subspaces. Maybe like this. So nothing is linearly dependent with everything. So A and B. And then you add. And then you add a simple segment from any point here to any point there. So for example, the joint of they have two zero dimensional spheres, so one this is one zero dimensional sphere, this is another, and you add all possible synthesis, you get one dimensional sphere. You get one-dimensional sphere. You take the term of one-dimensional sphere and zero-dimensional spheres, it is one-dimensional sphere, zero-dimensional sphere, you have all possible segments to get two-dimensional sphere. Anyway, we have three-dimensional sphere and L-dimensional sphere. The joint is K plus L plus one dimensional sphere. One-dimensional sphere. Joint with a point, so joint of any space with a point. So you have a space. You have a point. You have just a core over the space. And the cores can be always contracted in this point. So this is always just a point. George of any space, you detempt yourself. piece you detect yourself you don't have the second leg you know second shoulder to put your signator on it's just the space itself so those are simple rules you sign up with them now we have all the spaces we understand this space we understand this space we understand the joint we understand and the wish we understand this is a formula Let's see how it works in our examples. What's the distinguished point in the joint? What is the distinguished point in the joint of the two guys? In the joint there is no distinguished point. You take a wedge over. Yeah, so I'm taking a widge, you know, like I'm taking this point. Yeah, but uh yeah, and you take uh each point I'm taking here. Uh this point I'm taking here uh it doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter, but you know it's it's a good question. I got to think about it. I think these cases tend to be connected, so but it really doesn't matter, but you know, it's a good patience. Anyway, you know, I did think about it. Okay, so yeah, let's consider a couple of examples. Let's consider example of, again, this is our sphere, this is our W. Let's consider this is A, this is B, this is the intersection, right? So we have A B, maps into A, and maps into B. A and absent to B. Right? So I will have the pitch of three guys. The first guy will be the top part. That will be the pH. The top guy, so corresponding to AB. So what is the sequential complex span by everything below that? Everything below that will be just those two colors. So this delta is everything, this delta of everything below AB is just zero-dimensional spheres, just two points. And I'm taking joint of that with what? The space itself. What is the space itself? It has this point and that point. It's another zero-dimensional sphere. The whole thing is this one. Think is S1. The first element of the joint is S1. Second element of the joint is A. So what is less than A? Nothing is less than A. Empty set. So this empty set, and you take, you joined the empty set with this guy. Because A is this book here, right? It's S1. It's S1. It will be S1. Third guy, exactly the same. Delta of lambda B, which will get the space B, the gate as well. So you have the range of three loops. And indeed, this union is quantum equivalent to the range of three loops. Again, if I take this graph, I slide this graph to this one. So if they don't intersect, this guy is empty, so you have one move left. So this is what gives us the essentially all the computational parameters in here. And while it's good in our key situations, so in our situation, so let's return back to our problem. For our problems, we have this union. So remember, we have this union of this four-star j's. And by bijection, lambda, this is how we limit of this diagram, of this diagram. So these spaces and all these intersections. But all these intersections, remember, you have this ball and Intersection, so remember, you have this ball and all these linear subspaces. So if you take this affine subspaces and intersection of the ball and contract everything else to report it, so this will be just the sphere of dimension equal to dimension of this subspace. So this will be just a sphere. Any intersection will be still a fine subspace. All intersections will be spheres. So you have any intersection sitting in this space, so you have embedding of the intersection at this point, intersection embedded into this space. Embedded into this space. So you have a sphere of small dimension embedded in the sphere of large dimension. And any such sphere can be comatoped to a point. So we exactly in the construction, you know, we exactly can move back to the Nicholas mark. Essentially what we get is that this space will be equivalent to the bridge over all possible chains of Over all possible chains of obstacles. And the dimensions will be exactly matching. What we will see is that the dimension of the homologous, you'll be exactly matching the dimensions, the ranks of our ring, which we constructed in the past, to get just this simple complication. That's it. So you know that this space has the right dimension as our space. This our space. Our space has more information. This space just gives you dimensions. Our space also gives you the product, the structure of the ring of our homology group. So this is the proof. I know, I know. I just want to go a little bit into some generalization because I think, you know. So anyway, so the theorem is proved. What I wanted to uh to discuss is you know several again this is uh relatively simple again relatively simple model because we what we are doing is just everything is linear, everything is transversal in some sense and you know it is not big deal. So what you know so where we can go from there? So generalizations. So generalizations. One generalization is that, of course, if those obstacles, you know, the whole thing will work exactly the same if you have obstacles, affine obstacles, more than one obstacle in each instance, if the obstacles don't intersect. The whole proof will go verbatim, the same. What happens if the obstacles do intersect? The interesting, you know, this is a rich problem. Why is this rich problem? Imagine you have this just, you know, just x dot, this multinational dot, you know, the absolute area is whatever less than one. So you just, you know, you can go anywhere with any velocity, but velocity, so you can heat. So only Can heat so obviously, you know, like the trajectories will be distinguished just one instant. There is no, like, no, not many obstacles, just one instant. So, clearly, the topology of the obstacle avoiding path, this obstacle-avoising path, will become a topic equivalent to the so-called manifold corresponding to this arrangement, which is V minus the union of all those obstacles. So, this is the standard problem in. standard problem in topological continuity is called this is called linear arrangements problem and this is very rich problem with huge history going back to again break groups and design spaces for the break groups and you know but then developed by people like Jordan and Lois and Joker Jordan and Lois and Joker and so on, into some absolutely amazing, beautiful, or like some discourse with lots of names. Anyway, so ultimate question. Yeah, so like the problem of understanding of proprietary linear arrangements is a subset, a sub-problem, a special case of our problem. But our techniques will allow you to solve it. Allow you to solve it still relatively easily. So, again, like the link will be much more complicated. Interaction between different generators will be, of course, you know, you'll have to reflect in the totalics of each of the arrangements. But, you know, it's a principle of the whole. Where the things become really, really interesting is when you abandon the assumption that the obstacles are instantaneous. Here, I want to give you a couple of examples. So, imagine the Imagine so let's imagine that the pan goes up. I find it easier for me. The pen goes up, so this is again, this is your just x dot, that's the value is getting one, so you have this light core of velocities. And imagine you have one space-like obstacle, not instantaneous, it's sort of progressive type, but still it's space-like. You cannot, you know, once you persecute you cannot Once you intersect, you cannot catch the game, right? It's faster than you. And another obstacle going this way, sort of a skew. Two obstacles like that in this case. You're going from bottom to top. So let's count how many ways. We can go all above, go above, then sneak behind. Go here and there. It can go here behind and then here this way, or you can go all behind. Now we should think about this construction. So if the obstacles were like this, so this is A, this is B, then we would know what the process is, right? This will be A, this will be B, this will be K B. It's a B, it's a K. So this is if the So, this is if they subtract something slope of each other. And then, you know, like result, quite easy to see, there will be four classes. And that's it, corresponding, so that there will be more, this will be A, there will be B, and this will be AB. This actually. What is interesting here is that, you know, this is A, this is B. A, this is B. You can't hit both A and B, but you can hit both A and B in two different ways. You can hit them this way, first A then B, or you can hit them that way, first B then A. And as this picture will be deformed into something like this. You have A B, we have B A. Behave. And what happens? And in here, you know, we can write one, two, three, four, five components exactly correspond to our five. And yeah, so you can sort of draw this corresponding diagram. It will be AB, BA, AB. And you can compute the hitch lemma and everything will come as expected. Expected. But even more interesting, what happens if you transition from this picture to the one where they sort of intersect? Will the number of cats grow or go down? Grow, right? We'll do the six-phase care cats, right? Go up top, turn this way, that way, this way. This way, that way, and again, so all of that can be captured by the correspondingly modified apparatus. Still, this is a work in progress, so there's no final formula which allows you to produce the final results. But just to show how A, the program is rich, B, the topological tools which we sort of should, you know. Tools which we sort of should, you know, analyze more, they are not complicated, they are like natural. And they really give you a panel. You can compute stuff, you can compute the polar type of radiated spaces. Thank you. Any question? Is there a have you written a paper on this topic that I think? There is a paper called Wallace What? I mean, no, but this paper covers this like simple case: the linear systems with Stantinius. So really, something that kind of became apparently case. As you have more obstacles if you're considering that they're not instantaneous, your diagram. Your diagram is like exponentially increasing in size? I mean, yeah, exponentially kind of worrying about throwing expansion, but probably, yeah, probably you. If all cases were. Well, no, right, yeah. So like, yeah, you have to, like, yeah, you have intersection process, yeah. So like, you know, you'll do a lot of intersections. You can hit a lot of obstacles that you have. There are tools, you know, there's like tools in this editorial topology. This factorial topology, there are tools which allow you to come. If you have some big sequential complex, like if you have some horse function on there, it's like a skip word function, you can sort of collapse everything. So there are tools which allow you to avoid some, like minimize some complications. But yeah, I would expect like apply bluntly it would lead to better applications but it will be fair. Computable. All right. At the very beginning, you start with the number of components you are interested in. Right that the number of components are completely determined by the obstacles you've covered? Are they like obstacles of four dimensions? Not one, they sort of like, you know, you can go around that, right? As you can see, the interaction of those components, because I have just one, and this button is quite a trivial. Some people Thanks. Yeah. One important remote. We start at 1.30 today, not too like yesterday. We start at 1.30 back here. And then we have Maria online, then Matthew, coffee, break, and then French for novel. Yeah, so we can. I know a little bit more. It's a special case. Okay, that answers my question. So I got an answer. Because it's a special case. A little more detail would be nice a little bit of time, unfortunately. I mean, if we kept more time, that'd be more confident.  I think that's not I don't know what's important yet. So A, I think. This is the isa. So the obstacles are not. But when I just basically Right, okay. And A was this time size. And that would always possibly encounter A first time, which is not the case. So birth is a time. But it's going to be easy to put in our  Well there is something I'm just gonna make sure. Well, but in general, so the mapping form is homotopic, you map in each, and then you replace your map F by a a homotopic mapping so you can get gen as well as you know. And then I guess I must have space for a moment that I missed with the concept to the issue. Well, that was it, yeah. But then, don't you if the phone topic is mapping managed for all the meshes and all the Or all you have to do is do that and then put it really nice pieces, right? But it's basically something like that, right? So in your case, it's all very good. So of course there's possible. And the part where when the system is controlled, you can be multiple. When you smoke the string, you don't have to have a lot of And that's the question towards people with this control problem. And that would be all different dynamics. And we're kind of saying, well, no, it is more actually control problem that's creating the chains. We read just exactly what's going on. That was thesis of the problem says that the general general rules can be used. No, I haven't seen it. My impression of the triggers like that. Yeah, so we end up with something.
