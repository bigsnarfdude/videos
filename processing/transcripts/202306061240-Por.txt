Recording is ready. So, okay, and Dotila is ready. He's the next speaker, and he will speak about universal sequences of lines and other clear flats. Thank you very much. So, this is a joint work with Imre Barang, who could not be. Emre Barang, who could not be here, and Gil Colli. And it goes like back like two, three years now. So some of you might have heard these results. So what is, I will try to give an overview of our goals of what we try to achieve. So we start with some classical ideas that every I mean, some set of points or lines or k-flats have some orientation, which we extend from just simply the orientation of points. And we define some function on all s tuples into a finite set M. And so, in the case of points, if I have points in the D-dimensional space, then Dimensional space, then every set of d plus one points define an orientation plus or minus one or zero in case if they are on a hyperplane. And then we use that property to define universal sequences similar to points on a convex curve where all S tuples have the same orientation. So for points, it would be. I will give the example for points later. Example for points later. So we call the sequence universal if the value assigned to each of these tuples is the same. And then we also say that that value is universal and we ask which of those values are universal in the sense that there are arbitrarily long universal sequences corresponding to that value. So let's go to the example of before we go to the example. Let's let me describe a precise. Let me describe precisely that idea of universality. So we started a finite set M and then if we have a sequence of objects of S objects, we define a function f on all of those sequences into the set M and we say that a sequence is universal with property M if for Property m if for every selection of s of those objects, the assigned value to them is exactly m. Yes, as I said before. And we say that m is universal if there are arbitrary long universal sequences with that property. Yes? And by Ramsey's theory, obviously, we know. Obviously, we know because M is finite that there must be at least one property which is universal. Yes, but maybe all of them are, and maybe just some of them are. But obviously it depends on the definition of F. So this is the definition of points. If I have D plus one points in the D-dimensional space, A1 to AD plus 1, then one then i can construct a d plus one by d plus one matrix out of these vectors by adding one and then just ask for the determinant obviously if the determinant is zero then the points are on some hyperplane and other ways it has a sign either plus or minus one and that's the orientation of all the points so now if i have a sequence of points uh there Which is universal, that means that all the orientations are the same, and then we know the classical result that the vertices are on, sorry, the points are form the vertices of a cyclic polytope. Yes. And in fact, both orientations can happen either by switching one of the coordinates, I mean by switching, I mean multiplying it by negative one, or just simply reversing the sequence with the word. Reversing the sequence could work. That depends on the dimension. So, here's an alternative approach to that, where we use a different function, but the result will be the same, or at least the sequences will end up to be the same. So, instead of assigning some value for each d plus one points, we use the idea that there's a unique radon partition due to radon, which was mentioned, I guess, several times so far and most likely will be mentioned. Times so far, and most likely will be mentioned again. So, if I have d plus two points in general position, then there's a unique partition of the set d plus two where the convex hulls intersect. And I'm going to choose the set x to be the set which does contain the one and assign simply the set of indices to the selection of the points. Yes, so now. So now again, I can ask what. So now my set M is just simply all subsets, yes, of D plus 2, which do contain 1. So I have 2 to the D plus 1 minus 1. Well, then minus 1 is simply because you can't have all the sets, right? So X cannot be all the points. It's not a valid partition, right? Partition, right? So, but it really doesn't matter. Even if you include it, it would just not never be assigned. So, now for again, this is, I guess, just folklore, well known that if you have a sequence of points where to every subset of D plus two points, you assign the exact same Radon partition, then that Radon partition has to be the alternating. Partition has to be the alternating one, so in this case, all the odd numbers, because we already fixed one to be in the set, and because of that, that's the only universal one among all the sets for this. On the other hand, the sequences which are universal are exactly the same sequences that we get from the orientations, yes, as before. So the vertices of This is of cyclic polytope. So, this is all well known. Now, we will have some continuous version of our results. So, what is a curve? A curve is simply just a continuous function from some interval, like the open zero, one interval, to the d-dimensional space. And it is convex if for every selection of d plus one. Of V plus one elements of the curve, the orientation is the same. Yes? So, okay. So, let's move on to trying to define, so extend these to lines. So, the idea is that instead of points, we want to consider lines in the d-dimensional space. And the first challenge is to describe an order-oriented. Describe an order orientation for some set of lines. So, in order to define that, we will represent lines in a very similar way as everybody would do. So, we pick a point on the line A and the direction vector of the line V. And several of these selections will represent the same line. So, if I scale my vector, this is an oriented line. Uh, oriented line, so I can only scale it with a positive value, and then I can change pick any point on the line. Yes, so adding some multiple of the vector v to a. So now we want to define the actual order, and what we do is we choose s to be d minus one. So given d minus one lines, we want to define their order, and what we do is. Order and what we do is we take the vetch product of all the direction vectors. Obviously, if they are linearly dependent, then I get zero vector, but otherwise I get a vector which is perpendicular to all of these. Yes. And then I take the outproduct with every point and I get some values hi. And we consider the lines in general position if, in fact, the vector u is not. If in fact the vector u is not a zero vector, and all these values h i are different numbers, so they are distinct numbers. And we define the ordering of these lines as simply just the permutation of the values h. So hj1, hj2, and hjd minus one are in increasing order. And then the sigma is a permutation of the indices in which the lines appear. In which the lines appear along the vector u. So the first thing that we have to consider is that is this actually well-defined? Which means is this a property of the lines and not just the representation of the lines? And it's fairly easy to see that if I scale my vectors v, then the vector u will just scale, but not change, right? So the vector u is scaled. And also by changing the points A, because each Because each line is perpendicular to the vector u, it doesn't matter which point you pick, you get the exact same values. And so, this is a function where I put in d minus one lines and I end up with some permutation of d minus one. Yes. And that's a good question because that's the next slide. But it's a good question, it's really confusing. Question. It's really confusing. So, the way you can think about it, and this is an alternative approach to just the definition, is that when you take L lines, and obviously we assume that the direction vectors are linearly independent, then there's a unique hyperplane which is parallel to all of them, which is basically perpendicular to that watch product U. And that unique hyperplane you can shift into each. Into each line, which means that they contain that line. Obviously, if it intersects the line, it has to contain it because it's parallel to it. So now you get D minus one copies of this hyperplane, like parallel copies of this hyperplane, and they have an order because they're oriented. So I still have the direction of u, and it's basically in which order these hyperplanes appear. Hyperplanes appear along the vector u, as I said before. So I hope that answers that question. It's a little bit more intuitive what we do. So by Ramsey's theory, we know that there has to be a universal permutation in this case and of the D minus one of the permutation on D minus. Of the permutation on D minus one. And so the question is: which permutations are universal? And I mean, if you just, if you never heard of it, there are obvious candidates, and the two obvious candidates are the identity and the reverse. And of course, they have to, I mean, everybody would say, yeah, obviously they have to be universal. But are there more? And it turns out that there are more. So, our result is the following: that all the permutations where the permutation is increasing and then decreasing, don't read it. So the permutation is increasing and till some point where it reaches the maximum and then it's decreasing are good. And then also the permutations where it's decreasing first and then increasing, they are also good. And there are two to the d minus one minus two such. One minus two such sequences or permutations. And the proof is simply by just making an example, right? That's all you have to do. Given such a permutation, can you come up with an arbitrary long sequence of vectors where each d minus one tuple has this permutation as their order. As their order assigned to them. Yes. And that's the poor proof. So you're not going to see any proof today for me. All you have to do is you just have to pick some. So n is the length of the sequence that we want to achieve. And you pick a matrix, which is 2d by d plus 1 times n. And it's rapidly increasing, which means that you start with some element in the Start with some element in the upper left corner, and then you go through the first row and make them larger and larger and larger as you go. And then you start to the second row and make them larger and larger and larger, and so on. And observe that the matrix is 2d, not d. So these are not actually vectors. What we do is just we just use each second row for the vector, for the direction vector, and also for the points. And also for the points and the other values are some auxiliary values that we use in some rather complicated way, which is super easy, by the way, but it's complicated if you see it first and then it makes sense. But I don't know how we came up with those. So I'm not going to talk about that. Instead, what I'm going to do to show you some examples of sequences. Sequences which are universal. So in this case, you can think about this sequence as so. Look at the numbers. If you look at the number one, it's somewhere in the middle. Yes. And so the sequence is decreasing till the point one, and then it's increasing after that. Yes. But how you construct such a sequence? A more natural way could be that you start with the one, you place it. With the one, you place it somewhere. Sorry? Oh, sorry. I thought I was canceled. My bad. I pushed it too late. You do it. I did the same, so I don't know. I did the same, so I don't know. Like it's my finger must be my finger, but only for the pushing. That's why I hate these. So you start with the one and you place it somewhere, and then you place number two. You have to place the two either to the left or to the right of one, because otherwise it will not work. So basically, you can't think about you started the one and then you say either, hey, I go right or left. Then you say either, hey, I go right or left. In this case, we went right. We put the two to the right, and then I have a block of one and two, and I put the three again to the right, and then I put the four to the left, and then I put the whatever. I think at this point, everybody understands how this works. And you can start backwards, which means that you start with the largest number, that would be the 10. And then you place either the nine or the eight to the left or the right, and so on as you. Right, and so on as you go down. So, this is super easy. And obviously, because I choose left, yes, sorry. So, let's so this is simply just a sequence. It's a permutation. And I claim that this permutation is universal. Yes. Now, in this, in this permutation is on 10 numbers, which means that d minus one is 10. So, this would be in the In the 11-dimensional space. So there exists a sequence, arbitrary long sequence of lines in the 11-dimensional space, such that whenever you pick 10 of the lines and you draw those, you make those hyperplanes, their order will be that the ninth one will be the first, the eighth one will be the second, then the fifth one, then the fourth one. Fifth one, then the fourth one, then the first, and so on. But it doesn't matter which one you pick. Any the any ten will have this order. Yes? Okay. Any other questions? So in dimension three, we only have two lines, and it's one, two. It's one, two, and three, one. Those are the two permutations. And so they are all universal. And also, for the three permutations, I mean, permutation in three, they all have that property. So everything is, it doesn't have any, any, any order can be, is possible. Yes. But then when we go into the five-dimensional space, I don't know why I have d equals four, my bad. Again? The second notation is so three is the largest. You can go either way. I said, so what I said is that, so either you start with the largest, so it's increasing and then decreasing or decreasing and then increasing. Both of them are fine. But you can't wiggle like a lot because that's then we don't know. Only only one giggle. Only one gig on the end. Sorry. So these are all possible. And then this is actually dimension five, not four. These are all the permutations that are 14 out of the 24 are such, and we know that they are universal. Unfortunately, with the other ones, we don't know whether they are universal because we didn't manage to prove anything. We only made the examples. Examples. So it would be nice to have a proof that at least one of them is not universal. Because at this point, it could actually happen that all of them are universal, which I don't know. I guess it even would be more surprising to me, but who knows? Obviously, we didn't make an example and we didn't make any proof. So that's the result. So that's the result. And obviously, as the dimension increases, 2 to the d minus 1 is much, much less than d minus 1 factorial. So it's a very small portion of the permutation for which we know whether it's universal or not. Yes? Yeah, unfortunately, that's very true. I'm sorry if. Sorry, if you expected better. But on the other hand, maybe you can find one. So the problem is that you need to prove that it's not possible, which looks difficult to me. So, okay, we can extend these ideas to Can extend these ideas to unoriented lines. If we have unoriented lines, then one approach is just, hey, like I orient the lines somehow. I take the same D minus one lines, I orient them, and then I get the permutation. Now, if I change the orientation of one line, then the permutation might flip. Like I can get the reverse. So if I, but that's all that can happen. So I can pair up the permutation. Can happen so I can pair up the permutation, each permutation with its reverse. By reverse, I mean that one, two, three, four becomes four, three, two, one, which is cheating. I should use a different example, but I won't. But because you can think about there's also an idea of like reversing the numbers themselves in the permutation, which is different. Oops. So instead of assigning one permutation, So instead of assigning one permutation, we assign a pair of permutations to each d minus one lines. And it's the same idea, right? Actually, we have a smaller set. And we could also do it in a way that we start with D line. So now this will be a function of D lines, so D tuples of lines. We remove one line and define the orientation of the remaining. And define the orientation of the remaining lines, and they all have to be the same. Yes? And I don't really know why they did that, but they did that, so whatever. But it's basically the same. It turns out that the permutations have to be all the same if you are long enough, because just pick a different, add a different line to somebody else, and then you will learn that all of these permutations are one. So in fact, Are one. So in fact, if the sequence is long enough, then, or even just with these lines, all of them have to be the same. So the same pair. Now, you could wonder, yeah, but I actually get a function into that space. Do I get every possible? And that depends on the parity of the dimension, but it really doesn't matter for us whether you can achieve it or not in order to ask the question. Okay, so this is how. Okay, so this is how we extended this idea to k-flats, at least one way. Unfortunately, this definition leaves a lot to wonder about because we just don't get every dimension for every k. So if we assume that the dimension is one modulo k, so it's a multiple of k plus one, then we have some r k flats where these are k plus one, then obviously the same idea works. And obviously, the same idea works. I just add up all the k-flats, the dimensions add up. I end up with a hyperplane which contains each of the k-forry parallel, some parallel hyperplane contains each of the k-flats. And those hyperplanes have an order with respect to the, again, to the universal direction, which is perpendicular to the, which is the normal vector of the hyperplane. So, the definition would be the same, and it turns out that the same construction works with just extending by some extra vectors. So it's not really interesting. But it does work. Now, what is the continuous case for lines? So we start with the continuous functions of lines. Continuous functions of lines on an interval. Again, just think about the interval i as the open 0, 1 interval. And then we sweep through continuously with lines. And what we want, so first of all, how do we find that it is continuous? We just use the standard topology of the Grassmannian, right? So in the previous talk, you heard a lot more about that from a person who knows a lot more about it. So it's. So it's uh I'm not gonna say much, but what we again want is that whenever we pick d minus one, any d minus one points on the curve, which are lines now, then those lines should have the same permutations assigned to them. Yes, and then this curve is a universal curve, yes. And our result says that if the dimension And our result says that if the dimension is at least five, then that permutation has to be the identity or the reverse of the identity. Again, the reverse is easy to achieve by simply just switch multiplying one of the coordinates by negative one. And there's a gap here. So first of all, there is no d minus two, sorry, no d equals two. And there's also no d equals three because And there's also no d equals three because in d equals three you only have two lines so i mean i mean that's the only two permutations you have so it's not really a restriction and but there is no d equals four unfortunately because our proof is not good enough and there's a technical issue so we didn't prove it we tried to fix it didn't work so we just left it out it's easier but but it i mean there are It's easier, but it. I mean, there I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be true, right? I mean, it's the definition still holds. You can ask the question, and it should be true, but whatever. We are human. So I would like to finish with the following remark by Sturmfels. The idea is that if you have a sequence of points, where all the orientations are positive. Orientations are positive, all the deep, every d plus one points have the same orientation, then you can actually have a curve through these points which is convex. So you can extend the discrete set of points into a continuous function. And in fact, I used that definition before, but nobody called me out on it. So that's good. Because I describe the set of points as Set of points as a universal set of points as a set of points which is on a convex curve. So that's the result which actually proves that, hey, you can do that. Unfortunately, this is obviously not possible for lines because at least from dimension five, we showed that if so, let's say you have a really long sequence of lines where all the Sequence of lines where all the orientations are the same, but it's not the identity or the reverse identity. The only way to have a continuous curve through that, where all the orientations are the same, if that's the order, right? That's the permutation, which it is for those points. But the previous result shows that that's not possible. So you cannot extend it into some continuous family of into some continuous functions. Sorry. Yes? Function, sorry, yes, and yeah, I mean, thank you very much. Thank you very much for the very clear talk and nice results. Any question? I know. The segments on the convex score, if you consider if you consider convex colours, this, right? You consider convex colours this right is a gives the maximal like some type for McMullen inequalities for a vector. Do we have something like that property? Let us consider the convex curve. Consider a sequence of points. Yes. Let's consider convex colour of this. Yes. Then we have a polyhedron that gives. That gives us the boundary of McMahon. Okay. So, you want to ask me about lines? Yeah, I give an answer with a question. I give you two lines in the three-dimensional space, the x-axis, and you shift the y-axis somewhere. What's the convex hull? That is my question. No. Like, you have to define the convex hull, right? You have to define the convex hull, right? Yeah, it is defined. There is a Goodman and Paulak have a paper about this: that how you define this the convex hull of yes, yeah. Okay, I mean, if that's what you use, then I have zero clue. Any other question? Maybe you can say a couple of words about resolve for continuous curves. What does it look like? Why does it break in dimension four? Oh, so in the proof, we just do some, you can define like limits. So if you, if because if you have a vector sequence, right? Sequence, right? Then you can define, so you have a continuous vector sequence in the first place. Then you fix one vector and you take the limit of the plane through that vector and some plus epsilon. And then there may not be a limit, but there is a two-dimensional plane which Dimensional plane for which there exists a limit, yes, which is the limit of some sequence. So then, when we define these two-dimensional planes, we just add some vectors, and we end up with four vectors. And in the case of the four-dimensional space, there are some degeneracy, which doesn't allow us to continue the proof. So, the problem is that some vectors could be the same. We cannot assume that. Vectors could be the same, we cannot assume that, or we, or at least by definition, they will not be. So, we prove that these two-dimensional planes are independent. And this is at some point, if we add too many vectors, we just switch around some vectors and it's not working in the lower dimensions because you can't just randomly pick some vector later or in between, even. Yes. But other than giving you the exact proof, I And giving you the exact proof. I mean, I can't explain, but that's the reason that we use the idea of some low-dimensional subspaces, and it just doesn't work in. So we need a large space so that we can use the results. So it's very simple linear algebra, actually, after that. Okay, thank you very much again.
