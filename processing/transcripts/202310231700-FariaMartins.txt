I would like to speak about the Lagrange multiform. I hope you can read properly what I'm writing. I would like to speak about the Lagrange multiform for a generalized Darwin system and Everything I'm going to say today is joint with Frank Nyhoff. Sorry, I should probably spell Frank's name properly, or at least try. Sorry and Daniel. And Daniel Ricombeni. And I hope I've spelt everyone's name properly. And the context is a certain system which is defined in so whose fields. So let me call it this general. So let me call it this generalized Darbo system. Sorry. Just kind of start a new page. How do I create a new page here? Sorry. Having some technical difficulties. Sorry. Ah, so new page. So what is this generalized arbo system? So, what do I need here? So, I need fields of the form. So, let me say b i j of a certain set of coordinates x, where x is Is factors of the form xi where i is in z. So each xi a real number. Actually, let me say real variable. Okay, and the system is quite simple, but amazingly simple. Simple, in fact, amazingly simple, and simply says that the derivative with respect to k of bij at point x is equal to b i k of x times b k j of x. Okay, but note that this depends on an infinite number of variables. Number of variables. Let me actually say something I forgot to say. I'm always going to take i not equal to j. Okay, so condition on these fields is that they're only defined for i not equal to j. And this equation here holds for i, j, and k different. So think of this as a. So, think of this as a system that will always want to take i, j, and k to be different. Okay, so some quick properties. First of all, this is multidimensionally consistent. Sorry, not spelling things very well. Today I've got a news to doing online talks. Consistent and due to a result of Niehoff and others, I'll write the name of the other people sort of can be obtained. From KP system by a change of variables. I don't want to get into here because it's actually quite technical, but this increases the motivation for us to look at this amazingly simple system which Which can be seen by using results of Nyhov and Konopochenko and others as being equivalent. Actually, I'm not going to say equivalent, as being a spin-off of the usual KP hierarchy. Okay, right. And as I said, I'd like to obtain a Lagrange multifunction for this beautiful system. And in order to do so, I would like to recall. Sorry, I'm having some issues. Sorry, I'm having some issues with IT because it's being very difficult for me to change page. For some reason, I have not figured out. Okay, managed to change page. And like I said, let's obtain a Lagrange multiform. Actually, in this case, Lagrange three form for a tarbo system. And the method is via Chern Simon's three forms. But how is it I'm going to do this? So let me just quickly remember some facts about churn salmon. So which type of churn salmon stick? Which type of Chern-Simmons theory would I like to look at? So, context. So, let me take M and algebra. And when I say algebra, I was going to say associative. Okay, and I'm going to tell. And I'm going to take forms. I'm going to take as my space of fields one forms A, let me say defined in Rn. So my space is always going to be Rn with values. With values in this algebra M. Okay. And the Chern-Simons action on A, or the Chern-Simmons free form I associate to A, is defined by applying this very well-known formula, which is phase of A. of A wedge d A plus two-thirds of A wedge A wedge A. Okay, some things probably should be said here just to make sense of this formula. So I'm actually going to look not only as an algebra But also an algebra with a trace form, which is a function, actually a linear map trace from M into R. Okay. And the only thing I'm going to impose on that is that trace of AB is equal to trace of BA. So an example, just like Just take n times n matrices and the usual matrix trace, which has these properties, but actually the formulation is actually a lot more general. Okay, and it's important that when we compute all of these wedge products, we actually use this Ausburgh operation M to compute this. To compute these wedge products. Okay, right. So, what else can we do here? See if I can move slightly lower. Yes, so a property of this Chern-Simons three-form is that if I compute the exteriors to review. The exterior derivative of the turn-simon street form of A, I obtain trace of curvature of A, which curvature of A. And this follows by explicit calculations. It's actually not that hard to do and Not that hard to do, and if you're bored, just compute the axioderivative of Chern summons of A, and you'll see that you obtain trace of curvature of A, wedge curvature of A. If you need a reminder, what this F A is, so F A is simply equal to x your derivative of A plus A wedge A. And as usual. And as usual, we actually, well, as I mentioned, we are working over a certain algebra m. So, anytime you have a wedge product, remember that you should use the algebra multiplication to actually compute the wedge. Right, so what the main thing I would like to show to you today is: can we? Uh can we find a Lagrange tree form for the Darbo system using well element. Well, elementary John-Simon's theory. Sorry, and the answer is yes, and that's what I would like to show you how to do it. So recall that generalized Darbo. Sorry, this generalized Darbo. I sorry. This general This generalized Darko system has the form D I of B J K on a set of variables X sorry, a set of variables X I where I lives in Z this is equal to B J I. Bj i of variables xi times b i k of variables. Again, oops not call this xi. Let me call this xn so that I'm not repeating the variable. So xn times xn. So, what is the trick? So, let's consider turn Simons over. Over this R infinity. So it's R with an infinite set of variables. So it's a set of things of the form Xn where n lives in Z. Okay. So weak values on infinite dimensional. Infinite dimensional on the algebra of so Z times Z matrices. Okay, of course, this is an infinite dimensional space, it's an infinite-dimensional algebra, so you actually must be careful that you're not doing infinite sums, but it turns out that. Sense, but it turns out that all formulae that I would write down turn out to be finite as long as you well you're careful about computing them. Right, and so what is the trick? See if I can just go slightly. So the general fields F form okay, so the general sorry the general fields for this Chern Salmon theory have form form just going to write a formula so a general field with values in r infinity with values in the algorithm of n times n matrices a form sort of like this so i need several coordinates here i'm going to write it down as a i k l L D X I and then E K L. Okay, so E K L are just the matrices which are zero all over the place except at entry. K and at entry L where you have a one and all other stuff zero. Okay, so A K L times A K prime L prime this is equal to E K E k L prime delta L K prime. It's usual multiplication of matrices. Okay, right, so this is the general field for Chern-Simon's theory. Well, taking values in, well, the Chern-Simons theory defined over this infinite dimensional manifold and with values in the algebra. With values in the algebra of z times z matrices. But actually, in order for us to reach this Dargo system, we cannot just consider all of this generality, and we actually need to look at the finite-dimensional subspace. And this was actually the main trick for this construction. This construction. Sorry, I'm having some issues with IT. So you want to restrict the set of fields and consider only fields of the form. Fields of the form B, again B defined in this set of coordinates of this form B i j d x i so probably I should say what this is a function of, so of my infinite set of coordinates d x i and E X i and E I J. Okay, so again, I'm going to say I'm not looking at the full set of fields I could have for this infinite matrix value turn summons theory, which are these fields here. But I'm going to consider very restricted set of fields, which are fields of this form here. This form here. And you may ask why these fields and no other type of fields is because exactly if you look at these fields and you apply the Chern-Simons form and you apply Chern-Simon's theory to them, you get exactly the generalized Darboux system by taking the multiform Euler Lagrange. The multi-form or the Lagrange or Lagrange equations. Okay? Right. By the way, there are other sets of fields which are actually quite interesting, but probably I will not have time to look at them today. Note that there's this coupling here. So dxi goes with this i here. Okay, whereas in general, there's no relation between this entry here and this entry here. Okay? This is actually. Through here. This is actually passing through a very restricted set of fields. Okay, and now we can start playing a bit with this fields. And it turns out that, so let me just write it as a lemma. So if B is equal to B is equal to sum B i j d x i b i j, then several things happen. First of all, C s of b will have quite a simple formula. So Cs of B would be simply equal to some. Sum of i, j and k. So extremely simple formulae. So it will be something like B I J D K B J I okay plus uh two thirds of B I J B J B J K B K I Okay D X I watch D X J where H D X K okay and even better we can now compute the exterior derivative of C s of B actually this will be our be actually this will be our for i continue this will be our lagrange three form for the for the darbo system okay and even better uh so why is this so cool i can compute I can compute the exterior derivative of Chern summons of P, and this would be trace of curvature of B, wedge curvature of B. And this is equal to, sorry, I'm running a bit out of space, but I think I can still manage to write down the formula here, and this is. And this is equal to, let me see if I get this from the right. So the formula are so simple that you can easily memorize them all. But this would be something like some A, B, C and D. Let's see if I get this right. So D A B B C minus D A. minus d a b d oops sorry got it wrong and you'll get it wrong so this is equal to sorry not writing things well today so we have this term here then we have another term So times DXA wedge DXB wedge DXC wedge DX oops. Okay, and if you look at this formula again, by the way, this is this comes down for explicit calculations. And there's some phenomena that happens here. Okay, so here the A, B, C, and D a period would not need to be different, but if A, B, C, and D If A, B, C, and D actually two indices coincide immediately, this will make this multiplication zero because, well, dxA wedge dxA of the same A will give zero. And for this reason, we can see that D C S of B has a Has a double zero on the solutions of the diverse system, which again is D A. Is D A B D C minus D A oops minus D B A B A C equal to zero if A not equal to B, A not equal to C and B not equal to C. And for this reason, it then follows that This form I had here above is a Lagrange reform for the Darboux system because then the Darboux system is a solution of the multi-form other Lagrange equations. Let's start a new page. So hence CS C S would be for B equal to some A B B A B D X A E A B is a Lagrange three form for For the turbo system, which means that i.e. the Darbo system satisfies Uh satisfies the Euler-Lagrange multi-form equation. Right, so this actually, how much time do I still have? Because I forgot to check the time. I'm mute. Okay. So I think it's almost time, John. Can you make mutually perhaps I couldn't really hear it, but I guess I should have around five more minutes, according to my pardon? I really can't hear anyone there. I'm so sorry. I'm assuming I have 10 more. I'm assuming I have five more minutes to continue, probably slightly less. Right, let me just say generalization, which makes this quite exciting. So the usual turn assignments, so CS of I, which is equal to To trace of A wedge D A plus two-thirds of A wedge A wedge A is just a starting point for a general theory. And in fact, I'm going to put here an N, okay, and in this And in this case, n equals three. But there is a general Chern-Simons form for all n, which, well, I'll write it down in a bit. So this exists any time n is out. Is odd, okay, and this has the property that D of C S N of A is equal to the trace of F A, which F A and I believe here it should be n minus one over two. n minus one over two times okay and i don't think the formula is is needed if you want the formula it can come after okay and this gives us quite a nice method to construct a Lagrangian N forms for Darbo system and a result indeed that we have. I mean, of course, there's several calculations that still need to be done for things to make sense. Is that maybe let me write down a theorem? Let me write down a theorem which is due to me, Nyhoff, and Rikumbeni. And I hope I spelt everyone's name properly, which is again put B equal to Equal to sum i not equal to j d i j of x d x i e i j or again these are the matrix generators or the usual generators for the algebra of infinite dimensional matrices then If I compute the exterior derivative of Cs N of B, then this has a n minus one over two fold zero. On the solutions of the Argo system and hence CSN of B is a Lagrange and form. M form for Darbo system sorry for Darbo system and what is the proof of this fact? So essentially we start from this identity here and And see what it gives. And it's actually not, well, some calculations need to be done, but this is the general method. And perhaps I am going to put down to open problems here, and then I think I should finish. I don't really know how much time I took because I did not check the time I started. So, open problems. So, are there more lagrange multi-forms hidden or lurking in Turn Salmon's theory? So here today we considered Cs of some i not equal to j of p i j d x i e i j Okay, so you consider turn sign. You consider turn Simons defined in R infinity with values in G L of R that So, are there more interesting multi-forms we can find? And I don't have an answer to this question. I have some hints of what can be done, but it's actually quite different. actually quite uh different it's quite quite an interesting problem note that uh when we started when i started this talk i considered turn summons theory defined with values in any algebra and at the end i considered a very particular set of fields very particular manifolds and a very particular algebra actually this is actually i should probably not put here gl n because N because let me put here mat because there are matrices. I'm looking at matrix algebra, not as groups of matrices. But by miracle, we obtained a Lagrange multiform for the double system. And are there more miracles like this hiding in translance? I think I'll stop now.
