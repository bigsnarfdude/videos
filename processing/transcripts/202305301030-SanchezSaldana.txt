Second day of the workshop, and the first speaker of today is going to be Luis Jorge Sanchez-Saldana, who's going to talk about the homotopy type of the classifying space for commutativity of orientable geometric three-manifold groups. So whenever you're ready. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Well, first of all, I want to thank the organizers. Yeah, even for those who are not here. Yeah. Yeah, for the invitation to speak here. For me, it's a great honor. I mean, I was born here in this city, I grew up in this city, so it is a great honor to be here talking to you on my work. Okay, so well, yeah, I'm going to talk about this, the homotopy type of classifying space for computativity of geometric three manifold groups. And even though I've been working more with the type of classifying spaces that Rita and Kevin were talking about yesterday. We're talking about yesterday. Now I'm going to talk about some other type of classifying space. Okay, so this is, I mean, it is kind of related and not at the same time. But yeah, okay, so let's start. And yeah, this is a joint work with Omar Antolin Camarena. I see I have a typo here, right? Eduardo Garcia Hernandez. Okay, so let's see. This is not working. The pointer works. Oh. Okay, it's working now. Yeah. So, well, the goal of this talk is to study abelian subgroups of orientable geometric free manifold groups. But concretely, what I want to study is the coset of cosets. Coset of cosets of a billion subgroups of a group, essentially. And I will focus on this on this case. But before doing that, I will give you like sort of a motivation of why I ran into this problem. And essentially, I ran into this problem because I ran into these two guys, Omar and Lucio Ordo, and they talked to me about this. So, well, the motivation comes from algebraic topology. And essentially, the motivation comes from The motivation comes from studying this kind of classifying space, which people call, I see the title, the classifying space for commutativity. And well, this space was defined by Alejandro Aden, Cohen, and Torres Gese in 2012. And of course, well, this topic is kind of trendy among the crew of especially Alejandro Adam. So the thing is, okay, you consider a group. Okay, what they were thinking originally is G is a Lie group, but this definition makes sense for any group. And you consider the set of or the space of homomorphisms from this free abelian group to G. Okay? And of course, well, what is going to happen is that actually what they realize in this paper. They realize in this paper is that these sets, when you run n over all natural numbers, they define a simplicial space. Because if you have a homomorphism from set to the end g, well, that is completely determined or described by an n tople of elements of g such that they commute pairwise, right? So in that way, then you can identify this home space, well, set as a subset of. Well, set as a subset of G to the N, and if G to the N has a topology, then you have a topology in this homomorphism set, which now is an space. Okay? And of course, well, the phase maps and the degeneracy maps are those inherited by this simplicial set space. And then what you have is: okay, you can consider the geometric realization of this simplicial space. Completion space, and then by definition, that is this becomes G. Okay? Yeah. And well, the geometric realization of this other simplicial space, it is well known, it is a model for the classifying space BG. Okay, so since this is defined at the geometrical realization of a subspace, then what you have is an Have is a natural map here. Okay, actually, it is an inclusion if you take these two models. Okay, and once you have this map, well, you can recall that VG classifies principal G-bundles. That is a kind of a classical result in algebraic topology. And this classification is in the following spirit. If you have a space X, essentially, you have a bijection between the maps. Dijection between the maps from X to B G up to homotopy and the principal G bundles over X up to isomorphism. That is the spirit of this classification. That's why BG actually, I think, is called a classifying space. And well, you have the universal G bundle. So this bundle essentially is the one that is given by the identity of. By the identity of BG. And since, well, now you have, as in here, you have a map from BCOM to BG, well, you have a G bundle here, a principal G bundle here, which is by definition that bundle. That's how this classification, I mean this arrow works. And this bundle, this principal G bundle that there is over BCOM is what I will call, well, they call actually, they call ECOMG. Ecomg. Okay, so E-com G is a principal G bundle which is classified again by this inclusion map from BCOM to BG, right? Okay, so well the following features are very well known for VG. And the first one is that EG is contractible. Okay. And the other one is that if G is discrete, for instance, the fundamental group of this classifying space is exactly G. Fine space is exactly G. Okay? But well, the very natural question is that if these two spaces classify something, right? Because the notation is like very suggestive. I mean, it is like exactly the notation that you use for a classifying space. So the question is: okay, is it a classifying space in the sense that it classifies something? And the answer is yes, these spaces classify something that I will. Classify something that I will tell you, but at the same time, I will not give you any details. Yeah. And so the thing is: okay, become classifies transitionally commutative principal G bundles, which essentially, like roughly, like, but really, really roughly, is these transitionally commutative principal G bundles are principal G bundles such that the transition maps commute. I mean, I will not go into the details, but you can think of this that But you can think of this that this becomes classified bundles with an extra structure, okay? Like very particular G bundles. That's that's what they what what this this guy is classifying, this one, okay. And the classification is in the same spirit. I mean, you have again this bijection from uh if you have uh space X, you have this set of maps from X to become up to homotopy, and you have a bijection. Up to homotopy, and you have a bijection with these very special type of bundles. Okay, and this was approved by Alejandro Adem and Costeman Merikomis 2014 or something like that. Yep. And actually, ECOM classifies also something, which is like what I will call commutative structures on trivial G bundles. And well, by trivial G bundles, I mean this product bundle. Again, I'm not going into the details because it is not like. Going into the details because it is not like the main, let's say, topic of this talk. This is just motivation. But the classification is exactly in the same spirit. Okay, so they have like kind of a right to be called classifying spaces. Okay, so I will observe something. What happens if G is abelian? Yep. Yep, sure. Yep, sure. Ah, like slower here. Yeah, sure. Okay. So, yeah, so I have this. I can send you the slides also. You are not going to say but I think yeah, no, I mean yeah, I mean yeah yeah I mean they I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, the kind of you can take as definition this, right? I mean, you just pull back something here. Yes, yes. But yeah, to be honest, I yeah, no, no, I will not give that definition. Sure, yeah, sure. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry that I'm not giving these definitions in great detail. Yeah, actually, I was thinking like when I was preparing this talk is okay, it is like interaction between algebraic topology. Like interaction between algebraic topology and geometric group theory, and the whole work that we did here is actually, well, I would say geometric group theory. I mean, we studied the groups using the geometry of the manifolds. And this is just like kind of, I don't know, what I thought that it could be like a good bridge between the two topics, the main topics of this conference. But I'm not really like an expert on this stuff. Okay, what happens if this is a billion? Okay. happens if g is a billion okay if g is a billion what it will happen is that this homeset is actually g to the n right because whenever you take an n top of elements of g of course they commute g is abelian and the other thing that will happen is that uh well of course the simplicity sets are sets are uh the simplicial spaces are the same and of course then b com g equals b g exactly when g is abelian like just When G is a billion, like just right from the definition. And the other thing that it will happen is that since this actually, well, these are equal, then this inclusion map actually is the identity map. And therefore, also Econ equals EG, right? And as I said, EG is contractible. So one of the conclusions that we have is that whenever G is abelian, well, this E comm G is contractible. Well, this Ecom G is contractible, like just from the definitions, okay? Okay, uh, and actually, uh, Omar Antolin, Simon Gritz, Hager, and Bernardo Villarrell in 2021, two years ago, just two years ago, they proved that actually G is abelian if and only if Ecom G is contractible. Okay. And actually, they prove something stronger. I think if G is discrete, for instance, then this Ecom is contractible if and only if the fundamental group is trivial. And if G is a Lee group, then it is contractible if and only if the first, the second, and the fourth homotopy group are trivial. But anyway, so the thing is that this Ecom, after this theorem, you can think of Ecom or the homotopy type of EC. Or the homotopy type of the e column as a kind of measure of how far is G from being a bit. I mean, that is one thing that you can think of this space. And well, since these classifications, I mean, these classifications of transitionally commutative bundle, principal G bundles, and these commutative structures and trivial G bundle only depend on the homotopy type of these two spaces. Homotopy type of these two spaces? Well, it is a natural question, I would say, to try to describe the homotopy type of these two spaces or any group you might ask that. Okay. And yep, so essentially that's what we asked ourselves. And actually, there are several results and explicit computations for Lie groups. For instance, for instance. instance for instance uh antoline and vigarial they computed like very very explicitly the homotopy type of pcom for low dimensional u groups that means like e2 uh u2 uh s u2 o3 so i mean all these these low dimensional uh league very classical and they computed like i mean like really really explicitly like bcon is like a Becon is like a wedge of the suspension of a projective space of some dimension, like that concrete. Okay. And the other thing is: okay, Adam and Gomez, they also computed the cohomology of BCOM for certain Lie groups. I mean, it is not the whole homotopy type, but they compute this cohomology ring. And Chihanoke, he Shihanoke, he computed the homotopy type of ECOM for some finite groups. Certain finite groups, he did like very concrete computations. But there are no examples for infinite discrete groups. I mean, like, I think that the only very, very explicit computations of these homotopy types are the first and the third item. And the third item. Okay, so this is like, I mean, there is nearly nothing done in this setting for infinite discrete groups. So we started to explore that ground. And well, essentially from now on, like from this moment, I will concretely focus on Focus on Ecom G. I mean, I will not work with BCOM, just Ecom. Okay, and whenever, whenever G is a discrete group. Okay, so from now on, G is a discrete group. And the question is, okay, you want to compute the homotopy type of E comm G. So the question is, how can you do that? Okay. And well, the answer is the following. Is the following. Whenever you have a discrete group, you have that the following three spaces are homotopy equivalent. Of course, E, that is the first one. The second one is this. So this is the geometric realization of this posit. So as I was telling you at the beginning of the talk, essentially this is the posit of cosets of abelian subgroups of G. Million subgroups of G. Okay? So if you see, well, this at the beginning, this, it is, I think that maybe it might not be clear how to compute the homotopy type of this, but this posit, well, is, I mean, it is not that it is not straightforward to see what is the homotopy type of this posit, but now you know that you have to study how. That you have to study how the abelian subgroups of G behave. Okay, and of course, using a very standard coffinality argument, what you can do is you can also work with this that we call MAPCO. Yep, this is APCO, which comes from abelian cosets of G. Right? Yep. Yes, yes, yes. APCO is just APCO. Well, the geometric realization. Okay, okay, okay, yeah, sure. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Assume that you have like a pre, well, if yeah, the geometric realization goes as follows. Okay, so the vertex, the vertex set, I mean, the geometric realization is. I mean, the geometric realization is a, let's say, a simplicial complex. Okay. And the vertex set is exactly the set of elements in this, right? I mean, whenever you have a posit, you can consider the geometric realization, and the set of vertices is exactly the elements of your posit. And whenever you have a chain, when you have a positive, whenever you have a chain like this. Like this, then you draw an edge from x to y. Okay, you have a poset where you have a, yeah, and whenever you have something like this, you draw a triangle and so on. Okay, so for instance, if you have something like y less w, then you have something like this. Yep. Are they G equivariant? It is a it is G equivariant. Well, you have a ton you have a translation actually. So you're looking at n tuples of how to group, but what's the action of G of that? I mean, is it translation by the dog? Because then you might be able to make that as well. Yes. Yeah, yeah, the action. Yeah. Okay, let me go back. There you go. There you go. So you have that e-comm is defined this way, right? So the action, if you see, you have an action on the right-hand side. So that's where the action comes from. Yeah, become is, okay, let me go back. Yeah, again, become is this, the geometric realization of this simplified. Metric realization of this simplicial space. It is the simplicial space. I mean, it is a simplicial space of this one, which consists of the tuples of elements that commute pay or pairwise. Yeah. Yes. To be honest, I don't have a good answer for you. I think it is not. You, I think it's not, but I'm not sure. Yeah, I think. Let me think. Yeah, no, I'm not sure. I will have to check it out. Yeah, sorry. Yep. Screen, so very far from a video. Is it face up? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That is, yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay, yeah, I will go to that. Okay, so you can consider this MAPCO, and this MAPCO is okay, you don't have to consider the full poset of cosets of abelian subgroups. You might only consider the poset of cosets of maximal abelian subgroups and their intersections. Okay, and for instance, in exactly in the case that you say, for instance, Macarena, if you have F2, well, you know that. Well, you know that every abelian subgroup of F2 is either trivial or infinite cyclic, right? Okay. And whenever you have two maximal abelian subgroups, I mean, both have to be infinite cyclic, their intersection is trivial. So essentially, what you have is in this map code, I mean, you have like only the trivial subgroup, like downstairs, and upstairs, you have all And upstairs, you have all infinite cyclic, maximal infinite cyclic subgroups of F2. And the intersection of any two of them is trivial. So you have something like this. Right? I mean, this has only two layers. Okay? This is essentially this is the posit of maximal, well, generated by the maximal abelian subgroups of F2. But for this, you have to consider. You have to consider also the cosets, right? So, whenever you consider the causets, well, in the downstair level, where you have the identity element, now you will have all the singletons, right? And so on. And in the upstairs level, you will have all cosets for each of these cyclic software. Cyclic subgroups. Okay. And whenever you have a coset like this C1, you have to join this C1 with each of its elements, right? Because every element, I mean, for instance, if this G is contained in this in this cyclic group, as I said here, then you have to draw an H from here to here. Right? So this is joined to every element. And essentially, that happens with every. With every, for instance, here for every coset. I mean, whenever you have a coset, you join that coset to each of its elements. And as you can see, well, you have a graph like this. But the thing is that it is actually a graph. This is one-dimensional. So, since this is one-dimensional, this will be This is one-dimensional, this will be homotopy equivalent to a watch of circles. And you might ask, of course, how many circles do you have? And in this case, what you will have is that you have an infinite countable amount of circles here. The only thing that you have to do is like collapse a maximal tree here, a spanning tree. So yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Is it econ? This is econ. Yeah, this is this is how much of equivalent to e-cong. Yeah, yeah, and actually this argument, yeah, this will happen for every f end. Yeah. Ah, well, no, uh, yeah. Become, I don't know, uh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know any like easy model for VCOM. I will, as I told you, I was, I mean, I ran into this topic because I was talking to Omar and I was like, okay, I think that we can do some interesting computations for discrete groups. And actually, this was the first, yeah, actually, this was like kind of the first example that I told you, like, okay, you can do this for free groups. And actually, this works also for torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Hyperbolic groups, I mean, it is exactly the same argument, it is because of this result that Kevin was talking yesterday, right? Because this one carries a measure action, the process, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, of course, yeah, it is easy to, yeah, you have the translation action, of course, and actually, what will happen, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this answer is your. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This answers your question, of course, because then what you will have is: okay, you have a translation action, okay? And the quotient is exactly the poset of a billion subgroups. But the poset of a billion subgroups has an initial object, which is the trivial subgroup. So that posit is always contractible. Yeah, that is also one thing that, I mean, whenever I started. I mean, whenever I started to study this stuff, it's okay. The first thing that you have to do to compute this Marco, of course, is to compute map, which is the positive of all, this will be the posit of all abelian subgroups of G. I mean, if you want to try to understand this posit, first you understand the maximal abelian subgroups and their intersections, right? So you compute first this map. But yeah, as Chaule was just pointing out, well, this is from the algebraic topology point of view, this is not interesting because that is always contractible, right? Yep. But whenever you go to cosets, Whenever you go to cosets, this might have a very interesting topology in principle. Yep? No. No, BCOM is not always contractible for groups. No. No, no, because, for instance, if you have an abelian group, G, for instance, if you have G. For instance, if you have G equal to Z square, right? Then B com G equals V G. And this is not contractual because this is S1 times S1. This is a two-dimensional source. So yeah, that answers your question, right? Yeah. Good. Good. Any other questions? Nope? Okay. So again, if I want to know or to understand the homotopy type of this ECOM, well, what I will do actually is to understand the homotopy type of the geometric realization of this poset, right? Because this poset is way smaller. I mean, the third one is way. I mean, the third one is way smaller than the previous one. For instance, even if G, for instance, in this case, I mean, if you try to draw APCO of F2, that is like really, really complicated. It's a really, really complicated object. But here, when you restrict to maximal a billion subgroups and their intersections, well, that simplifies a lot. And you have something that it is one-dimensional. Something that it is one-dimensional. Yep. So that is kind of what I'm going to do for the rest of the talk. And I'm going to do it exactly for three manifold groups. So I will focus on this MAPCO G. And a toy example is, of course, when G is abelian. Okay, when G is abelian, what happens with this MAPCO? Well, if G is a billion, then G itself is. If G is abelian, then G itself is maximal, actually, is the only maximal abelian subgroup, and it has only one coset. So this map consists only on, sorry, I draw here A, but should be G, G itself. So you only have one element in this posit, and therefore this is contractible, right? Which is something that we already knew right from the definitions. So this is telling you that, in fact, things are not obviously wrong. Obviously, wrong. Okay. Is it useful to me to cover or pick up? Yeah, no. I mean, in principle, no. Like in the covering maps and stuff. I guess for the homotopy theoretical, just the homotopy pullback. So that's it. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. And yeah, the other toy example is. And yeah, the other toy example is exactly the example that I already drew, right? What happens if you have a group that satisfies this condition, right? That whenever you have two distinct maximal abelian subgroups, their intersection is trivial. Then what happens is exactly this, right? So in that case, actually, I have the draw over there. Yeah, but I didn't draw the edges. So now I have this. Okay, so exactly in this case, Okay, so exactly in this case, whenever I have that the two distinct maximal division subgroups intersect trivially, then what I have automatically is that ECOM is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of circles. You might have like finitely many of them or not. Okay, but it is always a wedge of circles. Because again, you can collapse a spanning degree. And I have, well, some results that we obtained, like in our way to trying to understand MAPCO of the fundamental group of a geometric three manifold. We proved, for instance, this proposition. And assume that you have a central extension and you consider the following two causets, posits. So you consider the positive causets generated by maximum. Deposit of cosets generated by maximal abelian subgroups, which actually is, I don't know why I wrote this like this, but actually, this is MAPCO of G, which is the one that you want to understand. So assume that you want to understand MAPCO of G, right? And somehow you have a nice quotient of G, which is what I'm trying to say here. So assume that whenever you quotient by something that lies inside the center, then you translate. You translate, essentially, you translate the task of understanding this MAPCO of G to understanding this poset of cosets generated by maximal abelian subcurses of Q with abelian frame. Okay? It is not that you translate the computation of MAPCOG to the computation of MAPCOQ, because it might happen that abelian subgroups of Q don't have a billion per image. A billion-pre-image. Okay? So this, I will use this, but I will tell you exactly where and how. Maybe the general statement is not that important. But the philosophy behind this proposition is that whenever you have a good quotient, you can reduce your task to studying the quotient and there are a billion subgroups. Maximal deviant sub image of three. What is that parenthesized? Is that maximal deviant subgroup, and among those you chose those who happen to have a B3 image? Or is that the deviant subgroup? And you choose the ones that are maximal with respect to the property of having a D3. Yeah, the second one. The second one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. And well, as a corollary, actually, this is a very nice corollary. And whenever you have a group, for instance, and you have that, whenever you have two distinct maximal abelian subgroups, and they intersect exactly in the center, said is the center of T. Then whenever two maximal abelian groups intersect in the center, actually what you have is that also Ecom is a wedge of circles. Is a wedge of circles. And actually, the picture is exactly the same. I mean, the only thing that you have to do here is that you have to replace one by the center and the cosets of the center. Okay. And we also have these two results. And the first one is the following: Following. Ecom of a free product of groups is this. Is homotopy equivalent to a countable, well, G and G1 and G2 non-trivial, to a countable... Yeah. So in your father, you should be taking C2D the Heisenberg boot, which where the center in C, the version C plus C, two copies of the C. C plus C. Okay. Okay. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So for instance, this. Yeah, so we have a formula to compute the homotopy type of ECOM in terms of, sorry, this was. Okay, this is, there is a typo here. Let me write it correctly here. Write it correctly here. What I was trying to write down there is the following: this pcom of q1 star g2 is homotopy equivalent to this, a wedge of countably many, infinite countably many copies of g1 wedge with a countably many copies of ecom of g two. Of G2. And also, I have a wedge of countably many, infinite, countably many copies of S1. And this is a generalization of this computation, right? Because as I was telling you, for F2, well, you have a wedge of circles, infinitely many of them. Okay? So for instance, well, you can express F2 as set, star set. Star set and then, of course, this will be E comm of set, and this is contractible, and therefore, this can be erased. And also, this is contractible because it again is E comm of Z. So, the only thing that remains is this one, right? So, this is a generalization of what is happening here. And essentially, this, I mean, the way to prove this proposition is essentially using Kurosh. Kurosh subgroup subgroup theorem. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. In Kourosh free theorem, these circles come from the free part, exactly, in Kouroch subgroup theorem. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, because essentially what is going to happen is that every abelian subgroup of this free product, well, it is either sub-conjugate to G1 or sub-conjugate. conjugate to G1 or sub conjugate to G2, or it is something that it is a cyclic, infinite cyclic group, which is not conjugate to any of the factors. So that is what is going to happen here. Okay. And the other thing that we have is that ECOM, I mean the homotopy type of ECOM behaves well with respect to direct products. And that comes from the fact that every maximal abelian subgroup of the product Every abelian subgroup of the product is contained in an abelian group which is of the form a product of abelian subgroups of G1 and one of G2. That is essentially the way the proof works. And then that's it. So for instance, from this example, from these corollaries and this proposition, we might have, Have we are able to give another example, for instance, SL2 set. So, when we have SL2 set, we can pass to the quotient, that means we quotient out by the center, okay, which is essentially the identity and minus the identity matrix. And well, this PSL2 set is a pre-product of set two and set three, and doing something like what I did here. What I did here, that is a wedge of circles, for instance. So, you might ask if this is always a set of circles, right? It looks like that exactly. But, of course, you can like make, for instance, a product of SL2SE with SL2SE and use the second item. And what you will have is that come of that product is a product of these quadrupoles of circumstances. A product of these wedge of circles with itself, and then you have something that it is not a wedge of circles, right? Because this looks suspicious, right? I get it, yeah. But you can, you can now, you can, you can, uh, I mean, do like several examples with using these two results. And well, what we proved was the following: so, uh, consider M an orientable compact connected free manifold. Compact connected free manifold with fundamental group G. Assume that every prime factor of M is geometric. So what is going to happen is that Ecom has the homotopy type of a wedge of circles. Okay? Yeah. Actually, I is finite if and only if either G is abelian or it is finite. I mean, if G is finite. Finite. I mean, if G is finite, you can clearly have that the Ecom has the homotopy type of a wedge of circles with finitely many circles because MAPCO will be finite. I mean, this diagram, this post, is going to be finite. It's going to be compact. So whenever you have a group, a finite group, then the homotopy E-com has finite homotopy type. Yeah? But this is very nice because, I mean, it is kind of, I mean, you can expect this result. And at the same time, I think that maybe it is not that the case. For instance, what I was telling you, right? Whenever G, for instance, is a fundamental group of a hyperbolic free manifold, or even whatever dimension, a hyperbolic manifold, then the fundamental group. Manifold, then the fundamental group is torsion-free words hyperbolic. And then this argument works. So, for instance, for every, I mean, in the context of this result, in the hyperbolic case, things are very, very easy. That's kind of like maybe the main motivation why we started to work with three manifold groups, right? Because usually the hyperbolic case is kind of the hard case. But in this situation, But in this, but in this situation, it is not. Actually, it is a very, very easy case. So that's why we started to work: okay, we can deal with hyperbolic manifolds. Why don't we explore like all other possible geometric three manifolds? Okay. And what happened is that essentially what we did, well, in this result, what I do is, okay, I assume that every prime factor is geometric. Is geometric. And essentially, it is because we, I mean, yeah, we cannot still reach like, we cannot still, we don't know if we can drop this hypothesis, right? The geometric topology. Yep. Yeah, we don't know. So my three manifold topologies there. So if I look at three towers, The three torrents, yep, that shouldn't have e copied the verge of circles because it's something, yeah, yeah, but then it is like like, yeah, yeah, I'm thinking, yeah, no, what I'm thinking is that if is empty, is is empty, then what I have is a point. Maybe that is a convention that I have, right? It's a list of zeros. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have zero circles, I only have one point. Point is included. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I'm sorry. That is kind of a convention that I have in my mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have like the possibility that I is empty or zero. You have zero circles, that means a point. Where is I confirmed? That's something that you can say? I? Yeah, how do you decide what I is? Yeah, hey. Decide what i is. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, this this. I mean, this i is countable, right? Because you are working with countable groups. So, this this posit is going to be countable, right? So, this has like only two options, right? It is either finite or infinite is countable. And the cardinality of the finite thing is. So, i is finite if and only if this happens. In all other cases, i is always infinite. Yeah, yeah, but if it's finite, then you say what's the cardinality. Yeah, but if it's finite, then you say what's the current idea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah, for instance, yeah, of course, in the first case, when g is abelian, well, this is contractible, right? So you know that there are zero circles. And if it is finite, if g is finite, then by geometrization, essentially, what you have is that your manifold is spherical. It is covered by the sphere. And we have a full classification of all possible spherical, let's call them spherical. Let's call them spherical groups. And we did the computation like really case by case. Yeah. Like really explicit, like, okay, if you have this spherical group, then it is a wedge of 128 circles or something like that. Yeah. And actually, we didn't, I mean, we did it using gap, not by hand. Yeah. But there is like a highly computable. Well, this is just okay. If you have a three-manifold group, you can always decompose your manifold as a connected sum of prime manifolds, right? So using the result that I just showed you, that how to compute the homotopy type of ECOM for free products, well, you can reduce the computation of the homotopy type of ECOM to the computation of the homotopy. Okay, here is again this typo. Okay, here is the again this typo should be something like this. Uh, so you reduce the computation of ecom to the computation of ecom of each of the factors, right? So you reduce immediately to the prime case, okay? And actually what we did is, okay, we wanted to, of course, to deal with all prime manifolds, but uh so far we made it only for geometric manifolds. Okay, so well, by Thorston, there are uh There are eight possible three-dimensional geometries, which are these ones: the Euclidean one, the spherical one, the hyperbolic one, this S2 times E, the hyperbolic, two-dimensional hyperbolic times E, E is just a copy of the real numbers, and this other, this universal covering of SL2R, and these two geometries, nil and sol. Okay, these are all the possible geometries, and essentially what we did is What we did is deal with them case by case, geometry by geometry. Okay, and well, a geometric manifold is just a quotient of one of these geometries modulo with a discrete group of isometries, which acts freely, of course, in the geometry. You have the compact case, yes. No, uh, no, no, also the oh, yeah, the final. Oh, yeah, the finite volume, the cloud compact. Yeah, yeah, but we allow like things not to be closed. Yeah, that's correct. And well, let me show you some sample cases. Yeah, I mean, not all of them, but some of them. So for instance, if you have a finite volume, hyperbolic three-manifold, then essentially what is going to happen is kind of the same thing that happens in the hyperbolic closed hyperbolic case. And it is the fact that whenever you consider Whenever you consider all abelian subgroups, maximal abelian subgroups, there are two types of maximal abelian subgroups: those conjugate to the fundamental group of one of these torus in the cusps, or a cyclic group which is not subconjugate to a torus. Okay? And actually, that collection, the collection of all maximal abelian subgroups of G is a my normal collection. So you have exactly this picture again. Okay? So this is like a So, this is like a very easy case. That's what I just said in words. But then, okay, next. Oh, that was too fast. I mean, it is just an instance of this that already appeared like twice in the talk, but it is exactly that, right? You only have two levels in Mapco, and therefore you have a graph that is clearly of the homotopy type of a wedge of circles. Type of a wedge of circles. Okay? So this is maybe not a very interesting case since I already spoiled this. Some other case. Well, this geometry is well known to be like the easiest geometry in three manifold theory. Essentially, you have two possibilities, right? It's kind of funny. In our paper, we have like sections of like four pages long, and we have this section. I mean, one section for each geometry, and this section. For each geometry. And this section is like two lines long. So we have only two groups: set, which of course has E-com contractible because set is abelian. And the other one is the infinity, the infinite dihedral group. And well, by this, I have that that is a wedge of circles. So what is the fair question here? Do you always have a map code that has Map call that has height one, meaning that you only have two levels. That is like a fair question, right? But the, oh well, let me skip this other example, which is the geometry. Well, this is like cipher case. But let me skip this and I will go directly. Oh, well, in this case, also, I have that MapCode has high. So, I have that Mapco has height one. Yeah, but yeah, is every Mapco of height one? That is the question, and the answer is no. So, let me give you an example. See? So, the example is essentially all groups of this form, right? So, this K is the fundamental group of a clay model, which is this group, this semi-direct product. And this Z square is the index to subgroup of. Is the index to subgroup of both factors, right? So whenever you have a semi-direct product like this, sorry, an amalgamated product like this, Marco has height two. And therefore, the geometric realization has dimension two. Right? So some extra work has to be done in order to prove that actually that the geometric realization of MAPCO has the homotopy type of a wedge of circles. Of a wedge of circles. So we have to do something, an extra step. Okay? So, yeah, exactly. These types of groups appear exactly in these three geometries, the Euclidean one, the nil, and the solve. Yep. So actually, these three geometries were like the three more difficult ones to work with exactly because of this phenomenon. And I will explain like quickly what happens, for instance, in the sol case. So, in the sol case, for instance, well, actually, there is a very explicit classification of sol manifolds, so three manifolds, and of course, of their fundamental groups. And the fundamental group of a sol manifold, three sol manifold, is either a semi-direct product like this, where phi is an automorphism of z square that does not fit non-trivial subgroups of z square. Non-trivial subgroups of z square, or it is an amalgamated product as the one in the previous slide, right? But the thing is that for this semi-diaric product, it is not difficult to prove that actually this Mapco has again hydrogen, okay? And the thing is, actually Mapco looks like this. You have Z squared, which is this factor, and all the other maximal abelian subgroups are cyclic, and the intersection of any two of them is trivial. intersection of any two of them is is trivial i mean that that is like uh you can prove this like as a kind of an easy exercise of group theory like using just this this information this this uh semi-direct product presentation of of of the group uh but then you take this amalgamated product again psi well the the the amalgamation is via an automorphism of a which is isomorphic to z square and again this To z square, and again, this does not fix any non-trivial subgroups, okay. And then, what is going to happen is: okay, a is normal in each of the factors, therefore you can quote out a and then just reject to the infinite dihedral group because a has index 2 in both factors. So you can project to the infinity, and what is going to happen is that, well, d infinity has a cyclic subgroup of index 2. Of index two, right? So you can take the index two cyclic subgroup of d infinity and then you can take the pre-image under p of this g. So this g has index two in gamma. And actually, this g is of the form, it has the form of a semi-direct product as in the previous slide. Okay, so essentially, what you do is if you want to understand the abelian subgroups of gamma, but you can do abelian subgroups of gamma what you can do is you can take an abelian subgroup of gamma and you can uh you can push it to to to to to the infinity i mean you can take the image of that abelian subgroup of gamma uh in in the infinity okay and then you have a well like kind of a trichotomy uh either if you take an abelian subgroup i mean here sorry b is an abelian subgroup of gamma and if you take an abelian subgroup b of gamma either the images B of gamma, either the image is trivial, in which case B, of course, is containing A, or the image is isomorphic to set two. I mean, the image is a group of order two, or the image is infinite cyclic, because that's really like all the possibilities that you have inside the infinity. Okay. And of course, in this case, B is containing A. The second case, what is going to In A, the second case, what is going to happen is that B is subconjugate to K1 or K2. That is, I'm using some of the features of the infinity here. And in the third case, what is going to happen is that B is contained in G. So using this trichotomy, I can try to understand or I can manage to understand how maximal abelian subgroups in gamma behave and also how the intersections behave. So, long story short, Long story short, this is map of gamma. And in fact, this has high 2, right? And what is happening here is the following. Okay, of course, you have the trivial subgroup. Yep. And these groups, L1, L2, L3, these come from the abelian subgroups of this index to subgroup, which is a semilari product. So this supposed is the one coming from this. one coming from this finite this index to subgroup of gamma while the the other part the other part essentially is the one coming from the group the the abelian subgroups which are subconjugate to one of the factors is there a random piece yeah uh yeah actually what is happening here is the following this a is the only set square subgroup i mean you can prove that in this case in the Subgroup. I mean, you can prove that in this case, in the sole case, you have a unique z-square subgroup. And every other maximal subgroup, abelian subgroup, has rank one or is infinite cyclic. So every other is a copy of z-square, and the other ones are infinite cyclic. Yeah. But yeah, this is map. So what happens with map call, right? I mean, what happens when I pass to two cosets? What is going to happen is the following. Okay, as I To happen is the following. Okay, as I told you, well, this is, of course, contractible. Now, what I have to do is I have to take all possible causets. But what we can do is, okay, every possible, well, every causette, every, okay. Whenever I have a two-chain here, I mean, the two-chain has to start in the trivial subgroup and has to end in one of these cyclic groups or A, right? A right, and whenever I have code, I take cosets, then a chain of cosets of length two looks like this, which is a coset coming from one of these chains that starts in the Trivial group and then ends up in one of the C groups, or is of this form that ends up in a coset of A. Okay? But whenever you have an H of this form, what is going to be a form of H. What is going to happen is that this, sorry, whenever I have an edge of this form, when I say an edge of this form, I mean this edge, the red edge. This chain is determining a triangle in my geometric realization. And this edge, the long edge, what is happening here is that it only belongs to one of the triangles. It's a free phase of that triangle. So since that is the free phase, and that is due to the fact that when And that is due to the fact that whenever you fix G, right, and you want to go up to one of the C's, that C is completely determined by this G. I mean, if you want to start with G and you want to end up, for instance, in a coset of this C1, that is completely determined by this element G. So that's why this triangle belongs, this edge belongs to only one triangle, and then you can collapse that triangle. Triangle, and then you can collapse that triangle, right? And once you collapse those triangles, what is going to happen is that now these, well, you have these other triangles. And what is going to happen is that this lower edge now is free. But after collapsing this, I mean, before collapsing these triangles, this edge is not free. But once you collapse these triangles, this edge is free. And then, of course, you can remove or you can collapse those triangles. move or you can collapse those triangles. And that's it. Those were all the triangles in your geometric realization. And therefore you can yeah, you can contract, you can deform your complex, your two-dimensional complex, to the one skeleton. And that's why this ECOM also has the homotopy type of something that is one-dimensional, and therefore it is also of the homotopy type of a wedge of skeleton. Of the homotopy type of a wedge of circles. Yep. And this essentially happens in all the other cases. I mean, all the amalgamated, these amalgamated products, kind of the same thing happened. But this, well, we had to compute, like be very careful in computing this map. And the map is different for each case. So we had to be like really, really careful and do like a lot of. But is the argument of a lot of triangles the same? Yeah. Argument of collapse of triangle is the same, yeah. It is the same, it is exactly in the same spirit. I mean, like, like the difficult part is just to compute this. The collapsing part is like exactly the same. I mean, in the same spirit. So, I have this, and that's it. Thank you. So, are there any questions? If I look at a random memory of subgroups instead of the abedian ones, like what a finite index one cyclic you name it. Is there a way of translating that into what? To what is classified by these incomes that come out of it? Like, is there a metric theoretation of the corresponding poster, the general nonsense argument that says this is always homogeneously equivalent thing in algebraic topology that classifies a certain question and if so, is there a dictionary and all the different translations from what subgroups I looked at to what I'm classified. Look at two classifier. No, I haven't thought about it. Yeah, yeah. My honest answer is I don't know. I mean, yes, good question, but yeah, no, I haven't thought about it. Are there any other questions? Is it possible that all of the homotopy types you get are products of wedges of circles? Afora, like you take like any group, yeah. Is it possible that you? Any group. Yeah, is it possible that you don't get anything else? No, I don't think so. I mean, I don't remember very well, but in case computations, you know, in a case computation, I'm pretty sure that he found some groups such that the ECOM has the homotopy type of wedge of spheres of high dimension or something like that. Yeah. So I think that the answer is no. Do you have examples of interest? Now, do you have examples of infinitely common? Well, you can take like an infinite product of this kind of. Yeah, yeah. Other than that, I don't have any other examples. I mean, for discrete groups, I'm pretty sure that this is the first time that somebody computes this homotopy type for infinite discrete groups. So, yeah. Can you say, for instance, what happens with both? What happens if we call BS12? Oh, BS12. No, but that looks like a hard one. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that is infinite dimensional, actually, but I'm not sure. I would have to think about it. Yeah. The center is trivial, right? It should be, yeah, sure. One of your early slides you had you indicated that there had been done something about leak groups, where you have a topology on the group. So have you looked at if there is a relationship between what happens for a new group and what happens for analysis inside? No, no, I yeah, no, but yeah, that that yeah, that could be like a very natural question to. A very natural question to explore. Yeah, I know. Yeah, as I was telling you, like really for discrete groups, it's like not been done. So yeah, that may be a good question to continue this. Yeah. Do you have SLNZ, SL3Z? I said 3C? I said 3C? Ah, yeah, I said 3C. No, no, no, I don't have it. For instance, yeah, no, I don't have it. Yeah, no. Yeah. Okay. Any other question? Yes, no. Okay, so let's thank Hangan Luis for the very quick talk.
