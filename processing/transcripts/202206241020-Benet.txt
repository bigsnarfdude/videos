The title of his talk is Jet Transport Applied to Near Earth Objects Aphophies. Go ahead, Luis. Can you listen to me? Yes, yes. Okay. So first of all, let me thank the organizers, thank Grenato, and thank Marcel directly. And thank Marcel directly because I have been giving them a bit of a harsh time due to some personal issues. So, truly, thank you very much, and thank you for the invitation to give a talk here. I've changed the title of the talk very, very slightly. Instead of automatic differentiation, I chose the word jet transport because it appeared two days ago in the talks of Ari and Joanne. So let me. Joanne. So let me try to describe what it is, this jet transport eventually, and how we have applied it to the problem of near-Earth objects. And in particular, I will be talking about apothis. Before continuing, I have to say that this work was made together with my ex-student, ex-PhD student, Jorge Perez Hernandez, who is currently working at Telespatio in Germany. Working at Telespatio in Germany. So before I make my screen wide enough, let me motivate the problem a little bit. And for this, I will rely on YouTube. So I have no idea whether you can see or not the screen. If you can't, please just tell me. And I will be showing, sorry? We can see it. Okay. What I will be showing was recorded on. Showing was recorded on 15 February 2013. This is summer in Russia, and it seems that in Russia they have to have some camera on the cars due to some insurance things. So let me play it. So the person just arrived to a red light. I don't know whether you can see what's going on. So, I will stop the YouTube thing here and let me now use this white screen. So, what we just saw was Cheleb. What we just saw was Cheleblinski's meteor, which happened on the 15th February 2013. And I think the recording is fantastic because it was already from far away. And you see the brightness of a tiny meteor coming into the Earth. So, just to give some figures about what are we talking about, Chelevinsky met. Chelevinsky meteor measured about 20 meters of diameter, 20 meters, so about six cars, if you wish, if you put them all aligned. The velocity of entrance to the Earth was about 68,000 kilometers per hour, extremely fast. The altitude where it exploded was about 30 kilometers above the surface, and the energy released was about Released was about 30 Hiroshima bombs. And this tells us that actually, I mean, being hitted by such a tiny little stone is actually might be a quite dramatic thing. Luckily, Chelebinsky meteor was sort of, it sort of evaporated in the atmosphere due to friction. So it did not happen anything except for, I mean, the shake, the. Yes, the shake wave, sorry, something happened here, sorry, damaged a couple of building glasses and all this. But it was, say, a fortunate event. But this tells us that we have to be a bit worried about these sort of events. Now I will speak a little bit about Apophis. Apophis was a near-Earth object which was discovered. A near-Earth object which was discovered in 2004, summer 2004. Its estimated diameter is about 400 meters, so 20 times longer in diameter than Chelevinsky's meteor. And after a few measurements, it was noticed that it will have a very close approach to the Earth in April 13, 2029. April 13, 2029. Now, what is the issue with this April 13, 2029? The problem was that with the very few measurements taken in 2004, people could not actually rule out a direct collision to the Earth. And this, as I said, it is a 20 times larger in diameter near-Earth object than Near Earth object than Chelevinsky. And one of the problems to get, I mean, to truly be able to compute any possible collision event or whatever is the fact that near-Earth objects of about this size are influenced by a non-gravitational force, which is called the Yerukovsky effect. And this force is related to the absorbance of radiation that comes from the sun. Radiation that comes from the sun and it is radiated in any direction. And without determining that thing, we have a large uncertainty for the determination of Apoffee's orbit. So in this talk, I will present what we have done to determine this Yarkovsky parameter, which is the ruling parameter related to this non-gravitational interaction. This non-gravitational interaction. Now, again, let me go with these few words about the Arkovsky effect. It is an acceleration produced by re-emission of the absorbed solar radiation. Ari two days ago spoke about the radial component of this radiation force, the radiation pressure, which is Pressure, which is this term here. What we are concerned today is about the tangential component of that acceleration, which is this term. And this A2 is, I mean, say, up to now, an unknown coefficient. And the whole idea of this talk is to get as precise as possible an estimate for this A2 in order to be able to compute a well-defined and precise order. Define and precise orbit for Apoffis. Now, the form of this potential here, which is in front, or the force here, it will be a one over R square potential, with, I mean, some units around. And let me emphasize that since this is on the tangent direction, then it depends, say, implicitly on the velocity, and therefore it actually. And therefore, it acts as some sort of friction. Actually, it is not a dissipation, but depending on the sign of A2, it might be a dissipation or actually provoke that it gets some energy from the solar radiation. So let me just say it again. I will not present any theorem. I am afraid I can't, but I will try to do some very dirty numerical. Do some very dirty numerics, present the results of very dirty numerics which show which are very precise, or at least as precise as we have been able to do, to get a precise estimate for this A2 using jet transport techniques, which as far as I know is a new feature of our approach. So, before going into the actual results of my talk, let me state how Let me state how things are. Let me state the problem of orbit determination for, I mean, an object out of, I mean, which we have from some observations. So we have this dynamical model, which is a large set of differential equations, where we have the initial conditions. And actually, we a priori do not know the initial conditions. Conditions. You can think that this dynamical model is the solar system model, solar system, so not a reduced or simplified solar system model, but actually the best we can do with respect to our knowledge of the solar system. And we have some observations. And for the case of near-Earth objects, there are two types of observations, which essentially give, I mean, some numbers, which are these. Numbers, which I have denoted by these R sub ks here, and some uncertainties associated to those measurements, say, or observations, which are those sigma scales. And these observations happen at the specific time that I have labeled T sub K. And we have several of them. If we have many, it is much better. So if you think on 2004, there were only a few of them. There were only a few of these measurements, which were mostly packed on the same time in a very, very narrow, say, interval of time. And this makes that the uncertainties of the whole prediction grow very much. So what is the idea? It is if we have these measurements, we want to determine what are the initial conditions for the object. For the object at a given specific epoch in order to make predictions about its orbit. Now, from these equations of motions, and sorry, the trash bus is coming outside here, so sorry for the noise, we want to link these observations with the actual outcomes, so this x, the dependent variables in these equations, and these observations. And these observations. And this we do it through this observation function capital R, which might be time dependent and depends. The idea is to build one such function R for all different measurements or observations. So for instance, if you observe the declination or the well, the how is it called? I mean. The how is it called? I mean, or if you consider some radar observations, then these functions will be different for each different type of observation. Now, how do we link both of these quantities? So, or predictions, which are here on this function, capital R, and the observations we do it by the so-called OC residuals. OC stands for observed minus computed residual, and it is. Computed residual, and it is directly the difference. And the problem of the orbit determination is to minimize the mean square residual, which is given here, and where I have included also these uncertainties associated to the observations in this denominator. So this is one possible, say, nice function to minimize. The whole idea is to, out of this. idea is to out of this minimization obtain initial conditions that describe as close as possible the orbit of the the near the earth object now there are a couple of strong uh assumptions in in this whole scheme and one of them is related with the uncertainty sigma and when i write this uh mean square residual in this way i am assuming uh that the the sigmas are actually uncorrelated Are actually uncorrelated variables. And this is not quite so. If they are uncorrelated, then this matrix, this Q is simply written as this quadratic form, then this matrix is, W is diagonal. If they are correlated somehow, the matrix W is not diagonal. So, and this builds, I mean, this is important to acknowledge and to emphasize. And to emphasize this assumption because it is a non-trivial thing. I will very briefly describe how these things are done in practice. Now, okay, so the goal is to find the minimum with respect to the initial conditions of this mean square residual. So, what do we do? So, we Taylor expand around the minimum, this X0. Minimum, this X0 star, which is unknown, we get to this equation. And you can notice that I have expanded up to first-order terms in the difference with respect to the minimum position. So the first thing we are doing, it is neglecting any other higher-order term. Now, once we have this equation, it is pretty simple and quite straightforward, actually, to implement a Newton scheme from a good guess for. From a good guess for this, say an X0 to get from an X0 to get a better solution, and then simply by iterating this formula, we get better and better approximation of this X0 star. Now, Newton's scheme involves these two objects. So these first derivatives and these second derivatives. If you compute explicitly those things, the first derivative derivative derivative Those things, the first derivatives happen to be written in this way, and this B matrix is something related to the residuals, the size, sorry, the derivatives of the residuals with respect to the initial guess or the initial conditions, if you wish. Now, since the residuals, and let me go back here, involve this capital R function and or prediction. Predictions from a given initial condition, then, I mean, simply playing with the chain rule, you can show that this B is related with the first order variationals of the equations of motion. Now, so this is say doable numerically. What do I mean by doable numerically? That it is say complicated to write down the Complicate to write down the first variationals, but it is doable and you plug in into your dynamical model, and then you have this quantity integrated together with the equations of motion. Now, if we want to go to the second derivatives, they may be written in this way. And the second term here involves the second-order derivatives of the residuals with respect to the initial conditions. And now this quantity. And now, this quantity is at least numerically extremely expensive to calculate, in which sense, in the sense that you have to compute, I mean, the second-order derivatives. And if here we have a very large matrix with respect to the actual number of degrees of freedom of our dynamical model, this thing grows much larger. This is some sort of three-index tensor. So, So, Milania and Gronki, who have this very nice book, write in their book that this term is usually neglected and only a posteriori checked that it can be neglected because it is extremely expensive to compute numerically. So, this is a practical thing. They simply neglect this term and carry on the computation, having only this contribution to the second. this contribution to the second uh uh to to the yes second order derivatives okay uh at this point and uh despite the fact i haven't shown anything related to our work let me say that we will not uh take away this term in our calculations we will be considering in everything that i will be describing so what is our approach our approach first is to Our approach first is to have a realistic model for the solar system dynamics. And this is obviously important in the sense that you don't want to predict something which has some model-dependent assumptions which are influencing your predictions. We want to be as realistic as possible for the solar system dynamics. So, what I will present is the actual solar system. Is the actual solar system model that we have implemented at home? So, this is homemade, and which essentially is the same as the JPL had at least for a year ago. They have updated their solar system model. We will also have a realistic model for the dynamics of apophics. What's the difference among these two? Here, for the solar system dynamics, we will have The solar system dynamics, we will have a full large n body problem. I will describe what this large n body problem in a minute or two. For apophys, though, we will use the solutions of the solar system, and we will have apophys as a massless particle. So, we will have something like a n plus one restricted body problem, n plus one restricted problem. Problem. And the difference with the usual approaches is that we will use jet transport, that means automatic differentiation for apophysis orbit. And I will describe in some minutes what is this or more or less what is this jet transport. The important thing I want to, there are two things is that, I mean, it is a pity, but all numerics are precise, but none. Precise, but non-validated. So we cannot write any theorem out of them. We certainly will have model-dependent things, but as far as at least for a year, we were say using the same solar system model that JPL was using. And the jet transport techniques that we will implement will be of high order. And high order means that this type of things. Type of things will appear not to second order but actually to sixth or beyond that order. So, we a priori are able to include this type of terms with our approach. So, what is the solar system model we have? So, what is this large N actually? We will have the sun, all planets, so eight planets, we will have the moon. Planets, we will have the moon. The moon is crucial for whatever is happening in the earth, close to the earth, and that's the reason we want to have not only the moon, but also a very precise description of all the influences of the moon in the earth. We will have also Pluto. It happens to be important. And we will also have 343, the influence of the most massive 343 asteroids of the main. Asteroids of the main belt. So, if you add up things, this is more or less a 350-body problem, a little bit larger than that. Maybe I'm not making the sums correctly. But notice that each body has six degrees of freedom. So, this is a very, very large system of equations of motion. Now, we will also include post. Will also include post-Newtonian corrections. That means relativistic corrections for all bodies that I have named here, except for the asteroids. Asteroids will not feel, say, any effects related to general relativity. We will include the flattening of the bodies. They are not perfect spheres. So we will include the flattening up to J2 for the Sun and for the Earth up to J5. Up to J5, fifth. And we will also include all these flattening effects for, I mean, whenever we are discussing the sun, the moon, or all the inner planets together with Jupiter. That means for Saturn, we will not care about the influence how flat is the Earth or for Pluto. Now, with respect to the Moon, we will include sonal and tesseral harmonics. So not only Tesseral harmonics, so not only the flattening, but also the deformations of the moon up to degree six. And these contributions will affect the motion of the, will be affecting the interactions with the sun, all inner planets, and Jupiter as well. The orientation of the moon will be computed dynamically. That is, in our solar system model, we will write explicitly the equations of motion for the orientation of the moon. For the orientation of the moon, however, the long-term dynamics that the moon influences on the Earth's orientation will be done by an ad hoc model, which is the so-called EAU 1976-1980 models. And I mean, all these things essentially cover, essentially, and let me emphasize that, essentially cover the same as what it is called the DE for. What it is called the DE430 model of JPL, which was used for any fMRIS calculations at JPL. There are a couple of minor differences. Certainly, JPL has a dynamical model for the long-term orientation of the Earth. Also, they have some relativistic, I mean, since you are including relativistic corrections, you have to care about time with respect to which a frame. To which a frame, and all of those things are including in their model. Some of them are including ORS, not all of them. And let me show what are the differences with respect to DE430. Now, this is a 100-year integration, and what you're seeing is the differences with respect to the position of the Earth heliocentric position. And you see that over 100 years. And you see that over 100 years it changes in about six meters on the for the full integration. So the Earth is within six meters of the DE430 planetary sephemeris. If you go to the moon, it is say within 1.5 meters. And this is extremely important. I mean, we do care that the moon and the earth are properly described. Are properly described. So notice that the range of uncertainty of all fMRIs is in the order of tens of meters, if you wish, for the Earth and the Moon. Now for Jupiter, we get about one meter of the uncertainties, I mean, or the difference with respect to the 430 planetary ephemeris. Now, if we consider a theory. Now if we consider Ceres, which is the most massive asteroid of the main belt, we get say 100 kilometer difference, actually 500 kilometer differences with respect to the DE430 planetary ephemeris. Now, is this important or not? We will argue that it is not. And it is not because. And it is not because the Ceres is located in about three astronomical units. So, 500 kilometers in three times 150 million kilometers, it is say 10 to the minus 6 or 10 to the minus 7, which is fair enough. So, the relative error is tiny, though it is something important. Since the integrations are short enough for all purposes, we don't care for such a long integration. For such a long integration span, I think we are in good shape. But this is the type of things that we have to bear in mind if we would be integrating for longer time spans. Now, what's the Apophis model? What's the model for Apoffis? As I said before, we consider Apophis as a madless particle. So it will be an n plus one restricted problem. Problem for the model, we will consider the Sun, all planets, Moon, Pluto, and only the 16 most massive asteroids. While all the calculations I will present are done with these 16 most massive asteroids of the main belt, we did check that this is good enough. So, we also did some calculations considering 25 and 32. 25 and 32 of those asteroids, and essentially nothing changes at least to the scale of meters. There are changes in the scale of centimeters. Now, we will also consider post-Newtonian corrections in the same way as we did before, not included for all bodies, but not for the asteroids. We will only consider the J2 coefficient for the Earth, and we will consider the effect of A2. The effect of A2, so the Yarkovsky parameter, the transversal Yarkovsky parameter. And this is actually the goal of this talk: get a number for this thing. So let me say a few words of jet transport, which was already mentioned two days ago by Ali and Joanne. So what is this jet transport? Usually what we do is we consider an initial condition and we integrate Create a dynamical model for that initial condition, which takes that initial condition to some other place. Now, the idea of jet transport is to consider not only the initial condition, but actually a small neighborhood of the initial condition, which you may parameterize in this case by these tiny differences, which are ψ1 and ψ2. And then not only you propagate this. only you propagate this initial condition, but you propagate all this, I mean, this neighborhood by defining, say, by overloading not only your integrator, but whatever you are doing numerically with a truncated polynomial algebra, which allows you not to integrate only numbers, but also these variables to a given degree. To a given degree. And therefore, you are able to integrate a tiny little neighborhood and see how it is deformed by the dynamics. Now, when we teach in our lectures, usually we care only about the first order corrections and we call that linear stability. In what I will be describing here, we will only also consider higher order terms up to degree five, but have checked that everything is. But have checked that everything is okay up to degree seven. Now, so as I said, what you have is your dynamical model. And what you do is not to consider your initial conditions, but your initial conditions, I will explain later what is this G, plus some variables, variables in the sense of what we write in the paper. And we will treat these new things as a Things as a with a multivariate truncated polynomial algebra up to a given degree on delta x. Now, the details won't be shown here, but I mean, they've been developed very largely by the Barcelona school. And now, in these equations of motion, we only have the initial conditions for the asteroid. What I will do is in order. What I will do is, in order to include the influence of the Yarkovsky parameter, we will add a new equation of motion, which is quite trivial. Say, A2 will be assumed as a constant parameter, but allows me to include it in these initial conditions. So, just to show up, well, this was supposed to be a tiny gif. Give video, but it is not showing it. But the idea is that you consider lots of more initial conditions. And if you do your calculations with a high enough order, you can consider also how this ellipse evolves in time. And you see that, I mean, also after long enough times of integration, all the initial conditions which All the initial conditions would remain inside this initial ellipse. But I mean, by some reason, it did not work and I did not check it before. I'm sorry. So let me pass to the next slide. So how do we determine the orbit of a POFIS using exploiting these jet transport techniques? The point of jet transport is that whenever we want to free say our integration in time at a given Integration in time at a given time, the dependent variables are actually truncated polynomials on many variables on this delta x. And therefore, since we have those polynomials, say numerically, but still as polynomials, we may substitute them into the explicitly substitute them into the form of their residuals. Residuals. So the observed minus computed residuals. And what we get from here, and I have written this because we're truncating the polynomials, we have a multi-polynomial variable which is truncated of homogeneous degree. So these are constant terms. These are the linear corrections on delta x's, including Apoffee's parameter. Apoff is parameter, these are second-order corrections, et cetera, up to Q order corrections. Now, since we have the residuals, we may directly substitute them into this mean square function, mean square residual function, and we have exactly the same form. So we have this Q function as a multivariate expansion. Expansion in homogeneous polynomials on these delta x's. And now, since we have that explicitly, we may take derivatives with respect to delta x or to second-order derivatives, which will be relevant with this term, and then implement Newton's method that I described for the orbit determination scheme in a straightforward way without the need of cutting off the second-order terms in delta x, as I was. Terms in delta x, as I was showing before. Also, I forgot to mention what was the correlation matrix, but we may get expressions for the correlation matrix directly from these jet transport expressions as well. And this is important because eventually this will give us the uncertainties associated with the determination of the Yarkovsky's parameter. Now, Now, let me describe what are the numerics that we did. We have done the integrations, so the time integrations with a Taylor method of order 25 and with a very small absolute tolerance. The jet transport was implemented in seven variables, so we have the six degrees of freedom for the Six degrees of freedom for the three for the positions, three for the velocities of apoffies, and the seven is the Yarkovsky parameter. And we have considered it up to order to degree five. As I said, we checked that everything was stable up to degree seven, and it is. Now, this polynomials in seven variables of up to degree five means that we are dealing with 792. 792 terms of each one of those polynomials. Now we have seven dynamical quantities that we're integrating, and we have 26 coefficients. Each one of them is one of these polynomials. So, I mean, the number, say, of terms is actually huge, gigantic. Now, we will use the as nominal solution. The as nominal solution, so the guess, the initial guess solution for our jet transport scheme, the so-called JPL's 197 solution, which assumes a gravity-only solution. So there is no Yarkovsky parameter at all. And we will also assume that A2 at, I mean, that the jet transport is constructed. Uh, that the jet transport is constructed for these gravity-only solutions. Now, to reduce the, I mean, to handle, say, the observed minus computed residuals, we will use nearly 8,000 right ascension and declination astronometry observations from the Earth. Now, this cannot be used just as reported. One has to correct them due to systematic errors. them due to systematic errors and this is relevant for the part I was saying that usually one assumes that the observations that the error related to the observations are uncorrelated. Now we have to get rid of some systematics that correlate those errors. And we will use all rather astronometry data from the 2005 to up to 2013 including 2013, including some carried on last year. Last year is important because it was the last close approach of EPOFIS before the next one, which is the important one in April 13, 2029. And the reference epoch is some date, September, 17th, December 2020. So these are the results we obtain. So the purple data The purple data in this plot means that we are substrate, are all the astronometry observations, so ground-based, assuming that Yarkovsky effect is zero. And this square, blue square, represents the mean of all those observations. And here are some projections of those observations to see the histogram, how they are distributed. They are distributed. And the green points is the same, assuming that A2, the Yarkovsky parameter, is non-zero. And I will come to our estimate in a while. Now, the important observation from here, it is that we have that these purple curves have this two-mode distribution. So we have these tiny two peaks here and also here. Now, Now, usually, if we have lots of observations and we have a couple of assumptions fulfilled with respect to the independence of those observations, we would expect that these distributions behave as Gaussians. We do not get that, certainly not with these two peaks. Now, if we do the same for the The calculations which include A2, a non-zero A2, we get these distributions that have one peak are not quite Gaussian, but at least are one peak distributions. And say this is a hint that we are maybe getting something to converge to a Gaussian eventually. These are the same results for the rather observation of Gossun and Arecibo, except that those here are Except that those here at the very last panel are only including Goldstone observations. Now, again, purple means that the observations do not include the Yarkovsky effect, whereas the greens are including Apophysis effect. The important observation now, it is that if you include the uncertainty, all Uncertainty, all the observations are say with their uncertainty, include the value zero, which a priori is the exact value, if you include the Yarkovsky effect in the calculations, but are not, take for instance this observation, or take for instance this observation, if you simply set the Yarkovsky effect to zero. And this is the And this is the key value that we were after. And we get that this Yarkovsky parameter is minus 2.9 plus some tiny, and let me emphasize this, this tiny uncertainty. The reason we get so nice uncertainty, it is first because we have a huge set of observations, and not only that, but we also And not only that, but we also use the observations done during last year close approach of Apoffis. And this help to reduce this uncertainty, which before was, I think, an order of magnitude larger. But still, together this value with the uncertainty means that A2 is different from zero. Now, previous estimates, which Now, previous estimates, which certainly did not include the observations of 2021, had a non-zero value for A2, but the uncertainty was so large that A2 equal to 0 could not be ruled out. And this means, well, with this value of A2, one can compute the mean semi-major axis drift, which is about 200. Meters per year, which is say large enough. Now, two more minutes. Sorry, yes, I actually began a bit later, but yes, two more minutes enough. So, let me show now lots of numbers which are related with the statistics of the fit we made. OR6 means that we did not include the Yarkovsky effect, so we have only six degrees. So we have only six degrees of freedom for the initial conditions. And OR7 means that we did include the Yarkovsky effect, a non-zero possible value, actually this value at the very end. OR means the astrometry observations and the radar observations. So we have both observations. And what you can notice when you compare these two columns is that These two columns is that the table with this OR7 means is always systematically smaller than the table with OR6. In particular, the chi-square of the feed is one order of magnitude smaller. So all these tiny little comparisons means that the stat, say, assuming a model, a dynamical model, which includes the Yerkovsky parameter. The Yarkovsky parameter is systematically describing better the observations than a model that does not include the Yarkovsky parameter. And now I think that the big question, sorry, so now my time is up, is that April 13, 2029, the closest approach distance is about 38,000 kilometers. And just to get an idea, And just to get an idea of this distance, the uppermost satellites around the Earth are something in the 36,000 kilometer range. So, I mean, Apophis will truly be very, very close to the Earth in April 2029. So close that it will be within one-tenth of the distance to the moon. And well, this plot, I will not describe it, but with all... I will not describe it, but with all results, we could rule out also a collision in a resonant return in 2036 and also in 2038. And with this, I will only leave this slide there. And thank you for your attention. And I'll take questions now. We thank Tuluis. Thank you, Junior. Any other questions or comments for Luis? I have a question about the variables. Yes. What kind of variables do you use? Double precision, quad precision? I mean, all integrations I presented today were done in. Presented today were done in using double precision. So floating points with 64 bits. But we also checked that everything was consistent if we did the calculations with quadruple precision. Maybe as a parenthesis, as a side remark, JPL also uses double precision. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And maybe let me first. Let me first leave this slide also. Thank you. And these are what we have been developing around this work. Okay, thank you. Another question, comment? We thank again to Toulouse. Now we have the coffee break. The coffee break. The next talk will begin at
