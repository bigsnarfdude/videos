 So it is a pleasure to introduce the last speaker of this afternoon, Professor Makuto Fuchivara, on conservation theorems on semi-classical arithmetic. Please. Thank you for introduction. Actually, I'm also not a professor and I'm working in postdoc in the major university, but until recently. But until recently, I work in Adam in Munich. So, my talk is on the conservation theorems on semi-classical arithmetic. This is a joint work with Taishi Kulahashi from Kobe University. And I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me an opportunity to give a talk here. And it was quite a pity not to. Yeah, quite pity not to be able to go physically hancho, but yeah, I glad to have you online like this. Okay, let me start. Actually, as already mentioned many times in this workshop, it is well known that piano arithmetic is pi 2 conservative over heiting arithmetic. Over hiding arithmetic HA. And there are several ways to prove this fact. For example, one is by the negative translation followed by Gerdo's functional interpretation or dialect interpretation. Another one is the negative translation for Uh, the negative translation followed by the so-called A-translation introduced by Professor Javi Friedman. And there is also another way to prove that, which is called generalized GÃ¶del-Gensen negative translation with substitution. Substitution, which was developed by Ishihara more or less recently. And in this talk, we generalize this well-known fact in the context of semi-classical arithmetic, which means arithmetic in between PA and HA by extending. By extending the second and third method. Actually, the second way is simpler. So let me start from the second one method. Actually, this is our framework. We work with the standard formulation of ATA, which has function symbols. Which has function symbols for all printed recursive functions. And we work in the language containing all the logical constants for all exist implication and or and contradiction. And here not phi is an abbreviation of phi implies say a bottom. Okay, and PA is defined as HA. Defined as HA augmented with the law of excluded middle. Yeah, this is as usual. And this is also the standard definition. The class sigma k and pi k of formulas of HA are defined as follows. Sigma 0 as well as pi 0 is a class of quantifier-free formulas and pi And pi k plus 1 is defined like this for all exist for all blah blah yeah to k plus 1 quantifiers. And sigma k plus 1 is a class of formula of form exist for all exist. Yeah, like this. And a formula phi is of prenex normal form if phi. form if phi is in sigma k or pi k for some k and namely the all the all the quantifiers are in front and in this talk we use the gamma lamb or the class gamma uh this is a actually this is a low exclusive middle uh for formulas. For formulas in gamma, and DNE is the initial letters of double negation elimination. And we also consider sigma K D and E and so on. And actually, one can easily show sigma K lem implies sigma k d and e and we TNE and the reaching price sigma k minus one then actually not only this logical principle or one can consider the similar principles for pi k class pi k or pi k over pi k or delta k in some sense and which is systematically studied by the people By the paper by Akama Berari Hayesh Kohlenberg 2004. And it was shown that these strict, this logical principle consists of the strict arithmetical hierarchy. And so for logical principle P, H A HA plus P forms semi classical arithmetic. Namely, this is the arithmetic in between piano arithmetic and hiding arithmetic. So this is a way of the proof of the previous fact by Harvey Friedman. Harvey Friedman. Here, for the make the things absolutely clear, here I use the placeholder star and HA star denote H let H star denote H A in the extended language with this. With this placeholder star. This is a yeah of RET0. And in the end, we substitute this star by some formula in the language of HA. So actually, in the end, we obtain just a statement in the language of HA. So the proof. So the proof is proof steps are as follows. First, assume that P A proves for X exist Y, phi X Y, this phi is not. Then by the negative translation, it follows that H proved or X not not exist Y, phi X Y. XY then of course we can omit this 4x and here using by the so-called A translation actually here the prime formula phi P all of the prime formula phi P is replaced by Phi P or star in in yeah this yeah this is Yeah, this is the A translation. Then we obtain that AJ star proves not star, not star, exist Y, phi star, X Y. Yeah, actually not star means just imprise star. And then in the end, by substituting star with exist y, exist y phi x y we obtain here star is replaced by exist y phi x y so and phi star x y is actually phi star x y or equals to y phi x y. So we have the following. The following. And of course, this is equivalent to 4x equals y, phi xy. Then in the end, we obtain for HA proves the same pi 2 formula. Okay. Here, actually, technically, I use this substitution lemma. Substitution lemma. Yeah, this is we are very much technical, but let X be a set of HA sentences and V be a H star formula. And if H star plus X proves V, then HJ plus X proves V, where star is replaced by Psi for any HA formula of Psi. And here we need some. And here we need some variable condition, namely the free variables of psi are not bounded in phi. Okay, this is the standard, I think. So this is the one negative translation. Yeah, actually there are many, several negative translations, but here I use the Genton's. Genton's one, and there are also several variants, but I choose it from the book of Terrestra, the book in 1973. And yeah, here this is one of the well-known definition. And for each formula phi, its negative translation phi n is defined inductively. Defined inductively as follows. For prime formula Vp, if Vp is not bottom, then its negative transition is defined as not not Vp. And the negative transition bottom is bottom. And actually it commutes for and and implies and for all. Only the only the crucial part is the translation of all and Translation of or and exists. And yeah, or is interpreted as not, not or like this. And exist is interpreted as not not exist, like this. Yeah, then of course by induction the structural formulas, one can show the free variable phi is the same as the free variable of phi n. Okay, and this is the Okay, and this is the soundness of the negative translation for any AGA formula phi. If PA proves phi, then AG approves the negative translation of phi. So in the context of semi-classical arithmetic, one can show the following lemma by simultaneous induction on k namely four. namely for any HA formula phi in sigma k H plus sigma k dn e shows that phi is equivalent to the phi n and for any h a formula phi in pi k h a plus sigma k minus 1 dn e proves the equivalence between phi and phi n. So by the second clause of this lemma, if P A proves for all exist y phi x y where phi x y is in pi k then actually h a plus sigma k minus them actually sigma k minus one tn e is enough. One dn e is enough, right? Uh, proves uh for x uh not not exist y uh phi x y. Okay. So next we develop the soundness of the A translation in the setting of semi-classical arithmetic. Semi-classical arithmetic. This is a definition of a translation. For HA formula phi, define phi star as a formula obtained from phi by replacing all the prime formula phi p with phi p or star. And in particular, bottom star is defined bottom. Is defined bottom over star, which is equivalent to star over HA star because yeah, HA star contains the axiom bottom implies star R star. Yes. And in what follows, not star phi denotes phi implies star. And as before, actually free variable of phi is ident same as free variables of phi star. So, and this is a key lemma for our relativization. First, in what follows, let H star plus sigma k l m denote h denote HA star argumented with sigma KLM for HA formulas. So actually in this part, sigma KLM is defined in the language of HA. And yeah, by simultaneous induction on K, one can show the following. For any HA formula phi in sigma k, HA star plus sigma h star plus sigma k minus one uh log excluded middle uh lem proves phi star is equivalent to phi or star and for any H formula phi in pi k H star plus sigma K lm proves phi star is equivalent to phi star so by using this lemma let us lemma let us show the relativized soundness of the A translation. Namely for any H formula phi, if H plus sigma K lm proves phi, then H A star plus sigma K L M proves phi star. So this soundness theorem for H A is already shown in the original paper by In the original paper by Harvey Friedman. So it suffices to show that H star plus sigma k then proves phi star for any phi in sigma k. So fix phi as exist x phi1 or not exist x phi 1 with phi 1 in pi k minus 1. Then phi star then phi star is equivalent to by definition is equivalent to exist x phi1 star or not star exist x phi1 star. Then by the previous lemma, h a star plus sigma k minus 1 lem proves this one. Actually phi1 star is replaced by phi1 war star. One world star in both parts. So, and this is equivalent to this one, exist x phi1 or star or not star exist x phi1. So this is derived from exist phi1 or not exist x phi1, which is an instance of sigma k lamb. sigma k lem so uh we have that uh h star plus sigma k lem proves uh phi star this is a proof okay so by using this uh relativized uh soundness uh we can show uh this relativized uh conservation uh pretty much in re uh first assume that First, assume that PA proves when x is y pxy, where phi is in pi k, then h a plus sigma k minus 1 lamb proves for x not exist y, phi x y by negative translation. Yeah, and 4x can be dropped here. Then, by using the soundness of the A translation, A translation in this semi-classical arithmetic, we have that a j star plus sigma k minus 1 lem proved not star not star exists to y p star xy. Then using the key lemma again here, we had that h star plus sigma k lem proves not star not star exist y phi x y or star. or star. Then substituting star by exist y phi xy, it follows that HA plus sigma K L M proves this one as before. Then it follows that H A plus sigma K L M proves 4x equals y 3 x y. Yeah, this is a true so uh So now we can relativize the first conservation theorem into semi-classical arithmetic. But we have another way, namely the third method to prove that one. Then by using this third method, one can show the conservation. Show the conservation theorem for more wider classes of formulas. So let me explain this method. Actually, in the paper by Ishihara 2000, defined classes QRJ of formulates of IQC, which is Which is intuitionistic fast-order logic, and by using the generalized negative translation and the substitution lemma, show that if phi is in K, this class K, and gamma is a set of formulas closed under his translation, Dala translation, then Gamma classically proves phi, then gamma industriistically proves phi. Then in the later paper, 2012, he mentioned that since if one considers the language of arithmetic, since the class pi to The class pi2 is contained in his class K, so one can obtain the fact that Pa is pi2 conservative over HA. And in this argument in the context of same-plask arithmetic, we showed a re-releutized conservation theorem. Actually, this is a definition by Shara. It is exactly the same as Exactly the same as Gensen's negative translation, which I presented before. So, yeah, but only the difference is here, bottom is replaced by the placeholder dollar. Here, I use dollar for the placeholder to distinguish the distinguish this translation with a Freedom of A translation. Freedom of A translation. So, yeah, actually, this is exactly the same as before. But as a remark, since star, okay, sorry, this this G should be N. I'd like to say the Say the Friedman A translation of the negative translation of phi is equivalent to phi data where data is replaced by star. This is because bottom over star is equivalent to star. Equivalent to star intuitionistically. Then, in particular, it is obvious from this definition: if we replace data with bottom, then this is just Kenton's negative translation. So then just Just in the same manner as for Genten's negative translation, one can show like this. Namely, HA Dala proves not data, not Dala, Phi Dala is equivalent to Phi Dala. And if PA proves phi, then HA DARA proves V data. Actually, Actually, negative trans Gensen's negative translation is the translation from classical logic to minimal logic. And for such a property, which holds over minimal logic, is, I mean, still holds for the Dara translation because in Dara translation, bottom does not There is no bottom in data translation, but in such a proof, how to say, the bottom does not play any role. So, okay. So, by using this translation, actually, what is What is done in Ishara's paper is the following. He defined the classes Q and R and J simultaneously like this. Yeah, it's a little bit complicated, but it works in the following sense. Namely, if A is in A is in this class Q, then A implies A dollar induitionistically. And if A is in this class R, then not data, not A implies A data. This is not a typo. Actually, in this setting, In this setting, this language contains bottom and also dala. So not dala, not a means bottom, a implies bottom, implies dala. And the third one states that a is in this class J, then a dollar implies not dollar, not dollar A. So So, actually, by imitating this one in the context of semi-classical arithmetic, we relativize them. And we first define the relativized classes RK and JK as follows. First, define R0 and J0 as a set of control-free forms. quantifier free forms yes then yes sigma zero pi zero and for each k we define simultaneously the classes rk plus one and j k plus one as follows let f range over formulas in sigma k and f prime range over pi k and r and r prime over those in r over those in Rk plus 1 and J and J prime over the formulas in Jk plus 1. Then Rk plus 1 and Jk plus 1 are inductively generated by these clauses. Actually, these clauses are very much the same as Ishihara's one, R and J, except the part of the prime formula. Formula. So then, actually, what we want to show is the third lemma, but for this, actually, this third lemma is just a counterpart of Ishihara's proposition, especially the second clause. Second cloth and third cloth, actually. Then for this lemma, we need the similar lemma, key lemma, as previous. First, one can show that for quantifier free fee, fee dollar is equivalent to fee or dollar. Phi or dollar. This is just by induction on the structure of quantifier-free formulas. Then, by using this lemma, one can show by simultaneous induction on k that for phi in sigma k h dala plus sigma k lem proves phi dala is equivalent to phi over data. And phi in pi k h a dala. K H dala plus sigma k lm proves phi dala is equivalent to phi dollar. Then actually if you have this key lemma then it is not difficult to show this third one as in the Ishara's paper. So next we define Q the class QK. Q The class QK first Q0 is defined as a set of quantifier-free formulas, and for each K, we define a class QK plus 1 as follows. Here, P range over prime formulas, and Q and Q prime over formulating QK plus 1, and here J over formulating JK plus 1, then QK plus 1 is inductively generated by the following. Be generated by the following closet. Here, J is appeared only in the premise of the implication. Then, actually, this is a counterpart of the clause 1 of Ishara. And it says, yeah, for HA formula phi, if phi is in QK plus 1, then HA dollar plus sigma KLM approves phi price phi. phi equals phi ta and then this definition is a little bit different from Shara's one that for each k we define our class vk as follows let j range over the formulating jk and v and v prime over formulating yeah previously defined class vk then uh Vk, then now we define VK as follows. Then VK is inductively defined like this. Namely, the formula in JK is contained in VK. And if B and V prime is contained in VK, then B and B prime is in VK. And for XB, And for Xv, it's in VK. Then our theorem is the following. For any AGA formula phi in VK plus 1 and Psi in QK plus 1, if PA proves psi implies phi, then HA plus sigma KLM proves psi implies phi. Then since Then since pi k actually j k contains a sig yeah now pi k plus 2 is a subclass of B k plus 1 because sigma k plus 1 is the subclass of J K. K because JK is defined from pi j k per so yeah just a moment q k plus one okay yeah So Jk plus yeah Jk plus one is defined from the formula in pi k like this then jk plus one contains sigma k plus one so vk plus one contains pi k plus two and it is easy to see and it is easy to see uh phi is uh pre next all prenex normal uh form prenex formulas are contained in uh q k plus 1 then as a corollary we have this one okay so the proof of the theorem is as follows first it suffices to show the assertion suffices to show the assertion for phi in vk plus 1 and psi in qk plus 1 such that free variables of phi is not bounded in psi so we show this by induction on the structural formulas in vk plus 1 namely that here okay first assume that phi is in j k plus 1 and phi and fix psi in qk plus 1 such that free variable of phi is not bounded in psi and supports a pa approved of psi implies phi then applying the data negative translation we have a j data approved psi data implies phi data then since phi is j in j k j k plus J in j k j k plus 1 and size in q k plus 1 by using our lemma namely this lemma for j and this lemma for q we have that a j dala plus sigma k lem proves of psi implied proves psi implies not dala not dala phi then by the substitution lemma actually by substitution substituting data with phi then we have that h a plus sigma k lem proves psi implies phi so this is a So, this is a base case. And this is a case for phi is phi1 and phi2 in vk plus 1. Then phi1 and phi2 is in vk plus 1 and fix psi in qk plus 1 satisfying this variable condition. And suppose PA plus phi psi implies phi1 and phi2. And phi2, then yeah, it is straightforward to see by using the induction hypothesis. We have that HA plus sigma KLM proves psi implies phi1 and phi2. And this is the case of for all phi1 in vk plus 1. In this case, yeah, fixed. case uh yeah fix uh yeah then p1 is in vk plus 1 and fixed psi in qk plus 1 satisfy the variable condition and in addition uh one can assume uh x is not in the free variable of psi then suppose of pa proves psi implies for x phi1 then uh of course psi implies phi1 and by the induction induction hypothesis the induction induction hypothesis we have hf plus sigma k length proves phi implies of psi implies phi1 and hence by this variable condition for x of psi implies up no no this is just yeah just insert for x in front and since x is not in it's not a free variable psi we have that h we have that AGF sigma k11 proves sine values for x phi1 yeah this is a proof so as a remark actually Akama Berardihai-Colenbach introduced the classes EK and UK such that every formula in EK is equivalent over PA over PA to some formula in sigma k and the same for u k and pi k in this sense ek and u k some I mean some correspond to sigma classes sigma k and pi k classically. Then actually our classes JK and RK are equivalent to EK Equivalent to EK and UK respectively over HA plus one level down low excluded mil and sigma k minus one lamp. So yeah, actually I think this two method are somewhat similar and actually Ishihara's translation is Ishihara's translation is some combination of the negative translation and a translation. So I think it's definitely there's some relation between this method. So yeah, and here I wrote two questions. First one is the following. Not only Gensen's negative translation, but there are also other negative translations. Also, other negative translations. Yeah. So, which are equivalent to the former over intuitionistic logic, but not so over minimal logic. For example, the clauders negative translation is not equivalent to against anyone over minimal logic. So I wonder, yeah, the Yeah, the question is: for example, can we obtain interesting conservation results by using their generalized variants combined with substitution lemma? And the second question is, yeah, actually I'm interested in this one. And how is the entire structure of the relation between the second and third method? And it is also the question that. uh yeah the question that how how how can we study or compare uh them is a good way to compare or investigate okay so uh in the end of my talk i a little bit mention about the optimality of the conservation results uh here the the simplest one namely let t be an extension of h be an extension of HA and if PA is pi k plus 2 conservative over T then this T proves sigma k len. This can be shown by induction on K and the base case is trivial. Before the induction step, assume that the assertion for K to show that for K plus 1. The statement for K plus 1 to show the statement for K plus 1 to show the statement for k plus 1, suppose that P A is pi k plus 3 conservative over t. Then, of course, it is pi k plus 2 conservative over t. Then by induction hypothesis, we have t proof sigma k ln. Then our goal is to show sigma k plus 1 lamb, then fix an instance of sigma k plus 1 lamb here, where phi1 is in sigma k plus 1. One then let psi one x in pi k plus one satisfied that h a plus sigma k d and e proves not phi one is equivalent to psi one. It's possible in the presence of sigma k d and e. Then actually digesti. actually there exists C such that X C in sigma k plus 2 X C is equivalent to P1 or of Psi 1 then H plus sigma K D and E proves Phi is equivalent to 4 X Psi which is in Pi K plus 3. So yeah since P A Uh yeah, since P A proves phi, then we have P A proves 4x psi x. Then by our assumption, we have T proves 4x psi x. Since sigma k lm derives sigma k d and e, we obtain the original phi from yeah by replacing psi by by yeah original one yeah p1x or not p1x yeah then actually here I have shown the equivalence between in this line but in our paper we also considered the conservation the relation between conservation theorems and the logical principle And the logical principle. Here, gamma cons is the assertion that PA is gamma conservative over T. And yeah, then we, for example, we consider not only pi k plus 2 conservation, but also like EK conservative or UK. Or UK conservative and so on. And in the case of the classes, which is closed under fall quantifier, I mean, this under Tilda does not change this. This under Tilde means denotes the class of sentences in Gamma, namely closed formula in Gamma. But for example, in the But for example, in the case of sigma, sigma k, the sigma k conservativity is different from sigma k under tear the conservative conservative because this is not closed under fault quantifiers. So the situation is somewhat messy, but we investigate the relation between the strengths of the conservation cell and for Of the conservation zone for the classes, existing classes of formulas. But only few implications, we could show only few implications are strict, but many of them still open that whether many of the implications are strict. But I think how many of I think many of them are strict. So, these are references, and most of the contents in this talk is written in this draft of our paper, which you can get it from archive. Yeah, that's all. Thank you for your attention. Okay. Okay, let's thank our speaker. So, questions remarks Professor Friedman Yes You can look at this in intuition. You can look at this in intuitionistic set theory, and you can also modify intuitionistic set theory by having a certain amount of it subject to classical logic. Actually, having all bounded quantification classical and arbitrary quantification. An arbitrary quantification not was studied in a PhD student of mine, Robert Wolfe. And I'm not sure. I think it was taken up by someone else more recently in the literature. I'm not sure. Michael Ratchin here, he can tell me. But I think you can try to carry out this. Try to carry out this kind of program in the context of intuition, etc. I see Michael is here. Okay, yeah, thank you. Actually, I know you developed a translation in more general setting and it works also for set summary. Yeah, but actually, I think this works is. This works is a very general method. So, yeah, I think it works also for some other context like reset theory or some finite type arithmetic and so on. But one thing I'm not sure is the hierarchy like this. Actually, I investigate the hierarchy, arithmetic hierarchy of logical principle only in the context of arithmetic. In the context of arithmetic. So I'm not sure what happened in the context of set theory for this here. Thank you for your comment. Michael Loratin. Yeah, just a comment. So, Javi, what you said about whether it has been taken up by somebody, these semi-intuitionistic set theories were also Investigated by Saul Pfefferman, as you might know. So he had the slogan that what's definite is the realm of classical logic and what's indefinite is the realm of intuitionistic logic. So you can, when you argue about the universe at large, so with unbounded quantifiers, you should use intuitionistic logic. And for the definite part, I mean, the definite part was. Definite part, I mean, the definite part was identified with sets. So basically, you have excluded. So if you have excluded middle for the elemented relation, right? So that's the setting in which Pfefferman studied this. You know something? I do recall this, because originally when I was advising Wolf, Pfefferman did not like this idea at all and criticized it. At all, and criticized it. And I think I now remember. And I think I now remember that much later he did come around to doing what you just said, and he was the one I was thinking of. But just one more comment. I think if one wants to do mathematics in a semi-intuitionistic set theory, it would be nice if GÃ¶del, and if not GÃ¶del's, Myhill's exponentiation axiom. Exponentiation axiom would be available. But with Pfefferman's approach, where you have excluded middle on sets, you immediately get power sets. So there's a disadvantage. I think one should consider something in between excluded middle for delta zero and so something lower than that, maybe things like LPO or stronger versions of that. But I would like to add another comment, which is a bit different. So, these kinds of translations, Makuta, that you used, they are also interesting if you look at geometric theories. So, geometric theories are theories where you have these positive formulas are built up from atoms via just disjunction and existential quantification. And then you look at so-called geometric. And then you look at so-called geometric implications. Those are implications between positive formulas, and then you can universally quantify over them. And so, and this gives you a geometric theory. And geometric theories are very, very common in mathematics, actually. I mean, like theory of algebraic closed fields and rings and projective symmetries and all kinds of things. And it was observed by, I think. I think for the first time in a category theoretic or top of theoretic context, that actually these geometric, classical geometric theories are conservative over intuitionistic geometric theories exactly for the geometric implications. And the proof, I think, was by Barr, it involves a quite half a Luton Coppers theory. Theory. But the result is actually an immediate consequence of cut elimination. So if you imply Gensen's cut elimination, Gensen could have proved this result, then you get it from that. But as you know, there is, of course, one disadvantage of this method. The cut elimination usually comes with exponential or even super-exponential growth. So if you want to do a translation, if you say you have a classic. Translation: If you say you have a classical proof and now I want to get hold, I want to get my mittens on the integeristic proof, then this can be a real obstacle. If the length of the proof grows exponentially. But actually, with some of the papers you quoted, I recently looked at this again and I published a paper where I said basically with this kind of modifications and Of modifications and of A translations, you can show it. So, basically, if you have a, so that means having a classical proof of a geometric implication, this kind of translation can be used to actually give you the intuitionistic proof of it. And the nice thing about it is that the growth is not exponential, it's something like polynomial, you know, it's in a nice. you know it's in the in a nice range and and so my suggestion would be it might be might be interesting to go um because you i think you had a slide where you suggested some future research um the idea would be maybe you can what happens if you have theories that are maybe not geometric but a little bit above what happens then is there are there also interesting um translations from the classical to the intuitionistic From the classical to the intuitionistic or semi-intuitionistic context. Okay, that was my suggestion. Yeah, I think it was. What do you mean by the more generized or more conservative? Yeah, I mean, so it's very interesting that basically that geometric theory, the classical geometric theories, are conservative over. Are conservative over the intuitionistic counterparts for geometric implications. Exactly. But there may be some theories where we don't have an geometric axiomatization. And it might be nice to look at them. And then you see, you want to maybe go also to the intuitionistic proof because it can be milked for the computational content. But you might not be able to directly go to the intuitionist. Directly go to the intogenistic theory because that might be in some sense weaker. So, the question is: what would you add on the intogenistic side? Maybe some kind of semi-intogenistic principle, and so on. And so, maybe with your these translations, some new results can be obtained. Okay, yeah, thank you for the questions, remarks? Yeah, sorry, I send the question, but not to Makodo, but to Professor Rajan. Yeah, I'm asking the title of the paper you just mentioned. Okay. The title of the paper is good question. I think there is no, there's something like there is no speed up or something like that. Something like that. The paper was in, you find it in archive, yeah. So actually, I can look it up. My computer is very slow. Let me find the paper. You're looking at your publication list, yeah. This is all this stuff is out of date. I mean, forget it.
