I just want to, a reminder for the people online who didn't see in the chat, there's a Zoom capture photo right after this box. So please turn your cameras on for that. Maybe I'll get you to remind the people of that. We'll have to come. Okay. You got it. Excellent. Thank you. Thanks, Liam, for the introduction and organizers putting together such a nice workshop. You know, nice workshop. Today, I want to talk about quantum homology and mounted surfaces, and I'm going to sort of piece together some joint projects with a bunch of people, Alan Du, Gary Guth, Sung Kim Kang, Sung Wong Kim, Maggie Miller, Young Park, and Isaac Sundberg. And what I'm going to want to try to do is convey some of the techniques that we can use to use phonophomology study. Use to use quantophonology study surfaces. Mainly, I'll sort of use one main result as a sort of a through line for running example, but I'll sprinkle in some results from different projects with these folks. Okay. And so what's on the screen right now is what might maybe look like some kind of inner tube, but this is going to be sort of a key player. This is the standard torus being split up into two different surfaces at the same time. Uh, two different surfaces of the same boundary, um, you know, randomly the pullout there. And I should mention that the core question we're going to be thinking about is one posed by uh oops, we're going to progress. Let's see, hold on one second. Is this going to work? Sorry, I'll try to save this all. Okay, it's going to, I'll have to do it manually. There we go. Uh, posed by Chuck Livingston. Livingston. I don't know. I saw Chuck who's on the members list. I don't know if he's in the audience. Hope he's not offended. Try to get the plaid shirt right. But there's something more specific that I want to focus on today in particular. And so what I probably should have called the talk is phonophmology and knotted satellite surfaces. Okay. And I find this interesting because I don't think that, you know, traditionally we thought of phonophonology as the most satellite-friendly thing, but obviously there have been. But obviously, there have been sort of increasingly exciting results in that direction. Okay. Okay, so just to start out with some topological motivation, we've known for a long time since Art and Provement 25 that there are knotted surfaces in the four sphere. For example, you could take just the regular old sphere sitting in R3 and then use the extra dimension to tie. The extra dimension to tie a trefoil knot, for example, into each sort of half of a great arc fiber. Those can be distinguished using very classical techniques. And it's also interesting to study the relative case surfaces in the four-ball with boundary in S3. So there's also lots of examples like this. Here's a particularly nice pair of surfaces bounded by the NOT 946. And these turn out to also be distinguished by. And these turn out to also be distinguished by classical tools, but they're also a nice test case for a lot of more powerful tools. Actually, with these disks in particular, I'm sort of reminded of this story that I think it was Tobias Echo used some powerful tools to show that, in fact, these disks are Lagrangian. You can make them Lagrangian than the syplectic four-ball and prove that they're not equivalent under any syplectic Hamiltonian isotopy. And I was at lunch one day and heard some topologists sniff. I was at lunch one day and heard some topologists snickering because they're like, yeah, but they're not even topologically the same. Pi 1 does it. And because Muhammad Abuzziah was like, well, yeah, sure, but I mean, even if they were topological isotopic, they still wouldn't be Lagrangian isotopic. And I love that line because it's somehow technically true for completely vacuous reasons, but it's also morally true for really deep reasons. And that's part of the way that. Reasons. And that's part of what I'm going to be trying to communicate here: is understanding, even in a case where you're sort of doing an overkill proof of something, what the deeper consequence is. Okay. So maybe some foreshadowing also. These disks can be distinguished by column homology. That was done by Isaac Sundberg and Jonas Swan. And so just a few questions as primers, nothing, you know, there'll be a lot of text on the screen, but to set the stage, what To set the stage, you know, what do knotted surfaces do for us? How can they help us as sort of probes of a four manifold? What types of tools can we use to study surfaces, knotted surfaces, and how can that help us better understand our tools? For example, something I mentioned in the previous page, one reason why studying non-closed services, slice disks, is interesting. For example, Sunken Kang just proved that you can use knotted disks bounded by certain slice knots. Certain slice knots to produce examples of contractible four-manifolds that are homeomorphic but don't become diffeomorphic after stabilizing with S2 times S2. And sort of the primary legwork going into that calculation involves understanding what's going on with these slice disks themselves. So there's sort of good flow between the two settings, surfaces versus the ambient four-manifolds. Along slides, how can they help us construct four manifolds? What about? What about the topological category versus the smooth category? How do they help us understand the difference there? Another important question concerning stabilization, either internally, which would be adding a trivial two, as illustrated here, or externally. So connect something with S2 times S2. And then the last thing I just want to put up here, sort of for priming, is where does 49 adding even come from? Where does 40 naughting even come from? I mean, like, in some sense, that's part of what we're really trying to do with topology is understand the emergence of the phenomenon, the existence of it. And so, we have lots of examples of four-dimensionally knotted things, but what actually makes something four-dimensionally knotted? Okay. Can you answer the same question crazy? It's a great question. In fact, you've read my mind. You kind of can. I mean, in some sense, I mean, in some sense, depending on what you mean, normal surface theory gives us really good understanding about how different surfaces arise in three dimensions. Oh, you mean knots in three dimensions? I see, I see. Okay. Yeah, interesting. I don't know. I would think that on a more naive level, yes, in 3D, we have a better understanding of this than 4D. But I do think, yeah, I mean, certainly there's strong analogy. But especially non-services in 3D will show up in a second. Not services in 3D will show up in a second, but not so much knots themselves. Okay, so in terms of just trying to get a sense of where 40 knotting comes from, oftentimes they come from symmetries. That was sort of evident in the previous slide. Oftentimes, in particular, knots which have some symmetry that does not extend over particular surfaces. Another sort of classical sort of source of constructions would be like we saw Art in modifying the sphere by changing some of these. The sphere by changing some of these interval fibers, surgering it to change its embedding. But I'm also particularly going to advocate today for thinking about satellite operations as a useful way to be modifying our services. Certainly not the first by any means. I just mean I'm trying to promote it in particular, especially in the context of Kibanophthomology. Okay, so these are the sort of the background things I want you to have in mind. And then a couple other points before we really dive in. Other points before we really dive in. Why do I think quantum maps are useful for surfaces in general? Well, for one thing, they're sort of what you see is what you get. When you want to calculate a coordinate map in quantum homology, if you have a picture of your surface, you can essentially just do it line by line. You take the movie and the movie directly converts into some elementary maps, water maps. So there's a certain visceral nature to it. This sort of This sort of folds right into the fact that it makes it possible oftentimes to do effective chain-level calculations, even if you have complicated objects. And this is something that we usually don't have. If I give you some kind of random surface, a random knot, some random surface of bounds, it's often difficult to calculate, let's say it's comports of maps on not floor homology. Whereas it might be computationally tough depending on how involved your objects are, but you can do it literally in common homology by hand. It literally in common opology by hand. And then another thing is that we know that it plays well with symmetries. I'm not going to get to talk about this too much today, but I do want to point out that some interesting work in progress of Brodzik, Dai, Malik, and Staffrigan extends, or not extends, but adapts part of their work in the equivariant not floor setting, which we heard a little bit about in Adam's talk. Actually, well, no, I guess that was actually Die Had and Malik, that was, but related to the Cavano setting. The Kivanov setting. Okay. And also as I'll talk about JSON satellite operations. And so throughout the talk, I'll mention some questions, but I just want to sort of, again, prime you with them. Everything I'm going to do today is using the sort of the most vanilla, most basic versions of I think it's an interesting question to ask whether using additional deformations or additional algebraic structure can give you more powerful and banana. Can give you more powerful invariants. And one of the things you're going to have to contend with, I think, in practice is making sure that you can actually work with cycles. This is part of the busting of the curse. You can do chain level calculations, but it's often hard to work with the boundary map. Okay, another question I'll ask is, can you find surfaces distinguished by quantum ofmology, but not floor gauge invariance? And then can the immersed curve invariance, particularly for quantophomology, help you? Particularly quantophomology, help you calculate chronic borders maps, and that's partially related to especially thinking about the symmetries. Okay, so all that said, let's go ahead and really dive in. What I want to do is pick a particular problem that's really a 3.5 dimensional problem and use it as our motivation. So we know that there are surfaces that are not in four space. What about not surfaces that are? What about surfaces that are knotted in three space? The answer is: yes, you can definitely have knotted surfaces in three space. Anyone who's done Rolfson might recognize the following surfaces down below. These are different in S3, but if you allow your surface to pass through the four-ball, then they do become smoothly isotopic. And in fact, this is going to be true for any closed surfaces in S3. So you might go back to the sort of relative setting and ask: well, is this also? Back to the sort of relative setting and ask: Well, is this also true if the surfaces aren't closed, if they're bounded by knots? And you're going to have to make sure the boundary stays in S3, otherwise, the question is not interesting. They'll just sort of trivially retract onto a ribbon. So, Livingston asks, if you have two separate surfaces of equal genus, the same boundary, do they become isotopic after their interiors are pushed into the four-ball? This might seem like kind of random question the way I've set it up, but there's a surprising amount of sort of context and evidence. Surprising amount of context and evidence for this. So, for one thing, lots of ciphered services exist that are not isotopic. But for almost any example you look at in the sort of well over a dozen papers that construct these types of things, you can pretty quickly tell that they become topologically isotopic, or fair, smoothly isotopic in the four-ball rel boundary. Okay, so there's just an examples issue. Here's a key pair of examples that motivated, I think, Livingston. That motivated, I think, Livingston's paper. One of the problems in the original Kirby list had to do with just distinguishing up to isotopical boundary in the four-ball, these surfaces, which are bounded by isotopic pretzel links. Pretzel knots, I guess. And so Livingston showed that indeed, even examples like this, which for us it's not really apparent, do become smooth isotopic in the four-ball. He also proved it for connected typhered surfaces. Connected separate surfaces with equal genus for an unlink. Okay. And it keeps going. Maybe you want to think about the, we said for topological versus a smooth category. There are algebraic conditions, particularly the simplest of which is the Alexander polynomial being trivial, that guarantee that any two cyber surfaces of equal genus will at least be topologically isotopic. This is proven by Conway Powell, 20. A bit of other sort of A bit of other, sort of more informal motivation for why this might be true. Not symmetries, which are really useful for producing different ciphered slice surfaces, don't seem in practice as useful for producing different ciphered surfaces. For example, it's known that any periodic knot has a minimal genus periodic ciphered surface. So you're not going to be able to sort of have the same situation where, for example, what's going on here is that I have a symmetry of the knot which cannot. Of the knot, which cannot be extended over a minimal genus slice surface, but does extend over a minimal genus ciphered surface, for example, here. And just sheer numbers, if you go through the tables, it's harder to produce candidates using symmetries. And getting to what I thought George was asking before, unlike in higher dimensions, there's literally one way to get infinitely many surfaces in three dimensions, at least in S3. And that comes from spinning along. And that comes from spinning along a torus, so Hakin Haakin summing along a torus. If you have an infinite family, you can reduce them to a finite number modified by this type of construction. And you can just see, if you twist up some sheets like this, if you don't care about moving the boundary, you can always unfurl that. Although rel boundary, perhaps it's interesting. Okay. So yeah. Did you say that every language in the file is a distributor original? No, I don't. I don't. Sorry. Oh, yes, absolutely. Thank you. So, yeah, so Andrew asked if I said that every minimal genus periodic surface, or sorry, surface type of surface for a periodic not is itself periodic. I don't, let's see. I don't know if I top my head whether that's true, but I think it was Edmunds proved at least the existence of. I mean, and it's at least error, it's like a minimal surfaces type argument. So perhaps it is that. Perhaps it is that all, but I'm not, but I'm not sure. It is all okay, great, yeah, yeah. Um, but it doesn't say anything about strongly invertible evolutions in particular, which is going to be sort of important. Okay, so we have these sort of limitations, and what you might, even if you're not sort of convinced that there's reason to believe that this would be true, it's at least getting at the point of basically you can reframe Livingston's question as asking, do you need four dimensions to make something four? Need four dimensions to make something four-dimensionally knotted? Or is three dimensions too tight to produce that type of interesting behavior? And I think that that sort of has reverberations for what types of, you know, how tight in general of a construction can you have and still produce something that's four-dimensionally either exotic or knotted. Oops, sorry, here's more of a close-up of that. Okay, and so the thing that I want to use to sort of guide a lot of the discussion today is. Is joint with Kim Miller, Park, and Sundberg. We showed that indeed there are separate surfaces that are knotted rel boundary. And the simplest examples in the paper, these aren't literally the first examples we wrote down, but they are sort of the cleanest to work with. And so we have this knot over here on the left. It is a minus six twisted whitehead double of the left-handed trefoil. And then on the far right, we have sort of the standard ciphered surface for that, which looks Standard ciphered surface for that, which looks like an annulus plus an extra band. And this sort of non-standard surface here, which is not actually a satellite surface at all. You look at the torus, the satellite torus for the satellite knot itself, it's going to intersect that orange surface. Okay. Okay, so initially we distinguished these using quantum homology, then sort of tweaked the examples and looked a bit closer. And in fact, they're not even topologically isotopic. In fact, they're not even topologically as a topic. That's not going to be the main focus we want to talk about today, but just in case anyone's curious, how do you see sort of the key point to showing that they're not even topologically as a topic is that this more standard surface has a hop band inside or hop annulus inside of it. A double branch cover, that's going to end up lifting to an embedded two-sphere of square minus two. Whereas you can just look at the cipher form, oops, the cipher form on this middle surface and rule out any square, any classes of. Rule out any square any classes of square minus two in the branch cover. Okay, so they're not even topologically equivalent. But the point is, even if they were topologically equivalent, they wouldn't be smoothly equivalent. And that's because the way of the way that Kamalopology distinguishes them. Okay. And so that's going to be more the direction I want to go in. And so today I'll focus. Oh, actually, sorry, maybe I forgot there's a bit more on where that nodding comes from. I just saw before. comes from as you saw before you can take the inner tube and you know cut it into two pieces of rubber bound by the same knot and here you can see that there's a symmetry of this this actually does correspond to a strongly verbal link where there are these cipher surfaces which are not themselves actually uh equivariant with respect to that they're equivariant with one involution but not the other okay um and then what we just do is slightly enlarge it and that helps Do is slightly enlarge it, and that helps produce something which is not even isotopic, sort of freely. That's going to help develop that square minus two sphere in the branch cover. So let's see. Yes, that's right. So the, oh, oh, sorry. Did I say that? Yeah, right. So yeah, so they're preserved by the, but I guess it's a free one. Yeah, my bad. Yeah. So preserved by the free one, not by the strongly invertible one. Yeah. Yeah. Great. And so we just enlarge these. You know, these are actually distinguished very directly by conophomology as well. You have to work a bit harder just to use branch covering arguments. This is sort of more immediate. Okay. So one of the main examples I want to look at, they're going to use satellite constructions. So here on the left, we have, again, a whitehead double of a trefoil, but now actually this is going to be a positive whitehead double of the right-handed trefoil. And what we have in the middle. And what we have in the middle is this thing which kind of looks like you took a link of sausages, but it's really just the standard site foot surface for the whitehead double. Plus, it's been stabilized. You've added a trivial tube. And on the right, we have what we would call the whitehead double of the cipher surface for the trefoil itself. And sort of sample theorem in this direction proved that if k is any strongly quality positive knot, including any positive torus knot like the trefoil. Any positive towards not like the trefoil, then its way head double is going to bound surface surfaces that are not smoothly equivalent but are actually topologically equivalent. Okay, so this gives a much bigger source of counterexamples. And we'll go beyond this in a second. But maybe just to dig in for another moment to the construction here. So there we have our not. Here we are, we said our standard cyber service has been stabilized. And I should, yeah, maybe one. And I should, yeah, maybe one thing that's going on here is we start with the annulus, attach a little twisted band to develop that clasp. It's going to be important later, and then stabilize it. Whereas on the right, what we do is we start with the standard ciphert surface for the trefoil, take a ciphert pushoff of it, so in the normal direction. And so now we have two surfaces that are linked together. And their boundary is just the zero frame two copy of the Copy of the trepoil. So there we can see the two different surfaces, and then we join them by a band as well. Okay, maybe one more bit of sort of topological foreshadowing. If you paid close attention, in both those situations, we added this band to both of them. And so the real difference in the construction, aside from stabilization, is actually before you even white hit double, if you just look at the cable. You even whitehead double. If you just look at the cable, you were looking at the annulus versus two cop versus the cypher surface pushed off itself. And that's really what actually mattered. Not so much that it was whitehead doubles, but that it was that underlying two copy. Okay, so you can actually generalize this significantly. So here are some examples of what I would call pattern surfaces. They start with some on the thicker end of it is some pattern on the left. We're just looking at some cable. In the middle, we're looking at a whitehead double tangle. The far right, like a maser tangle. And what's drawn here is a cobordism inside the solitaurus to the boundary of the solitaurus, where all three of these are just meeting a set of longitudes. And so if you have surfaces in the solitaurus like this, cobordism from some pattern knot to some collection of longitudes, you can always use that to create a satellite of any other surface by simply taking push-offs of your initial surface. Taking push-offs of your initial surface and then in the boundary tacking on these coportisms. So, this provides a way to produce satellites not just for knots but for surfaces. And where does common opology come in? There's a condition I'll call it a simple pattern surface, which is basically going to mean that there is, if I have the solitaurus, I can cut it open along some disk and split it into a cobordism to a collection. A cobortism to a collection of parallel longitudes, and that's going to have the same wrapping number as the original pattern. It's just a topological condition to make sure that things work out. You can define this really crude, simple invariant using tangle, common phromology for tangles, and that'll help control whether the pattern acts like the whitehead double did. So, in particular, if you fix a pattern P, and we want for the application, we're going to want its wrapping number to be higher than its winding number. Than its winding number. That's also true of the white head double, for example. It's algebraically, you know, no homologous in the solid torus. And that's going to guarantee us the existence of some ciphered surface that actually, at least part of it, lives in the solid torus. That's sort of what's the intuition there. And then fix your favorite strongly positive positive knot. Maybe it's the trefoil. Maybe it's P minus 237, which is top lock to be slice, which is nice. And so if you have this setup, then for If you have this setup, then for any such pattern, as long as it has this variant, which I'll call khx non-zero, then you can get the exact same type of statements we got before. If you apply it to a strongly quality positive knot, that knot will bound separate surfaces that have the same genus but are not isotopic. Okay. And moreover, if the resulting knot has alexander polynomial one, we said it'll be topologically isotopic. Okay. Okay. All right. So before I keep going, I just want to pause to see if there are any questions. Oh, sorry. Thanks. So that's the minimal geometric intersection number with some D2 inside of S1 times D2. Yeah. So these, you know, this is wrapping number three, wrapping number two, wrapping number two. Yeah. Okay. So what is quadratic model? What does quantum homology know about services in the four ball? Well, you know, just boilerplate stuff we need to say. We know that if we take some link in S3, we can get its quantum homology, some vibrated Z module. And key to the theory, but also especially to our applications, are that if you give a link cobordism, you're going to get a homomorphism between those commodities. And in particular, the grading shift on the homological grading is going to be zero. Homological grading is going to be zero, and on the quantum grading is going to shift based on the early characteristic of the surface. So, clearly, it contains some information about the surface. Many headline applications of modern phonology studying surfaces pass through Rasmussen's invariant, for example, proof of the common non-is not slice, reproofs of the local Tom conjecture and the, I guess, general Tom conjecture. And so the question is: what information can we extract directly from these homomorphisms? Okay. So it's known that these homomorphisms themselves are invariants, at least up to smooth isotopy rel boundary. And so the question becomes, can we actually use this to distinguish non-isotopic embeddings? And the answer is for closed surfaces, no. As people might already know, in this case, the map is determined. This case, the map is determined by basically whether or not you're a torus, but more effectively. And so maybe this inspires some pessimism, but it's worth sort of maybe taking a peek at what that calculation looks like, just as a reminder. So the standard torus, we can think about this. Mainly I can think over Z2 coefficients for convenience. So what is this homomorphism going to be? It's going to go from the empty set to the empty set, because those are the cohorts of the links. Those are the cobortism, the links at the end of the cobortism. And if we look over integers, it's going to go mapping one to two. Like we said, these maps are sort of what you see is what you get. You look at the topology of your surface and you need to cut it open every time the topology changes. And anytime you do a, really anytime the topology of the diagram changes, not just the link type. Okay. And there's a standard set of operations. A standard set of operations. Empty set will start with one. That one will get mapped to under a birth to a one labeled knotted circle, and so on and so forth. And we have these moves. One splits into a one plus x and a x plus one. Merge maps just multiply. One x goes to x, one x one goes to x. And then the death maps, you're going to map this each to one. Okay. So these are the flavor of the calculations if you want to do them on the chain level. Okay, just said that out loud. Okay. And so, getting back to some of the questions that mentioned at the beginning, you can do an analogous calculation to show that any stabilized surface induces a trivial map. So if I have sigma and I attach a trivial handle by connect something with the standard torus, then I can rewrite that as a composition from punctured torus. Punctured torus into the punctured surface, and analogous calculation will show that the second part will vanish over Z2. And so we've now sort of stumbled our way into half of the proof of the main theorem, which is by trivializing, by adding a trivial tube to that surface sigma zero, we killed its invariance over its homology map. Okay. Okay. Any questions before we keep going? Yeah. What is that? Yeah. So I didn't define it yet. It's going to basically be, we said you could sort of cut open one of these simple pattern surfaces and look at it as a tangle comboism from the pattern tangle to just sort of the trivial tangle. And it's going to have to do with whether and sort of how you hit the bottom graded element, which is just You hit the bottom-graded element, which is just the trivial tango with X labels. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, and that this is a goofy, crude way. You'll see why in a second. Really, there's got to be better ways, which is one of the things that sort of want to pose is how to sort of do this the correct way. But yeah, it'll be defined as just whether some map, some tangled pores of map is non-trivial into a certain subgroup. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. And sorry, the question was, in case you didn't figure it out, was what the KHX definition. Was what the KHX definition was. We'll see that in a moment. Okay, so now the question becomes: how do we distinguish sigma one? Well, we better hope that we can show that its maps are non-zero. Okay. So this begs the question more generally, when are these maps non-trivial and interesting? And there are a lot of conditions, you know, geometrically, especially turns out surfaces that arise from pieces of complex curves provide a really useful Provide a really useful set of examples, but that's not the case that we're working with. I will mention, though, that just to get right to the point, in practice, you can often do this just by inspection. If you have done a few examples, developed some intuition, and oftentimes you can write down cycles in the common opology, and it's important that they're cycles, which can directly distinguish the maps. I'm not going to say too much about the calculation yet, but here we have But here we have the underlying link diagram in the left, but not diagram on the left. We have some labeled smoothing, which has some element of its quantum opinion. You can check that it's going to always be a cycle for classes like this because all of the circles are X labeled. And if you look through all of the zero resolutions, changing them to one resolution always merges to X labels, and that'll end up producing a trivial differential. And this is baked into a lot of the calculations that we're doing. This is baked into a lot of the calculations that we're doing. Is working with classes like this because you don't need to worry too hard about making sure that they are cycles. So oftentimes you can find nice elements that are cycles, at least working with surfaces that are positive in some sense. I'll clarify that in a second. But just to get to the point, if you go through the cohortism that defines sigma one, it's a simple calculation to show that this element phi maps to one. And that's enough to say that. Okay, and that's enough to say that its map is non-zero. So, since the map for the other surface is zero, they're not smooth isotopic, at least. Well, at first you might say, well, rel boundary, because these invariants are isotopy invariants rel boundary. But what does isotopy that's not real boundary do? It acts on quantum ophthalmology by some isomorphism induced by the isotopy. And you can't compose by an isomorphism and change a trivial map to a non-trivial map. So really, these are just not isotopic. So, really, these are just not isotopic, not smooth isotopic at all. Okay, so I'm going to try to unpack what's actually going on in this proof and how we generalize it. We're going to pause to see if there's any questions first. Okay, so yeah. Yeah. So the question is: how do you actually even see this cobordism you're saying and then to do a calculation? Let me describe it in two ways. First, I'll describe it relative to this picture, and then I'll describe it more abstractly in a second. When we look at a cipher surface, like let's say we were to try to calculate the Euler characteristic of this or something like that, or think about Ceifert's algorithm, we would think about decomposing this into disks and bands. And what you're going to do is, for example, I could think about each one of these twists as a band. As a band, this is also a band. And so the cobordism is going to involve cutting each band. And there's an elementary move assigned to resolving a band like that. There's some coordinates assigned to that. And then after that, in this case, what you'll see is if you cut here, here, here, here, here, and here, maybe leave this one alone for a second. What you'll get is, actually, I should say, just cut here, here, here, and here. Just cut here, here, here, and here. Leave these alone too. You'll turn this into an unknot. And yeah, so you can, it's not hard to check. The point is, you're really, you're just severing all the bands except enough to turn it into a disk, but it'll be embedded because it's in S3, and then it has to be an unknown, basically. I mean, that's sort of a backwards motivation, but the point is, it's diagrammatic. And like I said, it's sort of like what you see is what you get. You literally draw the sequence of diagrams as cuts. But as cuts and Reitermeister moves. Yeah. Here, I guess depending on, I'd have to think about for a second about orientations. But what I can say sort of conflict with it, which is more to the point, is the visual connection here between the fact that these each look like copies of the disks, sort of the obvious disks in the disk band. For the obvious disks in the disk band decomposition service is not a coincidence. So, in practice, like when if I have to compute one of these maps, I write down the surface as disk union bands and cut along the bands. And then this is not true on the nose, but very often sort of the natural surfaces that you get, the natural resolutions that you get by sort of considering the underlying siphon smoothing circles are a good starting point, if not sufficient. Yeah. And these are not the minimums. And these are not minimal genus. They're not. They're not. And that perfectly sets me up for what I'm about to say. Exactly. So, that is what I think is surprising about this: these are not minimal genus, which we tend to think of as sort of being a form of tightness that helps having non-triviality of our invariants. So, what's going on here? Well, stepping back, what we did is we took some reasonably nice surface, trefoil ciphered surface, and applied a nice satellite operation, the whitehead doubling. So, more generally, what are we doing with more whitehead doubling? Generally, what are we doing with more white head doubling? We're starting with some surface, thickening it in normal direction, taking oppositely oriented copies at the ends, and then joining them by a twisted band. And this is not going to be in general genus minimizing. But we could ask, if the underlying service had a non-trivial map, does the white had doubled surface? And maybe I'll state it in a second, but more precisely, but you can think. Maybe I'll state it in a second more precisely, but you can think about this veering towards some classical questions about if a not has a property, does a white head double have that property? I'll make a finer point in a second. But as we just discussed, in general, these are not going to be genus minimizing. Basically, never if your original surface was not the unnot. Okay. So why is that not a problem here? Well, what's really going on, we'll see if I can demonstrate this example. Actually, maybe before I explain that. Don't share this example. Actually, maybe before I explain that, just what's going on in this picture, maybe you think the trefoil cyber surface is: we got lucky, they took like the simplest thing we could. Here's those surfaces that we saw from the very beginning, and one of those surfaces. And in this case, this class on the right, Isaac and I sort of separately within a couple of minutes, independently, looked at the surfaces on the left and surfaces, and the cycles on the right are sort of immediately what you get by looking at the, you know, you can think about it. You can think about sort of this coming from resolving sort of along the topology of the surface. And these classes, this class is non-zero under the quarter's map sign of the surface on the left. And literally, again, in the diagram, doubling that cycle, aside from where you have to put in a tiny little clasp, a tiny little difference for the clasp, yields an element that's in support of this much more complicated service than just. Much more complicated surface than just the way to double the shaft oil cycle surface. So, something here is going on, and the question is: what? Okay. So, I think the easiest way to explain it in this case is to think about braided surfaces. So, Palmervska showed that if you have what's called a positively braided surface, then it induces a non-trivial map on coanophomology. What's a positively braided surface? You could think about it as a stack of coherently oriented sheets joined by. Joined by bands, they're all positively twisted. Okay, so here we have three embedded bands, one sort of ribbon-immersed band. And whether you're looking at ciphered surfaces or ribbon-immersed surfaces, and then the corresponding slice surfaces, the statement holds. What does she do? Well, you look at the braid and look at the most natural class, the braid-like smoothing, and sort of assign an X label to each smoothing. To each smoothing. And the maps associated to the crossing, to the band resolutions, and then the writing master two moves that then simplify the knot all effectively act as the identity on this. And so you go, you had a cohorts into the trivial braid, this smoothing and labels, labels go to themselves, and then the deaths map these to one. So that's nice, but that's not. Oh, yeah. Yeah. If it was embedded, then yes, exactly. And if it's not embedded, it'd be defining sort of a quasi-positive rated surface. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The question of the question is: is this just the same as strong quasi-positive plus quasi-positive? And the answer is yes, you know, taking embedded versus ribbon immersed. And so sort of the intermediate statement that I want to sketch is that if you take a positively braided surface, then at least in this case, Positively braided surface, then at least in this case, the whitehead double always induces a non-trivial map. Okay, this is working towards what we really want to show. So, what's the idea here? You look at Palmevsky's class, look at a related one. And the point is that we don't worry about the fact that we no longer actually have a braid. And if I want to take the push-off, let's say, I look at a band, let us work locally, I have some band, and the cipher push-off is going to be always. The piper push-off is going to be always in the upwards direction because those disks in this braided surface were coherently oriented. So, every region on the far left turns into a region in the middle when we take the just the push-off. And then between the sheets, we have to add a clasp. And we can exactly take whatever our class was from Ponetsky's variant, for example, this is what you would have locally here, and then just naively double it. And then just naively double it. Just do the most obvious, sort of crude thing. And then the one thing is for this part, you know, we have to just introduce a little bubble corresponding to the clasp. And the point is that the maps, again, very trivially, behave just like they did in Palma Scott's original positively braided case. And it maps something non-zero. So, what really matters here, at least with chromatophomology, is that it does. At least with chromatophthomology, is that it doesn't care about the orientation of the sheets. And that's really key because, for example, the cipher genus does care about the orientation of the sheets. That's why these services weren't minimal genus. But the calculation with chromatomology doesn't care. Okay. So let's see, what's the next thing? Okay. So I'm going to try to squeeze a couple of things in. Is it okay if I go since I started five minutes late? I mean, that's my own fault. But okay. So any questions about the sketch? Any questions with the sketch before we try to sort of further generalize this and see what's going on? Okay. So, one thing I want to mention here, just going back to some of the questions I was asking at the beginning, a big part of the awkwardness here is that we're really restricting ourselves in order to work with surfaces and knots where we're going to have interesting cycles that, or sorry, interesting channel lengths where there's just no boundary maps in sight, which is sort of an artificial restriction that's not really essential here. And so, I think that. Essential here. And so I think that a better formalism to understand things where you don't have to work as literally with managing your boundary maps is a good direction to develop things in. Okay, this proof exactly generalizes to other types of pattern surfaces. So for example, this maser pattern surface on the right, there's an analogous calculation. And if we dig in a bit closer, what's actually working in these calculations? Bit closer, what's actually working in these calculations is that if we start with just thinking about the tangle cobortism just as a local piece of that bigger calculation, we have some cobortism from some interesting tangle to the trivial braid-like tangle. And what we want to do is hit just X labels on the trivial and the trivial, you know, and the only smoothing of the trivial tangle. And so this is the element that you could call maybe like theta bot for theta bottom for the lowest gradient element here. And to make sure that you And to make sure that you can patch in your pattern, sort of interesting piece of your pattern into the map for just the basic end copy of the surface. You want to make sure that you can have X labels at the end. Again, so this is the kind of thing, I mean, it's a sort of an artificial restriction, but it's sufficient for our purposes. So this KHX, you cut open your pattern surface, look at it as a tangled cobordism, and it's basically. And it's basically defining whether or not you hit this element. And in particular, you actually want to hit it from an element which has X labels on the ends or on the smoothings that hit the end. But in practice, you can often do this with other types of patterns. All right, so try to say a couple more specific things in a moment, but I just want to pause if there's any questions about the sort of the approximation to a sort of cut and paste calculation. To a sort of cut and paste calculation. Okay. So the key thing is that the orientations of the sheets don't really matter, which is pretty essential. Okay, so we don't always just want to have some service that has a non-zero map and one that does. In practice, we might have sort of equally interesting maps divided by our surfaces and still want to distinguish them. So, for example, going back to this not 946 and its slice disks, here are two. The slice disks. Here are two cycles corresponding to this surface and this surface that are in the support of each map, but they're in the kernel of each other's map. So we have these non-zero maps that are distinguished by these elements that are sort of adapted. And again, there's obviously sort of a clear topological connection between the topology of the smoothing and the topology of the surface. And what if you want to distinguish surfaces like this? I'm not stabilizing or something to kill the maps. Or something to kill the maps. Well, the point is, it turns out again that just literally whitehead doubling the cycles for services like this and doing sort of slightly more complicated things and other ad hoc examples that aren't as nice, again, still tends to show that if your maps started distinct, they remain distinct. And just a sort of a nice corollary of this is while these surfaces, as we said at the beginning, are not even topologically equivalent, if you whitehead double them, they do become equivalent. Whitehead double them, they do become topologically equivalent. And the reason is that what Kami and Powell really show is about slice disks with infinite cyclic polymer group of their complement. If you take any disk and white head double it, pyramid of the complement becomes infinite cyclic. So actually, any surfaces like this you can distinguish using phonophomology, or in fact from other tools, immediately yield lots of examples of exotic disks. And so that's the direction I want to go in in a moment, but maybe. I want to go in a moment, but maybe just for the last moment, let me skip over. There's a gallery of some other surfaces for which this works, some other knots. Let me jump to the to the comparisons with some other theories. So the first thing, let me start actually with the last slide with this. Okay, so what are the big differences between what we have in the common? Two of the big differences between what we have in the Kavanaugh setting and other settings are: a nice cut and paste tools coming from a bordered theory where we have a really fully developed theory in sort of the floor setting, but a sort of a newer developing theory in the Kvanov setting. And the other thing is that these in the floor theoretic setting, for example, we have tools that are more robust under stabilization. This is, I think, part of the reason why it'd be interesting to explore the other flavors of quantum opinion or other ways of extracting information to see if you can find. Aspects of the, or sort of invariants derived from the chain homotopy types of the maps, which are not immediately killed by stabilization. So just to state some results in some other settings, Gary Guth early this summer proved that one internal stabilization is not enough to make exotic surfaces into the four ball smoothly isotopic. And in fact, the perspective And in fact, the perspective of applying satellite operations is again, the way it works in the quantum setting works quite similarly in the floor setting. So, some forthcoming work. We show that if you have the, if you have slice disks D and D prime whose HFK hat maps are distinct, then in fact, their whitehead doubles are also distinct. So, this is sort of saying that the analog of the question I was raised. So, this is sort of saying that the analog of the question I was raising in the Kimano setting is: yes, if you can distinguish the SLIS disks using HFK hat, then you can distinguish the redhead doubles. This applies for lots of other nice satellite operations, for example, cables. If you have a P1 cable of a disk and it's sort of evil twin D prime, then those would also be distinguished. Sorry, if D and D prime are distinguished. But getting to the stabilization point, in fact, actually. But getting to the stabilization point, in fact, actually, not only are the cables distinct, but they remain distinct even after you stabilize. So we're seeing these satellite operations with just basic input about what the maps are for the base surfaces, you can prove a lot about satellites of these surfaces. Ideally, if we knew the H of K from reality theory over the integers, you could do far more. You could get infinite families of surfaces. For example, For example, one of the simplest examples would be by take the family of roll spun knots by bounded by 4, 1, 4, 1, figurate knot in itself. Those are distinct, and their whitehead doubles will become topologically isotopic. And so the question is, do the whitehead doubles remain distinct? And so while sort of the existing theory isn't there to say yes with novel hormology, just as a sort of proof of concept that this should work, you can prove it using cyberquitrism. Should work, you can prove it using cyber-Gwitten invariance, um, sort of indirectly. So, uh, so you know, whitehead doubling can give you infinitely many exotically knotted disks in the four-ball. I believe these are the first examples of infinitely many exotically knotted disks in the four-ball. Okay, so do I have anything here to say? Okay, the last thing I'll just say, then I'll shut up, is there are plenty of services that do have the exact same maps on phonology, but are distinguished by these other tools. Onkomophthomology, but are distinguished by these other tools, which sort of asks what do we need to develop further inkful homology to pick up on these more subtle things. So, joint with student Alan Dew, I proved that these maps, these surfaces induce the same map. Actually, this statement's old. These surfaces induce literally all of them the exact same map quantum homology. So, there's some infinite family of surfaces introduced by GOMF. Okay, so sorry for going over. I'll end. I'll end it there. Thank you guys. Let me just switch the mics over here. I was supposed to remind you of that.  An eye towards thinking about different theories. Like, what are the core algebraic aspects of the source of your arrow that you really need, as opposed to like just all X's? Okay, so I just make sure another sitting with the mic to make sure it was heard. Actually, I think the end of your question was definitely heard. Good to go. Okay, so I don't know that I could give, this is part of what I would like to ask everybody else here. I don't know that I can. I don't know that I can exactly say what the algebraic property is, but for example, in a lot of cases, what you're doing is you're really finding some, not always, some of those satellites don't involve some underlying sort of equivariant shenanigans. But a lot of the surfaces that we looked at, for example, all of these, really come from some symmetry of the knot that doesn't extend over any possible surface that it bounds. Here we're showing that. Any possible surface that it bounds. Here we're showing that it doesn't extend over a particular pair of surfaces. But the work that, be careful with the acronym, DAI, or sorry, yeah, B D M S. What they're doing is, I think, sort of mimicking the formalism that they did for equivariant not flow homology business, where now you're asking, instead, I mean, here you can interpret what. Here, you can interpret what is going on as saying that there's some symmetry of the quantum homology of this knot, and we can identify some elements which are not preserved under that, but are in the support of some disks. And so they sort of illuminate that those disks cannot be asymmetric. But at a sort of more, at a more formal or deeper algebraic level, my understanding is that what is in the BDMS. Is that what is in the BDMS framework? Is to instead think about sort of what possible maps can there be on localizations and think about this symmetry from a more algebraic perspective. And so there, you don't actually need to necessarily explicitly point to the chain elements, and you definitely don't need to point to the surfaces. So I think in a lot of these cases, what's going on in the underlying algebra is well reflected. Algebra is well reflected by the sort of stuff we've already seen with involutions and sort of understanding localizations for the interaction with the localization on the floor setting. Does that answer that at all? Maybe, maybe I'm just slow at understanding. So for this particular case, like what makes you were saying something about how they're not like with the involution in mind, these are not related by. mind these are not related by something what is it not related by uh so and what are these the cycles or the surfaces these cycles these cycles yeah so the the the symmetry of this um you know acts on the chain complex by taking this cycle to this cycle and uh the fact that these are trying to get the best way to phrase this kind of crude in a simple way but the the fact that these are um These are not homologous is telling you that their difference is that is a non-zero element that's not preserved by the involution. And I think that morally part of the idea is you want to show that somehow that element has to be a part of the support of any slice disk towards map. That's at least my intuitive understanding. Okay, so you need it to be a cycle and you need it to be non-equivariant, basically. Yes. Be non-equivariant, basically. Yes, yes, exactly. So, I could, in theory, like think of something that I somehow know is a cycle, which might be hard if it's not just X's. But if I had a different theory, I could take any root of the quadratic that you're modding out of in your Fourier algebra and just slap it on there. Yeah, and the choice to use X's was really just to find a cheap way to guarantee these cycles. But what you said is exactly the point. And I think the sort of the morally correct direction to go in, which is to get away from sort of. Which is to get away from sort of tinkering around with you know painstaking calculations at the chain level and figure out actually what's what really illuminates classes that are effective at distinguishing. Cool, thank you. Yeah, thank you actually, if I could mention one other thing about that question, and another advantage of the Kavanaugh setting, especially for some of these surfaces, is that I think literal chain elements that might do what you want to do in the floor setting oftentimes are sort of in like the thick part in terms of gray. Sort of in like the thick part in terms of gradings of the not technically sort of in the mean in the middle. Whereas oftentimes these classes, because the different nature of the gradings are actually out at the extreme ends, the sort of the supports of these maps. So there's just actually like less noise to cut through sometimes, which makes it easier to find explicit elements, even if it's not the ideal way to go. So, in this, like in the example that I asked you for, Like in the example that I asked before, the cipher surface you have, you are not getting it by a cipher algorithm, right? Yes, that's right. Yeah, it's not, it's not so it's it's like the element you're checking is sort of there's a state induced by that specific cipher surface? That's right. I mean, you could think one thing, I don't know if this is always true, but just at a rule of thumb level, that's the original trefoil cipher surface did come from Seifert's algorithm and has preferred smoothing coming from the Seifert circles. Coming from the Seifert circles. And we end up basically doubling those when you want to get the preferred smoothing for the whitehead double of that underlying surface. So even though even though the whitehead double itself doesn't come from cypher's algorithm, it's a whitehead double of something, you know, some simpler cyclet surface, and its class is a sort of a whitehead double of that simpler surfaces sort of cycred smoothing. That makes sense. That makes sense. Like that's sort of what's going on in this picture. If the cipherte circles for the trefoil would be just, you know, delete one of the concentric circles each time. Okay, but I mean, you find this state from the sigma one, right? Yes, I know. I mean, especially in light of the proof, you're really finding it from the surface that sigma one is a quite a double of. Ah, I see. Okay, you use sigma one to. Okay, you use sigma-one to find cobordism maps. That's yeah, you can think of it that way, yeah. Okay, okay, but the state is still the sort of like the ciphered state where the uh the homological grading is zero and then yes, that's that that's true. Really what it is is, you know, if we're looking at the white hat double of K, we go back to K, look at the cipher smoothing, and then white that double that thing, even though that won't be sort of corresponding to a cipher. Uh, a cipher smoothing of the go ahead double itself, okay? Thank you. Okay, so I think what we should do is you should thank Kyle again. Zoom picture. People on Zoom should please turn on their videos so we can quickly take a photo, which let's get.
