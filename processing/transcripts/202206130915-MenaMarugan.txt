Sure, to participate in this conference, and the only pity is that I cannot be there in person. So, well, let me also say that most of the content of my talk, of my presentation, in fact, are very well-known facts in quantum theory and good space-times. But somehow I feel that this has been in Feel that there has been an increasing interest in recent years about the topics that I'm going to comment, in particular in questions related to the choice, for instance, of a vacuum state in cosmology, because it's a crucial point in order to extract predictions. And also, for instance, concerning the notion of unitarity in quantum information in systems. In systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. And this is why I thought that it could be nice to review some of these ideas and not show to refresh them in order to have a broad perspective in this new context. The other thing is that most of the material that I'm going to present has been done in collaboration with Ferronimo Cortet from UNAM. Cortez from UNAM in Mexico, and with this Josev Eli√±o from Universidad de Beir Interior in Portugal. Okay, so we all know that quantum field theory in curved space-times is affected by a serious ambiguity, even for the case of linear fields that do not interact, and even for the simple case of biological algebra and focus representations of them. Representations of them in the sense that, in fact, there exists infinite and infinite number of possible representations which are non-equivalent among them. And this means that the physics that we obtain with this representation is different, it's non-equivalent. There is no unitary formation relating the physics obtained with different representations. Okay, so in cases. Okay, so in cases in which the the background the perfect space-time so in our analysis is highly symmetric or in cases such as in which the space-time is stationary we can use these symmetries and arrive to at least a unique class of representations that are unitary equivalent and in this sense at least we know that the the the physics is not The physics is not affected in the sense that we will obtain completely different predictions. But in the case of no estation background, this is not generally the case. In recent years, there has been, because of that, increasing work trying to find criteria to select to pick out at least one class of unitary folk representatives. One class of unitary FOC representations in this kind of scenarios. In particular, the criterion that I have proposed with my collaborators is to use whatever symmetry we have in the system, usually special symmetries, and complement it with a requirement of unitary implementability of, let's say, the Heisenberg dynamics, the evolution of the annulation and creation of. Evolution of the annulation and creation of operators of our representation. Indeed, we have seen or we have proved that this criterion succeeds in selecting a unique class of representations in isotropic cosmology, in several anisotropic ones, and for a variety of fields, scalar fields, bile and dirac fermionic fields, and also cosmological perturbations. Cosmological perturbations of scalar, tensor, and fermionic type. And in simple cases, as the one that I'm going to describe in detail in the presentation, it also selects, let's say, a privileged parametrization of the canonical pair of configuration and momentum for the field that is quantized. Okay, so I'm going to consider probably a most simple case. Consider probably a most simple case, which is a scalar field in a cosmological space-time of three-man limit Rorensau-Walker type. And at the end of my talk, I will comment on the generalization of the ideas and results for more general non-stationary matter. So, I will consider a minimum and minimum, sorry, minimum coupled stellar field. Minimally coupled scalar field. The cosmological space-time will have flat sections of constant time and will, in principle, study compact sections. The non-compact case can be, let's say, attained at the very end of the calculation by taking a suitable non-continuous limit. The metric can be written in a conformally flat Flat form by adopting conformal time, and the conformal factor is simply the square of the scale factor of our space time. And the scalar field satisfies a plane-order equation in which the mass of the field M appears. And this scalar field I will call it phi. It is also known that we can rescale the field going to another field description, chi, just by. Distribution chi just by multiplying by the scale factor. And the field equation for this new field chi, in a certain sense, is simpler. It's a kind of generalized wave equation in which we have the spatial Laplacian and we have a background dependent square mass appearing. At the bottom of the transparency, you can see the expression in the case that I am describing, but for instance, for cosmological. But for instance, for cosmological perturbations, you will obtain other expressions of this background-dependent mass. And the only difference is the background functions that appear and the particular form that they take in the formula that gives you this background dependence. Okay, so how can we obtain the quantization of this field in this? This field in this, let's say, cosmological kind of space tense? Well, I mean, from a completely asterisk point of view, we can start just with the covariant phase space. This means that we start with the space of solution and do it with our simple structure. And we know that the only thing that we have to do, the only ingredient that we know for the FOC representation is to introduce a complex structure. Structure. I recall that this is a real linear transformation that lives invariant. Our simple structure is a simple to morphism and that has a square that is equal to minus the identity. And I will focus only on a subclass of complex structures that are called compatible in the sense that when they are combined with this simpleton structure, when they act in all When they act in only one of the entries of the simpleton structure, then they supply a positive bilinear form from which one can obtain an inner product. And with it, one can construct the one particle Tilbert space for the theory. And with tensor products of this Tilbert space, one finally obtains the Fog space for the representation. Okay. Okay, well, this is the description in terms of the covariant phase space. It can be equally done with the canonical phase space that is formed by pairs of Cochi data for the field. Let's say the value of the field and the value of its momentum at a given section of Constantine, in A for G section in G. Well, this canonical phase space can be viewed according to this observation just as a set of pairs of functions on our three manifold and endowed again with the canonical syntactic structure. And it's also clear from my comments that it's straightforward to construct an isomorphism between the covariant and the Between the covariant and the canonical phase spaces for each value of the conformal time. Essentially, given a solution, what we do is to evaluate it and the momentum associated to it at a given value of the conformal. In the transparency, you see this both for the original field phi and for the scale one chi. The main difference is the expression of the Difference is the expression of the corresponding momentum due to the rescaling that we have. So we see that we have, in fact, an isomorphism for each value of the conformal thing. This means for each spatial section of our species. And in this way, given a complex structure in covariant phase space, what we obtain is a one parameter family of complex structures in the canonical. Structures in the canonical phase space. Okay. And it's also evident that there is a consistency relation between the members of this family. They are related by the mapping and a transformation E that is simply the combination of the inverse isomorphism at one of the considered times, theta one, this composed with the isomorphism at the second conformal time eta. At the second conformal diameter. Okay. And with this transformation, we can relate all the members. Okay. So it's also obvious that we can decide just to fix a reference time, let's say eta nod, once and for all, and in this sense, identify the covariant phase space just, let's say, with one copy of the canonical phase space. This canonical phase space of thing at the time. Obtain at the time eta naught. Then the family of complex structure in canonical phase space that I was considering are simply related to that one at eta naught by the transformation mean between the time sita naught and a general conformal time eta. And at that moment, we can consider all these complex structures as different structures in this, let's say, single copy, in this unique view of the canonical. View of the canonical phases. This is like considering all these complex structures at the same instant. And the mapping E at these moments adopts the interpretation of an evolution in this canonical phase space, relating the different complex structure that we are considering. Well, the first thing is that this evolution, this dynamics, will be unitary implementation. Will be unitary implementable if and only if all these complex structures determine representations of representations that are unitary equivalent. And we know that from a mathematical point of view, this equivalent to say that the difference between the complex structure has to be a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on the one particle Hilbert. So this is essentially the condition. So this is essentially the condition that tells us that all these complex structures are equivalent, at least for the same family of options. Well, one could think that this interpretation of the evolution of the dynamics is somewhat artificial in as much as it just depends on our view of on our description. On our description in canonical phase space. But in fact, it's not so. We obtain an equivalent family of complex structures in covariant phase space just by transforming them or mapping them with our fixed isomorphism at the given time eta node. And again, the members of that family and covariant phase space will be related by a mapping that can be interpreted as an That can be interpreted as an evolution, and that in a certain sense is totally equivalent to the one described in the canonical formulation. Okay. So, consider quantum field. Given the form that the field equation had, the best possibility that we have at hand is just to span the field in eigen modes, so the special applaution. This is what I have done. This is what I have done. This and the other things that I have already included, the scaling by the skill factor, and then the rest of the expression in this expansion of the field is just a linear combination of the solutions for the modes of the disc field chi. Okay, they must be solution to the second-order differential equation in time that is. In time, that is the one that appears in the window of the transparency, and in which we have the wave norm square corresponding to our Fourier mode, and the other frame is the square of the background-dependent mass that I already described in some series before. Then, if we choose these solutions as complex ones satisfying the air normalization condition that comes from the claim. Condition that comes from the claim-Gordon product appears here. The coefficients in the linear combination can be directly interpreted as annulation and creation variables, and the quantization of this field is simply promoting those coefficients to operators. Okay, so let me just, although it's trivial, let me just comment that we see that different choices of annihilation and creation. Choices of annihilation and creation of operators or variables, and therefore different POC representations will be obtained with the choice of different solutions for our equations, field equations. And in turn, these solutions will depend on which kind of initial conditions we select for the dynamical equations of our models. So, in this sense, it's clear that different choices. It's clear that different choices of initial conditions correspond to different representations in our system. Okay. Obviously, in all the considerations that I have done here, the only caveat is that I am respecting the symmetries of the system in as much as that the modes that were decoupled by the field equations have not been mixed by my linear accommodations or and And changes of solution and respect in that symmetry in more microscopic. So, how can we select a complex structure, a family of complex structures that are unitary equivalent in order to obtain the desired representation of our scalar? Well, the thing I will do in the following is just to comment on the physical model. Comment on the physical motivation to do that selection, how we can complicate the situation more and more, but they still find arguments in order to motivate a specific issue. So we start with the most simple possible background, the Sminkowski space-time, and it's also A highly symmetric choice, if not a group of symmetries, there is the concrete group, and requiring that our choice of complex structure is such that this structure is invariant and the natural action of the symmetric group, in fact, suffices to obtain a unique answer. In this way, we can kick out a unique complex structure. But since time-reparameter. But since time reparametrizations are part of this monk group, it happens that the dynamics is immediately incorporated and is unitarily implemented in a natural. The other thing is that the choice of initial conditions that correspond to this invariant compared structure is the one that appears there. Essentially, what it's telling us is that the Telling us is that the derivative with respect to a conformal time is equal to the product by minus i the constant frequency of our mode and the result factors in our initial conditions come from the normalization of the zone. Okay, so we see that in post-case what we are doing at the end of the day is using the symmetries of the spacetime to select a unit. Select a unit once. Suppose that we are in a situation with less symmetry, but at least they have enough symmetry as to have a distinguished one parameter group of simpletic transformations. This is the case, for instance, when we have a stationary space-time, because the dynamical transformations depend in one parameter, that is the difference between the final and the initial. Then, there is a result that tells us. Result that tells us that there is again a uniquely complex structure that is invariant under the action of this group of performation and such that the generator of the group is a positive operator. And given this positivity, we can interpret that generator as a Hamiltonian in a standard. Okay, so at least if we have a stationary space-time, we have a First time we have a standard process. But when we are in non-stationary backgrounds, then essentially what happens is that generically we don't have a family of one parameter symptomorphism and we do not know, we don't know how to proceed in those. Okay. So the idea in this case, or in these cases, is to replace. These cases is to replace the requirement of invariance at the dynamical evolution by the next weaker possibility, which is to have at least a unitarily implementable dynamics indices. Okay, so consider again an example in which the space-time is not stationary, but at least we have two regions in the spacetime. Regions in the space-time that are isomorphic to Minkowski. One region in the past, I will call it the IMP region, with the standard terminology, ports smaller than eta one, and another one in the future, the out region, portains larger than eta. Then in each of these regions, we can select initial conditions as in Minkowski. As in Minkowski, okay, and obtain in that way complex structures. One in the outreach, another one in the in-region. The two complex structures are different because the scale factor is not the same in the one region, sorry, in the in-region and the outreach. In both regions is constant, but it has a different value, and therefore, the frequencies associated to our remotes are. Associated to our remotes are different in these two regions and the corresponding compressor structure is different. Okay, so we have two natural choices of compression structure and then the question is whether they are equivalent. If they are not equivalent, we will be in a problem because in a certain sense, both of them are natural, but the physics they lead to is not equivalent. Well, happily in this case, Happily, in this case, the two complex structures in covariant phase space are indeed equivalent, and so we have, let's say, acceptable procedure. In fact, this is the reason why we can define a scattering S matrix, comparing natural solutions from the in radio with solutions in the out. Well, and what happens with the And what happens with the complex structures induced in canonical phase space from these choices in covariant phase space? So we can consider in the in region the isomorphism provided by a conformal time in that region and from the complex structure covariant phase space with initial conditions in the region obtain a complex structure for the canonical description. And we can do And we can do something totally similar, but in the outreach. And then the question is: what is the relation between these two different complex structures in canonical phase space when we consider them at the same instant of time, in a unique copy, let's say, of the canonical phase? Well, remarkably, what happens is that these two complex structures are not equal. Okay, and to understand what is the obstruction that leads to this non-equivalence, let me consider the risk L field F. In this case, we repeat the procedure. We choose initial conditions in the in and out region, and we obtain two complex structures in the covariant description. And again, they are equivalent, okay? And again, we can define. And again, we can define anguish matrix in the system. Another difference is that if we induce complex structure in canonical phase space with times in the in region and in the out-region, respectively, the two complex structures that we obtain in this way, now they are equivalent when they are compared at the same instance. It's not so surprising at the end of the day because part of the timing dependence. Part of the timing dependence in our system has been absorbed by the rescaling by this. On the other hand, the fact that the two complex structures in the canonical phase space are equivalent and the same happen for the covariant ones can be used to show in the short argument that appears in the transparency here to show that what happens is that the What happens is that the dynamics is unitary implementable in the description of the scale file type. Okay, so this evolution admits a unitary implementation in our form. Okay, so also in this case and with this rescaling, we have been able to obtain a family of representations in which for members are unitary equivalent. members that unit are equivalent and that has a good physical model. In the general case, what will happen is that we will not even have regions that are isomorphic to Minkowski space time, but the scale factor will be arbitrary. Then we can try to mimic the process and define complex structures by choosing any possible value of the conformal time. Value of the conformal time, okay? And we will obtain in this way a different complex stressor in covariant phases. Even so, one might hope that the result will be still handable and lead to acceptable result if the variation of the scale factor were really small, a slow variation. This typical expectation of these ophysis that by installing is really, really small, things that will have almost no. That will have almost no consequence. But in this case, the expectation is wrong. It doesn't matter how small is the variation, the complex structures in covariant phase space are not. So we have a problem because there's no way of getting by this manner a family of well-defined complex structures as soon as we have a specimen. As we have a space-time in which the scale factor is. Okay. The problem even affects standard interpretation in terms of particle. Consider two of these complex structures in covariant phase space for different values of the conformal time and the set of annihilation and creation operators associated with them. They will be related by a vocal U of transformation with coefficients alpha. With coefficients alpha and beta, alpha for the linear part and beta for the antilinear one. And we know that the two complex structures that we are considering are equivalent if and only if the beta coefficients have a square norm that are summable over all the modes of the okay. Since we know that they are not equivalent, then this sum must be very. Then this sum must be there. On the other hand, physically, this result tells us that there exists an infinite content of particles when we analyze the vacuum of one of our representations, interpreted in terms of the vacuum of the other. Okay, so essentially, this vacuum cannot leave. This vacuum cannot live in the same focus space, and their associated concept of particles are not compatible. And since this happens for every single change in the value of the conformal time, obviously there is no sense in trying to give a definite particle interpretation analysis. Rather than that, the emphasis was put in this situation on the definition. On the definition of a family of unitary equivalent complex structures that at least lead to a reasonable or sensible for representation of the system. Well, this is in fact what Marquette did when he proposed the use of adiabatic states, essentially and historically, given a value of the conformal time, one can One can obtain solutions for the field by solving an equation for the positive frequency of these solutions that can be solved by an iterative procedure. And at each step of this iteration, we obtain an adiabatic approximation that is improved. So we speak about adiabatic states of order R. Stage of order R when we are in the R step of this iteration. Okay, well, there are well-known facts about the vogue of transformation between adiabatic states of different order. For instance, it's known that the beta coefficients asymptotically have the order of one over the wave norm one exponent 2r plus 2 when r is the Two when R is the lowest of the arithmetic order of the two representations that we are going. On the other hand, the number of modes in the system grow with the wave norm square, for lack of wave norm. And from the two results, it's straightforward to see that the square norms of the beta coefficient, in fact, converge once we sum. Converge when we sample. So, this means essentially that the adiabatic representations of any order are equivalent. And a similar result exists also for the consideration of adiabatic states at different values of the order. Okay, so in this way, one obtains what one obtains. There is a family of complex structures that are unitary. And what happens? And what happens with this other criterion of a unitary dynamics? Let me comment on it and the relation with the adiabatic proposal that I have just presented. So we can use the rescale field description and introduce initial conditions, essentially mimicking the processing. The process in post-pure spacetime using the instantaneous frequency for our mode, okay, for the modes of the field I. In fact, remarkably, what happens is that the complex structures obtain at different values of the conformal time. Now they are equivalent among them. Okay? And this difference to what I said before for the field for the construction with the field. So. So the good news is that in this way we obtain a family of complex structures that are motivated with physical arguments and that in this family we don't have dangerous ambiguity because they are all unitarian. In fact, the issue is not that we are fantasy or We are quantizing or representing the scale field instead of the original one. What we have obtained is a representation of the original field. I mean, you have a quantization, a representation for the scale field pi, the only thing that you have to do is to divide by the scale factor and you will have the quantum field for the original scalar field phi. The same thing can be seen just by considering the initial conditions. We have the initial conditions for the modes. have the initial conditions for the modes of the scale field and taking into account that the scale factor also changes in time when we take the time derivative this has to be taken into account then we obtain initial conditions for the regional field phi that in fact lead to the representation that we are considering so it's not okay that we are quantizing a different field that is not physical the quantization of the representation that Quantization of the representation that we obtain is valid. The major difference has to do with this evolution, this dynamic, when described in terms of one of the fields to the other. Indeed, the time evolution of the field chi turns out to be unitarian. And this is quite. So we can do exactly the same thing. So we can do exactly the same thing as before, starting with the complex structure in covariant phase space, obtaining two different values of the conformal time, and using the isomorphism to canonical phase space corresponding to these two times, we obtain two complex structures in canonical phase space. We consider them as being defined at the same instant of time, and it happens, can be shown that they are in fact equal. That they are in fact. And using this result, again, with the simple argument, one can prove that what is happening is that the evolution admits the unitary implementation is unitary implementable in our system. Okay? So this, I mean, in this sense, the criterion of unitary dynamics leads to what we Dynamics leads to what we wanted: that is a family of complex structures that are unitary equivalent among them and that allow to obtain or to reach a quantum representation of our original scalar field. It can also be proved that if one considers a general rescaling of the field, the only possibility that leads to a dynamics which is to a dynamics which is unitary implemental is precisely the scaling that we have described okay so what is the relation with adiabatic states it can be proved that the representation that we have described is equivalent to any of the adiabatic representations. And this like a standard formulas quantum field theory, we know the value of transformation between the annihilation and region variable for each of the two representations, ours, and a diabetic one of order r. Then there's a formula related to the vacuum, and the only thing is that this normalization factor in front of it has to be finite. In fact, it's a simple exercise. And in fact, it's a simple exercise to prove that this is the case with our representation. So the good news is that our criterion leads to a hope representation that is equivalent to any of the adiabatic representations. Okay, so let me skip this fancy because essentially it's the information I have given. Let me go to just today discussion, which is going to be just brief, a couple of comments. Let's brief a couple of comments. Well, the first thing is that in this example, we have shown that using a criterion of unitarity of the dynamics together with the spatial symmetry result, the system will have succeeded in selecting a unique class of complex structures and representation. And in fact, they lead to a representation that is equivalent to that. Okay, so let me comment. Okay, so let me comment on another notion, generalized notion of immunity that has been used recently, and in particular in the context of country information, it has found certain applications. In this case, what one has is like a different canonical phase space for each value of the conformal time. In each of these canonical phase spaces, one defines a complex structure and then A complex structure, and then the evolution E is said to be unitary. Unitary if the difference between the complex structure at the initial time evolves with this dynamics, the difference between this evolution and the complex structure that we have at the final time is convergent. If this difference is convergent, then it said that the evolution is unitary in our system. In our system. Okay, my comment in this sense is that in a certain or to a certain extent, this notion serializes the evolution. This can be seen just by considering any choice of complex structure in covariant phase space. We obtain a family of complex structure in canonical phase space, and the relation between them is such that the difference that it was completed is equal to zero. So, therefore, in particular. Equal to zero. So therefore, in particular, it's equivalent to smear because it's zero. But notice that then our notion says that there is unitarity and we have not restricted by any means the choice of covariant complex structure. But furthermore, we have not restricted by any means the evolution that we are considering. This valid for any evolution. Okay. So in certain sense, this notion of unitary that we think they think. Of unitary, the only thing that is saying is that there is compatibility because the Coxypron is well posed at any value of the component. Okay, and this is my last transparency concerning generalization. So for a general case, what can we do? Okay, so what we have proved is that we can consider canonical transformation connecting an elation aggregation variable. An elation aggregation variable, choices of them, such that the canonical transformation now may depend on the mode and may depend as before on the background. We allow for a general background dependence and we allow a mode dependence that is compatible with the spatial symmetry signals. So the fact that there is a background dependence obviously changed the dynamics of the annihilation and creation. Of the annihilation and creation variable in this case, depending on what is the canonical transformation that we have in terms of. And the question is who find a canonical transformation such that the associative dynamics is unitary implemented? Well, this criterion is sufficient to choose a unique family of complex structure of representation that are unitarily equivalent. Unitarily equivalent. And we can go even one step further because we still have freedom in this choice of canonical transformation and demand that the Hamiltonian diagnosis associated dynamic is such that it becomes diagonal in the limit or in the region or large wave number. Then this asymptotic diagonalization combined Symptotic diagonalization combined with the requirement of minimum absorption of the dynamical phases of the annihilation creation variables, in the sense that this dynamical phase is not absorbed in our canonical information, turns out to lead not just to a unique family of equivalent complex structures, but in fact to a unique complex structure and therefore to a unique structure. To a unique choice of vacuum for the system, at least in this asymptotic region of actual number. And in many interesting cases that we have studied, in fact, some kind of continuity criteria are sufficient to be able to obtain a unique choice for all possible things. So I will conclude just with transparency with two references. One, the first one, it's essentially about. The first one is essentially about the content of my presentation, and the other one is for the generalization that I have commented on. Thank you very much. Thank you, Guillermo. Any questions? Yes, Alejandro. Hello, Guillermo. This is Alejandro Corrici. Hello. Nice talking to you. So just a clarification in the when you were commenting on this generalized notion of unitarity equivalence. Yeah, that one. This is the one by Ivan and Avai, right? Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's nothing wrong. I mean, there's nothing wrong about it. The only thing is what I said. It's not restrictive. It's not restricting choices of dynamics or choices of stressor on covering phase experience. Yeah, it depends on what extent you want to have a stronger notion of unitary. Sure. So this basically says that anything goes, right? Anything is unitarily equivalent and there's no. And there's no I mean, if you see this cognition here, this difference is exactly equal to zero for any dynamics and for any choice of complex rational covariance. That's the point. Okay. Thank you. More questions? More questions? Hello, I am Ognia Moreshko from the University Libertarius. So I have a couple of questions, and maybe they're a little naive as I don't work on this subject. And the first one is kind of more specific, the second a little more general. The specific question I have is: now you spoke about these different inequivalent representations of the vowel algebra. And I was wondering whether it is known. It is known, I mean, whether there is a certain physical interpretation of these different representations in the sense that what is the variable that labels them? Could it be interpreted physically, like some sort of charge? I mean, in general, what happens is that predictions in the ultraviolet sector will differ, okay, for this representation. It's true that in many physical cases, you can say that this very You can say that this very, very asymptotic ultravaux regime will not be reachable for observations, okay? And that for the kind of observation that you are going to do is not dangerous. But as I said, the problem is that it's not that you can label it in general because you may have choices of representations that are not always. Representations that are not always labeled just by one quantity. In some cases, yes, but generically, it's not so. But the important point is what I am saying: the predictions concerning the ultraviolet behavior will not be the same. And there will be no dictionary to relate the predications. It's not like when you have a unit creator of making so is it in principle a viable option to consider? In principle, a viable option to consider at least abstractly these parameters as some kind of dynamical or physical variable and embed the space even into a larger space where one could regard even what might appear as non-unitary transitions as part of a larger unitary transformation. Or is this somehow discouraged based on certain physical considerations? I don't know whether I understand your questions exactly. I mean, for you. Exactly. I mean, for instance, in the generalization I have said, you can consider as a general transformation. And typically, you can describe this transformation by certain, more than labels of parameter by certain functions. And then, obviously, the dynamics and the predictions depends just on those factors. In this sense, it's true that you can enlarge your description. Can enlarge your distribution. And then, if you introduce physical requirements, what you are doing is again reducing the possibilities and concentrating those that have the good physical properties that you want. I don't know whether this is exactly the answer to what you asked. I guess in part, and my more general question was whether in this community it is considered reasonable to even imagine. Reasonable to even imagine that the dynamics may not be unitary. Yeah, yes. But my point is the following: okay, generically, you can find a dynamic such that it admits unitary implementation. So you don't have to abandon unit rating. It's true that it depends on. True, that it depends on what is the dynamical evolution that you want to consider. For instance, in my description, the original field phi do not have this unitary dynamics, but with the rescaling dual. The same thing applies to what I have said with canonical transformations that are background dependent. Essentially, you extract the part of the evolution that is dangerous for the dynamics. Dynamics, sorry, for the unitarity, and the other part now is compatible with unit. And then you can use your requirements of a unitary implementation in order to obtain a family of essentially data. So in a certain sense, this devolution will affect the norm and the phase of your, let's say, annihilation location variables. In the norm, there may be. Variables. In the norm, there may be a dangerous part that is not compatible with unitarity. Then, if you can assert it in a background dependence, go ahead. Because you will get everything, unitarity, the family of representation that you want it, and a quantization of your original fields without any problem. Thank you. One last question by Benito. One last question by Benito. Benito, go ahead. Thank you. Thank you very much for the talk. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, I guess maybe you partially answered my question already, but let me ask it anyway. So how general is this beyond cosmology? So you've been discussing in the context of cosmology, but then you give this quite general criteria. So I'm wondering. So, I'm wondering if actually cosmology is just a toy model where you understood this, but this is actually much more general than cosmology. Yeah, go ahead. Yes, yeah, yes, you are completely right. It's exactly what you have said. I mean, because also my field of specialization, the parallels we found them in cosmology, but it's just one of the possibilities and the discussion. possibilities and the discussion is general and the discussion is applicable to stationary space-time. It's a way to solve these questions of well this to give a meaningful notion of unitarity and solve the problem of a family of representation. It's general. And we have different cases that have to do for instance with one smart problem. Okay. Okay. And in general in general one has good And in general, one has good expectations in space-times with compact spatial sections that one can work in a fixed representation and this will work all the time and so on. And you don't have problems of unitarily in equivalent representations. I mean, have you tried to look at these compact spatial section spacetimes from this approach, for example? And I mean, even in I mean, even in compact cases, okay, you have the problems with the unitary evolution. Let's say that, I mean, you may have problems in the ultraviolet sector or in the infrared. The ultraviolet problems, you find them already with compact sections. The problem with the infrared behavior, this is solved in the compact cases. That's why I said what we usually do, at least in compact. Usually do, at least in topology, is start with the compact case that finding the family of representations that has a good ultraviolet behavior and then reach the non-compact case by a suitable continuous limit in the modes. But essentially, this is what I am saying is that two different kinds of problems of divergences of non-unitality, the ultraviolet and the impact. And compactness has to do with. And compactness has to do with the internet, yeah. And so, one, maybe, final, if I may, very quickly: have you tried to study all these problems, for example, concerning the ultraviolet, correct ultraviolet behavior of endpoint functions, so related to the Hadamard property, and so on. So, you're working in free field theory, so this is a desirable property. Do you have this in this approach? I mean, yes, at least let's say that. That collaborators of mine and other people have already considered relations with Cadamar. Thank you very much. Welcome. Okay, thank you, Guillermo, for the nice talk. We can continue now with the talk by Carol Sikovsky. Carol, you're on. Hello. Yes, thanks for your invitation. I would try to share my screen now. Share my screen now. Please confirm, can you see it? It looks fine. Yes, great. So it takes slightly bigger than what we can see. Now, is it better?
