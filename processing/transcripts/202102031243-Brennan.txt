To be here. This is my first math conference that I've actually attended. So yeah, as with Andy, it sort of took me a while to come to the conclusion of what I should even talk about. So I guess I wanted to start my talk with a first apology to the organizers because I'm actually not going to talk about what I wrote my abstract about, although it is very intimately related. And the second thing I wanted to say is that. The second thing I wanted to say is that, as my title says, I'm going to be talking about the connections between monopoles and fermions. And this is going to be based on work in progress with Jeff Harvey. But so it is work in progress. And so it doesn't have as many, maybe as many conclusions as you would like, but I'm hoping to emphasize a lot of open questions along the way. Okay. So the goal. So, the goal of the talk will be really to discuss features of monopole fermion interactions. And in particular, we're going to focus on non-supersymmetric field theories. And so, of course, I would say that is inherently an interesting problem to study interactions between perturbative and non-perturbative degrees of freedom in a quantum field theory. As Andy wrote, we can sort of do this moduli space approximation. This moduli space approximation, but that is not sort of the most general story. For non-supersymmetric theories, you do have this sort of moduli space dynamics of monopoles, but when you have low energy degrees of freedom that, like for example, massless fermions, they can still propagate in the bulk and they have some very complicated interaction with these degrees of freedom. So that's one reason why this. One reason why this is an interesting thing to study. But more recently, the interactions between monopoles and fermions has been realized to be related to understanding anomalies involving what are called higher form global symmetries. This was sort of explained in a paper by Wang, Wen, and Witten and will be further elaborated on in an upcoming paper by myself with Clay Cordova. By myself with Clay Cordova and Thomas Dumitruscu, in which we show that computing these sorts of anomalies requires computing the global charges of monopoles. That has to do with the charges that are imparted by fermion zero modes that are bound to monopoles. But in general, this procedure requires the monopoles to be coupled to the scalar field that comes with the monopole solution. And what that does is it gives the Fermi. And what that does is it gives the fermions a mass and creates normalizable bound states so that we can identify the global charges of these monopoles. But in general, it is unknown how to figure out that there's this anomaly when there's no coupling to the scalar. And this is sort of an open problem and just fundamental understanding of what these anomalies mean. Because anomalies are supposed to be invariant under sort of small deformations of your coupling. Small deformations of your coupling constants in your theory. And so, in particular, there should be some reflection of these dynamics or this anomaly, really, even when there is no coupling. And so, that is sort of actually sort of my entry into this problem. So, what we're going to be interested in is studying the low energy limit of monopole-fermion interactions. And so, in general, we're going to have a scalar field that breaks. Have a scalar field that breaks our microscopic gauge symmetry, which is called G to a subgroup GÏ†. And so, right, so the non-trivial profile of phi, as I said, sort of breaks the microscopic gauge symmetry, except in the area that is directly surrounding the monopole, which is the core. There, there's usually some sort of preserved non-abelian gauge symmetry. gauge symmetry. But right, so but what we can do is perform this what's called the normalization group flow that Andy was discussing earlier, where we sort of restrict ourselves to only low energy degrees of freedom. So there our theory is a G sub phi gauge theory and our smooth monopole is then sort of represented by a defect or a singular monopole. Monopole. And so, what we're going to be interested in is the coupling between massless fermions and these sorts of monopoles. So, in general, if we're going to study these sort of singular defect monopoles in G5 gauge theory in the sort of low energy limit, we don't really need a reference to the microscopic gauge theory. We sort of only can say is that I am a low energy person and all I have access to are All I have access to are ways of studying low-energy processes. And so that means that we can sort of study this without reference to the microscopic gauge symmetry. And so what we're dealing with is purely defect modifes. And that's where we impose, and to construct these, what we have to do is to impose boundary conditions on the fields at the insertion point. So the whole thing. So the whole, I guess, the crux of what we're going to be studying is the interaction of fermions with these types of monopoles. So generally, the fermions are shielded from the short-range non-abelian physics in the core of the monopole due to the magnetic field. And that's because the magnetic field actually couples to the spin of the fermions and introduces an energy gap, except for the sort of spherically symmetric solutions. And what that means is that we actually need to impose Is that we actually need to impose additional boundary conditions for fermions that sort of deal with these spherically symmetric solutions that sort of can probe into the core of this sort of non-abelian physics inside of the monopole. Good. So there are sort of two questions that we would hope to answer along these lines. The first is sort of what are the The first is sort of what are the allowed defect monopoles in a gauge theory when we have massless fermions. And the second is what are the sort of defect monopoles that even arise from smooth monopoles in non-agelian gauge theories? It is not clear that one set is contained inside the other. Can I ask a question? Yes, please. Does this shielding mean that maybe in some way the monopoles are behaving as fermions? Are behaving as fermions? Well, it is true that there are a class of monopoles which have dionic excitations that are, well, you can have, sorry, you can have monopoles that are fermionic, but that's sort of not the fundamental reason why the fermions are shielded. It really does come down to the fact that the magnetic The magnetic field, there's sort of the spin magnetic field coupling, and that sort of gives extra energy to everything that has spin. Okay. Contribute angular momentum. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Are there any other questions? Actually, first of all, please feel free to interrupt me. I'm a physicist, so I'm trying very hard to stay away from jargon as much as I can. Very hard to stay away from jargon as much as I can, but if you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt at any time. Okay, so I wanted to address these two questions. So, right, so as I was saying, we're dealing, we want to know what sort of defect monopoles are allowed in these sort of theories. And what that really means is that we want to know. Oh, sorry. You keep using the word. You keep using the word defect monopole. What do you mean by defect there? Ah, good. So here I actually mean a singular, I guess what's usually called a singular monopole. And so what we're really going to be doing is we're just going to be picking a point in space, and then we're going to excise an infinitesimal two-sphere around it. And we're just going to impose boundary conditions on all of the fields there. So usually what we do is we say, I will pick a point. We say I will pick a point, cut out the two-sphere, and then the gauge field approaches the Dirac monopole field there. So this is what I mean when I say defect monopole. Okay, good. And so, right, when I say what are the allowed defect monopoles or singular monopoles, what I'm really asking is what are the sort of Asking is what are the sort of possible boundary conditions that you can impose on the fermions? That is, what are the sort of monopoles you can define and their fermion interactions? And as I was saying, this is because a class of fermion zero energy solutions can sort of tunnel into what is in the UV, the non-abelian core, and sort of see what's inside of the monopole. And additionally, there's another reason why we need sort of, well, there's another reason why these boundary conditions are non-trivial. And essentially, it comes down to the fact that the magnetic field, while introducing a gap, also polarizes the fermions. And so what I mean by that is that if a fermion has a positive charge pairing with the magnetic charge, then you'll find that there are only ingoing wave solutions. Whereas if it has negative charge pairing, Whereas, if it has negative charge pairing with the magnetic charge, then it will actually only have outgoing solutions. And so, you'll find that you have to impose boundary conditions because if you send stuff, if you send energy in, then it has to come back out. And what we see is that we will see is that there's really an interesting interplay with what sort of global symmetries can be preserved by these boundary conditions. Right, and so sort of the sort of basic question you would Of the sort of basic question you would want to ask after asking the first question and realizing it's very difficult is to ask what sort of monopoles are given to you by non-abelian gauge theories. Right, so as we discussed, you sort of have, you start with some smooth monopole configuration and in some G0 gauge theory, and then you say that it's broken to some G subgroup here. G subgroup here by the scalar field having some non-trivial asymptotic value. And the point is that since you are picking the microscopic dynamics, it specifies the boundary, these microscopic dynamics will sort of specify the boundary conditions in the low energy gauge theory. And this happens by performing this renormalization group flow. Forming this renormalization group flow that Andy talked about, where we're really integrating out these non-abelian degrees of freedom that are sort of stuck on the monopole. And in sort of older literature, this procedure leads to what's called the Kalin-Rubikov effect. Okay, so good. So this is sort of where I was thinking it would go with the talk. Don't worry, the monofole review is going. Don't worry, the monopole review is quick. It's mostly just to make sure that we're on the same page with notation and stuff like that. But I wanted to stop really quickly to see if there are any questions. Okay, cool. Good. So our setting is just going to be four-dimensional G-gauge theory on R3 times time. So really, we were just thinking about So, really, we're just thinking about monopoles in three spatial dimensions, which on which is R3. So, we're going to introduce our connection A here, and we're going to couple to a real adjoint scalar field. And we're going to use sort of standard notation that math frac G is the Lie algebra of the Lie group G. And so we're just going to sort of take the most vanilla action, which is given here. And what we're going to do is we're going to restrict to the sector of the theory that has a fixed asymptotic value of the scalar field, denoted by phi infinity. And so phi infinity determines, well, it lies in some Cartan subalgebra, which is just the Lie algebra for a maximal torus in G. And what happens is that when we restrict to this sector of the theory, it's Sector of the theory, it's actually going to break the gauge symmetry G down to a subgroup G, which is the stabilizer group of the asymptotic value of the Higgs field. Right, so as we know, monopoles are solutions to the Bogomolny equation, which is given here, and it has the solutions have the asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity, which is the Higgs field has a sort of fixed. The Higgs field has a sort of fixed component here, which, as we said, breaks the gauge symmetry. And then we have the magnetic field, which arises in the scalar field at order one over R and linear order in the field strength F. And this gamma M lies in the co-character lattice of some of the Lie algebra and defines magnetic charge. Good. Good. So as Benoit brought up earlier, I wanted to differentiate between the two types of monopoles that we're talking about today. The first, the smooth monopoles, which are the solutions to the Bogomoni equation that are smooth. They describe field configurations with sort of localized lumps of energy and are particle-like that source magnetic field. And so, in the core of the monopole, we often, as we said, have gauge enhancement. And so, what Enhancement. And so, what happens is that for each direction that is sort of broken, part of the broken part of the gauge group, the gauge field gets a mass away from the monopole, the core of the monopole, excuse me. And so what happens then is that there are non-abelian charge degrees of freedom that are then confined to the monopole. So generally, the monopole, the Higgs field profile looks something like this. Profile looks something like this. So, this is R and this is our Higgs profile. It looks kind of like this. So, what that means is that you have all your gauge degree, non-abelian gauge degrees of freedom are stuck here. And what they are is they essentially give you localized scalar fields that are charged under the gauge group. And this is sort of, well, we'll talk about this later, but this is essentially the origin of the phase degree of freedom associated to a monopole. Degree of freedom associated to a monopole. If it's really just the charged non-abelian degrees of freedom that are stuck there, good. So then we also have these defect monopoles or singular monopoles. And so these are solutions that source magnetic field that are not smooth. And as I said earlier, they're defined by excising an infinitesimal two-sphere around a point and then imposing boundary conditions on the gauge field and the scalar field there. And these are And these are really important because this is essentially the effective description of smooth monopoles at long range in the sort of low energy gauge theory. And so this is where we'll be living primarily. Is that the low energy where we are mostly dealing with defect or singular monopoles? Good, and so you can sort of see that one turns into the other by looking explicitly at the Prasad-Sommerfeld solution for an SU2 monopole. For an SU2 monopole. So here the gauge connection looks like this. You have sort of a Dirac component, which is along H, which is the sort of generator of the Carton. And then you have these two components here, which are the non-abelian sort of off-diagonal components in the gauge field. And so since the profile here, alpha of R, goes like R hyperbolic cosecant, that means Cosecant, that means that these fields really die off exponentially fast away from the monopole core. And that's because of the non-trivial profile here for the Higgs field, or the scalar field, which goes like hyperbolic cotangent time minus 1 over r. So as I was drawing earlier, it sort of looks like this function, and that sort of confines these off-diagonal degrees of freedom, which have Of freedom, which have charged relative to their carton subgroup to the core of the monopole. So this is sort of one way you can explicitly see that in the low energy where you can only probe distances that are much larger than the core of the monopole. These energies, how the smooth monopole effectively becomes a singular monopole. Monopole. Good. So that's all I have to say about for view, I guess. So now we want to move on to what happens when you couple fermions to the monopole. So let's take the low energy theory of our previous example and just take U1 gauge theory in four dimensions. And let's couple the theory to two vials. The theory to two vile fermions with opposite charge plus and minus one. So the sort of standard action that we consider is given here. We just have, you know, the kinetic term for the gauge field. We have our, now it's a free scalar field. And then we have charged fermions here. And what we want now is to consider the fermions interacting with the Dirac monopole. Excuse me. That the smooth SU2 monopole flows to. So as we said, it's singular at r equals zero, and so we have to really just impose boundary conditions on the gauge field there. But generally, there are non-zero solutions to the Dirac equation, as there are here. So we're just going to consider the Dirac equation here. And we find that there are fermion zero modes that go like 1 over r. That goes like one over r times some times some scalar, or sorry, not scalar, some spinner that is polarized with respect to the radial direction. So these fermion zero modes live at the bottom of a spectrum of scattering states. So psi plus or minus has has a solution of, has a has states that Has states that essentially are the fermion zero mode times an ingoing or outgoing phase that is correlated with the electric charge of the fermion. So in particular, psi plus has, it goes like e to the ik t plus r, which is an ingoing wave, and psi minus has only outgoing waves. So, what you can do is you can compute the fermion density of these solutions, and you find that it is finite, especially in the limit r goes to zero. And so, what that means is that the fermion wave function has non-zero overlap with the boundary. And so, what that means then is we have to impose boundary conditions for these fields at r equals zero. And another way to see that we really do need these boundary conditions is the Boundary conditions is the following. So, what you can do is you can imagine sending in a spherical wave of psi plus at some fixed momentum k. So, if you just send it in and you don't have any boundary conditions, it just hits the singular monopole and just gets stuck. It can't go anywhere. And so, these sort of have broken your theory. You no longer conserve energy, momentum, or gauge charge. So, sort of So, sort of the best you can do is to relate that to the outgoing fermions, which are the psi minus. And so, now you can preserve momentum and energy, but you have sort of done that at the, you cannot really preserve gauge charge. But we'll see that actually secretly it is preserved. But we will get to that in a moment. Daniel, can you pause for a second and just okay, so. Okay, so you've I think in earlier slides you were showing that these fermions are are in the kernel rack operator, right? Yes, that's right. So why what does it mean for them to be ingoing and outgoing into the monopole? And also you've said things like, oh, this is coming and it's stuck on the monopole or language like this, but the monopole is the thing. The monopole is the thing, we're doing the Drac opera in the background of this. I don't understand the relationship, the dynamic relationship you picture between the fermions and the monopoles. Okay, good. So by ingoing, I mean that if you fix a phase of the solution, so psi plus or minus k, you see that, for example, psi plus of k goes like goes like 1 over r times e to the ik of t plus r. So if you pick a phase for this function, you see that it moves inwards because it is a constant phase at t plus r equals a constant. So that means that as you evolve time, r goes like minus t plus whatever your offset constant is. So this is what I mean by either So, this is what I mean by either ingoing or outgoing. Sorry, just to clarify, these are not square integrable solutions. That's correct. These are purely plane-wave solutions. And right, that is sort of the key feature of what we're doing, or what we want to look at here. You mean spherical wave solutions? Yes, sorry, yes. Good. Spherical solutions, yes. Right, and so what I meant by saying Right, and so what I meant by saying that if you send in a wave, you get sort of stuck at the at the monopole, what I mean is you can actually take a superposition of these waves so that you send in sort of like a wave packet that goes inwards. And since there's no outgoing solution, it'll just hit the monopole and then you don't know what happens. You sort of have broken your theory. So, really, the only thing you're allowed to do is to say, well, I have some cyplus. Well, I have some psi plus that goes in, and that by some boundary condition is related to a pulse of psi minus that's coming out. So, but just a question, we you solved the Dirac equation for the Dirac monopole as a pink round. Okay, that's why everything is that's why the waves are spherical and they get spectral. Spherical and they get stuck there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so the point is essentially, if you want to think about it, so we have just like sort of an energy scale and say this is equal zero. What you have is you have a collection, I guess maybe a stratification of the energy levels. So you have sort of the zero energy, you have say the you have some energy cap here. You have some energy gap here. Call this energy, I don't know, E naught. And so essentially, there's this energy gap E naught to sort of the next angular momentum mode. And what we're doing is we're looking at all of the scattering solutions that you can build off of this low zero energy state. And so the monopole energy is like way, way up here. Way, way up here. So, this is the monopole energy. And so, what we're doing is we're just going to say, well, let's introduce a cutoff for our theory that is sort of somewhere down here. This is E cutoff. And so, since our energy is so low compared to the monopole and sort of all of these higher angular momentum modes, what we can really do is sort of treat Can really do is sort of treat our theory as only the fermions of spherical symmetry interacting with a defect monopole. All of these sort of incoming waves are too low to sort of move the monopole. So this is sort of the physical picture of what we're looking at. Thank you. Oh yeah, no problem. Okay. Good. So as I was saying, any sort of Any sort of monifold defect must come with some sort of specification of boundary conditions whenever you have massless fermions, essentially because of all the problems we just brought up. And so the question we want to ask is, what are sort of these allowed defects and what are their allowed boundary conditions for these fermions, these low energy fermions? But this is sort of a very expansive question. This is sort of a very expansive question, and it's probably something that's very too ambitious to answer, at least, in the time we have. But in general, the answer, the general answer, is not known. And sort of one reason for this is that fermion boundary conditions are actually tricky to deal with, but it makes them very interesting at the same time. So, to demonstrate that, let's just consider a simple example of 2D fermions. So, let's just take fermions in two dimensions, and we'll take a pair of them. Dimensions, and we'll take a pair of them. Take a left-handed and a right-handed fermion. So they have an action that is generally given by this, and the equations of motion, or the Dirac equation, now is of this form here. So you see that psi left is holomorphic and psi right is anti-holomorphic, which means that psi left is left-moving and psi right is right-moving. So good. So the conjugate momentum to The conjugate momentum to psi left, right, psi, left, and right is the complex conjugate, this psi, left, right dagger. And that means that they satisfy these anti-commutation relations here. So they, in particular, they do not anti-commute. And so what that means, well, so now what we can consider is this theory on a half space. So what we need now is to put a boundary condition on the fermions. Boundary condition on the fermions at the boundary of our space. But these, the fact that these feel that psi left does not anti-commute with its complex conjugate and psi right does not anti-commute with its complex conjugate means that you can't just set psi left or psi right to zero. You don't have sort of the normal Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions you do for a scalar field. And it's essentially the same reason I was saying earlier. It's essentially the same reason I was saying earlier. Psi left is only left moving, and say maybe out of a boundary, and psi right is only right moving, say into a boundary. So the picture we have here is so we have sort of a boundary here, and we want to say you have some sort of psi, oh, I guess I flipped this. Well, say you have some psi right that moves this way, and then you have some psi left that moves out of the boundary. If you send a wave of psi right, The boundary, if you send a wave of psi right into the boundary, you have to have it bounce off, otherwise, you don't have conservation of energy. So you have to relate psi left to psi right. And it turns out there's sort of only this simple system is so simple that there are only two allowed boundary conditions. There's the one where you say psi left is equal to psi right up to a phase, and then there's the one where you set psi left equal to psi right conjugate up to a phase. And these two A phase. And these two boundary conditions differ by what sort of global symmetry it preserves. So the first one, this boundary, preserves a vector symmetry where you rotate the phase of psi left and psi right simultaneously. Whereas the second boundary condition preserves an axial symmetry where you simultaneously rotate psi left and psi right in opposite directions. And the fact that there is no boundary condition that preserves both is indicative of the fact that Preserves both is indicative of the fact that the quantum theory has a mixed anomaly between axial and vector symmetry. So in general, when you have an anomaly, that tells you that you cannot have a boundary condition that preserves it. But when you have a mixed anomaly, that says that you cannot preserve the two symmetries simultaneously. So this is kind of interesting. And what's great is about it. And what's great about it is that you can actually use it to give a partial classification of what are the sort of allowed boundary conditions on a monopole. So if we restrict to the case of monopoles, singular monopoles, in an abelian gauge theory, and only take fermions that have charges plus or minus one and zero. Then what we can do is we can take the low energy limit, which effectively just reduces us to these spherically symmetric fermions on the Symmetric fermions on the two-sphere. And as we were saying, it's because the magnetic field introduces a gap to all of the other, the higher angular momentum modes. And so what happens is you now effectively have a two-dimensional, you have two-dimensional fermions on the half-space, where the boundary is essentially the spatial direction of the two-dimensional theory is the radial direction of the spherically symmetric fermions. And this system was studied by, I guess, somewhat recently by Smith and Tong. So, sort of the most general system you can consider of this type is when you have n left-handed fermions, call them psi I, and n right-handed fermions, psi tilde i. So, these left- and right-handed fermions come from the UV fermions. So, the left-handed fermions are The left-handed fermions are the fermions with charge pairing with the magnetic charge, which is greater than zero, and the right-handed fermions come from the fermions with negative charge pairing. And that's essentially just because the positively charged fermions are the ones that are only ingoing, and the negatively charged ones are the ones that are only outgoing. And so there's this natural identification of left-handed and right-handed fermions. Left-handed and right-handed fermions in two dimensions with the charge of the fermion in the four dimensions. So, we're just going to consider the very basic free fermion model. And from these fermions, you can construct currents, which is literally just the flow, measures the flow of these fermions. Good. And so now what we want to do is consider the n global symmetries. Global symmetries that these fermions can transform under. So we'll denote their charges by Qi A and Q bar IA, which are both integer invertible matrices. And so the currents corresponding to these symmetries are going to be related to the fermion currents linearly by the Q and Q bar matrices. By the Q and Q bar matrices. So the boundary conditions for these two-dimensional fermions are classified by what symmetries are preserved by the boundary conditions. And so we say that the symmetry U1, which has an index A, is preserved if the boundary value of the sum of these two currents is zero. So that's to say if the incoming current is equal plus the outgoing current sort of cancel each other out. out because then there's no charge leaving the system. And similarly we can simultaneously preserve U1 sub A and U1 sub B if these two combinations of currents commute at the boundary. And so this condition turns out to be related to some condition on these Q and Q bar matrices, which in the full quantum theory Quantum theory simply means that there is no mixed anomaly between U1A and U1B. But this description has a sort of labeling redundancy, so what you want to do is you want to define a matrix that removes this by defining this curly R matrix, which is just by taking the product of Q bar inverse with Q. Then the condition that the symmetries are preserved. That the symmetries are preserved is simply this. It's given in terms of the fermion currents, the psi i and psi, psi j and psi bar, sorry, j sub j and j bar sub i. And so now we can see very clearly that this does in fact classify boundary conditions because this interpretation of the boundary literally means that if you Literally means that if you send in a psi tilde i current fermion, which is measured by this j bar sub i, it shoots out a combination of fermions, these psi sub j's, related by this rational matrix R. But it's a bit strange because r is rational, so the occupation numbers are all fractional, and there's sort of no particle interpretation. No particle interpretation. But I want to comment on that in just a bit. I want to talk about some of the interesting math related to this. So we can use this matrix that defines the boundary condition to define a lattice, sort of the intersection lattice of Zn with the image of Zn under the action of this matrix R. And the properties of this lattice have a bunch of interesting physical Physical, they encode a lot of the interesting physics of the system. So, the first is that the volume of the primitive cell of the lattice encodes what is called the boundary central charge, which is effectively just a measure of the sort of the degrees of freedom, number of degrees of freedom that live on the monopole. You can also say, for a sort of more general theory, if we were to consider general theory if we were to consider two-dimensional fermions on an interval with boundary conditions r and r prime so r we have r prime and this is our theory here then the the geometry of the lattice actually classifies the number of ground states that exist in this system and it's given by this sort of semi-complicated formula but again you can see it's just determined by the the volumes of The volumes of the primitive cells of these lattices and up to some overall pre-factor, which is just defined by the matrix R. But what else is interesting about this lattice, which lambda of R, is that I can actually signal non-abelian symmetry enhancement. Essentially, whenever you have lattice vectors of length squared 2, you actually have. 2, you actually have a non-abelian symmetry enhancement. And this comes from the fact that when you have n vile fermions in two dimensions, it really has an SO2n symmetry. And so there's sort of this whole zoo of boundary conditions you can have where you have different preserved non-abelian symmetries. But what else is interesting is that you can actually have monopoles that preserve only discrete symmetries. So we can generally have a lattice with, you know, this lambda. lattice with, you know, if this lambda r has discrete symmetries, but no lattice vectors with length squared two, then there is some sort of discrete symmetry at play without having sort of a continuous non-abelian symmetry. And I believe these sort of lattices have been studied before many times. I guess one source I know is from my advisor and collaborator together, Harvey and Moore. Together, Harvey and more, but I'm sure there's many more instances of this in the math literature. Right, but, anyways, what we can do is we can use this analysis to study the scattering off of a minimal monopole, which is called the Kalin-Rubikov effect. So, what we can do is we can consider an SU4 gauge theory with three types of fermions. There's fermions, the 4, 4-bar, and the 6 representations, which we write as psi, psi, tilde, and chi. Psi, psi tilde, and chi. And this theory has an additional U1 global symmetry that is technically anomalous, but it has no mixed anomalies with the gauge symmetry. And this is sort of like a toy model for grand unified theories of the standard model. And the sort of analogy of the chiral symmetry is the baryon minus lepton number, for those who are, I guess, know about this sort of thing. But so what we can do is But so what we can do is we can consider the scattering off of the minimal monopole, or we can consider the minimal monopole with this magnetic charge that flows to the, I guess, to U1 cubed gauge theory in the IR by this asymptotic value of the Higgs field. So here what we find is that there are four four-dimensional zeros. For four-dimensional zero modes with positive charge pairing with the magnetic field, and then there are four with negative charge pairing. And when we reduce to the two-dimensional effective theory of spherical waves, you find that there are four left-handed and four right-handed fermions. So we then demand that any sensible boundary condition for a monopole preserve the three U1 factors of the gauge, you know, gauge factors. Gauge, you know, gauge factors. But then we have another U1 symmetry that can be preserved by boundary conditions. So it's perhaps natural to choose that this global, you have this U1 sub C global symmetry. We want to choose that to be preserved rather by the monopole. And what you can do is you can literally compute, or just I guess write out, what these charge matrices are, these Q and Q bar, and you can compute this R matrix. You can compute this R matrix. Now, in general, this is not the most general boundary condition you can write, but is a particular one. And it is, in fact, the boundary condition that is given to you by the microscopic physics of the SU4 gauge theory. And so the way you can see this is by, well, we'll go through it really quickly. So this is first worked out by Callan and Rubikov, and then I think more clearly. And then I think more clearly explained by Polchinski. But so what's going on is that our Higgs field has some non-trivial profile due to the fact that there's a magnetic monopole. And so what it's doing is it's actually confining the off-diagonal components of the gauge field to the monopole, which gives a sort of localized periodic scalar field. And this periodic scalar field is what's often called the dion degree of freedom. Degree of freedom. And in particular, it's charged under the low energy, one of the low energy U1 gauge factors that couples to the monopole. So, good. So, the UV physics tells us that the boundary conditions come from integrating out the interaction of this non-abelian dion degree of freedom with the fermions. So, if you literally write out the interaction from the UV theory, you find that there is You find that there is this type of interaction between the two-dimensional effect of two-dimensional fermions and this dion, this scalar dion field that's charged, that's localized at the boundary, which I here set at x equals to zero. And so when you integrate out, well, this interaction effectively tells you that the boundary condition is the following. It relates the sort of left incoming fermion to an outgoing right-handed fermion. To an outgoing right-handed fermion with an interaction with the dion. And so that means that if you send in some left-handed fermion, psi i, it shoots out with its sort of conjugate psi tilde i, and it comes with an excitation of the dion degree of freedom. The dion degree of freedom, though, is very heavy because it is part of the monopole field, and so it immediately radiates all of its energy and electric charge back out into all. Charge back out into all of the outgoing fermion degrees of freedom that it couples to. But it couples to all of them equally. So that means that you just have radiation coming out in the psi tilde fields, so that the total flux of current, electric current, is integral. It's in fact equal to one. But since you have multiple fields, what that means is that it's radiating fractionally into all of the different modes. And so this boundary. And so this boundary condition is now referred to as the Malde-Sana-Ludwig boundary condition, and is exactly the, is described by the R matrix that we just simply computed earlier. And as I was saying some time ago now, the fractional flux does not have a true particle interpretation. And people like to say the words that it's propagating pulses of the vacuum polarization. But I think probably the best way to think about it. Probably the best way to think about it is that when you ask to measure these fermion currents Ji and J bari, you are actually trying to measure currents that are not conserved. Really these Ji is sort of it's associated to a symmetry where you rotate just one of the fermions and in general that is just a horribly non-conserved quantity because essentially all the interactions with the gauge field so. With the gauge field. So, really, the only things that you can measure reliably are the conserved of the currents corresponding to the U1 global symmetries that are preserved by your boundary condition. So I guess I'm almost out of time, but maybe I'll just sort of talk about sort of where, I guess, what sort of questions I'm thinking about now and sort of where we are in terms of progress. Sort of where we are in terms of progress. So, really, all I've talked about are how fermions interact with sort of minimal monopoles in abelian gauge theory, which is not super, I mean, it's interesting, but it's not the most interesting case, obviously. There are a much, much larger class of monopoles, such as when you have non-abelian gauge symmetry that's preserved in the in the inf in the low energy, or you know, when you have monopoles of higher charge. You know, when you have monopoles of higher charge. And so there's sort of two cases. But first, I mean, first, the restrictions we're taking are to restrict to spherically symmetric higher charge monopoles. And we'll just take SUN gauge theory because as a physicist, it's my favorite type of gauge group. So we say it's rotationally invariant, you know, if the gauge field and all of the charge fields are rotationally invariant up to a gauge transformation. So you can actually explicitly So you can actually explicitly write out the gauge field in this way, where A and now the scalar field phi are vectors and scalars under a linear combination of the generators of the spatial rotation group and some SU2 subalgebra of the gauge group. Good. And so now what you can do is you can actually write out the sort of the general form of a rotationally symmetric model. Form of a rotationally symmetric monopole is of this form, where yeah, you sort of have a Dirac monopole part, and then you have some off-diagonal components. It's essentially the same thing as the SU2 monopole case, but much more complicated. So there's sort of two classes of monopoles that we know how to think about. The first is sort of non-minimal embeddings of the SU2 monopole into SUN. And this is literally the And this is literally, these are just given by a Lie algebra homomorphism where we embed the SU2 monopole into our SUN monopole just by a simple non-trivial embedding. So for SUN, these are just given by the representations that are not necessarily irreducible of dimension n. Do we keep the Gamoli relation between A and Phi or not? We just require that it solves Young-Mills? Yes, we keep the same relation between A and Phi. Right, but so physically, these have a lot of the same features as the minimally charged monopoles. The sort of non-abelian degrees of freedom are exponentially localized to the core of the monopole. But the sort of new feature for these is that now the degrees of freedom that are localized on the monopole are interacting with each other, which Interacting with each other, which sort of adds a new wrinkle. So the sort of simple monopole we want to consider is maybe say the SU4 monopole. And so what you can do is literally embed the SU2 along with the maximal embedding, where now the Carton of the SU2 maps to this particular combination in the SU4 as realized as a matrix. Realized as a matrix, and the off-diagonal is realized this way. This is great. We can sort of do physics with this if you'd like. And so since the limiting value of the SU2 monopole is just given by the carton generator, we find that its embedding in SU4 is also the image of the carton. And so we find that the gauge group SU4 is broken to U1Q. age group SU4 is broken to U1 cubed here, where now the monopole is a linear combination of three monopoles with different electric charges and higher electric charges as well. But now we see that sort of all of the off-diagonal components are become massless in the core. And so now there is sort of more interesting things. Sort of more interesting things that can happen when you have interactions with the fermions. And as I sort of alluded to earlier, these charged dion degrees of freedom is normally what we associate to the phase of the monopole. So for example, in the SU2 case, we say that the moduli space, at least topologically, looks like R3 times S1 to the M modulo. Modulo and SM identification. So this phase S1 in the abelian case sort of becomes something more complicated in these higher embeddings. The other type of monofole we're interested in are monofoles that are not simple SU2 embeddings. And so generally for these monofoles, what we want to do is we want to write the magnetic. we want to do is we want to write the magnetic charge as sort of we want to write the magnetic charge as the difference of two carton generators of two separate SU2 embeddings in SUN and we have some specific conditions that are required for this solution to be consistent but what's interesting about these solutions is that they very often preserve non-abelian magnetic charge so right so you can have something like Right, so you can have something like an SU3 gauge symmetry in the IR, or at the low energies. But something else that happens in these theories is that you actually find that there is non-abelian magnetic flux being sourced at subleading order. So these are of a very different flavor than the sort of non-simply embedded SU2 monopoles. And these will provide interesting examples, or interesting. Examples or interesting new class of low-energy defect monopoles that at least I'm not sure have been studied. And so we want to understand how they interact with monopole or with fermions. And I think there's much to be thought of here. Here's a nice example. Since I'm running out of time, I will skip it. But so, right, as I was saying, our overarching goal is to sort of generalize the computation that we did before for the abelian monopoles and understand how fermions. And understand how fermions interact with these higher charge monopoles. And at the moment, there's no systematic prescription for the boundary conditions. And it's sort of just a very complicated problem because we have to sort of be able to write down all of the different solutions for all the monopoles and then solve the Dirac equation there and then figure out and then integrate out these sort of interacting non-abelian degrees of freedom to figure out what the effective boundary conditions would be. conditions would be. But there's, as I was talking, as I was saying, it's very clear that there are new and interesting features for these higher charge monopoles. And I find that the spectrum of zero modes there is significantly more complicated and interesting. More examples. Yeah, sorry, I think I am pretty much out of time, so I will skip this example. But the The problem essentially with figuring out what to do here is that the zero modes of the microscopic theory do not seem to match the zero modes of the low energy theory. And so there's some sort of interesting matching problem that's going on that we're still in the process of figuring out. Yeah, so that's sort of most. Yeah, so that's sort of most that's mostly what I have for you guys today. Sort of the summary is that there are a lot of interesting open questions here, and we sort of know what we know, we know what to do for minimally charged monopoles and abelian gauge series. They're classified by these orthogonal rational matrices. But outside of that, the problems are just wide open. But there's sort of a lot of interesting reasons why we are interested in. Interesting reasons why we are interested in this. So, one physics reason is that understanding this interaction of higher charge monopoles with fermions is actually very important for understanding what the global form of the standard model gauge group is. So it turns out that the standard model actually has a Z6 redundancy, which means that the gauge group of the standard model could be any type of quotient of SU3 times SU2 times U1. And each type of times u1. And each type of different gamma leads to different monopole spectra. So if you were to be able to understand what the interactions are and say go out and measure them somehow, then you would be able to constrain what are the allowed microscopic physics of the universe. And in fact, you can, if you were to be able to measure whatever this group gamma is, you would be able to rule out, or you could potentially rule out. You could potentially rule out incredibly large classes of proposed UV completions of the standard model. But I think on a more mathematical note, I think that actually this problem of scattering resonates very strongly with the rational maps construction for monopole moduli spaces. I think as everybody knows, based on the talks that we've had so far, the rational maps relate a trivialized bundle of incoming states. A trivialized bundle of incoming states to a sort of non-trivial bundle of outgoing states when you sort of scatter along monopoles in a particular direction after you compactify the sort of transverse complex plane to a CP1. But in this case, what we're doing is we're scattering spherical waves off of a single monopole. So we're taking a trivialized bundle of ingoing states, and we're getting some sort of non-trivial bundle of outgoing states on CP1. So I would expect So, I would expect that sort of all monopole defects should be classifiable in sort of an appropriately generalized notion of the rational maps construction. So, and I think this is this is the end. So, thank you so much. Questions to Daniel? Yes, I have a question. So, you mentioned I have a question. So, you mentioned this idea of doing the scattering is reminiscing of Hitchens, no, sorry, with Kronimer's thesis, right? Where this twister story is described. So, when you just want to make sure that we speak the same language, when you're talking about classification, you'd like to use this. You'd like to use this whole story of scatterings of the fermions to produce all possible singular monopoles. That's sort of a goal that you're seeing as a possibility. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think there would have to be some. I don't think you could directly import what Kronheimer and Hitchen and Natia have done, but I think there's such strong parallels. There are such strong parallels that I think there has to be some way of adapting that idea. There are questions? Yes, maybe correct me if I'm wrong. The way I understand or maybe reformulate the story you told us today. I can have an entirely smooth monopole and then send the radial wave from infinity and study scattering. From infinity and study scattering problem where I don't have to impose any artificial boundary conditions because the solution is smooth, I just require regularity and find the outgoing wave. That's right. For that monopole, if I excise a sphere, there was, of course, the charge of the monopole was given by a co-character. But then there were certain restrictions on what co-characters I'm allowed to consider, considering the Higgs field. Considering the Higgs field, asymptotic Higgs field. For example, negative charge monopoles and such do not allow this filling in. But you relax this condition. Do I understand correctly? You consider much more general singularities, not necessarily extendable to smooth ones. That's right. That's correct. And then the boundary conditions you impose if you apply these conditions, consider these conditions to the extendable case. Consider these conditions to the extendable case. Are they all exhausted by this natural extension that I described first? I don't know. And I think that's part of what's interesting about it. So we have some sort of notion of what are nice non-abelian gauge theories, and they have sort of nice monopole solutions. And as you said, we can sort of cut out a two-size. Cut out a two-sphere around them and do the boundary condition so that the UV, the microscopic physics, matches the long-range physics, for example, in the scattering problem. But I guess what I'm suggesting is that it's also an interesting problem to try to reverse that and say, just take the long-range theory, just pick some gauge theory, and say, what are all of the possible singular monopoles you can construct so that the theory You can construct so that the theory is still consistent. Well, when you say consistent, I'm already becoming, I immediately become suspicious whether it might be consistent, but are they realized in the world? Because you need to have finite action in the end. So if it does not allow extension inside, which is completely smooth and L2 has finite action, then they will never be produced. Right. So I guess. So I guess my counter question, or would maybe not question, but that would sort of assume that we know everything about all possible microscopic theories and all the possible interactions that all the possible monopole solutions you could possibly construct. And maybe you can have some monopole that is coupled to some other higher energy, something that I don't know. I can imagine all sorts of. Know I can imagine all sorts of crazy things happening at microscopes. One presupposed completion, I say. Yeah, very unusual for a physicist. Usually, I presume you know the theory right away. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, of course. There might be a sort of twister version of this somehow, because you have the solutions to the Dirac equation are classified by elements of a cohomology group associated to the sort of twister construction. And it could be that somehow feeding Be that somehow feeding a class in this H1 sort of through the monopole gives you another class in the H1 that represents the, now it's that feeding through that's delightfully vague, and I don't know how it would work, but it might be sort of visible in that setup. I mean, these are very, you know, as you're pointing out, it's very. As you're pointing out, it's very far from being L2 solutions, which would be solutions somehow induced or supported in some sense on the spectral curve. But it's, you know, there could be some canonical class of easily, and then you feed it through, you project, you do something, and then see what this thing gives. So, anyway, interesting. Good, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Good. I'm glad you enjoy it. I think there's a lot of interesting questions you can ask related to at least the stuff I talked about. But fortunately, I have more questions than answers for everybody. So you have no supersymmetry in this theory? No supersymmetry. So that's why you're not worried about having these local boundary conditions instead of the usual sort of non-local boundary conditions you'd expect to be compatible with supersymmetry. That's right. And sort of, I guess, the main reason. And sort of, I guess the main reason I didn't want to consider supersymmetry for this theory is that it often comes with a sort of coupling between the scalar field and the fermion fields. And so usually when you consider a monopole, you give the Higgs field some sort of profile, and that will give your fermions a mass. And then you're sort of out of this, you're sort of into a different realm of questions. But yeah, it sort of ruins the Yeah. It sort of ruins the fact that you can have low energy degrees of freedom in the fermions that can go out to infinity. So you're saying did it usually have a spectral gap in that case? Or is it? That's right. You often do. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, yeah. More questions? If not, then let's thank Danielle once more.
