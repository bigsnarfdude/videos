So, I'm going to talk about some symmetry and the motions, a kind of mathematical structure of particles similar to the free flows. So, although the workshops focus on the vortices or vortex dynamics, so I'm working on some very small particles inside vortices. So, today I think is for the kind of boredic applications for stitchencies. So I'm going to talk some something about the particle swimmers in swimming in vortices like the turbulence roll in everywhere in the world. But size of vortices is still very big compared with to the size of microorganisms of pranktons, bacteria like this. So the flow field around the site of small particles, fimers, well approximated by simple Well, approximated by a simple linear frog. And today's talk is focused on how such a particle swimmers moving in such a linear frog. Okay, so I'm going to first show you some very brief introductions of the microorganism of microswimmers, which are tiny agents that can be self-propelled, like a Propelled like bacteria, sperm cells, and ciliates like this. The important and interesting points in these particles, there are many, many different shapes. Although we are very familiar with spherical particles, to say, to find the flow fields or visualize the flow field by a particle image. View by a particle image blossometary, but these kind of particles sometimes are not spherical, although there are some particles really spherical. Okay, there's a kind of example of non-spherical particles which is active, like hair coid of tail rotated by the Morrican motor to propel. Another example is sperm cells. I would I will talk some work on these cells in the later of this talk. They just are swimming with a slender tail called Frazilla. The third example is a celebrated swimmer. They have a lot of hair-like appendages on the surface, then beating in a synchronous manner. And these kinds of particles now manufactured by humans. So, some researchers working on artificial microsumers to make them propel maybe inside our body for drug delivery. So, there's another question: what kind of motion dynamics arises for such an artificial microservice, for example, in my body? Microsimus, for example, in my body, like in blood vessels. Okay, so let me talk something about equations. So we now are working on the free flow. So we first set up the Navier Stock equation for the Gabon equation of freight motion. But at the same time, I need the equation of motion for the particle swimmers embedded in this freight environment. So-called Newton all. Environments, so-called Newton-Euler equations for the Rhini and Angular momentum situations. But the current Reynolds number is much, much smaller than the unit say due to the size of microorganism, microparticles. So the initial terms are all niggable. So the equation of motion for the fluid is reduced to linear Stokes equations, and Newton-Euler equation is just the force and torque balance equations. Force and torque balance equations. But these two equations coupled at the boundary, and typically this boundary can be formed by this self-propelling nature of the particle. So it's more complicated than we thought. We apply the Nausic boundary condition on the surface of deforming object. So in this context, I assume the velocity, the deformation. The velocity, the formation itself is a given function, but we don't know how it swims. So, Bernilian velocity and angular velocity are assumed to be unknown functions to be solved. So, in this simple setting, still, there are many, many interesting questions. The first thing I would like to highlight is the symmetry of this system. A so-called time-liberal symmetry or kinematic deposibility. So, if you are seeing The possibility. So, if you assume the kind of reciprocal deformations such as the scalar of doing in this way, so just open and close its shell, which is time universal deformation. But with the linearity of South equations by this Lisbon motion, they cannot swing at all. So, after one period motion, the displacement, the net displacement have to be punishing. Be punishing. So, this is called Scarp Theorem by Passel back to 1977. The mathematics behind this is summarizing this way. So, now I focus on the kinematic problem where the swimming gate is given function and the swimming trajectory itself is a known function to be solved. But in this But in this zero-Reynolds number, no information is needed for internal structures. So, like how it flexible, that doesn't matter. Only the shape matters for the solution of this equation. So, shape is important. And another important factor is resistant tensors. So, the duty of linearity, we can formulate it. To linearity, we can formulate the total fruit force in this way. So, separate into the different factors. The first one is the so-called resistance forces. So, if your particle is moving in fluid, they receive some drop force, which is linear to its own velocity. So, this is drag force. And resistant tensor, Kij is formulating 6-6 matrix by. Six matrix combining and velocity and angular velocity, anyway. This persistent tensor is just a function shape. And if we assume some linear velocity at the background flow, we have third blank tensor called CL resistant tensor as well. And proper portion is coming from its deformation. Anyway, everything is linear. And these tensors are just a function of shape. This is an important part here. Part here. Okay, let me introduce another interesting mathematical solution of these equations called Jeffrey's orbit. So Jeffrey's equation is proposed over 100 years ago, 1922, by G.B. Jeffrey, and now cited more than 5,000 times. But interesting, the half of this citation is Half of these citations are just after 2010. So only the recent 15 years, half of this citation are made. This is probably because of the development of this micro-swimming hard zonics and micro devices. So this kind of simple equations has big impacts after century. But anyway, so let me introduce this Jeffrey Breton equations, which is the Of equations, which is how the particles rotate under the linear flow. Just consider a body of revolution, which is a shape made of the rotation of the function around an axis. And if this particle is immersed in a linear flow in this way, it's a linear background velocity, linear angular velocity related to the volticity, and rate per strain. And your particle. And your particle orientation vector, which is unit vector d, is obeys these equations. So d dot is how it rotates. And of course, it follows the background vorticity if the particle is sphere. But there are some moderations by the shape of the particle, which is integrated in this shape parallel B. Shape parameter B called Brotherton constant, representing the effective asset ratio, anyway. So if there is some non-sphericity or particle, the B is a light is here. So if the particle is needle-like splendor body, B approaches one, a sphere, B0. And if the particle is like disk flattened limit, B goes to minus one. So these shape. So, these shape information are all integrated in this shape parameter, which is remarkable. So, our system, including fluid dynamics and particle dynamics, are coupled with any arbitrary shape. But if you assume body revolutions, all the information about shape are just represented by a single point. But this is just an introduction. But this is just an introduction or motivation of our study. But there are many, many different shapes in the world. So if you just consider the bacterial with helical tail this way, under the rhinea flow in the micro devices, they are not just rotating. Sometimes, as in this panel, if they share, If there's shear and how you call it tail, there's some shear-related effect, which is called shear-related drift velocity. So if your particle is left-handed and right-handed, these two different chiral particles split away after in this microchannel. So there's actually the effect of chirality. So the Jeffrey law bit. So, the Jeffrey law bit is not perfect in this sense. So, we have to extend our concept shape to include the chiral object. So, we sometimes approximate this kind of chiral object by the simple rod, but this is not okay for this kind of biological material. So, I'd like to extend this axisymmetric. Axisymmetric concept to include the chiral object. To do this, let me define the hydronic shape symmetry. So as we introduce, these resistant tensors are just a function of shape. But the shape is now defined in terms of these equations or the dynamics equation motion of the particle in the fluid. So let me assume. The fruit. So let me assume that all the resistant tensors are invariant under some transformation of the body fixed frame. And let me denote by A, which is a kind of matrix of rotation and reflection. If so, the objects now we call the hydrogen symmetry. The hydrogen symmetry associated with A. So, this is a kind of shape, but defined in terms of the equation motion, not of the object itself. Then we can naturally extend our idea of axisymmetry in this symmetry, in this hydrogen symmetry. So, let's assume that matrix A is just the rotation on the axis of an axis. Is just the rotation on the axis of an arbitrary angle along. Then the corresponding hydrogen symmetry we call the helicodal symmetry because it naturally includes the helicity or chirality of particle. Then it is called helicode object. So this helicode object is a kind of extension of axisymmetry in terms of hydrogen symmetry. Okay, that's a bit abstract. So let me consider. Abstract, so let me consider an example. But that's hydrogen symmetry. I'm sorry, high-quality symmetry is really little bit generic. So this definition includes a kind of n-fold rotational symmetry denoted by Cn in Schenfield's notation. If n equal to 4 or greater than 4, this particle are also. These particles also satisfy the condition for the helicode object. So, natural extension of aximetry includes this kind of helicopter object like bacteria, bacterial tail, and also this includes discrete rotation symmetry like this kind of star shape, prancetons. Then, A few years ago, I derived the equation motion for the dynamics or orientation dynamics of particle with this particular symmetry in this form. So your d, the director vector, which is unique vector, follows these equations. The first time is just the rotation around by the background vorticity. The second time is And vorticity. The second time is the aspect relation-related shape modulations included in this present constant, and new terms comes from the new Chiral effect. So, let me briefly show you how we derive. So, K Q C gamma lambda, these are the tensors. These are the tensors inside the sorry, this K and G I J K. This has some symmetry from the energy conservation law. But still, there are many, many entries in total 51. But if you assume the Harry Cordle symmetry or axisymmetry in terms of axam symmetry, we can reduce this number into. We can reduce this number into 13. Still not quite easy, but we can write down the explicit form of these tensors and just consider the force and torque balance equation to cross the system and solve the linear equations, although there are many, many entries. So to do this, So, to do this, if we select the proper author tryout, we can explicitly solve these equations to get the dynamics of the rotation vector, which is the equation I presented in a couple slides ago. So, we have the dynamics of rotations as well as Rhinea. Velocity. Still, there are some effects from the chirality. So, as I said, these kind of helicode objects can be split away if these have a different chirality in the microdevices. This is explained by the drift velocity coming from the coupling between the chiral shape and the shear. These two effects are very new or novel in this chiral shape. So we have many different effects. So let me summarize. So if our body, our object is body revolutions, we have returned constants, which is non-zero in general, and the chiral effects should be vanishing for. Should be vanishing for body of revolutions to the symmetry. And in general, we have this non-zero effect. But if you assume, for example, right-handed and left-handed helices in your right and left, this has additional millasymmetry in this frame. If so, we can remove the drift effect. Also, if you assume two. Also, if you assume two left-handed or right-handed equal helicity in your both sides, this has another symmetry, which is a high rotational symmetry around an axis. If so, we can eliminate the C effect. This could be very nice. For example, this particle just modulated its Modulated its orientation dynamics by its Kilo term, I mean the Boltes effect. And these terms only appears, the colour effects only appear in the drift. So we can eliminate the rotational colour effect. So these two additional shape is only here in terms of hydrogen shape. In terms of hydrodom shape, so we can summarize in this way. So, Halicord of shape is more general. A body of revolution is a kind of geometrical oxymetry, but not equal to the hadomic oxymetry. And in between, we have two different chiral shapes. These are clarified in this table by a Schoenfree stein. Anyway, so this equation. So, this equation is very nice in terms of explaining the bacterial taxis, how bacterial life heliported shape moved in the background flow. And the result is here. So, there is some voltage. If you assume some shear flow, there's a vortex vector. So, if you assume like this, your vortex vorticity vector is Applied in your side. A particle with helical objects would like to align this background vorticity vector. So we may be able to detect which directions your background vorticity vector is facing by this chiral object. And recently, the C parameter, which represents the size of chiridity for E. corridor. Chirality for E. corribacteria and acilate. So, as I said, if your particle is n-volt lotus symmetry with n equals to forward greater than the four, we have this simple symmetric shape, a symmetric structure. But if you assume just in three rotational three-fold rotation symmetry, the dynamics is in general. The dynamics is in general chaotic. So, four is safe, but three is a bit dangerous in this sense. So, this is back to the study back to 1997 showing that two-hole rotated symmetry with a multiple additional symmetry like ellipsoid or cuboid behaves in a chaotic way in a simple shear. So, this means three is the So this means three is the minimum number, or maybe maximum number if you see the critical number, which shows the chaotic dynamics of rotation particle inside the linear shear flow. Again, the Leo famous wording that POD3 implies chaos is accurate in this sense in Stokes Particle Dynamics. Dynamics. Okay, in the remain times, I introduce some additional work after these equations. So now I've studied on the kind of Ewing active particle like spam. But this system has two time scales. One is its original Beating frequency. The other one is how it rotates in the background flow. So we can split these two time scales by analyzing with mass scale analysis and can we integrate this fast time dynamics into a slow dynamics? So with the standard multiple dynamics for dynamics, we can set up the Setup the particle which is yawing in the prime shear is down to the slow dynamics with effective velocity and effective breadth of constant. So if your particle is oscillating very fast, your particle follows asymptotically Jeffrey's orbit as a slow on risk. So this is kind of unnatural if you assume, let's Unnatural if you assume, let's say, this kind of lapital oscillating particle. And if you blowly look at this particle in the fluid, this could be a kind of spheroid, not a needle. So this kind of effective shape is represented in this way. Okay, let me skip a bit. So the second topic is The second topic is the three-dimensional swimming. So now we assume the particle velocity is constant, not oscillating. But additional slow dynamics is coming from this helicoidal trajectory of three-dimensional swimming. In general, this kind of particle exhibits three-dimensional helicoidal part. Three-dimensional helicoidal trajectory pass. This is an example of microalgae called Gunium. With this steady velocity, they exhibit headquarters trajectory. So this is very common and very general. So now I try to analyze, to separate two different time scales. One is this kind of helicopter trajectory. Of helicopters of trajectory, the other one is rotations in the back flash here. So, let me remind me of the rotation dynamics, which we derived in the first of this talk. So, let me assume our particle is helicodal or hydrodynamic oxymetry. Then, Then write down the equations of angles with Euler or Eura angles in three dimensions. And these are the coefficients. So H1, H2, H3 is coming from the background shear. And omega power is our propulsion angular velocity. So this is the kind of active part. And the second part is the passive part. Coming from They're coming from the shear shape interactions. These terms are expressly shown in this way. B C D is a shape parameter, Black Constant. C is the characteristics effect. D is another characterist effect, which is not explicitly shown in the previous slide. But anyway, there is another chiral shape parameter. And look at this equation. And look at this equation just in a trigonometric, awkward, non-interesting part, but this is coming from the hidden symmetry of the system. So if you do the multiple scenarios to eliminate fast perichoidal trajectory to get the slow dynamics, after ablation out this helicoid dynamics in the shear, we can get We can get simple slow dynamics only represented by the passive part, although the particle itself is active, with effective shape parameter. So your particle is active, but if you look at the slow dynamics, the behavior is the same as the passive particle with the modulated or modified shape parameter. So B hat, C hat, D hat. So B hot, C hot, D hot is shape parameter, new shape parameter including your activity. So let me show you the result. So if you assume this kind of helicoid particles, helicode trajectory with under linear background flow, they behave a very complicated behavior. But if you look at the effective The effective asymptotic equations, we can clearly draw the average dynamics, just modifying the shape parameter. Okay, let me summarize. So I introduced the hypersymmetry to understand the complicated behavior of rotations of particle swimmers inside the linear flow. Inside the linear flow, but I assume the shape is helipoidal based on the symmetry, base symmetry coming from the equation motion. And I show a rapidly owing summer for the asymptotic Jeffrey orbit and rapidly spinning summer is now for asymptotic Jeffrey Bretton-Lismox equations. I just call these equations by this. Anyway, thank you very much for your kind attention. For your kind attention.
