So, I'll be talking about the background and existing literature a bit first. So, what is cognitive control and the associated dual mechanism of control framework? So, cognitive control is the ability to regulate, coordinate, and sequence thoughts and actions per internally maintained behavioral. Per internally maintained behavioral goals. So, cognitive control is immensely important for us human beings to navigate through our day-to-day tasks smoothly. So, it is hypothesized in the psychopathology literature that cognitive control has three components, working memory, the ability to hold information temporarily, inhibition control, the ability to control impulses, thoughts, and emotions, and cognitive flexibility. And cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt our thinking and behavior to the situational context. Now, impairment in the above components of cognitive control has been seen to be associated with mental health conditions such as ADHD, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, OCD, etc. So, now the dual mechanism of control framework hypothesizes that cognitive control operates via two. Control operates via two distinct modes: the proactive control and the reactive control. So, this has been hypothesized in the seminar paper of Todd Brever and Lockheed Braver. So, what is this to give some context? So, suppose you are driving in a highway. So, while you are driving, your primary goals are to maintain the lane, check the speed limit. So, those are your primary goals. So, those are your primary goals. So, it is hypothesized that the proactive control of the proactive mechanism of cognitive control, which is a continuous process, so this actively maintains the goal in a sustained manner. So, the proactive control is typically responsible for that. Now, suppose a card in front of you that makes a that suddenly hits the brake. So, in that case, our knee-jerk reaction should also be to Reaction should also be to halt our car or steer in a different way. So, that is an effect of reactive control that comes into action after detecting a high interference event. And at the advent of such high interference events, attention is recruited as a late correction mechanism. So, for proper cognitive control in human beings, so the both. Human beings. So both proactive and reactive control has to be operational. Now, changes in situational factors can influence whether proactive or reactive control is utilized depending on the situation, as I just explained with the cartoon with the cars. Also, individual differences such as personality traits may determine which control is preferred approach for task performance, but again, these are latent processes and it is not. Latent processes, and it is not exactly like in our control, like what we are doing. This is something latent that happens in the brain in starting the disruption of cognitive control. Both proactive and reactive controls are of equal importance because they act in unison. So, now I would like to talk about different ways to measure cognitive control impairments. So, to the best of our knowledge, no taste or Test or no pathological test or procedure exists to directly measure cognitive control. Now, alternatively, some psychological tests are performed in laboratory settings to measure cognitive abilities in humans. And one such psychological test is the stop signal task. So, stop signal tasks typically can assess the inhibition control and cognitive flexibility. The inhibition control and cognitive flexibility, those components which are important in many real-life situations. So, what are stop signal tasks? So, they typically have two kinds of tasks. So, there are both tasks. So, in such tasks, the participants or the subject typically sit in front of a computer and they are subjected to some visual stimuli. visual visual stimuli those could be the right right arrow or left arrow so these are the visual stimuli and they have to press the button accordingly now the responses are recorded what what do they respond and also the time between seeing the stimulus and making the response that is also recorded so that's the go response time so there in in go tas typically we have two measurements uh their response and uh their the response time And the response time. So, if the participant presses the wrong button, for example, let's say the low left stimulus was presented, but they press the right key. So, that's the response accuracy in the task is zero in that particular task that is also recorded. So, these are both tasks. In stop signal trials, there are also stop tasks. So, those also start with the visual stimuli. Stimuli. Only one of these two stimuli will appear and randomly that is unknown to the subject. But after a stop signal delay, this stop signal will appear in the screen. And the instruction to the subjects are to withhold their response whenever they see the stop trial. So if they're able to successfully inhibit or withhold their response, then All the response, then only we have that information, but in that case, there's no response time. We cannot measure any response time because they have not pressed any button. However, if they make a wrong, however, if they are unable to withhold their response, unable to inhibit their response, in that case, the response time is recorded. So, to summarize, in goal. So, to summarize, in Go tasks, we have a response and a response time. In stock tasks, if the response is successfully inhibited, then there is no response time can be measured. However, there is a latent reaction time in the brain. So, the brain reacts to it internally and decides to withhold, but we cannot measure that. So, to further illustrate that. So, to further illustrate that, so here suppose a participant sees the stop signal. So, the brain processes the signal and registers that they need to withhold. And they are also able to successfully withhold. But in that case, since it's a latent process and that's not measured, but the reaction time in the brain that it is something that exists. That it is something that exists, and we refer to that as the reaction time. So, SSRT is an unobserved quantity, and in stop signal tasks, one of the main objectives is to measure the stop signal reaction time or SSRT as a measure of inhibition control. So, longer SSRTs are often considered a marker of impaired response inhibition because empirical studies show that individuals with mental health conditions. Individuals with mental health conditions such as ADHD, OCD, or schizophrenia, they tend to exhibit longer SSRTs. On the other hand, shorter SSRTs are generally an indication of more efficient inhibitory control, suggesting better cognitive abilities to suppress a response quickly if required. So, the distribution of the SSRT, as I just mentioned, this is unknown, but based on the other observables from stop signal task, the other observables. Stop signal task, the other observed quantities, the distribution of SSFT can be estimated, and that is typically done by likelihood-based statistical approaches. So, we will be using the ABCD trial data, the adolescent brain cognitive development data, which is a large-scale study conducted by NIM Image on US children. So, over 10,000 children aged 9 to 10 are enrolled. Are enrolled and they have annual cognitive and clinical assessments. We only in this first project we only utilize the baseline year data. And in that study, stop signal tasks task is used as one of the cognitive assessment tools. Now, the stop signal trials. So I just mentioned Go trials and stop tasks. So randomly, there will be like several trials where the go task and stop task. Trials where the go task and stop tasks randomly appear. The subject does not know what will appear, they just randomly appear, and the subjects need to act accordingly. Now, out of the 180 trials, around 30 are stop tasks. So, the stop tasks are designed to mimic rare and infrequent high interference events. For example, if you drive in a highway, it's less likely that a car in front of you makes a sudden stop. So, that's an unlikely event. So, the stop. That's an unlikely event. So, the stop tasks are designed to minimize such situations. So, existing models to estimate the stop signal reaction time. So, the hot stress diffusion models are widely used. So, in hot stress diffusion, this is a stylized example where there could be three, there are three stimuli, and these color stochastic parts are the latent accumulated evidence over time. So, here this Time. So here this was the stimulus onset. So one of the three stimuli was presented. But the assumption of the horse's diffusion model is that brain collected evidence for all the stimuli. And the different evidence accumulators race towards the boundaries. So there's a boundary for each evidence accumulator and once and Accumulator and once an accumulator reaches the boundary in this stylized example, the green one, evidence accumulator one, it reaches the boundary. And so that's the winner and the subject in this case will respond according to the winner. So the evidence accounted that reaches the boundary first wins. So that's why this model is known as the horse-rest diffusion model. horse stress diffusion mode now this evidence accompany this stochastic evidence accumulations accumulators which are like latent evidence which we uh which is assumption like that's something our brain does so that's typically uh modeled by a linear winer diffusion process so at time t the accumulated evidence uh follows a winer stochastic process uh where uh which is defined as nu t plus sigma times uh bt where b t is the Bt, where Bt is the standard Brownian motion, and Î¼ is the rate of evidence accumulation. So, here we have three processes in this example. So, these are the respective evidence accumulators. And once the boundary is reached and a decision is a response is made. So, the distribution of the time required to reach the boundary that is known and the That is known, and it can be derived that that follows an inverse Gaussian distribution with this PDF. So, here this tau is the first passage time, that is the time when the stochastic process first reaches the boundary. If that is tau, the distribution of tau, that's also a random quantity because these are stochastic processes. So, it has this PDF where B is the boundary parameter and u is the corresponding evidence accumulation rate. Now, this B and Nu parameters are unknown. B and new parameters are unknown, and those are estimated from repeated trial data. So, I would like to briefly discuss how the likelihoods are constructed. So, the horse-race model has two key assumptions that the evidence accumulators are independent, and also successive trials are also independent. So, with that, we can construct the likelihood function. So, for GO trials, where the job is to respond. The job is to respond in that case. In that case, one response is made. So, suppose in this case, process one has won. So, we will put the PDF of the stopping time distribution of the process one and the other one, they did not win. That is, they take more time than tau. So, we in the likelihood, we plug in the corresponding serial functions for processes which are not the wind. Processes which are not the winner. Now, for stop tasks, we have two types of tasks: the failed stop task and the response inhibit task. So, in failed stop tasks, so suppose this is a time where the brain registers that this is a random time when that brain requires to register that it's a stop trial. However, the decision in the brain has only brain has already decided to respond. Has already decided to respond. So, the other evidence accumulators for the GO process has won. So, in that case, we would have the likelihood of the GO process here, which has won. The evidence accumulated for the stock process could not win. So, we need to put its survival function and also for other GO processes that did not win. So, this is the likelihood for the stock, failed stock trials, and similarly, for the similarly. Similarly, in the response inhibit trial, in this case, the response has been withheld. So the time required for the brain to understand that it needs to withhold the response is smaller than the time that is smaller. But we cannot observe it. As I mentioned, in stock tasks, in successful response individual trials, this is unobserved. Else, this is unobserved. So, we need to integrate over all possible all possibilities of the SSRT. So, we need to integrate over this random likelihood of the stop task. So, these are the likelihoods, and from these likelihoods, we can estimate the parameters. So, these are the standard approaches. So, now Farabi will take over and talk about the limitations of existing approaches.
