In this work, we are discussing about the interaction between spin and orbital rotation. The idea is that since the formation of the vorticity and the water dynamics by Humpholes, that the vorticity field have been traditionally considered as the solely characteristic quantified vertical motions. So, everyone here knows the definition of vorticity. Definition of vorticity. So, in typically, that if we do vorticity equation plus some BSR law, plus some list equation, we can be equivalent to the unless equation. And I think that most people here, we are solving the vaccine equation, not solving the unless equations. So then for a fluid element, it possesses not only the orbital rotation as shown here, but it also has some spin, which can characterize by the pure shear, like the linear shear here. Our understanding on these two types of motions, sometimes even Types of emotions sometimes even qualitatively is either study the this kind of actual vortices as showing here or we start the shear layers so people typically ignore the interaction between these two motions and then for Homo's theorem that to then to some very various exact vertex model solutions of all equations like Aussie vortex bachelor vortex and also as well as a very lot of what has criterion or what has adapted in master since 1980s most of research on what has Most of the research on vortex dynamics has been focused on the actual vertices. Most people ignore the vortex shift. However, it's essential to recognize that actual vertices represent only the strongest vortex structures in the vertical flow. So that in contrast, shear layers due to the presence of homohole instability exhibits many rich diverse motions patterns. Here, we give some examples here that we see that when Some examples here that this is that when you have shear layer, they will low up into this kind of vortex, and here this is a jet flow that you have formally got vortex green, water screen integers for the general turbulence. Here we give a turbulent boundary example that you have water sheet sheet at the beginning, then you have low up into water tube, then it will go some list on the TS instability, then become turbulent. Yeah, so what actually seems to become very important, particularly at high-range numbers. So, let's go ahead with our force to keep our like. Let's go ahead. We are forced to give like what the angular waters or line element. Consider line that the starting point is x0, ending point is x. The line can be expressed as these equations. So from Cauchy-Stock's theorem, that we can get the velocity of this kind of line element, which is here. We can further get the change of the this E is a unit vector of that line. We can get the change of the unit vector in terms of this kind of omega. In terms of list and omega, omega is the anti-symmetric part of velocity tensor, D is a symmetric part. So if you can do some simplification, we can get what we call angular velocity of a line element, not the flu element. It's given here. It has three components. First, the lambda term is just a stretching along that line. We can ignore that one. At least the vaccine term is that the line element, the angle velocity of line element depends on the vaccine at that point. It's trivial. But if you have additional terms, it's list. But you have additional terms, it's least term. Least term comes from this kind of symmetric part of our velocity gradient tensor. So if we this is the angle of velocity for a line element, but if we do a volume integral along that, to do a volume integral along that line, we get the mean angle velocity of the fluid element, which is the typical angle of velocity, which is one half vorticity. But from this here, from the equation here, we see that when we consider a line, that we have some additional contribution come from the D. Some additional contribution comes from the D, not only simply from the omega. Yeah. So this highlights the importance of this, as JJ will say, the little higher importance of this kind of D term, which somehow also corresponds to the shear term. So from here, that we also first get some review of this kind of characteristic function of the wash screen tensor. I think most people here know that. So here the lambda are the eigenvalue of the wash green tensor. We have this kind of three invariant PQR. P is just a trace of A. It becomes Of A is become zero for the income pass flow. Then, further, we can define delta, which in terms of this kind of PQR, which it can define because it can simplify to this simple form for the income pass flow. And this delta then can characterize the eigenvalue patterns that if delta is positive, then we have one real eigenvalue plus two complex eigenvalues. If delta is less than zero, we also have all three real eigenvalues. So then. Then people propose specifically professor that Dr. Li Zhen proposed this kind of shoe decomposition, and also there are other people up there, like Key Lock and also like Lien Li by Liu Chao Chun said to develop this kind of shoe. You can decompose this one picture into normal part and a new potent part S. Like here, given it's very expensive here, based on the shield decomposition, yeah. Here, the S, here's the normal part of normal tensor N has the same angle. Normal tensor n has the same eigenvalue as the uh water speed tensor A and also same invariance. But the near point tensor S just capturing the 3D pure shield and has three components, alpha, beta, gamma. And S has no non-zero eigenvalues. So if you can further decompose this kind of normal tensor as further three components, E just corresponding to this kind of compression and expansion, Z just we capitalize. Expansion. Z just we capture the three-dimensional non-axial symmetric rotational strength as capturing as we draw here. Then psi just list on the orbital rotation we typically see in the vertical flows. And this D just previously this year. So based on this one, there we can decompose the loss content into four flow patterns. So it can somehow help us to understand the flow. If we're incompassed flow, then Incompass flow, then E is zero. So we can have this kind of triple decomposition: S plus Z plus psi. And if we define that, the two take a coordinate that the E3 direction is just the eigenvector, eigenvector of the real eigenvalue of the A, so we can get expression for all the three quantities, three tensors. So here that side can have two different forms depending on whether delta is positive or delta is negative. Delta is positive, then it characterize the location. The location there is an active classified in-plane strain, yeah. Yeah, so these are all three forms, these are all the forms for this kind of tensors, yeah, yeah. So then if you further apply the symmetric and anti-symmetric decomposition, this is typically people do in the in in in turbulent flow or in any vertical flow that d is a symmetric part, omega is unsymmetric part. So we can further decompose d into three part and omega into two part. So that in this case is that both d you can see both d have this uh strain have this. Have this strand have the have a shear part, SS and SA, SS and SA given here, yeah. So that it characterizes shear have a contribution not only to D, but also to omega. Then we can further, since we know that omega, this kind of omega can be extracted as a vorticity omega here. Then we can similarly have the omega can be decomposed into two forms. This is two psi and plus s. Psi is what we call orbital rotation by Jz and S is. By JT, and S is the shear part we discussed previously that this provides like separation of vorticity into orbital rotation and a spin. This is idea similar as what proposed by the Tauten Leo as a, this is that side, two sides almost equivalent as the low-text proposed by the torch and real, yes. Then, okay, if you still use E3, like the eigenvector of the real eigenvalue as one of the coordinates. As one of the coordinates. So we can express some of the equations that gamma is equal to the square root of omega 3 square minus 4 lambda c r square. Omega 3 is the vorticity along that E3 direction. Lambda C R is the real part of the compass eigenvalue. So psi is given this equation. So that it gives us a way to calculate psi and gamma. But we know that for vector psi and s, we have four components because psi only have one component. Because psi only have one component, this small psi, and s have alpha beta gamma. So that it's only that we have two independent variables. We have two constraints for this kind of four variables. One is that omega three equals two psi plus gamma. And the second is this equation. It's come from the divergent free of the vorticity vorticity. Yeah. So we have this equation. So if you assume that this side, which we call optimal rotation, only mostly comes from this kind of slow up of shear layer. Then this kind of Up of shear layer, then extend the orbital rotation and rotistry should have the same sign, so we can do some normalization. We define eta equal to psi divided by omega 3, then it must be from 0 to 1 and a half. So if there are no background shear means that gamma is 0, then eta can get the maximum value. We call one half, yeah. So then we give some simple examples. The first double is a double shear layer. The expression is given, the initial condition is given here. This is the evolution, yeah. But in 2 decays, Evolution, yeah, but in 2D cases, z is going to zero, yeah, and the upper beta also equals zero. So we only have this simple equation, omega equal to two psi plus gamma. Yeah, first we show the evolution of the vorticity, like this literally the two parallel shear layer. Then try to do some perturbation into a lower up into here is like a vortex core. You have some tails along a tails connect with them. It is at length that you have a clear wattlex core with some shear layers. Here we have some green lines, not so. Here we have some green line, it's not so clear, it's just delta indicates that within the green line, delta is positive. So that the middle row shows the psi, which can be considered as a vortex identification method or vortex criterion. So that you can see initially it's psi zero, but later time that almost captures the vortex core. But if you only look at the vortex core, you don't know where this kind of vortex comes from. So you need to better look at gamma. Gamma is the shear, so that gamma is somehow coupled with. So, that gamma is somehow coupled with psi. So, that when psi is strong here, that gamma is weak. So, that has some coupling between psi and gamma. So, if you want to get a more comprehensive picture of this kind of evolution of this flow, so we must look at both the gamma and the pai. This is the idea that JG said that we should not only look at the vorticity vortex, but we should also look at the shear layer. So, he also believes that the shear layer is also the source of the vortex. Layer is also the source of the vortex. Most of these vortexes come from the lower of the shear layer, so that people should focus more on understanding shear layer. In this case, the gamma term. Then we also give an example of the water connection part. Here we give different is the contours. Here, the gray at the eye counter is a vorticity. Then the blue is because the norm of the side. It's mostly in the as a in the In the as a uh in the center region of the vortex, because this is like a vortex identification method, like like Q, named other method. So, this pink color is a shear. So, shear is because you have two layers because it's almost shear is strong in the periphery of this kind of vortex core. So, away from the kind of course is strong. So, this have this kind of two layers. So, inside this layer is strong. So, really, it means the irrotational suitation strengthened. The strain turn. It's only important though in the loop connection region because in this region you have this kind of cask structures. So you have structure terms, you have vortex structure term. So this turn is important. You can see that this kind of dark red hun only important in these regions. Then we can also look at some particular planes. One is the symmetrical plane, which is cutting through here. One is collision plane cutting through here. Here we give some isochontos. Here the black is a vorticity isochontos. And this green is the delta is blue. And this green is the delta is positive. And here, the blue is only side. You can see the captured vortex core. Here, we have three vortex dipoles, so that it only has only non-zero in this kind of green circles. And it has clearly extracted these three dipoles. This pink color is a shear term. So it's somehow compensated this kind of brutal. When you sum them together, you guys get a. Some of them together, you guys get a complete picture of this one so that this term that you can see that for this structure, this vortex sheet mostly are due to S, not due to gamma. Then we can show the Z turn because Zetan is a 3D electron strain. It's also important because it's somehow represent the actual stretching of the vortex, so that it may be helpful to give some idea on the amplification of vorticity. But we find that inside the vortex core, the z-ton is very small. Yeah, yeah. You can see that z-trans almost zero. Yeah, yeah, you can see that different almost zero. It's always that in along that plane that this definitely is strong. Yeah, so that means that this D is very weak in that extra in the core. So that extra structure in that core is also weak. Then we look at the collision plane. It's the uniform bridge. So that when at this time that you can see this kind of vortex core reforms. So this again, this green is just the delta is positive. So in the in the list is like similar. So inside in that list is like similar, almost like a vortex, circular vortex, but inside inside there's still some green inside there is a hole. In that region, delta is negative. We can see that this is a, again, black is what it blue is a psi, and pink is S. So that you can see that in that vortex, it also has a region of strong shear layer because most we believe that this kind of vortex is come from lower up vortex shears, so that least why we still have a shear vortex. Hasn't she whatever this strong S inside the core here? Here we show the Z. In this case, that we have Z strong in this plane because in this plane that we have this kind of cask structure, so you have like a strong stretching along from with respect to perpendicular planes. So this is why that D is also stronger in that plane. So finally, we can also do some time evolution of these current terms. For here, that again, D is. Terms for here that again d is a symmetric part, so d squares can somehow characterize the dissipation. Omega square is somehow entropy, yeah. So we can also decompose into two terms. This blue is the erosion of d for at different time during for reconnection. Initially, this is the adraction phase, this is the reconnection phase, and this is the later starting phase. We can see that during reconnection, that this square rapidly increases. And from this decomposition, we find that mostly this rapidly increases contributes. Mostly, this kind of rapid increase is contributed by the shear. So, you can see that it's due to the formation of this shear structures contribute to the increase of this kind of disqualify also to the dissipation. So, that is somehow highlights the importance of this kind of shear layer in the loop connection. Then, if we look at the entropy, entropy turn can also be complemented into this side turn and a shear layer, shear turn, and some coupling turn. Entrophy should be equal to this omega square should be equal to this square. We know that if you Square, about this D square, we know that if for incompass of flow, yeah, and from this kind of decomposition, we find that this also this kind of increase of entropy is most due to this kind of shield shield tonight, which is this yellow color. If you see that this during recognition, you have this yellow rapidly increases. So this is why that we believe that it's still again the shear layer contributes more to the entropy production, to the entropy layer. And other terms is very small, except for this interaction term between psi and the s. So for all this analysis. So, from all this analysis, we think that the shear layer formation during this kind of vortex reconnection is the most important to both dissipation and also to entropy generation. Then we can also do some analysis for the entropy production because entropy production is omega i, dij, omega j. So each term can be decomposed into two terms. So we can get simplified into six terms. We can do some manipulation that we can get this kind of six terms, sometimes at zero. Yeah, so each term has some physical meaning, like first term, the omega. term has some physical meaning like first term the omega i z i j omega j is interaction between the vortex core with the actual stretching with the irrotational strength just like a stretching of a vortex core yeah or what has column here that this kind of omega i s i j omega j term is the intext self-intaction of this kind of shear layer so this red color is the omega d this production turn total production turn for this uh picture that have some oscillation maybe due to initial condition effect but it's have this oscillation again the have this oscillation again that due to during reconnection time you have this strong uh increase of the energy production and from this curve that mostly come from this kind of omega s d omega uh s time it means that the stretching of the shear layer by this list the 3d illotification strain is the most important component to this kind of production turn all other terms are very small except maybe this kind of uh shear layer self-injection turn uh it has a low in the in the at beginning It has a low in the beginning, yeah. So, again, this also shows that the shear layer formation during reconnection is the most important, yeah. Not what has dipole we see, yeah. And then finally, we can look at the self-amplification term. This is dij, djk, dki term. Yeah, similarly, we can also decompose into three terms. Yeah, here we show here that uh for this, uh, these three terms that it also have a strong value at the during the connection, but it's mostly come from this kind of interaction of the electrational strain with. Kind of interaction of the electrational strain with the shear layer at the beginning, then later due to the elo strain, due to the stretching turn itself, this kind of electrational strain turn. So, from here that we see that this kind of decomposition may give some other some new insight on what has recognised process. Finally, that as a last part that is not ongoing work, that just want to discuss the coupling between psi and s. If you consider vertex line, then e3 is again the Then E3 is again the real eigenvector of the real eigenvalues. Then pi is the plane perpendicular to that plane. So we know that the least vorticity for that can be expressed in this equation that this is two psi plus gamma is a vorticity along that direction. This omega pi is a vorticity in that plane. So we can do some simplification, define eta as this one, they define S divide gamma as this turn. Based on diversion free of vorticity, we can get this equation. We can also We can get this equation. We can also get the evolution of eta, which is psi in that is somehow equivalent to psi and also evolution of gamma in that plane. So it's like that. So for eta to get maximum, we must have less than a greater than pi gradient in that plane of eta equal to zero. At the same time, that gamma will also become zero. So this is somehow the condition to extract a water core line. So that if you want to have a water core line, that you must That if you want to have a water score line, that you must have listed equations. Then, for that, I think that I can also show that the wattage equation can give you this form. Here, B is a deformation of surface deformation tensor. So, the idea is that since we have an equation for the vorticity, we may also can decouple the vorticity equation into two terms. One is psi turn, one is s turn. So, we may use this equation, use these two equations to study the evolution of psi and s, also the coupling between. And S, also the coupling between them, and also the interaction between this kind of beton with the discount sine and S turn. So, since this is still ongoing work, I don't want to give conclusion, but just give to outlooks. So, based on JD Wu's idea is that this LND decomposition can have laid the quantitative foundation for the separation of T into spin and also orbital rotation. And in the future, that may be interesting to study the coupling between psi and s and also the. Between psi and S, and also the interaction between the surface deformation tensor, list B. The final comment he wants to make is that because the two days ago that Professor Yue Yang proposed this kind of present this kind of water surface field method, surface field research, he said that there may be some connection between the water surface field and the strength surface field, at least S term. Yeah, these are some conclusions.
