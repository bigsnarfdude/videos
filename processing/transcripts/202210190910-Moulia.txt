We're going to change scale actually because we're going to talk about the control of shaping of plant axes and crowns and try to illustrate what could be a model-assisted top-down phenotyping. And there's a subtitle of this, which is a different view. It's the dimensionless numbers of plant shaping by tropic growth. So because 10 minutes is short, it's kind of an abstract of a review paper and position paper somehow. Paper and position paper somehow that we just published in phytologist. So, when the botanists look at the botanical architecture of crown, well, they actually characterizes the axes, like the branches and the phyllotaxi, what are the flowers, what are the secondary growth, but they came out that the major feature is tropism. And they define autotropic versus plagiotropic axis, and this changed the shape of the This change the shape of the axis and of the plant. So autotrophic means meet upward and plasotropic means outward. And so the question is what controls this shaping of orientation of each axis within a crown? And if you step back, you can also look at the crown shape itself when it's isolated freestanding plants. And you can recognize that there are specific, I mean each species has a defined crown shape. Defined crown shape. And there was these landscape architects, Italian ones, they kind of make the collection all the shapes. And so you can have all this catalogue, let's say. And so the question now is what control the shaping of the crown edge, which is the thing that you can see, just the edge at various stages. So geneticists also have a view on that. And so they find out many sets of genes, let's say, two of the major ones, TAC1 and The major ones are TAC1 and LAZ. So, this is illustrated here in Arabidopsis. Can you see my pointer? So, in the center, that is the wild type. So, they have both the protein TAC1 and LAC. On the left, there's a knockout for TAC1, and so you see upward. And on the right, it's a knockout for LAC, and it goes downward or outward. This is not only in RIBDOC, that's the interesting thing. For example, if I look at TAC1. For example, if I look at TAC1, so you can see in poplar, plum, and peach the exact effect of knocking out the effect of the gene. It's just the same, any change of the orientation of axis and crown shapes. So how this gene can control axis and crown shaping? Well, the genesis, they've done this type of scheme, let's take this type of scheme. It's very complex, it's quite complex, but you can see that here from this part, which is oxygen distribution growth response to the orientation, there's a line. Orientation: There's a lag, so I'm going to try to address this lag. So, my topic is first: what controls the shaping and orientation of each axis, then what controls the shaping of the crown edge, and then I will try to do something about how to control both the genetic control and the environmental plasticity of plant shaping, which is well known. So, let's start with the axis. So, everybody thinks of the light, but I'm going to start with the experiment and then I'll go to the model. Experiment and then I'll go to the model. So, but actually, if you want to separate all the effects, we've designed this growth cabinet, which is spherical with isotropic light. So, when the plant is growing inside, it doesn't find a cue to direct toward the light because the light is all the way the same. And if you look at this small poplar, then you can see the bends over in the primary growth zone, which find out a steady state. And then the secondary growth zone here is the woody part. The regrowth zone here with the woody part is going to also bend over with a different motor, slower, but both of them are going to react. Okay, so this is a typical gravitropism. So the gravity Q is actually the sensing we've worked a lot with Joel Fortaire on that. It's sensing on the status side. And there are these beads that Adrienne told you about. When you tilt, actually they go to a horizontal surface and the contact here activate oxygen transfer. Contact here activate oxygen transport, which is going to be lateral, right? So, this is gravitropism. But this is not enough. And I'm going to show you here on this experiment. So, it's the same sphere, but now we're going to have a Kleinostat. So, you're going to rotate the plants slowly after a while. So, when you, the rationale for that is that when you rotate things within the viscous fluid with beads, you suspend them. And because you suspend them, you also suspend the capacity for the plan. You also suspend the capacity for the plant to sense its orientation versus gravity. And here is the movie. So I concentrate here on the secondary growth zone, so the one which is woody, and you can see here what happens. So it's rotating with shots when it comes back to the same position. And you can see that it's straightened. It's strengthened back or straightened actually to a straight shape. So and the interest of this system is that you can track the more. Is that you can track the motor of it, which is reaction wood? So it's reaction wood is special wood that shrinks. So at the beginning, it's on top, so it shrinks to get to bend up. But then when you start the clinical stat, you can see here that it's actively shrinking down to get back to a straight position. So you have both gravitropies sensing, but you have also another sensing, which here cannot be explained by the length. Which here cannot be explained by the lengthening of the cell, like Veronica was explaining the other day, but really it's active sensing, and we call this properception. Well, the last element is obviously light, so we can investigate this like comparing the isotropic light with anisotropic light with different angles and monitor the behavior. So, this can be summarized in a phenomenological model. In a phenomenological model, which we call the ARC model. So, which states it's a bit the same like Adriano, at least it's the pioneer version of what Adriano explained to you. So, the rate of change of curvature at every special position and time is related to three items. The gravitropic component, which is related to the amount of angle toward the gravity with gravity sensitivity beta, a proprioceptive component, which is A proprioceptive component, which is related to the curvature with a gravity sensitivity, the proprioceptive sensitivity gamma, and the phototropic term, which is actually related to the angle at the tip versus the light and with the sensitivity nu. The interesting of this model, you can show that both the dynamics and the steady state is controlled only by two dimensionless numbers. The first one is the balance number. Is the balance number, it's b, so it's the ratio of the gravity sensitivity of the property sensitivity scaled to the size of the reacting zone, let's say. And the second one is the motion pointing number, M, which is the ratio between gravity sensitivity and photosensitivities. And with these two numbers, you know everything about the system. Of course, we assess that. We assess that on 13 species, simply the phylogeny of land angiosperm. Examples of the phylogeny of land angiosperm for the two first components and on four of them for the phototropic part. And you can see here an example of the theory and experiments for Poplar, I think. So combining experiment with ARC model, you can estimate B and M and you can do a quantitative phenotyping. I would like to give you more about view of what the type of shape can produce. Of shape that you can reduce. So, here you have the morphospace with the two numbers. So, this is the motion pointing number here in Y and the X is the balance number. And you can see it with different lighting direction. So, the first one on the left is a typical light elevation for a temperature country. And you can see all the different shapes you can get. And here on the right, it's the case where the axis is shaded somehow. The axis is shaded somehow on top, and so we see the light coming from below, like for example, inside in the side of this lake. And then you can see you can even have more of the shapes than before. So now we've done this. I will go to go to what happens when you consider now the wall crown and the crown edge. So to do that, we did a model which is a bit simpler. It's a crown front model. Oh, I'm missing here. I know if you see the Missing here. I don't know if you see the tip of my screen. Yes, probably yes. So, what it is idea is that the only thing that can change the edge shape is the growth of outgrowth of a flush of growth from an axis that is going outside of the edge. And so you can state that the front front, where the velocity is a vector of the velocity, is actually given by this U and it's redirected. It's redirected, it goes to the normal and redirected with two sensitivity to the vertical that is gravitropic and to the light, which is phototropic. And there's also a smoothing term, which is very interesting, but it's and I've no time to explain it. So we're playing here with the motion pointing number of the system, of the axis. And obviously we can compute the shade of this ground. And we did it for overcast sky. Did it for overcast sky, and here are the morphospace of this. And in green, there are the cases. So, this is the intensity of the phototropic response. This is the intensity or the sensitivity to gravitropic response. And you can see in green all the shapes that can produce with steady state. The other one have not converged. But you can see the large variability of shapes that can produce with just these two. Given the self-development, We given the self-shading by the crown. We try to fit this into various shapes. It works fine. It's not a full validation though, but it works fairly. So what control the tree, the shaping of trees by mechanical optical signals, while actually sensing position versus gravity, light, and the cell shape of the axis. So we have So we have dimensionless number. Sorry, I do have some problem here. I show you two of them: the balance number and the motion pointing. In the article, the paper, we explain that there is two others. One is the active weeping number. It's brand new. And the elastic sagging, which has been worked out by Mahadevan's group. What control the shaping of the crown edge, but just the same, actually, plus the crown feedbacks and the crown actually. Feedbacks and the crown actually is acting like a tropic droplet with global shade feedback through shade. So, to finish, you have this kind of system where you have both the environmental controls for physical signals like phototropism, gravitropism, elastic sagging, and this explains the shape plus plasticity. But then you can control the you can summarize more. Summarize the morphodynamic process driven by this signal in terms of different morphodynamics dimensionless number BM and the two others. So BMWE, if you want to remember all of them. And obviously, you can, this is much closer to the control by the gene because it's just no variation due to the environment. And we are currently trying to understand the irritability of this morphology dimensionless number with the study with TAS1, AZ, and other genes. The AS1, AZ, and other genes. So, this is an example, I think, of model-assisted quantitative phenotyping top-down. So, you're trying to get from the global phenomenology to the control by genes. So, these are the people who have been involved in all these works. Two of them are with you in Oaxaca, Joel Fortère and Christophe Elois. And I also mentioned two PhDs. And I also mentioned two PhDs, Ron de Bastien and Alexander Corlius, who have been very instrumental in what I've shown. And now are my questions. It's more a surprise, let's say. It surprises me that these top-down approaches from the phenotype or phenomenology we want to understand to the crucial mechanism is kind of less developed than could be, maybe, because the advantage is you can zoom in only on the relevant process scales and locations. And locations. And there are examples, like, for example, in continuum mechanics, the inclusion theory, where you consider inclusion of some microstructure, but just in a given place and range, and then feedbacks on the overall behavior. This is also done for canopy optics, but maybe it's worth doing considering more. And the second one is that it's surprisingly very few dimensional analysis, even in modeling. And that's surprising. I have a That's surprising. I have a colleague of mine, Felix Achmann, you may know, he's a computer scientist and a physicist with background. And I had to really fight for him to get his model with dimensionless number, and still we don't have it. And I think it's very useful, even for interdisciplinarity, because we can define both physical and biological dimensionless number. And with this, I'm happy to talk with you with the questions. Thank you. Thank you. We have time for one or two questions either on Zoom or in the room here. Yeah. So Bruno, like very nice talk. Thank you very much. I just wonder, I mean, like, like your model implies that the self-organization of branches in space, so the competition for branches in space, the sound. Do you hear me? Uh do you hear me? More or less or less if someone just can restate the question, I will be happy. So you say there yeah, so you suggest that self-organization of branches in space might be not important or not a leading principle in determining the overall shape of the tree crop. So, so yeah, I just want to make clear. So, this is the hypothesis that you're putting forward, essentially. Yes. Okay. Yes, okay. Easy question, easy, easy answer, but this is exactly this. Great. Christopher, maybe a complementary question. How would you, in the top-down approach, then you are modeling the development of the crown, and how would you feedback on any branching system that would be beyond? I mean, because if you want to go back to the final scales, you need to have a sort of communication between the crown and the branching system that is below. And the branching system that is below, how would you imagine that? Well, actually, there's you're right, and but in this case, we are just concentrating on the flush that goes out of the edge. So the idea was to show that it's possible then if you to get a simple front model. Then if you want to detail more, you can really specify the overall architecture of the axes and look how they The axis and look how they see the shade, and just play with the axis model I've shown before. It's possible, but it's more numerical and well, but it's possible. The only thing which is puzzling here is that actually what really matters is what each, but in this cron phone model, you don't have overall motion of the overall stem, so it could be that. The overall stem. So it could be that it's a bit more complex just at the edge. But yes, we could do that. All right. Well, let's thank Verdo one more time. Thank you so much.
