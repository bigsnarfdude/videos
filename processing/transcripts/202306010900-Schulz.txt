Everyone, for making it out this beautiful morning. Thanks to the organizers for this beautiful conference. It's really been a blast. I've learned a lot. I think we all have. And my apologies to the physics people in the audience. This is going to be a math talk. In fact, it's bad enough that we don't even really know how to think about this stuff in physics. So if you have any ideas, then maybe we should chat. So I want to talk about some aspects of Higgs panels that we haven't really seen yet in this conference. But I will try to make some context to some of the stuff that we have seen. To make some contact to some of the stuff that we have seen, but as is normal in these six-bundle talks, I will fix a compact Riemann surface. The compact you can take with a grain of salt. There's a version of this for parabolic bundles, but for simplicity, I will just do it this way. And I will take E over C, a rank and vector bundle. And really, I wanted to talk about the SLN case rather than. About the SLN case rather than GLN. So I will also say that it's the determinant bundle is trivial. We'll be just off degree zero. See. So let me start with an actual definition, which is that of a Lambda connection. So, lambda connection on E is a triple del bar E P and lambda, where so del Var E is just a Delvo operator. In other words, a complex structure on the Complex structure on the smooth vector bundle E. So the pair del Bar E and E is a holomorphic vector bundle. The second piece is, maybe I want to call this, we can switch the notation ever so slightly. Let me call them lambda, nabula lambda, and delber E. I think that's more standard. So lambda is just a complex number. And nabula lambda is a differential operator. We take zero forms on E. zero forms on E and spits out zero one forms on E and the conditions that they obey are the following so first as it's typical for these differential operators or maybe partial connections there should be some sort of like net rule so in this case if I take a section of my bundle and multiply it by a function if it was If it was an honest-to-god connection, I would expect it to look something like this. So it will not look like P, just del Bar. And this twisted Leibniz rule means that I will give one of these two pieces a factor of lambda. These two pieces are factor of lambda, and the other condition is just some coherence relation between these two types of differential operators, that the commutator is zero. Okay, so there's a homodulous space of these things. The equivalence relation is just the usual sort of complex gauge transformations. And there's some stability condition floating around that. I will just sweep under the rough. Nonetheless, I want to talk about this modular space. So, what is kind of structure does it have? It comes with a map. It comes with a map to the complex plane where you give me a pair of these guys, a triple of these guys, I guess. I will just forget about all of the interesting information in this remote of the lambda. Let's call that pi. And there's also a pi equivariant C star action. So some number, can you still read this one? So some number, can you still read this one right down here? I'm always sure because of the screens. Okay. Okay. You have the video. Yeah, very good. So I will scale the lambda. I will scale the second piece. And I will just do not. And I will just do nothing to the Del Part E piece. So then the interesting question is, what are the fibers of this map? So if lambda is equal to one, we can check these two conditions. Uh, two conditions. The first one, the this lambda is literally just one, so you're just reading um the condition of something being the zero, one part of a connection. So that means if I just define D to be the sum of these two pieces, this is now a connection. I think hang on, that will then do this in one screw, right? Yeah, yeah, I think I did this wrong. Sorry, thank you. All right, okay. Sorry, thank you. I realize this. That's it. No, thanks. Um, yes, sorry. So, this is the one-zero part of the connection. The delta E is already the zero one part. So, when I add them two up, I really get a usual connection. It has a zero, one part and a one, zero part. Delvar E acts on the total space of P, but what does it mean? What is a double operator? Yeah, what does it mean that it has? Yeah, what does it mean that it has a substrate? It's acting on the total space of E. That's just the notation. It is, you know, in the other days, we saw it as with people who wrote it as del bar A because they started with a connection and they just took the 0, 1 part of that. And they call that del bar A. I'm just calling it del bar E instead. It's just... What does it mean? Is it defined on the base of the bundle? No, it's a del Bo operator on E. On the total space of E. So it takes zero. It just take, for example, zero forms a map to zero, one. For example, zero forms are mapped to zero, one forms of E and with values in E. Okay, but it doesn't have a connection. So, if you so, like, let's look over here, right? Forget about all the Lambda business. Let's just look at Lambda equals one. I'm telling you, if I take the sum of these two guys and connection, this is the usual way. It's just that I'm working over Riemann surface. So, it makes sense to ask what is the 0, 1 part and what is the 1, 0 part of the connection. So, that's exactly what's going on. Does that make sense? So it's sort of we need we need just give me a section of E, I will spit out another section of E times like some DZ at least locally. That's where it looks like. Okay, so the first part says this is really just the one, zero part of a connection. So I can add them up and I get a connection because I already have the zero, one part. So what does the second part say? It says that this is actually. The second part say it says that this is actually a flat connection. In other words, the inverse image over the 5 by 1 you can identify with what people sometimes call the DeRAM modulus based on flat connections. And again, maybe here I should have said since I'm doing SLN, I really want the determinant line bundle of E to be trivial with this flat, with this holomorphic structure, but it's a technical detail. So when lambda's in C star, we can abuse our C star action that I just talked about. So if you give me a guy of this form, I can use. form, I can just multiply by lambda inverse, and that transports me directly into the fiber over one. In other words, there's sort of a canonical identification between pi inverse of lambda with the same modulus based of lead connections. So that leaves one fiber, the fiber over zero. The fiber over zero. So, what happens here is that this term drops out. And that's, of course, the term in the lightness rule that makes sure that a connection is not actually a tensor because it's not linear over functions. If it drops out, the sky becomes linear over functions, just an actual endomorphism. And so I can give it a new name. Let's call it phi. Call it phi, and then what does the second condition say? It says that this endomorphism phi is holomorphic with respect to the holomorphic structure delta E. And so that means it really is a holomorphic section of the endomorphism bundle of E, thought of as a holomorphic vector bundle. Except that it sort of is not just an endomorphism, but it's twisted by the canonic bundle. So it is twisted by Kc. Is twisted by Kc. Canonical bundle of the curve C. And so that's a little thing that we've seen a lot this week. It's really just a Higgs bundle. So the cartoon is that I have my complex lambda plane. I have a distinguished fiber zero over which I have the modulus space of Higgs bundles. And over all other fibers, particularly over one, for example, I have a different space, namely the modulus space of flat connections. So this is pretty natural if you're familiar with the twister construction, hypercalar geometry. The expanded modular space is hypercalor. This is just the twister space over C. This is just the twisted space over C rather than the whole P1. So that makes writing it down a little easier. But it's also, you could, people call it sometimes the Hodge modules space because it's a space that really shows you how anonymous Hodge is supposed to work, because it shows you how the modulus space of Higgs bundles really is a deformation of the modular space of flat connections. Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about the C-star action. So, on the modular space of Higgs panels, you're probably more familiar with it, the C-star action. The c-star action is really like the Morse flow of a perfect Morse function, the square of the norm of the Higgs field. And so that gives the modular space of Higgs bundles a nice stratification, unless the Morse stratification, right? Now we don't have a C star action on the modular space of flat connections, so we can't play the same game. But we don't have a Morse stratification, or we do have a stratification on the entirety of this vibration, and we can just restrict it to the And we can just restrict it to the individual fibers. So that also gives a stratification of the Modier space of blood connections. So let the Hodge moduli space, the C star fixed points, let them have connected components labeled by some label V alpha, V alpha at the components. W alpha. W alpha, I will call just the points WF was going to be the Going to be the upward flow. So, all of the points in the space that flow into a particular fixed point component. W0 or Wi alpha is going to be the intersection of this with the pre-image over the point I. So, really, I only care about zero and one, about the Higgs bin modular space and about the modular space of flat connections. And then I can refine this to W alpha of a particular fixed point. Um, of a particular fixed point, so the fixed point components, because of the C-stack for variance, necessarily lie in the factor of zero. So the Higgs bundles, so they're very particular kinds of Higgs bundles. I would just call them del bar E B is just all of the guys such that the limit as Zeta acts on these guys is the same as this. Okay, so instead of looking at the Okay, so instead of looking at the entire stratification, I look at the individual leaves of Lambda connections that flow into a particular Higgs bundle. So this is a particular variation of hot structure, particular fixed point, and then I can play the same game of looking at just the fibers over some point. So I have two stratifications of two spaces that I know are diffeomorphic through the Non-Bein Hodge correspondence, but these stratifications are quite different. So here it is the stratification, it comes from a perfect Morse function. So it is the Morse stratification. Here it is known as the partial OPES stratification. So that is where the title of my talk comes from. My talk comes from. And I think the first one to write this down was Carlos Simpson. So he has this thing called, so I think sometimes mostly people call it the foliation conjecture. And it says that the partial OPER stratification So that's the that's this one of the Dura moduli space is a smooth Lagrangian foliation with closed sleeves. So it's a conjecture, so you might think something must be hard about it. It's probably the hardest word in there, which might be word Lagrangian. But in fact, this one is known to be just true on very general grounds. I wanted to talk a little bit about the conjecture because I have absolutely no clue how to prove it. Clue how to prove it, um, but I'm not the only one, so um, let me do a few remarks. The first one is there is a version for parabolic bundles. There's not really so much different, it's also not so much complication, it's just a little harder to present because of the technical details of parabolic. Of the technical details behind parabolic bundles. So, you would ask why we want to talk about parabolic bundles if it's harder to talk about. The answer is because sometimes it's easier to do something with it because you can do things over P1, for example. So you can write down things more explicitly. Thus, the moduli spaces, you can construct moduli spaces that are smaller dimensional, right? Like you do the smallest dimensional moduli space for compact surfaces. You take a genus two-Riemann surface and SL2, and you get a space that has A space that has six complex dimensions, right? 12 real dimensions. Here you can do, for example, P1 minus four points. And that is a space of the minimal dimension, four real dimensions, since it's hypercalor. And this conjecture was proved by Frank Lauré, Snito, and Simpson. And Simpson. And then you could also do: okay, let's try P1 minus five points. So now it is of sort of two hypercale dimensions, eight real dimensions. And that was also done by GU, Pengfay 1. And it's just these two Marie Trumps. We'll see. And Ruhongzong. And that is really the state of the art. So, this happened only two years ago, I believe. And there's no other known cases where someone has actually proved this conjecture. So, what I tried to do in my thesis was focus on this last little piece. On this last little piece. So, how would you do something like that? Questions? This is how you define V sub-LF. So, V sub-Alpha is just the fixed point components of the connected components of the fixed point set. Under this story. Exactly, under the C-story. Exactly, under the C star actually, we have some fixed points. So, maybe I should also say that these limits always exist. So, like for exponents, you kind of know that that is true because of the properness of the hitchhiking map, but it's also true in this case. So, this is the twisted space of the Happaquella manifold. So, it naturally comes with some sections, right? And so, one of them comes from what's known as, we've seen this before. We've seen this before: the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence. So if delta E is stable, fully stable, then there exists a unique Hermitian metric. metric h such that um the following i will call it nabla zeta um maybe nabla twiddle zeta um i can take phi i can add zeta times uh dh and zeta squared times phi dagger h so now that i have a Hermitian metric I can take the adjunct of phi this guy here is the term This guy here is the Chern connection or the pair L bar E and H. So when I have a Holomorph vector bound with a Hemissy metric, there's a unique connection on there known as the term connection. So I can write down this thing that that's a connection and now I add some particular one forms to it. The whole thing is still a connection. The statement here is that this is a lambda zeta connection. For all zeta. So that is the same as saying that if I rescale it, this is a flat. But this is a flat connection. Or now, of course, in C rather than C. And so that's, we've seen, for example, in Andy's talk, he wrote on exactly the same formula, right? So these guys are really sections that sit inside a few. And these sections sort of explain to you how non-ABN hodge works. And it's a little more because if you think of this as a map from the fiber over zero, which is where you can start, to the fiber over one, where you just plug in zeta equals one in one of these two formulas, that means you get a map that takes the exponent, spits out an irreducible connection, and that is actually a diffeomorphism. Now, there's a another section that is sort of less well understood. Less well understood known as the conformal limit. So when I write down this family of lead connections, I haven't used the C star action at all yet. So I can intertwine it with the C star action. So let's write Nabla zeta r for some Higgs bundle phi as I did before by just taking by just taking R phi plus zeta del H R plus R Zeta squared V dagger H R. Okay, so I do the same thing over there, except I don't do it to the expandal del bar E phi. I do it to the exponential del bar E R times V, where R is a positive real number. So in the formula, the phi's both get an R. So in the formula, the fees both get an R, but I will also in general get a different emission metric, right? HR. And now I want to actually maybe look at the family flat connections rather than the Lambda connection. So I will write it like this. And I want to look at the limit. Am I doing this right? Yes, I want to fix the ratio of R and Zeta. So let me call that H bar zeta over R. So I get H bar inverse phi plus del HR plus R squared H bar phi dagger HR. And now I want to take R to zero. And it is a theorem that you can actually do that, and you get another finally flat connections in H-bar. So, sort of a theorem this limit exists. Limit exists and there's a gauge where it is what I wrote here, where del bar naught phi naught is the limit as theta goes to zero of del bar e Of del bar e b multiplied by zeta. So maybe the details don't matter so much, but the point is there's a second section of this. Once again, if you give me a stable Higgs bundle, I could cook up a family flat connections. And if I just rescale it, I can think of this as an H-bar connection. And so I get these two different sections, and they have very different nature. So the non- Very different nature. So, the non-Abian Hodge correspondence people love because it's a nice topological thing, right? It shows you how these two spaces are diffeomorphic to each other is a completely messed up thing if you want to think of it from the point of view of complex geometry. Nanobian, the conformal limit, it's exactly the opposite. It is not a smooth, it's not a continuous map, even. So, from a perspective of just algebraic topology or differential topology, it's nasty, but it has a nice. Nasty, but it has a nice feature in the realm of complex algebraic geometry. So, what is so nice about it? So, let me call this limit the H-bar conformal limit of the Higgs bomb that I started off with. So maybe I should finally say some names. So this is a theorem of Dmitresko, Fredrikson, Kirunakis, Matseo, Mulase, and Andy Naitsky. Made a habit of not writing of writing only the names of those people in the audience because it's too many people otherwise. Otherwise. And then there's also Colier-Wentworth. So the theorem says that the conformal limit, when you take just Higgs paths that flow into a particular fixed point, it will give you the Higgs points in the other fiber that flow into that same fixed point. Other fiber that flows into that same fixed point. But not in a very arbitrary way, but in a biholomorphic fashion. So these individual leaves are complex sub-manifolds in either the complex structure coming from the modern space of Higgs panels or the complex structure coming from Modier space of flat connections. And the conformal limit for some H bar sort of remembers the structure. So you have a stratification of the space. So, you have a stratification of a space. You take all the individual leaves, you rip them apart, you carry them somewhere else, and put them back together and form a completely new space in a nice and smooth fashion. That's kind of a really messed up thing to wrap your head around. But that is what the conformal limit does. What's the motivation for that age for the interpretation? Could I have asked why it would work? The could have asked why we call it the conformal limit. I call it the conformal limit because I don't want to disagree with Gayoto, who was the first one to call it the conformal limit. But it is, I think, it is motivated from a construction in thermodynamics. So the conformal limit isn't in thermodynamics. But I don't know if anyone else has something more to say. I mean, it looks like it's a good idea. I mean, I don't think I have anything very sharp to say. It is true, though, that these stratific, I mean, in a way, it interpolates between sort of the, I mean, here you can maybe see something quantum versus classical because it talks about something, just the more stratification that we know, something that sort of has some quantum nature with the opers, because when you want to do quantization of Higgins systems, these are very interesting objects. Hitchin systems, these are very interesting objects to study. So, for example, the minimal dimensional stratum and the stratification is the hitching section, right? So, we've seen it a few times. It is identified with a space of opers, so like just a half-dimensional space inside the modular space of flat connections. But I wouldn't say that this thing in sorry, Steve. No, maybe a maybe simple version of the question: when H bar goes to zero, does anything become commutative at? So let's see when H bar goes to zero, that's like fixing arbitrage zeta to zero. Yeah, I'm not sure. Andy. There is something that people often say about this, which is they say that the over that you see a finite value of h-bar is kind of like. A finite value of h-bar is kind of like quantization of the spectral curve of the first biometric. So, like you write a heat funnel, right? That you know, think of it in coordinates. It says some function of x and y is zero. And then, if you would replace the y by h bar times d by dx, then you see some differential. And more or less this open is like a global version of that. What I said sounded very coordinate dependent, so it doesn't sound obvious that it would actually make global sense, but the statement is. But the statement is it does make a little sense. So, in that sense, it is kind of optimization. Yeah, that's a much better answer. Okay, so let's get back to business. So, I wanted to convince you that it's plausible that these leaves are closed subsets. You could have asked me earlier, why are you talking only about the stratification here, not about the stratification? Talking only about the stratification here, not about this stratification. And you know the answer: it's either that this stuff is obviously right or it's obviously wrong. Right when I when I phrase the conjecture, I only said it about the stratification of the Mojo space of flat connection, not about the one on Higgs bundles. So what happens for Higgs bundles, right? The cartoon of Higgs of the Moirier space of Higgs bundles is that you have a vibration by Hybrid by sort of special Lagrangian, by some compact, complex tori. And there's a divisor over which they degenerate. And then those divisors meet, and all of these divisors intersect, and there's a single point where they all intersect, and you have sort of maximum nastiness called the Nilipoten cone. So, for the case of a four-punctured P1, one can actually draw this comic, and then the pollen cone looks like this. And then you ask me: so, where do I see the fixed points? And the answer is, and if you in with certain conventions, the fixed points is the central guy, this, this, and this. So, one point on each of the outer P ones, one or two points, if you count these guys. Count these guys and the central P1. So it's an affine D4 of P1s, this configuration, and all the green stuff is the fixed points. And so that means if you take a nil-potent Higgs barn, that's like right here, and you scale it, you can scale it in both directions. You can scale it down and you flow into this entropy one, or you flow it upwards and you flow into this point up here. But in particular, the leaf for this guy right here then cannot be closed right. Then it cannot be closed, right? Because I can go as far up as I want, but I cannot never reach this guy up here. So, on the modular space of fixed bundles, this conjecture is wrong. But I've already showed you everything that's wrong with it. The only problem is exactly the existence of these wobbly bundles, as we've learned. Wobbly bundles are exactly these Higgs bundles, these fixed points that emit Higgs bundles that flow upwards inside the nilpotent cone. So, if you have a very stable bundle. If you have a very stable bundle, then the then and this, so that means there's nothing flowing upwards, then um then the leaf is perfectly closed. So nilport and Hicks panels really are the problem with this on the Moier space of Higgs panels. So what about the Moier space of flat connections? Well here I want to do how much time do I have left? Nice. So I want to abuse something that goes by the name of WKB method. So let's fix a curve like a real curve on my complex curve, gamma. I'm in SL2, so that means if I pull back a Higgs bundle, this will has two eigenvalues. Plus minus U of T dt I will call the demise called WKB curve if the real part of mu of t is larger than zero volts. Is larger than 0, 4. Okay, so that's some smooth family, this mu, just a smooth map from 0, 1 into the complex plane. After I do the appropriate trivializations, and I demand that the real part of this function is positive. And if that is true, I will call this a WKB curve. In that case? In that case, or in any case, really, I can always define the number z gamma as just the integral along gamma. We should write the integral along 0, 1 of this quantity gamma star mu dt. I guess I don't need the gamma star once I write it like this. And if I have a WKB curve, then of course this sits inside of the complex plane where the real part is positive. So in the right half plane. So a theorem of Mochizuki from I think two years ago by now states that if gamma is a WKB loop, If gamma is a WKB loop, so far I've only talked about curve, means I didn't demand that it closes up. Now I'm talking about an actual loop, cycle. If it is a WKB loop, then what can I do? I can take the holonomy around gamma of this family of flat connections, let's say Nabla of Zeta. I can take its trace and Trace and I can take the limit as zeta goes to zero and his theorem is that this grows exponentially in zeta inverse so it's exponential of zeta minus zeta inverse C gamma if the is not going to potentially. Uh, phi is not not potent. I shouldn't really have to say this last part, but I want to say it anyways. Of course, if phi is not potent, then these mus are zero and you can never find a WKB curve to begin with. But I wanted to write it anyways to make for the following reasons. If V is not an a potential If he is not an a potent, then there exists homology classes admitting WKB representatives. So that is to say, don't worry so much about this, whatever WKB means in this case. I'm saying as long as your Higgs speed is not nil potent, I can always find some loop that's a WKB loop and I can use this theorem for whatever advantage I want. And the second point is you should worry even less about what that means because it is expected. Um that this is true holds for any loop. And when I say it holds for any loop, that means there exists some constancy gamma that is not defined in this way, but there's some constancy gamma that is again of positive. Gamma, that is again of positive real part such that the same thing is true. So that will be called the exact WKB method, and it's just something that no one has proved yet, but it is expected to be true. Okay, so how does this help me? It helps me the following way. If I take a leaf in the Higgs bundle modulus space that does not contain a nilpotent Higgs let me call it delta. Let me call it delbar zero and phi zero. So of course it contains the point delbar zero and phi zero. So other than this one point I wanted to not contain the bot next panels, then the leaf and the MySpace of the RAM connections of the RAM MySpace of LAD connections is closed. Okay, so as far as I know, I guess so what you prove such a statement. So I want to use the two facts that I've told you. I want to use the fact that I can use this identification for the conformal limit, and I want to use the WKB method. So the proof strategy is roughly as follows. Wait, what do I have to show? I want to show that if I so this leaf of just a copy of C to the n, and I want to say if I go out to infinity in some direction c to the n, then there's no limiting point. When I go out to infinity, I cannot run into an unstoke flat connection. Okay, so the first thing is to say if I go out to infinity in this leaf, then In this leaf, then I can do this via the conformer limit where I take this parameter h bar to zero for some deliver E P. Okay, so if you give a Higgs span like So, if you give me Higgs ban, I get this conformance connections. I can just take the h-bar parameter to zero, and this thing blows up when I go up to infinity in my leaf. I'm saying that any way that I can go up to infinity, I can do in this particular way. But once I know that, I have a family of head connections, and I can use this deer of Mochizuki. That says that I can find there is a loop gamma such that if I take the trace of the holonomy around gamma of the stamily of that connections, this goes like exponential of h bar in. Exponential of h bar inverse z gamma. Particular goes off to infinity as I scale my parameter h bar and take it to zero. Okay, well if the trace of the holonomy blows up as I go off to infinity, then sure enough, I cannot run into an honest flat connection. Okay, so what's left? What's left is, of course, that there are leaves that have no mixed bundles. So, um So then let me think a little bit about Nilport and WKD. So let me just talk about the case. Where I do SL2. Well, I guess I've already done only SL2 here. So this, all of this, no problem to do this in SLN. It's just a little annoying to like write down exactly what. So this theorem doesn't actually exist. So, this theorem doesn't actually exist, so someone had to actually sit down and prove this in more generality. Um, it would also be a little more annoying to say exactly what a WKB curve is and all of this, but in principle, this should be possible, but no one's done it. Um, then the potential WKB, let me also just do it for SL2 to begin with. Then, as we learned from Christian yesterday, or maybe the day before, the Higgs field that I want to consider is. That I want to consider is one that is important but non-zero. And so it gives a filtration of my bundle by just the kernels. So I can call K the kernel of V and I can take L to be the orthogonal complement with respect to the harmonic metric of the explicit H. So my bundle E splits In a C infinity way as the sum of two line bundles, my Higgs field phi looks something like this. And the associated Dolbo operator will have Dolbo operators on these line bundles. But K being the kernel of V is actually a holomorphic sub-bundle. So that means. Sub-bundle. So that means the Delbo operator is also upper triangular. It has some guy here, nothing else. And similarly, V dagger H, maybe I should get this guy name to call this guy alpha. So this guy will be like 00 alpha twiddle, something that you can compute from the harmonic metric. And here, del bar E. here del bar e del e will look like del k del l zero and some beta two effectively this is the adjoint of this and this is like minus the adjoint or something so when i write down for example the family of flat connections in a bazeta The family of flat connections now zeta looks like this, right? It's zeta inverse the Higgs field plus the churn connection, which is just the sum of these two pieces. Plus the add-on of the Higgs field times. Times theta. And now you can make it a cheeky gates transformation. A cheeky gates transformation that depends on zeta. And it should look like zeta to the minus one quarter, zeta to the one quarter, I think. Yeah, so. Yeah, so I take my two line bounds and I scale them against one another. Okay, what does that have? I scale one by a factor of zeta minus one quarter and the other by a factor of zeta to the one-quarter. And the guys that go from the second to the first will be scaled by a factor of zeta to the one-half. And so with the scattr transformation, this looks like this: zeta to the minus one half, zero, alpha, zero, zero. Okay. Nothing happens on the diagonal, so these guys just stay what they are. But this guy also gets gay by a factor of zeta to the one-half, so let's write him here. And that leaves two guys, that leaves two, these two, since these are scaled by a factor of zeta to the one-half, for the same reason these will be scaled by a factor of zeta to the minus. Reason this will escape by a factor of zeta to the minus one-half. In other words, this guy will have the same sort of behavior as the alpha, and this guy will go over here. Okay, so far so good. So, of course, I wanted to do this cheeky trick to use a nilpot Hicks panel and somehow cook up something that looks like a Higginix panel that's not Nilpon. Something that looks like a Hignik span, that's not nilpotent anymore. So I'm in the game if this guy is not nilpotent. So alpha cannot be zero since I just demanded that phi wouldn't be zero. So the question is, when is beta twiddle not zero? And that's just a general fact. The beta twiddle is zero if and only if del bar E and phi is in Is in the fixed point set of the C star action. Right? And sort of a general fact with the C star actions, there's this thing called the C, the Ries construction, which says that fixed points of this direction are graded objects in the appropriate sense. Sure enough, if the beta twiddle and therefore the beta are zero, then this decomposition is not just a C infinity splitting anymore, but it's actually a holomorphic decomposition. And these fixed points of And these fixed points of the z direction really are those that are sums of holomorphic vector bundles, where the Higgs features goes from one vector to the other. General Nilbotton Higgs bundles won't have that property. This filtration that I get when I take the associated graded, or like when I do this construction the way I describe it here, will not be a holomorphic splitting, just a C-infinity splitting. Okay, and so if the bar E Double E So if Delbar E I want to write this well, let me stop right here. So this one I will call So this one I will call del bar E twiddle plus del e twiddle so del bar twiddle e and this guy will call capital phi phi is a stable Higgs bundle. A stable Higgs bundle if WE phi is a stable X bundle. Okay, so I'm really back in the X bundle world. I have a strings construction by which I start with some important Higgs bundle and I cook up. I cook up a different Higgs bundle and it's again stable. The second factors, basically, for the reason that I statement here, Delbar E will phi is nilpotent if and only if the original Hicks bundle delta E phi is a C star fixed point. C stuff explained. And thirdly, if delta E phi is not a fixed point, then there exists. A loop gamma and a constant Z gamma in the again the right half plane. So a constant with positive report such that limit, as I take zeta to zero, of the trace of the holonomy around gamma. holonomy around gamma of Nabla of Zeta grows exactly like the exponential of zeta inverse z gamma and now we screwed up the most important part zeta to the minus one half z gamma okay so that's what I call in the WKP and then sometimes some Sometimes someone Alexander Thomas has called it rational WKB because of these rational powers here. Okay, so let me wrap it up in words. You can do all of this business for vector bundles of higher rank, like SL and Higgs bundles. I also did the parabolic version of this. All of this is fine. The real issue is that all of the stuff that I presented in this last Newport W. Presented in this last Nipoten WKB business was only about the twister family in Ablazeta. Really, I would have wished to do it to the family of conformal limits, right? Because I only went to the stronghold in order to prove these statements, these conjectures of Simpson. So what's the difference? The difference is that the little piece beta twiddle that I would feed it to make it a non-important Hicks bundle doesn't come anymore from just the one zero. The one zero piece of the churn connection for the original Hicks bundle, but it comes from that piece for the fixed point. So I would have to be able to sort of solve Hittege's equations and get the handle on a certain component of the fixed point that a Hitting spannel flows into. And that's really hard because I can't solve figures equations. And for that reason, this procedure hasn't worked yet. This procedure hasn't worked yet. So, under the assumption that a particular piece of the churn connection at the fixed point that a Higgs panel flows into is non-zero, the same procedure applies and this closed leaf conjecture is true, but that's a very abstract sort of condition and I don't really know what to do about it. So, yeah, thank you for your attention. Are there any questions? I just need a little review in this example to understand the motivation of what you did. You started with a no potent bundle. Yeah. So I start with a no potent bundle and then comes with the frustration. And then it comes with the filtration, I turn it into something graded, but not in a holomorphic sense, just in a C infinity sense. So I'm an SL2, so it has a kernel, and I just take some line bundle complement. You may as well take the one that is orthogonal with respect to the harmonic metric, but you could take any line bundle or anything that follows. If you do that, then you can write down the Higgs bundle and just these coordinates and the splitting, as well as the holomorphic structure. And if you do it with H, then it's very easy to just write. If you do it with H, then it's very easy to just write down the other two pieces that you need in order to write down this family. Okay, now I have this family of that connections with this parameter zeta, and I somehow want to make it look like a family of that connections where the leading part is not important anymore. And so the way that I did it is I did this gauge transformation in order to sort of pull this guy and this guy together that they grow with the same power. And so that is just terms of some numbers. And then you have a new. Numbers. And then you have a new family where now the leading order term cannot be zeta inverse anymore. It is some sub-leading thing, and it looks exactly like this. Okay. And then you ask, okay, so now you have something non-milpotent. And that's true under the condition that beta twiddle is non-zero. That's something very concrete for a Higgs bundle person. It just means that the Higgs bundle started off with is not a fixed point. That's fine because you wouldn't really expect that you can just abuse the C-star. You can just abuse the C star action to do something if you started with a fixed point, because of course nothing will happen. Okay, and so that's the theorem. As long as you don't take a fixed point, you get a stable Higgs one that is not nilpotent anymore. But why did you want that to get something not nilpotent? Well, first and foremost, you could ask, what happens to this quantity or some family of that connection where the leading part is a nilpotent Higgs part of it? And the answer is, well, you shouldn't really expect anything to begin. So, you shouldn't really expect anything to begin with because, for example, the quantity that I gave here was the integral over the eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues are just zero if you have an important Higgs banner. So it's completely unclear how this should behave. So if you want to know how this behaves, the way that I did it is I related it to a different Higgs banner that is not an important anymore. And so then you can determine the asymptotics of amyloids of that connections of this type. Ultimately, I wanted to use this in order to prove these closed leaves conjectures. In order to prove these closed leaves conjectures. But the procedure that I used here doesn't really work well for any family flat connections because you would have to say individually every time what are the pieces in this entire business. Particularly, what is this beta twiddle? And for the conformal limit, I don't have a good handle on whether this guy is zero or not. For the family that I wrote here, I know it. The condition is exactly this one. But in the conformal limit family, this would come from something somewhere else, and I would have to sort of complicated PDE. To sort of complicated PDE in order to check if it's zero or not. Thanks. Yep. Are there other questions? So if not, with thanks, Sebastian, again.
