My dissertation chapters. I'll be discussing the rotation of anisotropic particles in turbulence, specifically flat particles. And I know it says tumbling and spinning in the title, but I'm going to focus more on tumbling for this talk. So this research was done in collaboration with Gauthier, who's here in Marseille, and it was done while I was at UC Berkeley. Where's my next slide? There we go. Okay, so I'm going to start by giving a little bit of background and motivation. Michelle did a great job kind of giving the big overview of why we care about this plastic transport, but I'm going to give a little bit of background and a refresher of the different types of turbulence that I will be speaking about. Then I'm going to look at how the turbulence that I have influences the part. Have influences the particle motion and briefly touch on some questions that I did not get a chance to answer in this project, but I'm hoping to do so with future projects. So as Michelle said, plastic pollution is ubiquitous and particle transport and turbulence is an open question. So here's kind of like this big picture overview of where people have found a lot of different plastics in the ocean. The ocean. And the sizes that I'll be talking about are a little bit bigger than what Michelle mentioned. So, while she was looking at stuff smaller than five millimeters, five millimeters is going to be the smallest size that I'll talk about. And I'll look at like five to 20 millimeters. So a little bit of turbulence review. Turbulence is a chaotic flow with universal properties. With universal properties. So it's rarely homogeneous or isotropic. It's normally superimposed on some sort of background flow. So here we have the multi-scale chaos of turbulence that is superimposed on top of the geometry of this original flow. And this is normally what you see when you see something, when you see different types of turbulence. But to simplify things a little bit, Things a little bit, I'm going to be using these special types of laboratory equipment to make homogeneous isotropic turbulence. So, in this, it won't matter which direction you're looking in or which direction you're moving in. The turbulence is going to be all the same for the measurement volume that I'm looking at. And I'm going to discuss a little bit about one of the tanks that I use. So, this is the turbulence tank that I'll be using. The turbulence tank that I'll be using for these experiments that I'll be talking about throughout the talk. I also want to refresh people on the different turbulent length scales. So here we kind of have the generic turbulent energy cascade with our high energy on this, our energy plotted on this vertical axis and our size plotted on this horizontal axis. Horizontal axis. And we have a couple of different size scales that I'm going to highlight. So, if we take this picture over here on the right as kind of a generic turbulence with different sized eddies and different strain rates in there, we can look first at these large scale eddies. So, I like to imagine myself as being, as the particle that's being transported. As the particle that's being transported. And so, what I think, if I am larger than this biggest scale eddy, that I'm going to feel the turbulence is this kind of random noise. So, imagine that you were walking down the street and somebody was kind of poking you. Your trajectory isn't going to change very much, but you're still going to feel kind of this poking that's happening. So, that's why we think about these kind of largest scale eddies where. Largest scale eddies where really the energy is like input into the system. Then at the small end, we have these smaller eddies. And so particles that are smaller than the smaller size can be considered passive tracers of the flow. So for example, if you were kind of walking down the street, but you were and somebody came by and like tackled you and picked you up and ran off with you. And ran off with you, your path would then be the path that they're taking you on. Um, and the path that, like, somebody else takes you on is what dominates your emotion. So that's how I like to think about passive tracers of the flow. But I'm working in this intermediate region. So in this region, the particles that I'm looking at are on the same size scale as this Taylor micro scale of the flow that I'm studying. And so it's different. I'm studying. And so it's difficult to model these particles numerically both because they are anisotropic, so they're not spherical, they're not kind of these circles or cylinders. So you have to take into account the differences in the shapes. But also because on this scale, you have kind of the flow of the effects of the flow are on the same size scale as the inertia of the particles. So you have to kind of balance both of those out. To kind of balance both of those out, which makes it just computationally intensive. So, because of these things, because I'm working in turbulence and because of the scale that I'm working at, this project will mostly be done by doing experiments. And that's how I'm going to answer these questions of how do these anisotropic flat particles, how does their behavior change as you change the shape and the turbulent forcing? The turbulent forcing. So, for the bulk of the talk, here's the particle rotation part. I have these five different neutrally buoyant flat particles that I tested. So, here, this is on my hand. This is a picture of the five different particles I tested. I have three different sized triangles, the small, medium, and large. So, the small is over on the left. So, the small is over on the left, and the large is on the right. And then, in this medium section, I have three different shapes. So, I have a medium triangle, a medium square, and a medium hexagon. And here's a little preview of kind of what this looks like. This is very slowed down, but this is what these large triangles look like in a really slow way when we put them in our turbulence tank. Our turbulence take. So, here again, the size ranges that I'm looking at also. So, this d equals five millimeters is the diameter of the circle that the triangle was drawn inside of. So, I'm changing the diameters from five to 20 millimeters, but the thickness changes, it scales with the diameter, so the aspect ratio of all of these particles is the same. So, maybe we change. The same. So maybe we change the shape, but not, or the size, but not the aspect ratio. So the setup of our tank kind of from above looks like this. We'll have these motors on each corner of the tank. And then we have lights that are cameras that are perpendicular to each other and light panels behind the Other and light panels behind the cameras so that the particle motion is backlit. So, if we look at this from the side, we have our three cameras, we have the light panels across from them, and then we have we'll have the motors, which aren't drawn on the second image. And to create our homogeneous isotropic turbulence, we take these motors and we turn them in opposite. We turn them in opposite directions. So, for all of the turbulence that I created, the motors were forced at the same frequency, but the direction that they turned in was opposite to their nearest neighbor. Here is a little picture of some of the images that we collected. So, here we have camera two, which would be over here on the left. Camera two, which would be over here on the left, camera one, which is over here on the right, and then camera three, which is from underneath. And this is like an example set of one of the images that we would have gotten. And so what I did to try to figure out how these particle, how this particle motion was changing over time is the first thing we had to do was identify where the particle was in 3D space to reconstruct its orientation. Its orientation. So, if we take this particle right here, we can project the particle location onto the other images. So, this is what the points of that triangle would look like. We can project again onto the camera three. So, we would have done this for all the pairs. We would also have projected camera two onto three as well. And so, when we did that, we could figure out, okay, these, this one part of Okay, these one particle in camera two could match this same particle in this location on cameras one and three, and then we could reconstruct what happens in where that particle is located in 3D space and what its orientation is. However, sometimes we have conflicts. For example, here we can see that there's another particle that could match with camera one and camera three. This particle is in the same line. This particle is in the same line and it matches over here on camera two as well. So, what we would do is we would say we only have one particle on camera three, but it could match two different particles on camera one and camera two. We would reconstruct using both possibilities and then try to figure out which reconstruction has the least amount of error. And when we take kind of our 3D reconstructed particle, we can take its orientation and project it back onto these planes that we. To these planes that we got from our cameras and figure out which projection matches best what we actually saw with the cameras. So that's how we would deal with kind of these overlapping issues like that. So after we identified the particles, we had to link them to a trajectory. But before I go through this trajectory linking, I want to give a quick look at what these reconstructed particles actually look like. Particles actually look like the so here, let's see the little play. There we go. Okay, so here on this bottom right is our 3D reconstructed particle. And it doesn't look like it's moving because we've cropped the images so that we're following the particle. Particle and the red dots are our like reconstructed particle that we've projected back onto these flat planes. And the blue here are the actual images that we took of the different squares. So you can see sometimes this is before I've done any of the kind of post-processing filtering. And so this code does a fairly good job of kind of following this particle. This particle along its path. Okay, to get to the particle trajectories, we link them together using the nearest neighbor method. And so for those who don't know what this nearest neighbor method is, we basically take a current trajectory path that we have. And then we look at all of the particles that are. Of the particles that are identified in the next time step. So here, let's say that this black dot ends at frame N, and that all of these blue particles over here are everything that has been identified or reconstructed in 3D space in the frames n plus 1. And so, what we did here is we created a search volume saying that particles couldn't have moved. Particles couldn't have moved more than a given number of pixels in a certain amount of time. And we, and within that search volume, we found, oh, I don't know why that moved to the middle, we found which particle was closest to kind of the trajectory path beforehand, and we added that to the trajectory path. So there are several different ways of doing this. You can look at particle acceleration and say And say that maybe it would have been a particle like over here because of the space that we had. But what we did is we just said that the nearest neighbor worked for us because after linking to the trajectories, we did some other filtering to kind of smooth out any of anything that would happen by kind of using this particle instead of this one or this one. So, computationally, it was the best choice for us. So after we got our particle trajectories, we could look at the particle orientation and then decompose the particle orientation into tumbling and spinning. So in order to actually get the tumbling and spinning, we had to look at the difference in the particle orientation between two frames. So we needed those particles to kind of already be on that trajectory. Particles to kind of already be on that trajectory. So, here this is, for example, one of the particles that we have, and we define spinning as the rotation around the particle z-axis. And that, so this would be spinning here, and this is also the axis of symmetry for the particles that we have. So, here kind of is an outline of the circle that we would have used, and we drew those triangles in. We drew those triangles inside of this circle. And that is, and so the axis that is normal to kind of this flat plane, that would be our symmetry axis. These two other components, the axes along the plane, both contribute to the particles tumbling. So we have two different axes around which the Two different axes around which the particles can tumble, and one axis around which the particle can spin. So, we took this particle that I have over here on the left as kind of our reference particle. So, we said we know where this particle is located, we know and we know what its orientation is because we've defined it, and then we can do a mapping to get from our reference particle to our particle of interest. So, say over here on the right is what we've calculated. Calculated from the pictures that we took. So we can map the particle, the reference particle from the left onto the particle from the right. And from doing that mapping, we can figure out what is the total change in rotation that we've gotten and then decompose that into the tumbling and spinning components. So here's kind of our general rotation matrix and our rotation matrix is composed of the tumbling and spinning parts. So I haven't gone through the math. So, I haven't gone through the math here to show how we can break those down. But when we take that mapping, that reference particle and map it onto our particle of interest, we end up with our rotation matrix, which we then can figure out how does this, how do the tumbling and spinning components of this matrix change over time to get our tumbling and spinning rates. Okay, so once we want to talk. Once we, I want to talk a little bit more about some of the filtering that we did to smooth out some of the trajectories that we made. So once we figured out what these actual particle orientations were, we could look at the evolution of the particle orientation in time. So here on the left is the particle X vector, and on the right is the Z vector. So for example, again, So for example, again, this one is the Z vector, which is over here on this right side. And that's when the X vector is along here on the particle vertex, and that's on the left side. So here we can see that this Z vector, which the evolution of this kind of represents spinning, the raw data is much smoother than for the X vector. And this is because we didn't look at the previous trajectory or the previous. Previous trajectory or the previous orientation along the trajectory when we calculated particle orientation. We just said at a given time step, what is the orientation when we're mapping from our reference to the particle of interest? And again, here we could do px or py so that we could map along two different axes for the template. This is kind of why we have so many like high and low values here because the particle is basically. Low values here because the particle is basically flipping back and forth. And so, what we did in this second layer here, the second row, is that we flipped the particle orientation. And so we matched the particle orientation to its previous timeframe. So, here, this is actually what you would expect if you use the previous timeframe for the trajectories to look like. And then, after that, we did some smoothing to make sure that we. that we did some smoothing to make sure that we could take the we could like reasonably take the time derivatives um of the part of the particle orientation to get our tumbling and our spinning rates okay so next after we had our tumbling and our spinning rates we had to plot those Had to plot those. So, here this is the tumbling rate normalized by the Komograph time. So, it's kind of the evolution of both of those p vectors and x vectors. And on the bottom, we have the radius of the circle that the particle was drawn inside of, normalized by the Kolmogorov time scale, or sorry, the Kolmogorov size scale. Size scale. And then we have here the data that we collected. And so the triangle symbols are triangles, the square symbols are squares, and the circle symbols are hexagons. And then the blue would be the small sizes, the red is the medium sizes, and the yellow is the large sizes here. And I also plotted some data from Nimish's 2017 paper. Nimish's 2017 paper of these inertialist disks to compare to the data that I have. So I'll go through a different a couple of different components of this graph. So first, I just want to show that like the data that we had collapsed here. So we have that our tumbling rate when it's normalized by the Kolmogorov time and when our size is normalized by the Kolmogorov scale. We actually did get that the data collapsed, even though these. The data collapsed, even though these particles are bigger than those chromograph scales. We also got this minus four-thirds power law scaling, which is from the Parson and Both paper in 2014. So they did this, they showed this scaling for small particles, and then they also showed it for particles that are inside of the inertial subrange. And so this says that. And so this says that the motion of these particles is related to eddies that are on the same size scale of the particles. And so this is, we have, we have this minus four-thirds law. So we know that the motion of these different shapes is relevant to kind of the eddies on the same size scale as the shapes. And then we also have this plateau here. Here. So, or we have this part where these meet. And so this purple plus over here is inside of the viscous dissipative region of the flow. And so we would expect some plateau to happen when that assumption can no longer be used. So we see here that it's kind of going towards this plateau region. So somewhere along, you know, I think here it's like. You know, I think here it's like somewhere like seven or something, but along order 10, 10 times the Comogorov size is where you would expect to not be able to use some of the viscous approximations. So we can see that happening with these tumbling rates as well. And so our spinning rates followed a similar trend, but I don't have the plots here for this presentation. And overall, our spinning rates were And overall, our spinning rates were slightly lower than our tumbling rates, which was also kind of expected for poor disks or for flat particles that are similar to disks. Okay, and then I want to go through a little bit about some of the preferential orientation work that we did. So here we looked at whether or not Whether or not we had a preferential orientation between the tumbling rate vector and the particle x vector. So here again, this is kind of this vector again that we're looking at. So did this vector along the particle's surface and the tumbling rate vector, what is the angle between those two? And does that angle show any sort of preferential orientation? Show any sort of preferential orientation. And so here in the black, we have what would happen if you assumed a random orientation of the particle in the flow. And then on top of all of this are all of the different sizes and shapes particles that we had. So here we get pretty good agreement that the orientation of these particles. Of these particles, that they don't have a preferential orientation. At least their tumbling vector doesn't have a preferential orientation. So the particle isn't preferentially tumbling over either the vertex or one of the sides. Okay, and in the last few minutes, I'll just go over some of the, I'll conclude with some of the findings that we have. So overall, we saw that the Overall, we saw that the particles didn't show a preferential orientation. Their angles aligned well with the random orientation prediction. The particles we saw followed a minus four-thirds power law scaling. So the particles rotated on eddies that were, they were aligned by eddies on the same size scale as them. So at this point, Them. So at this point, we saw that their size mattered more than their shape because of that collapse on shape. And then the findings that we have for these flat particles agreed with what we've seen for fibers and what we've seen for cuboids as well. Alan, there are just a couple of questions that I didn't address so far in this study. So far in this study. And so, you know, particle, so we have these different types of particle transport. But one of the predictions that I wanted to look at, and that hopefully, you know, I'll be able to learn more about this week is kind of where do these particles eventually settle out of the flow. So how does the different shapes of the particles influence where they're transported and where they end up? And then I also wanted to look at the intermittency. Wanted to look at the intermittency because you know turbulence is a highly intermittent phenomena. And from the data that we collected and the way that it's been analyzed so far, we haven't been able to determine how much the intermittency of the flow impacted the particle kinematics. Okay, and in the end, I just want to acknowledge my two advisors, Gautier and Evan, who helped me. Gotier and Evan, who helped me with this project, and the Shateau Brown Fellowship, who funded the work. So, thank you, and I'll take questions. Wonderful. Thanks so much, Terry. Everyone else, they may be muted, but I'm sure you can hear the clapping through the muted microphones. You can certainly see it. So again, we have time for questions, which is intentional. And well, we have a question right away from Claudia. Well, we have a question right away from Claudia. So, why don't we have Claudia's question? Hi, Teretta. Great talk. I really enjoyed it. I was wondering in your particle tracking algorithm that you developed, there must be a limit on how many particles in the flow there can be, because if there are too many, then I'm guessing no filtering is going to give you any good data. So, what's that number? Is that order 10, or the 100? You know, like you know, yeah, because I know this. Yeah, because I noticed your images were very, didn't have many, I mean, had order of, say, maybe 10 particles. Is that what it is? Like, or can you do, say, 100 particles? So I wonder, you know, like PTV and PIV are different because usually use PIV for lots of particles and PTV for less. So this is even less than you usually use for PTV, correct? Yes. So the tank was about 60 centimeters cubed. Centimeters cubed, and we put in maybe 100 particles into that tank. And we ended up with enough data where if we ever got a really big conflict, we just cut the trajectory and started again because it was easier to cut the trajectory than it was to figure out where the particles were going past each other. And we weren't data limited at that point. So I. I you could probably write in some more parts of the code to get longer trajectories with more data, especially since you have kind of those three different angles. But since we were looking at just nearest neighbor, kind of just nearest neighbor based on the center of mass of the particle trajectory and not looking at orientation as we. And not looking at orientation as we linked the particles together. That's why we cut them. But there are a lot of other components that you could use to kind of make this more robust for more particles. Okay, great. And you said your tank was 60 by 60 by 60, correct? Yes. Yeah, 60 by 60 by 60, but like with the edges cut off for the yeah, it's fine. Yeah, but that kind of size. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Nimes, you have a question. Nimes, you have a question. Hi, Terry. Really nice talk. Thanks. I was going to ask you a question about the figure you left up at the end there. So the power law is very interesting, obviously. But I don't know if you remember the pre-factor in front of the power law, because I remember looking at some similar results where that kind of was interesting and some measure of particle inertia, I thought, at the time. Yeah. So we have. Yeah, so we have the prefactor. It's been emailed to me by Gautier and it is neither on this presentation or in my head right now. But I do have that and we were comparing that prefactor to some of the prefactors from the fibers papers that we had. So I haven't done that yet, but I do have it. It's something that I'm looking at. Yeah, I think from Comogroph theory, it should be eight. So then anything, you know. Be eight. So then anything, you know, probably it's lower than that. And so that kind of maybe tells you something about how much inertia there is. Just before going on to the question by Jacques, I just want to ask, is there some obvious reason why you expect the power law to be minus four thirds? Let me see if I put this in here. Okay. So this, okay, is from the Parson and Waff paper. And so it's just a scaling law or a scale that they did. That they did. And so they said that rotation rate for tracers would scale as one over time on this Komogorov time scale. And that if you make this assumption that for particles that are inside of the inertial subrange, their rotation rate is going to scale on the eddy turnover time. So that's the assumption that's made. And then inside of the inertial subrange, you can define the eddy turnover time. Time with kind of the eddy length scale and the dissipation rate. And when you take this and you plug it back into here, you end up with the rotation rate scaling to the minus four thirds. That's great. Thank you, Terry. Jacques, please ask your question. That was my question. Thanks. Sorry to have scooped you. Well, in that case, I'm going to ask another question that I had in mind. You didn't mention the density of the plastics. I assume they were probably matched with the I assume they were probably matched with the fluid that you were using. Yeah. So it was polystyrene plastics. If you were to let them settle, they would have, you know, they'd be negatively buoyant. But because of the magnitude of the turbulence fluctuations, we just assumed neutral buoyancy for these experiments. Do you have an intuition if you did have a more substantial density difference, let's say 5% either more or less buoyant? Either more or less buoyant. Would that perhaps influence the nature of the tumbling? Or is it? I suppose it's going to depend on the Reynolds number of the turbulence, but I just wanted to. I think it would because the particles will have a preferential orientation as they're settling. And so then there'll be some sort of balance of like the particle preferential settling orientation with the kind of tumbling components of. The kind of tumbling components of their kinematics. And so it would kind of be figuring out which one of those would kind of win in those two balances. A nice merger of your work and the work that we just heard from Michelle. Yeah, yeah. Jean-Luc, do you have a question? Yes, thank you. I was curious whether there is a statistic that can detect the shape differences? Is there like outfit? Is there like outside of the rotation rate or what? Yeah, exactly. So clearly the rotation rate doesn't do very well at detecting the shape, right? I mean, it detects the size, but not the shape. But is there some other statistic you can make, maybe something Lagrangian or correlated between two different times or something that would see the shape difference? Yeah, so I've been, we've been looking into that a little bit with kind of the correlation time scales and with some of the With some of the like kurtosis PDFs that I've gotten, I've gotten some weird components, but I'm not sure at that point if it's because my kurtosis isn't converged. And like, that's why I'm getting these weird, like, I'll get some, some shapes that are kind of have this like normal, you know, like line thing. And then I'll get some other shapes that are kind of like concave. And I'm like, why is this concave? And I don't know if that's just because when I take the fourth moment, I don't have enough to convert. Fourth moment, I don't have enough to converge it, but when I had like the second moment, I did. So, those are some of the statistics that I'm looking at right now. But I'd be happy to look at others if you have others in mind as well. Okay, thank you. All right, Christian. I think you need to unmute there. Yes, thank you very much for the very interesting talk. As you mentioned, the work of Bowdoin shots, I remember in these days, In these days, 15 years ago, they had these very interesting acceleration measurements of acceleration histograms, and they were non-Gaussian. Do you expect that perhaps with this PDF of the acceleration, one could distinguish between different shapes, or do you think these PDFs of acceleration are also independent of let me see if I have. Let me see if I have the oh, the picture. So, if I'm remembering correctly, so the acceleration of our PDFs for kind of just our rotation rates didn't distinguish between the shapes. So, I have a version of the paper that I'm working on with Gochier that has all of Gochier's comments on it with some of All of Gotier's comments on it with some of these PDFs. So, if I'll share that screen really quickly. So, here are some of the PDFs that we have. And this is just for kind of our normalized tumbling rate here. But the so this is just the triangles, and all of the sizes are collapsing, and this is all of the shapes. And so, all of our shapes are collapsing here. So, what we're Here. So, what we're not sure about, though, is kind of why these tails are so high. Very interesting. Thank you very much. So, it basically is independent of shape. Yeah, yep. All right, we'll take one more question from Laura. That was really interesting, Terry. Thank you for that talk. I was just wondering, quick question. The length, how do you define the length scale of the particles? Is it the side length or is it like the longest length? The side length, or is it like the longest length across? Um, I'm defining it by the circle that it's drawn inside of, yeah. So that's why I just had the outside circle and I will either look at the diameter or the radius of that. Got it. Thank you. Okay, wonderful. Well, thank you so much once again for an excellent talk, Terry. Really appreciate it. And we'll get set up with our next speaker, Tom Vandenberg. Looking good. Oh, are you uh just go full screen on this thing? Hang on a sec. Just realize I forgot to hit the stop recording button. Now I have
