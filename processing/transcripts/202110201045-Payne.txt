shared two-minute lightning talks on their research. So I hope you can stay for that. And then we have on our sides on Zoom, we have one hour break and we'll try to come back on Gathertown if we have any questions because we won't be doing question and answer of the lightning talks. And I understand that people have hike plans in person and you all should do that. But whoever can on Zoom join, we encourage you to do so. Encourage you to do so. And so, for this afternoon, we're going to have two collaborators actually speak. And so, I'm excited to first introduce Dr. Christine Payne, who's the Yeo Family Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University. She's also director of grad studies and associate chair in the same department. So, take it away. All right. Thanks, Veronica, very much for the introduction. I'm going to switch to this. All right. All right. Can everybody see these slides? Good. Yeah. So thanks very much for inviting me to participate in this. It's been great. And also, I think it's probably fair to say there's some conferences that I have been happy have moved online and I'm not traveling for them, but this is the one that I'm so sad not to be in person at. And I feel like the invitation to the hype was sort of rubbing it in in terms of the virtual participants. Sorry about that. You should have muted. All right, so I wanted to. Okay, there we go. I wanted to tell you a little bit about what my lab does overall and then imagine that we're there in person having lunches together where we could talk about these other things. I'm going to switch the laser pointer, but instead I would just say if anybody is interested in these other topics, please contact me by email. I would love to talk about them more. I would love to talk about them more. My lab does a lot of work looking at nanoparticle-cell interactions, and there are applications here in biomedicine and also in environmental and manufacturing exposures. And that's what you see here. You see four cells, the nuclei are stained blue, and then you see red nanoparticles adsorbed onto the surface of these cells. We also work in the field of bacterial electrophysiology or bioelectricity. Or bioelectricity. And many of you will realize these are not bacteria I'm showing you, but this is some earlier work we had done developing conducting polymer micro wires and nanowires to control the bioelectric behavior of cells. And in this application, it's actually cardiomyocytes, and they will beat spontaneously on their own. When the red circle appears in the image is when we've applied a voltage, and then the cells are beating in response to this applied voltage from the wires. From the wires. For all of these experiments, we do a lot of fluorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking. Fluorescence microscopy is, of course, unique as a technique that gives you both spatial and temporal resolution, and it's really important for understanding how cells interact with materials. And then some new work in my lab related to lab automation and machine learning, especially about how we can predict what proteins are interacting with the surfaces of different types of nanoparticles based on their, just on their surface properties. Based on their just on their surface properties. All right, so I'm going to start with sort of lead into this really fundamental biophysical question by talking about our work with nanoparticles. And I'm going to talk about titanium dioxide, so TiO2 nanoparticles. And these are nanoparticles that you have all already interacted with today. So they are the white coloring and also the protective material in sunscreens. They're the basis for industrial white paints and pigments. White paints and pigments, all of the paint in your house. When you see white PVC pipe, that white color comes from TiO2 nanoparticles. They're the white sort of shiny coloring in food coloring. So when you have a frosting, that's TiO2. And last, I will point out you are in France. So France in 2020 banned the use of TiO2 in food colorants as sort of a better safe than sorry approach. And then there's also applications for TiO2 nanoparticles as photocatalysts. Particles as photocatalyst. And in terms of sunscreens and cosmetics, I should say TIO2 is completely safe here. You should use sunscreen. Food coloring, the U.S. definitely considers it safe, and those limits are set by the FDA. In terms of paints and pigments, in this case, what people are worried about, including my lab, is the exposure to people that are manufacturing these products, so how much they inhale each day. Much they inhale each day. And those limits are set by OSHA based on experiments that, by today's standards, would look sort of old-fashioned to us. And I will say, just because they are used as photocatalysts, that what's important to my work with TiO2 is usually we're thinking about lung exposure, so inhalation. There's no light exposure in the lungs, so all of our experiments are done without light exposure. That's not what we're interested in here. All right, so TiOT. All right, so TiO2 nanoparticles in scare quotes here is because these particles I'm showing you in an electron microscopy image would be called 22 nanometer particles. But what that means is the individual grains are about 22 nanometers. The particles themselves are fused aggregates, and they range from about 100 nanometers to a micron. And they always have these very irregular shapes. And that's what makes them sort of interesting from a material science point of view, is when you think about View is when you think about how do these particles interact with cells, the particles have very different sizes and very different shapes, and you have to think about how those factors interact with cells. All right. So one thing my lab has really done a lot with is thinking about a three-body interaction between nanoparticles, proteins, and cells. So nanoparticles in any biological environment, and this could be nanomedicines that are injected into the bloodstream, or they could be these inductions. Or they could be these industrial nanoparticles that are inhaled and are in the lung. They're never, once they're in a biological environment, they are always surrounded by proteins. Those proteins will adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface, and that forms what's called a protein corona. And the corona is binned into two categories: where you have a hard corona, and these are the proteins that have a high binding affinity and are really stuck to the nanoparticle surface. Surface, and then a soft corona of proteins that are exchanging on and off the surface. We always in the field draw it as this sort of layered cartoon, but it's not actually a layered structure. The hard and soft corona really just refers to the binding affinity. So, as these proteins, and the proteins I'm showing here come from blood serum, bloodstream proteins, as those proteins interact with the nanoparticle, it will change the structure of the protein. It will lead to, in many cases, a partial. lead to in many cases a partial denaturation and then that changes how the nanoparticle protein complex interacts with cells and then it's important to point out that what i just showed you it's really a cartoon so we did some super resolution imaging with professor melekalakadamiali she is at unpenny she was at iqfo when we did these experiments um so on the left you see standard fluorescence microscopy the proteins are labeled with a red fluorescent dye here and that's Dye here. And that seems to say that you have these irregularly shaped TiO2 particles and that they're just, the protein is just covering the nanoparticles. But when you use super resolution imaging, what you can see is that you're actually getting different densities of proteins at different spots on the particle. So again, what I just showed you before is really just a cartoon. So what I mentioned there is that the protein corona, you will always have proteins adsorbed onto the nanoseparticle surface. Nanoseparticle surface. What proteins adsorb is really interesting when you think about the protein-nanoparticle complex interacting with cells. Even when you have the same protein, in this case, bovine serum albumin, adsorbed onto two different nanoparticles, changes in protein structure will change how these complexes interact with the cell by leading them to different receptors on the cell surface. And because a lot of you sort of work in transport and endocytosis, I should say the different receptors will lead to different endocytosis. Different receptors will lead to different endocytic pathways through the cell. So it really changes the whole fate of this nanoparticle-cell interaction. All right, so in my lab, our nanoparticle cell studies, I just want to show you what the workflow looks like for us. So we usually start with a physical characterization of the particles. And what's most important here is measuring the zeta potential, so the effective surface charge of the particles. And what we see, and this is general, is that you could start with. General is that you could start with either cationic positively charged nanoparticles or negatively charged nanoparticles. But once the protein adsorbs on the surface, your particles will be net negatively charged here and here. And that just reflects the charge of the protein that's absorbed onto the surface. And we can also measure the hydrodynamic diameter. And both of these measurements are done with light scattering. Our next step is biological characterization or biochemical. Characterization or biochemical characterization. And we do that in two steps. So we will, we want to know what proteins are adsorbed onto the surface. We can do that in a really fast and cheap way by running gels or doing western blots. And in many cases, we see the same proteins over and over again in corona, so we can identify them based on their molecular weights. This is from a set of experiments we did looking at the importance of flow rates on the formation of the protein corona, so modeling what went. Of the protein corona, so modeling what would happen in the bloodstream. And then the second, more expensive, longer step there is to do proteomics, where you get a list of all of the proteins adsorbed on your nanoparticle surface. We usually rank them by abundance, and we're interested in what proteins are, for example, enriched on the nanoparticle surface compared to the biological medium that they're in. All right. And then our third step is thinking about how these particles interact with cells. And for that, we use live cell imaging. And for that, we use live cell imaging and single particle tracking. And this is just an old example from my lab, but what you're seeing here is sort of a standard fluorescence microscope setup. We can do multicolor excitation and emission. We're using an inverted microscope and imaging on an EMCCD camera. And this is an example showing red nanoparticles. These are actually quantum dots that have been internalized into the cell. And then we're labeling two different types. And then we're labeling two different types of endocytic vesicles. So, blue are early endosomes, green are late endosomes. They have two, they have different protein characteristics, and we're using two different fluorescent proteins to label them. And then we're able to track this nanoparticle, which is actually localized in a late endosome as it transports through the cell. All right. So I should say, in terms of the TIO2 nanoparticles, at high concentrations, they will be toxic to cells. Toxic to cells. So, one of our first steps is always figuring out a very low concentration to work with. And that for us, we want to mimic exposures, especially in the manufacturing setting where it's not toxic, but maybe you're working with these materials over a 30-year career and inhaling them. So to set a concentration for our experiments, we use an MTT assay. This is an assay that measures mitochondrial activity. It's used as a measure of cell health. So we find a concentration of particles where we see about Concentration of particles where we see about 30% cell death, and then we back off by 10 or 100-fold, at which point the cells appear healthy, and then we say what else is happening to the cells. All right, so in terms of the TIO2 nanoparticles, I'm just going to summarize this briefly, which is to say a lot of things happen to the cells. So, we know, for example, that there's changes in gene expression at very low concentrations, and we know there's a specific family of genes, the peroxy. Specific family of genes, the peroxyredoxins, that are affected by the TiO2 nanoparticles. And that effect is very specific to TiO2. It's not a nanoresponse. You won't see it for other types of nanoparticles. We know there are changes in gene expression, and these changes in gene expression are extended over multiple generations. We looked at generation one cells, generation 10, and then also a re-challenge experiment. We know that the nanoparticles oxidize the proteins that are. Oxidize the proteins that are absorbed onto the surface. This is due to surface defects and oxygen vacancies. That protein oxidation is actually important in terms of the cell response and these changes in the protein in the peroxyredoxins. And then this is unphysiological, but if you do have bare nanoparticles, which you would never actually have in a biological system, they will oxidize the lipids that they come into contact with. All right. So that work I told you about was mostly done. I told you about was mostly done with industrial TiO2 nanoparticles, and I just wanted to mention this because it's been a newer experiment and I love the advertising here. So, when my lab, so we had done experiments with food-grade TiO2 over the years, just as sort of a fun side project in comparison to the industrial ones. But we didn't see it as being particularly interesting because it's a smaller market share. But my lab moved from Georgia Tech to But my lab moved from Georgia Tech to Duke in 2018. And when we moved, we had to reorder all of our reagents. And so previously, we had food-grade TIO2 that we got from a big chemical supplier. But when we went to reorder it at Duke, we realized that you didn't need that anymore. You could actually just buy it on Amazon. And it was sold on Amazon. If you wanted to make your own food coloring or your own cosmetics, you could buy this food grade TIO2 to give you this really white, shiny color. And I love it because it is advertised. And I love it because it is advertised as vegan and non-GMO. And it is the thing that is most certainly vegan and non-GMO, like this, just titanium dioxide in here. The particles themselves, I'm just going to mention this briefly, they're very similar actually to the industrial TiO2. They're slightly smaller. But those responses that I talked about before, you see actually identical surface responses in terms of protein oxidation. Of protein oxidation. And then you also see similar cellular responses with the food-grade TiO2 as you do with the industrial products. So, those biological responses for us are on the cellular level, looking at oxidative stress in cells, and then also using PCR to look at, we had done a big set of RNA sequencing experiments, so we know every gene that's affected by TiO2 nanoparticles, and then we focused on ones that are relevant to epigenetic changes. To epigenetic changes. And we know that there are five, and here two of them are shown: the HDAC. So these are two different enzymes that are responsible for epigenetic modifications, and they're also affected by the food-grade TiO2 nanoparticles. All right, so with those nanoparticles, they're actually nanoparticles. Normally, you think of something as being like the size of a virus. So 100 nanometers should be what you call a nanoparticle. And TiO2 gets, sometimes you call it a particle, and sometimes a nanoparticle because of. And sometimes a nanoparticle because of the grain size. But these are big particles. And so, one question with all of these cellular responses is: do the particles have to be in the cell for these responses or are they just triggering a receptor on the cell surface? But these particles, even though they're quite big, they are internalized by cells and not just macrophage cells, but regular epithelial cells as well. So these are some A549 human lung cancer cells. And at four degrees, you block. And at four degrees, you block endocytic uptake. You don't have an active cytoskeleton. And you can see these are electron microscopy slices through cells. You see the particles here outside of the cell. But even after one hour at 37 degrees, you'll see the TiO2 inside these large vesicles. And at 24 hours, you just see additional uptake. So the particles get into the cell. And we also know that they get into specifically lysosomes. This is actually true of a lot of Specifically, lysosomes. This is actually true of a lot of nanoparticles. They're internalized endocytically. They don't move across the plasma membrane, and ultimately they end up in lysosomes. And for the most part, they're stuck there. There's not an exocytosis of nanoparticles in general. There's sort of an interesting result here with the TiO2. So here we have two cells. We're labeling specifically the lysosomes of cells. And normally lysosomes, which are membrane-bound vesicles, they have a low pH, they contain many high. Have a low pH, they contain many hydroglytic enzymes, and they're responsible for degrading cargo in the cell. They're the stomach of the cell, is the lysosome. So, normally, lysosomes are about 100 to 200 nanometers, so they're below the diffraction limit of most microscopes, and you see them in labeling as just punctate spots. But with TIO2, you see that they're enlarged, and you can actually see the shape of the lysosome. They look like circles instead of spots because they're larger than the diffraction limit of the microscope. Limit of the microscope. So I should say there's other ways to end up with enlarged lysosomes. So there are disease states that result in lysosome enlargement. Specifically, the lysosome will store you. Osmotic effect that leads to lysosomes. Oh no. Oh no. Okay. You're back, Christine. Just a few seconds there. That was like the nightmare. Okay. So I should say, okay, so there's a way, just a laboratory tool for controlling lysosome swelling is to incubate cells with sucrose. So 50 millimolar for 12 hours or 24 hours. The sucrose ends up specifically in the lysosome. It doesn't end up in other organelles, and it's not diffusing throughout the cell. It's not in the cell. Throughout the cell. It's not in the cytosol, it's just in the lysosome. And then the swelling is due to an osmotic effect of having the sucrose in the lysosome. So this is some previous work from my lab, but you see the control cells here, the inset shows you the punctate staining of the lysosomes, and then when they're incubated with sucrose, you see the swelling effect. So this question of lysosome diameter and how it affects transport is something that my lab looked at in 2019. Is something that my lab looked at in 2014, related more actually to lysosomal storage disorders and basic biophysics. It was sort of interesting to us when we saw it again for the nanoparticle studies. And when we did these experiments in 2014, I would say we did them in what was like a pretty standard way at the time. So we did single particle tracking. We followed the trajectory of individual lysosomes. We used mean squared displacements to analyze the motion. We looked at diffusion. And for a diffusive behavior, which we just classified. Behavior, which we just classified based on a linear MSD, we did see a decrease for the enlarged lysosomes, and it matched with the enlarged, the change in size was sort of fit together. And then we also looked specifically at lysosome transport based on unidirectional motion. So, for lysosomes that were either moving into the cell body or out towards the cell periphery, we tracked those lysosomes, we measured the velocity. Those lysosomes, we measured the velocity, and we saw that there was no change in velocity as a function of lysosome diameter. So now this enters into the collaborative part of the talk. So at this point, let's say we're at 2017 now. I think probably most of you are familiar with the NSF Simons Foundation centers. So Christine Heitch at Georgia Tech led a big effort. Georgia Tech led a big effort to make a southeast-based center for mathematics and biology. And the way this center was structured was there would be bioscientists and bioengineers based at Georgia Tech who were paired with mathematicians throughout the Southeast, some at Georgia Tech, but also throughout the Southeast. And then you would have individual teams all working on different questions to sort of develop new math, inspire. Develop new math inspired or motivated by the biology. And we'll see how Scott responds to this analogy. But I would describe it as it was set up as sort of like an arranged marriage. None of the partners met each other beforehand. We were just given each other's names. So I was given Scott McKinley's name. Here's his email address. You two have, I think, like two weeks to put together a mini proposal for this center. And this actually turned out to really be the, like, it was the perfect combination. Be the like it was the perfect combination that Christine Heitch knew both of us and matched us together, and then there's seven partners all working on different topics. So our team, oh, I should say the other way this was structured is that the teams would have a postdoc who was a mathematician and based with the math partners. So we have Keisha Cook, who's also at this meeting. And then there would be a grad student who's an experimental grad student based with the bio-scientist. Student based with the bioscientist or bioengineering PI. And so, this is our team. And we also had two undergrads who really got this project up and running for us. So, Quentin Tran was a Duke Physics undergrad, and then Riley Junaman at Tulane was Scott's undergrad. And then very, we sort of gamed the system, but then she came to Duke as an REU student that next summer. So it was really quite nice. And Riley's now doing a PhD at Stanford after winning best tool. Stanford after winning best two-lane undergrad ever last year. All right, so we Sad and I went through sort of multiple projects and sort of what would be best for both of our expertise and what would be most interesting to us at the time. And one thing we were really interested in was revisiting this lysosomal transport question. So questions of, okay, speed we measured, but did we do this in the best way? I was really interested in the question of function. So there's many places where you see lysosomes. Many places where you see lysosomes swell. And the question is: does that change the function of the cell in any way? From a mathematical point of view, really, what's the best method for analysis? And what's the best frame rate for data collection? These two go together. And I should say in general, before we had been working at one frame per second, one hertz, or between 0.5 and 2 hertz for experiments. All right. So we take a lot of data. We do the labeling and the cell work, obviously. And the cell work, obviously. And we hand that off to Scott and Keisha. And Scott's going to go next. So I'm not going to sort of steal his thunder here other than to say they use a change point analysis. We can take a trajectory and one shown here and they decompose that into its segments. So looking at time as a function of x or y. So this is a nice one that shows three different types of motion or states of motion. And then we can describe the behavior of those segments. Okay, so how long? What was the speed duration? How long? What was the speed during that segment? And then what was the state? And the state actually was probably finding the right wording to describe the state was probably one of the hardest things to come together on in terms of math language versus biology language. And in the end, this definition is whether it is faster or slower than 100 nanometers per second. So greater than 100, motion faster than 100 nanometers per second is motile and slower. Per second is motile and slower, is stationary, even though it's not fixed in space. And I should say, this was actually a reviewer comment. Our paper had been submitted. We got reviewer comments back. We had a different labeling scheme and we weren't totally happy with it, but this was one of those reviewer suggestions. We were like, oh, like it was great. All right. So the end result of what I'm going to tell you is that the vesicle diameter, the lysosome diameter, isn't really very important for. Isn't really very important for transport. But a surprise result from this was that the region of the cell really did matter as we look through the data. So I hope you can tell this is a good example here. So these are monkey kidney cells. These are BSC1s. The lysosomes are labeled green. The nuclei are blue. And so what you can see, this is the boundary of the cell here. Okay. This denser region of lysosomes, this is the perinuclear region. Outside of the perinuclear region, Outside of the perinuclear region, you hit the periphery of the cell, this body of the cell. So, what turned out to matter was really where the lysosomes were in the cell. Were they in the perinuclear region or the periphery of the cell? All right. So, here's our analysis. I'm going to give you like the 30-second overview so I can save this for Scott. But what turned out to really matter was the stationary period. So, when you have stationary lysosomes, how long those segments or stationary segments, how long? Stationary segments, how long those segments were stationary for. We did a big analysis of speed based on region and then also size, whether we had large or small lysosomes. And once we realized there was this regional dependence, then for the size question, we only, well, we focused on the cell periphery so that we could compare apples to apples. We see a small difference in speed for small versus large lysosomes. Versus large lysosomes. But overall, we sort of were able to bin that out in terms of which matters more based on an effective diffusivity. And the speed, it's a small component, this large versus small, but it's really the region that matters in terms of lysosome transport. I should say the speed, so this way of dividing the states into stationary or motile, right, as we said it was 100 nanometers per second was how we defined them. Was how we defined them. And so we did go back, and I didn't, Scott and Keisha went back and re-ran all of the analysis. But looking at what if we had changed our binning to 50 nanometers per second or 200 nanometers per second, and the proportion changes, but the ratios don't. So overall, it's the same result no matter what cutoff you're using for your definition of states. From a biology point of view, I should say what was really important to us was that this result is independent. To us, was that this result is independent of cell type, at least for the two cell types we looked at? So we used the monkey kidney cells. These are really common for single particle tracking labs because they're big, spread out, very flat cells. So they're great for imaging. And we also did experiments in human lung cancer cells. These A549 cells are used a lot as a model for inhalation, and we see the same result in terms of perinuclear versus periphery being really important for that. Really important for that. Yeah. So I want to say, in terms of the transport, is just to repeat that is cellular region is really important. And I think that was exciting to us because it's something that we don't usually talk about in single particle tracking experiments is that you do need to consider what region of the cell you're in if you want to have sort of a fair comparison. Lysosome diameter was really a minor aspect of transport, and that actually makes sense from a biological perspective. And that actually makes sense from a biological point of view because if you did have a difference based on size, you would, for example, have large lysosomes. Forget the sucrose question. Lysosomes are a heterogeneous population, even without sucrose. The larger ones would always pile up on one side of the cell if there was a diameter dependence, and we don't see that in cells. So I think this makes sense. In terms of next steps, let me just point out one thing here. So we want to know why, right? So why is it different than the perinuclear region? Region. And so one question, just because this comes up by eye, is that you do have this dense crowding in the perinuclear region. You have a lot of lysosomes together. So one question is, is it sort of a crowding, a density issue? You have lysosomes mumping into each other. But we have started to look at that. And so far, the answer seems to be no. So you can, as a control, look at regions in the periphery that are crowded or look at regions perinuclear lysosomes that are isolated. That are isolated, and it doesn't seem to be a crowding effect that leads to this change in transport. So, the other two sort of, I would just say, I don't know, hypotheses that we're looking at is one, so what's different about the perinuclear region? And one might be, it's also the location of the endoplasmic reticulum, the ER. And there is other work showing that lysosomes undergo a tethering to the ER. So it's possible that that's what we're seeing here. And that's something we're testing now with drug. Here and that's something we're testing now with drug treatments to dissolve the ER, for example, and see if transport changes. And then the other side, so we had to talk Monday, it's Monday evening for us, but I guess Monday afternoon for you guys on intermediate filaments. And I think intermediate filaments, so they often get overlooked in terms of the cytoskeleton. So in terms of transport, we think a lot about microtubules and sometimes we ask about actin. But the perinuclear region is really dense with intermediate filaments. So is it possible that they're changing the local viscosity of the crowd? The local viscosity or the crowding within the perinuclear region. And this is something else we can test with drug treatments that we're working on now. And then the other idea, and again, this came actually from, we had a really like a very thoughtful reviewer here, is are the lysosomes, is it possible what you're seeing is something like maturation? So is a lysosome in the perinuclear region different from a lysosome in the periphery of the cell, right? So endosomes mature. So early endosomes recruit proteins. Early endosomes recruit proteins and become late endosomes. Is it possible the difference we're seeing is some sort of maturation pathway for lysosomes? And that we don't have a great way of checking right now, but it's interesting. And in some sense, this would really be the dream is that this sort of high-level mathematical analysis has led to like a very new biological discovery in terms of a new type of lysosome. All right. So I'm going to go ahead. I'll thank my lab. This is us during COVID, obviously. COVID, obviously. And then Nathan here is the grad student who's part of this team. And then I'll show you the fun picture, which was, so it worked out great for us summer 2019. Riley, the undergrad from Scott's lab, came to Duke as part of an REU program, the Duke Grand Challenges REU. And then Keisha, so the center had been designed for postdocs, the math postdocs, to spend one month during the summer. Spend one month during the summer working in the biology lab and getting a hands-on feel for data. And so, this was also the summer that Keisha spent a month in my lab. And so, it was great for everybody to like spend real time together. I'm going to give one ad also, which is to say that Duke has a really nice program, umbrella program in materials science and engineering, where students come into a home department and then can work for anybody in materials science. And I just point this out because I think looking at sort of our affiliations, we come from many different departments. We come from many different departments, but this also includes mathematics at Duke, where then they can do biomaterials research or soft matter or whatever. All right, I am going to stop here. I'll go back to these conclusions. I'm happy to take questions or we can save questions for after Scott's talk, however people want to do this. Thank you so much for the lovely talk, Christine. And I think we should take some questions. I think that would be nice. Yeah. I think that would be nice. Yeah. So maybe we'll start with Zoom participants. And I think I see Melissa with her hand up. Cool. Okay. So I wanted to follow up on the idea of how or why the middle is different. And I know in neurons, right, everything is super spread out. So it's easier to look at how things move through space and change. And there is work showing that endosymbionts. Is work showing that endosomes mature to lysosomes in dendrites towards the cell body. And so there's also a set of markers worked out for that that might be useful to address that question in these cells. Yeah, that's actually interesting. So in these cells, in epithelial cells, you'll see fusion, for example, between handoff of cargo between late endosomes and lysosomes. And I should say in terms of markers that we're using LAMP1 as the label for these lysosomes. As the label for these lysosomes. Yeah, so that was problematic in the neuronal studies. They had to move, I think, to cathepsins to really look at fully mature lysosomes. Yeah. That's good to know because there are, of course, fluorescent proteins for cathepsins also. Yeah. Any other questions from online? I guess I have one. I guess I have one. Do you think, are you thinking of the intermediate filaments as a key player, not because of transport on them or anything like that, just because of a crowding? Is that where you're okay? I would say to first order yes. Like we picture it like, is it a more crowded region or is it providing some sort of structure or is there an interaction with them? But that's right. It's not a transport or it's not like an ATP-dependent transport on intermediate filaments. Cool. Cool, thank you. Any other questions? We can move to in person. We have no questions here. Okay. All right. If that's the case, thank you so much again, Christine. Thank you. Alrighty. Um, Scott, are you ready? Awesome. All right. So next up, we have Dr. Scott McKinley, Associate Professor in Department of Mathematics at Tulane, and on a personal note, a wonderful collaborator. Take it away. Thank you. Thank you, Veronica. Thank you, Christine, for the good. Christine for the good for setting me up there.
