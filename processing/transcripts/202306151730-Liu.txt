Bebe Liu, also a former student of Misha Kapovich, will be talking about Eisenstein series and cusps of Kleinian groups. Thank you, Jennifer. And I also want to thank all the organizers to make this happen, and in particular for Jennifer Schultz to make this special day. I think it is really meaningful. I was a graduate student of Misha from 2015 to 2015 to 2019. And I think, like, the way Misha's way to see mathematics to think mathematics really make a big impact on the way how I think about mathematics. And in particular, I think he asked really many insightful questions. And terms are like every question becomes a paper. So this is like one time I sent a preprint to Misha for comments, and then he just asked a question to me, and it becomes a paper. So I think he really makes me like. He really makes me like enjoying the client groups, enjoying the hyperbolic geometry, and make me try to answer many interesting questions. So, this is, I'm going to talk about Eisenstein series and the cusp of Klanien groups. And this is joint work with Shiwan. And at some point, Michael's impact will show up in this talk. So, I'll start with some complete hyperbolic manifold. I'll denote it by M. And during the whole talk, this M, it will be N dimension. This m, it will be n dimension. So I will denote it by the quotient of the hyperbolic space model Hn plus one and the quotient of the Kleinian group gamma. So the Kleinian group is really just like some discrete. Here I assume it's also torsion-free isometry subgroups. Here I do the left quotient, but usually you can also do the right quotient. It's really for some technical reasons for in this talk, like why I do the left quotient. One example is One example is like if we consider dimension two hyperbolic surface, what you can imagine is like, well, it has some genus, and also together it comes with some punctures. So topology, we can regard these punctures as just like delete some point inside my surface. But like geometry, they can call like cusp. You need to put some metric on this, on this, on these punctures to make the metric to be complete. To make the metric to be complete. And that's just like one way to see the cusp in dimension two. And in higher dimension, there's like a more explicit way to describe the cusp, and I will just try to draw the picture to describe it. So for this hyperbolic surface, I will just use this unit disk model to denote H2 or even Hm. And for each of these punctures or each so-called cusp, you're just what goes to infinity. So when you go to infinity in this cusp, you really just try to. In this cusp, you really just try to approach some point at infinity in your hyperbolic space. However, you have this gamma, the group acts on this hyperbolic space. So you see like a bunch of orbit points and etc. So the cast also contains like some long leg, you can see in this picture. And going to the universal cover, this long leg will now become some horribles. horribles and i will denote it by h and then this will be gamma h gamma prime h and etc so it's not necessary this horribles will disjoint but you can always make this horrible small enough such that they will be disjoint um and another so this is like in terms of topology what happens in the universal cover or in or downstairs in the quotient and we can also talk about the groups so for this point cassi For this point, we can consider the stabilizer of this point under my ambient Lie group G. So now my ambient Lie group G in my talk will always be the isometry group, which will be just SO SOM plus 1, 1. So this will be my ambient Lie group. So then let me denote the stabilizer of my Cassie inside this Lie group by P C. So this is a some neopotent subgroup. This is a some Niapotin subgroup, and also I have some discrete group gamma, so I'll consider the intersection of gamma beside the stabilizer of that point. So, this is just like all the elements inside of my discrete group, which preserve my cassine. And so now one way to describe the cusp in topologically is just like without ambiguity, we can just denote the cusp by the quotient of this horrible left quotient with my group. Now, my group action will not be the whole group action, but. Action will not be the whole group action, but just like gamma c, which preserves this point at infinity. So, this is just like one way to describe it in topology. And in group sense, we can also describe the topology as one-to-one correspondence to the conjugate state class of the group gamma casi. So, so this gamma cassi is also called the maximal parabolic subgroup. It's just a name, but we just call this like the parabolic subgroup, and then each cusp will correspond to. And then each cusp will correspond to the conjugacy class, the gamma conjures Cassie class of gamma cassi. So there are two ways to understand this cusp: one is topology, one is in terms of the group. Okay, so now is a natural question in terms of topology or in geometry. It's like, given such a Kleinian group, and then given such a quotient manifold, under which conditions you have, you can count your number of cuts, like how many cuts you can have in your quotient manifold. Do you expect? In your quotient manifold, do you expect finite many, or do you expect infinite many, or it's like if it is finite, can you just give a bound or just like even explicit count them number? So that's a very natural questions. So we have a lot of results goes back to Dennis Sullivan dating in 1981. So he proved like if this n equals to two, like the three-dimensional hyperbolic space, if your group is finitely generated, then you can actually prove the finite least result of your cusp. The finite least result of your cusp. And moreover, you can bound the number of cusps by 5n minus 4. So this n is the number of the so this number, so this n is the number of the generator of your group gamma because your group gamma is finite generated. So it's a finite number. So you can bound it in terms of the finite number. So you're wondering whether this is still true if you go to higher dimension. So this goes to Misha's work. He has a lot of contributions to higher dimensional hyperbolic. To higher-dimensional hyperbolic space, because phenomena does to be very different from dimension three to higher dimensions. So he constructs the examples in the four-dimensional hyperbolic space. He constructs the group which is finally generated and is even a free group. But in this case, gamma has infinitely many rank one cuts. So it already has fails. So the final result already fails, starting from dimension four. Even your group is finitely generated. And recently, And recently, it's Niano Matelli and Migurino Nori. Sorry, I'm so bad at not pronouncing names. So they have a very recent result in 2022 to construct not even finally generated, but also they can construct counterexample, which is also finite presented. Such Planet group in dimension 5, 6, 7, 8, such that gamma has infinite many full rank cusps. So this is full rank. Full rank cusp. So, this is full rank cusp. By the way, I probably need to say one word about what do I mean by rank one or rank n. So, your gamma casi will sit inside some isometry group of Rn. This corresponds to the horosphere, the boundary of the horrible. But it will sit inside the isometry group, and there exists some k such that the gamma kc will act co-compact on Rk. So, in this case, your gamma casi actually is virtually zk. So, that's what we call the rank, the rank K or rank in general, the full rank, we'll call the rank and cut. So, this is the result we have so far. And this is then one day I sent an email to Michelle's like, he asked the questions like, if you put some additional assumptions on the clinic group, can you expect some finite result of the cusp? So, we need this critical. So, we need this critical exponent. This will be my additional assumptions to put on my Kleining group so that you can expect some finite least result. So, the critical exponent denoted by delta gamma, you can regard it as kind of like a group invariant of a Keynote group because this numerical invariant, the numerical invariant, it will be keep the same if you just take a finite index subgroup. And for definition, there are two ways to describe it. One way is like you. Describe it. One way is like you just pick one point, arbitrary one point inside your space, and then you look at all the orbits and just take a radius r ball and see like how many orbit points sits inside your radius R ball. So that's this number. But you do the log because the water grows exponentially. And you take the limit, divide R and take the limit to see like what this number is. So this is a number sitting between zero and n. And remember, it's like depends on the dimension. Number is like depends on the dimension of your hyperbolic space. So, this number is kind of like geometrically, it will estimate your exponential growth of your orbit. And there's another way to see this critical exponent is to see the Poincar√© series. So, the series here depends on like the distance between O and its orbit. So, it's like the orbit distribution. And you want to see like when this series converges or diverges. So, one fact is like whenever this parameter. It is like whenever this parameter s is greater than your critical exponent, it always converges. And when it is smaller than your critical exponent, it always diverges. And in the middle, when it is equals to this, it's just like this is where the dichotomy will happen. It could diverges, it could be convergence. And if this is equals to infinity, we say this is a divergence type for the group. And if it is convergence, we say this is convergence type of the planning group. So this is just some terminology. This is just some terminology. And so the question Michael asks is: Now I assume my gamma is finitely generated. We know this is not enough because we have counterexamples. So he says, like, furthermore, let's put this additional assumption, like the critical exponent is smaller than two. So it has some restrictions about your gross, the growth rate of your orbit. And then do you expect like your quotient manifold has finite many curves? This is what he asked. And we cannot. And we cannot fully answer this question, but we already know when critical exponent is smaller than one, then yes, you have finite many cusps. And this is also proved by me and Shiwan in another preprint. But in general, we don't know the answer. However, we kind of like invested several examples and we kind of believe maybe the following conjecture is true. Saying it's like now your gamma is still finitely generated. Your gamma is the finite generated assumption one. And also, you assume your critical exponent is smaller than some positive integer, k. We don't know what it is, it's just some positive integer. And then once your critical exponent satisfies this condition, then we conclude like there exists the finite many rank k curse. And we can go back to see this counterexample. And actually, it does not contradict to this conjecture. For example, like when the critical exponent is smaller than one, Exponent smaller than one by our result is uh one, we actually have finite many cuts for rank one. So, this is kind of um confirmed this conjecture. And it goes back to this counter example by Misha. So, in this case, his example has the critical exponent sitting between two and three. So, it does not, so he has infinite many rank one cuts, which does not contradict to our conjecture, because our conjecture just says like your critical exponent small. Just says, like, your critical exponent is smaller than K, you want to control the number of rank K customs, but his rank is rank one. So we don't know how to control rank one. And for the third counterexample by these three people, their critical exponent will equals to n. So it is not smaller than n. And then they have infinitely many ranked n cuts, which still does not contradict to our conjecture. So there is very high chance like our conjecture seems still could be true. Conjecture seems theory could be true. So far, any questions? Okay. Good. So now let's try to think about what kind of possible approach we can use to answer the finite mini result of CUSP. So we have like a two approach. The first approach combines several people's work. So we, so some of this approach shows up in my work is my joint works with Shuam, which is joint. Works with Shuam, which is shown up here. If your critical exponent is smaller than one, you have finite many cusps. And also, recently, WAM has a joint work with Connell and McReynoid. They actually prove like in general, if your critical exponent is smaller than this integer k, then you could expect some k plus one linear isoperometric inequality on this quotient manifold. What does this mean? So meaning like if you have any closed sub-manifold in dimension. Sub-manifold in dimension k inside your quotient manifold, and let's assume that it's not homologous in homology. So there exists some feeling now, the dimension is k plus 1. So this omega k plus 1 is a filling of your k-dimensional closed sub-manifold such that the volume of this filling is smaller than some constant. So this is some constant. This d delta is some constant, depends on your critical. some constant depends on your critical exponent delta and the times the volume of your the case volume of your of your nk so you have some comparison between the volume of the feeling and the volume of your original submanifold so how this could be used to give you some result of the number of cusp so one corollary immediately is like we can bound the number of cusps of of course you need here gamma is finally generated also and also here the critical And also, here the critical exponent is smaller than k. So, then in this case, then the number of the rank k cuts is bounded by the case-betty number of your group gamma, which also is the quotient, is the is the case-betty number of the quotient manual. So, the idea actually is not that hard. So, you can just see the picture. So, suppose you have like k plus 1. Plus one. So suppose like you have like a many cus like P1, T2, T3, P4, etc. Let me just draw three. And suppose like the number is exceeding this baddie number. And then you know like the linear combination for this cusp inside the homology must be trivial. So there exists some linear combination for this homology represented by each cusp is non-homologous. Such that they will bounce some feelings. And because, like, the feeling, you don't know, the feeling could have like very complicated topology, we don't know. But one thing you know is like the feeling must pass through the thick part. So most of the feeling will be inside the thick part and the cusp will be in the thin part. So you have this feeling and now you can use this linear isoparametric inequality. So now the feeling is like omega k plus. Now, the feeling is like omega k plus one. This is the volume. And inside here, you have like this volume: nk now will become this t1, t2, and t3, your cusp. And the c delta is still some constant, depends on your critical exponent. But thing happens is like, if you go further and further in your cusp, you can make the volume of this cusp to be smaller and smaller. But then you can make the lap to be longer and longer. To be longer and longer, such that the longer leg will make a great contribution for the volume of the feeling, which will make the contradiction to the linear isoparametric inequality. So you get a contradiction. So that's just one way to see like how you can use the geometry to find the number of cuts inside your quotient manifold. But it turns out this approach is not very effective if we don't want to do the If we don't want to do the betting number, if we just like, because the betting number is usually not very obvious to compute. In particular, if you just know your group is finite generated, no one can make sure like the betting number is finite. So still, you could have the possibility like your number of cusp is still infinite, even your group is finite generated. So it does not fully answer the question I have before, like to bound the number of cusp. But we have the second approach, which can do a little bit, a little bit more in the But a little bit more in a different perspective, very different perspective. So, the second approach we're going to use is showing up in the title. It's called so-called Eisenstein series. Originally, it's like this Eisenstein series has been used by mathematicians a long time ago, by Hodder. This shows up in the work of Hodder, Schumer, Harry Chandrow. Like, they use this method of Eisenstein series to study lattices in general semi-simple Lie group, and they even use it to study some. They even use it to study some number theoretic stuff like the stub of trace formula, etc. So it has been used pretty widely. However, most of the time people use the Eisenster series for lattices, meaning like the quotient manifold has finite volume. So in general, the quotient manifold does not need to behave that well. It actually can be non-compact. It actually can have like infinite volume. So in this context, like the Eisenstein stein series is not so well. Stand series is not so well explored, and we kind of try to generalize their method or the classical tool Isenstein series to study more general hyperbolic manifold in a more general setting. So let me just first of all give the statement of the theorem we have. Let's assume like you have many cusps. Let T1, T2, etc. This TI be the rank end cusp of gamma. So this rank and Of gamma. So this rank and they're all four rank. And we don't know how many of them. It could be finite, it could be infinite, we don't know. So it's just like indexed by this letter V I. And still, we let this gamma i to denote the fundamental group of the ice cusp. So this is like the original gamma cusp D, the maximal parabolic subgroup. So for each cusp, I have this, for each cusp PI, I have this group gamma i as a pair. So this is one. As a pair. So this is one case. So the first things we prove like there exists some homomorphism from the homology of this coefficient V. I will just say what this coefficient V means later. But now you can just regard it as some twisted coefficient homology of a Lie group. So there exists the homomorphism from the M's cohomology of this group gamma plus the twisted coefficient V. Is the twisted coefficient V and it goes to the N's cohomology. Oh, sorry, this is gamma i. So the group is like from the end scomology of the parabolic group gamma i, the twisted coefficient V goes to the end scomology class of the whole ambient group gamma with the with the same coefficient module. So let me say what this module V is. So there are different choice actually. In general, you can make this V as a general module. You can make this V as a general module as long as you can find a representation rule for your gamma i or even gamma to the automobile group of your V. Then you can induce such twisted coefficient homology class. But in our context, we can make the V very explicit. One choice of this V is to be the trivial, to be the real number. And this representation is really just a trivial representation. We don't really need to take a lot of work to do the representation. So this is really just a trivial. Representation. So, this is really just a trivial cohomology. And then the second choice is to make this V the module to be the Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of your MBNL Lie group G. So remember, this G is SOM plus 1, 1. So I can take the V to be the Lie algebra and then this row to be the adjoint representation. So this is my second choice of my module. So based on the different choice module I've chosen, I can get like the Module: I've chosen, I can get like the different V twisted coefficients cohomology of my group. And then the first theorem is just to say it's like I exist such a homomorphism from the cohomology group of gamma i to gamma. However, I did not complete the whole statement. So if I use the trivial coefficient R, there's additional assumptions I need to make. So the additional assumption is like either the critical exponent is smaller than m or Is smaller than n, or it is the convergence time. If you remember what this means, means like Poincar√© series converges when the critical exponent equals to n. So this is the whole statement. If you make v equals to the trivial, then you need to satisfy this additional assumptions on the critical exponent such that you will exist as such homomorphism. So if you choose the V to be the Lie algebra of your ambient Lie group, you don't need any additional assumption. You don't need any additional assumption for your critical exponent. You will have this homomorphism in this coefficient. So, this is the part one of the theorem. Part two of the theorem is like the linear independence of different cusp. So, for each cusp gamma i, you can construct such a homomorphism, make an image inside the whole ambient Lie group, and then you can do the restriction to the J's cusp. This I and J's cusp could be different, could be the same. So, the linear independence. The same. So the linear independence is things like when you compose these two maps, you get this delta ij times i. Meaning, like if you choose the same cusp, gamma i and gamma j, you just get identity for this composition. If you choose different i and j, different conjugacy class of the cusp, then you get zero. So this is some linear independent things like different cusp will have linear independent cohomology class representative. And then the number of cusps, And then the number of cuts is kind of like bounded by the rank of the cohort mode class. So immediately, by this linearity independence, we have the corollary says like the number of the cuts, the number of the full rank cuts is bounded by the dimension of the n's cohort model class of your ambient Lie group with the twisted quotient V. So this is what I'm using V to be the Lie adjoin, this associate adjoint representation. If you just use the trivial, If you just use the trivial representation, it's kind of also trivial because you know, like each cusp is kind of like a topological end. So, apparently, like the number of the topological ends coming from the cusp is bounded by the end-steady number of your hyperbolic manifold. This is just like by a purely topological argument. But then for the adjoint representation, we can do a little bit better. We not only have the dimension for this one, we all can also divide by this n. So, it's actually expanded by. actually expanded by n. And also like one more thing needs to mention is like usually if you use the adjoint representation, this dimension of the cohomology is very hard to compute. So there are two ways to see this corollary. One way is like maybe you can find the number of cusps. And the other way is like the other way to look at this corollary is actually we have many examples of hyperbolic manifold, there's finite many cusp. Manifold with finite many cusps or even infinite many cusp. Then, in terms of the examples we have, we actually can make some restrictions on the number on the dimension of the homology class of this whole MLE group, this adjoint representation as the coefficient module. So, that's the main theorem for the second approach. So, I have one more minute. I want to just like give a very quick sketch about how to build such homologous. Such homomorphism, and how to prove the linear independence. So that's where we use the Eisenstein series. So if you pick any elements in this homology class of this gamma Cassi, the parabolic group, and then one thing you can see is like you can find a representative, which is like an n-form inside this H cassette V. So this is the horrible, and this is the coefficient. And this is the coefficient. So, this now n will be like an n form inside the horrible in this valued in is a vector-valued n-form inside my horrible. And actually, it's also translation invariant. Now, this is only defined in my horrible, but now I want to define in the whole space. So, there is a unique way to extend this n-form to be the entire space so that your form will be closed. So, there's a unique way to make sure that your extension is closed. To make sure, like, your extension is closed. So, during this step, you don't have a choice because if you want to make sure your extension is closed, there's just a unique way. So, now you have like an M bone is defined on the whole ambient space of the whole Hm plus one. However, it is only gamma cos E invariant. It's a subgroup of gamma. So now I want this n-bone to be gamma invariant. Now, there is a very simple thing to do. It's like now I just take the left quotient of my whole group to be to left. To be to left quotient gamma cassine. And then I just take the summation of all left of all pullback of this angle and sum it over. Then you can make sure like this series will be gamma invariant. However, the since this is a series, so you should worry about whether it is convergent or not. So if it is absolutely convergent, then you don't need to worry about the closed list because each omega is closely closed. So that will win. In terms of like the convergence of the series, The convergence of this series, this is called the Eisenstein series, is exactly controlled by your Poincar√© series. And that's why here you see, like, if I choose the trivial coefficient, it will sit at this n, but we don't know whether it converges or not. So that's why we need the additional assumption. If we use the adjoint representation, it terms out this is n plus one. So it is always converges. We don't need to worry about the convergence at all. And that's why we don't need these additional assumptions if we use the adjoint representation. If we use the adjoint representation, I think that's kind of what I want to share, and this might be time over. Thank you very much for your attention. Okay, thank the speaker. Baby, did you try to make it work for each upper one? For each upper one, because there are Eisenstein series for, I mean, that's even more classical when you use one forms. You are using going to one form, but with the twisted coefficients. So there should be, but I don't know. Did you try, but it did not work? So one thing I did not say is like there are a lot of other directions for this project. Directions from this project. So, for example, you don't necessarily need to consider RAC N cusp, you can consider any RAM K cusp. That's the first generalization. And also, like Misha says, we don't necessarily need to consider HN, we can consider any HI, including H1. So, H1 usually is good because you could maybe have finitely many, like the dimension is finitely many. So, the problem for H1, we tried is like we don't know when it is non-zero or when it is zero, because for HM, you can always have this. Because for HM, you can always have this canonical volume form, and so you always have a preferred choice. But for H1, I think sometimes the structure is really not good. You have the chance like H1 is just zero, you don't get anything. I know. So again, there was one case when it was successful, this approach, namely paper by Irvin Kraft from 1984. He actually made it work, but somehow that was only in Habulic 3 space. Did you try to analyze why it Did you try to analyze why it worked or? We tried to see. Yeah, that. Yeah, we tried, but yeah, that. Successfully. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thank you. But the usual intuition somehow is that when you restrict the Eisenstein series back to Back to original cusp, you should get something non-trivial. That's the kind of
