Thursday morning session. I'm very, very happy. Got it. I am very happy to introduce Schultz. He will speak about unstrengthened version of a problem of Conway and Guy on converse polyhedron. On converts polyheater. Thank you. I thank the organizers for the opportunity to give a presentation here. Okay, and I'm trying to talk about what I promised in the title, but there are separate threads leading to the. Threads leading to the result that I'm going to talk about. So it will take some time to gather from different directions. Okay, so I start with some. Oops. Is there a problem with the type? Okay, very good. Thank you. Okay, so I'm starting with some definitions. So, I'm starting with some definitions and I touch a bit of physics. So, the topic of the talk is static equilibrium points of convex bodies, right? So, the way you can imagine them is if you balance on a horizontal plane a convex body, then at some point it will be in equilibrium, right? So, this result was investigated throughout the history of silence. History of silence, and I'd like to talk about some mathematical aspects of this concept. So, the definition is the following. If we have a convex body in Euclidean space and there is a point regarded as a reference point, then we say that the boundary point of the body is an equilibrium point if the segment PQ, sorry, the hyperplane perpendicular to the segment PQ and passing through. And passing through Q is a supporting hyperplane of the body. So there are some pictures here. Yes, this is the reference point here. This segment is perpendicular to this supporting line and here similarly, or we can use an external reference point. You use an external reference point, so it doesn't really matter according to this definition. Okay, and if the body is at least once differentiable, then equilibrium points, just the critical points of the Euclidean distance function measured from the reference point. And if it's at least twice, continues to differentiable and the Hess. Continues to differentiable and the Hessian is not degenerate at this equilibrium point, then we call this equilibrium non-degenerate. And the body is non-degenerate. Oh, yes, and the point in the plane can be stable or unstable, or in the and also several points in three dimension, depending on the negative eigenvalues of the Hessian. So I'm not seeing anything new, I guess. It's just. So I'm not seeing anything new, I guess. It's just the usual local maxima, local minima, and several points of the Euclidean distance function. Yes, and if a convex body has only finitely many equilibrium points and all are non-degenerate, then we say that the body is non-degenerate. So this is what smooth bodies. And what's worth to know is that it's a consequence of the Poincaré Hope. It's a consequence of the Poincaré-Hoff theorem that in the plane for a non-degenerate converse body, the number of stable and unstable points are equal, and in the space, the number of stable minus number of sudden plus number of unstable is equal to two. Yes. And from now on, when I see, so the reference point is fixed to be the center of mass, which is defined as usual with this inter. As usual with this integral, sometimes I will emphasize it by saying that the body has a uniform density or constant or homogeneous density function. Okay. And for convex polyhedra, well, we cannot talk about non-degeneracy in the previous sense, but one can do it geometrically, which I'm not going into details. We can talk about stable, subtle, and unstable points of a convex polyhedron. And then stable points are interior points of faces, saddle points are relatively interior points of edges, and unstable points are at vertices. And the previous corollary of the Ponkarihov theorem holds also for convex polyhedra. Yeah, so this is just some. Yeah, so this is just some picture. Yeah, so the red points are stable points, and blue points are unstable points. So, in case of a regular polygon, every side contains a stable point, and every vertex is an unstable point. But in general, it's not true. Yes, and from now on, by SUE, we denote the family of. We denote the family of three-dimensional convex bodies, either smooth or convex polyhedral, which has S-stable and U unstable points. And we don't need to care about the number of saddle points due to the Point-Karihoff theorem. And then it's yes, and it's a natural question. What can we say about these classes? So first, we know that any convex body has at least one. Any convex body has at least one stable and one unstable point because a global minimum and a global maximum are always unstable and stable, respectively. So, the question is which classes S and S U are non-empty? And the first result in this regard is due to Domokos Ruino and Papodopoulos, who proved that class one is empty, which is actually a variant of the forward axis theorem from differential geometry. If someone is If someone is familiar with it. Yes? Sorry, could you please again restate what these classes stand for? Yes. So SU means all convex bodies, smooth hand polyhedron, which has exactly S stable and U unstable points. And then it determines the number of server points. So these two parameters are enough. And similarly, in the plane, we define S. In the plane, we define S. Okay. Okay. Yes, so there is no plane converse body with only one stable and one unstable point. That's the statement here. And it's easy to see that otherwise in the plane, any other class is non-empty. Like, I don't know, you take an ellipse for two stable points and regular polygons or smooth and regular polygons if you want smooth bodies for. Smooth bodies for larger values of S. And there was a conjecture of Arnold which stated that there is a monostatic solid, meaning that it has exactly one stable and one unstable point. So this theorem of Domokoshuin and Papotopoulos is not true in three dimensions. That's the statement, or there is no counterpart of it. And this was verified by Domokosh and Varponi. So they constructed. So they constructed a convex body with homogeneous density with the property that it has exactly one stable and one unstable points, which means that no matter how you put it, somehow it rolls always into the same position, like a perfect ship, but with homogeneous density. Okay. And this body they call Gumbets. So some of you may have heard of that. So this is a Gumbets here in the picture. That's actually in the National Bank of Hungary because, surprisingly, the National Bank of Hungary chose Gumbutz as its symbol to symbolize monetary stability. Okay. And it has some interest. I mean, it appears. So there are some applications of this body. And I must say, just for the sake of what I'm trying, going. The sake of what I'm going to talk about later, that there are actually two gumbases. So, this is not the original body that they constructed because the original body was very, very close to a wall, unit wall. So, you just cannot manufacture it. And this shape can be manufactured. Yes. And yeah, this is a turtle whose shell resembles gumbits. So, it seems that some. So it seems that some turtles use muscle to turn back if they are turned upside down, but there are some turtles that use shape, like this one. Yeah. And Domokosh and Varkoni also proved that no, so all classes SU are non-empty, which actually, once you have Goombas, it's easy to see because what they did is that they just truncated it very close to already existing equilibrium points. Already existing equilibrium points and then created new equilibrium points one by one, so both stable and unstable. Yes, so this is just a picture to show representatives of these classes, right? So there is some something in each class. So that's Gumbus and there is, I don't know, a truncated infinite cylinder and you can just check for yourself. Check for yourself. So, is there something smooth in it? Yes, actually, it's easy to there. Is a smoothening algorithm, which is very standard in analysis, and you can use it here. Some kind of convolution. Yes, so this is the classification of convex solids and. And yeah, so here the first in the first first column, yes, so U stands for the columns, right? So that shows the number of unstable points. And here you can see the number of stable points. And convex bodies here with one unstable point are called mono unstable. And in the first row, they are called monostable. row they are called monostable and a body that which is both so in class one one they are called monomonostatic yeah so and and that was one part that i was going to talk about there is another part so i'm talking about uh monostable polyhedra so polyhedra with only one stable point and actually uh this concept appeared for Appeared before Arnold's conjecture and this whole examination. And it started with a problem of conveyant guy in Sciam Reviews in 1967 who has a problem, this problem, so proved that every tetrahedron with homogeneous density has at least two stable points. So there are at least two faces on which you can balance every tetrahedron. Balance every tetrahedron. So that's the question that they asked, or problem that they posed. And also, another question that they asked is a construction of a non-degenerate monostable convex polyhedron with homogeneous density. So they stated that no tetrahedron is monostable, but that there are other polyhedra that are monostable. And it's interesting, just a side remark, actually. It's just a side remark, actually, that right next to this problem, the journal published another paper due to Ladar Hepesh, who constructed a double-tipping tetrahedron. Double-tipping here means that you can choose a face so that if you put that on a horizontal plane, then it rolls twice because finding a stable position. Okay, so which is interesting because if you compare it to this problem, so if this is true that there is no monostable tetrahedron, then There is no monostable tetrahedron, then actually, that's the best that you can get, and it's even stronger, right? Because it's not that there are two faces without stable point, but that they are in a row inside on a rolling graph of the tetrahedron. And these two problems were answered two years later in the same journal. So, Cooné and Goldberg proved that. Work proved that there is no monostable tetrahedron with homogeneous density, and there is a construction of a monostable polyhedron with 19 faces. And yes? Can you move it on to the previous screen? So the problem the problem that was stated is 67, right? 67, yes. Yes, and I don't exactly know how Sim Reviews does it, but probably it poses a problem, and sometime later it returns to it if they got solutions. I don't know. Maybe some people here are more familiar with it. Yes, and yeah, so this is what they proved. And in the meantime, Shepard published an open geometric, a collection of open geometric problems paper. Paper. And actually, so Shepard knew about this construction. So, not only the original problem, but the solution. And he asked, what's the polyhedron with the smallest number, monostable polyhedron with the smallest number of faces? And yes, and actually, Andrés Berzdek has a construction, so he managed to modify the convey construction to gain one face. To gain one face. So he constructed a monostable polyhedron with 18 faces. And Reshetov made a computer search and he found a polyhedron with 14 faces. And that's the best that I know of presently. Yes, but this is actually not what I want to talk about. But in this second paper, there are a number of problems and three of them proposed by Guy. Prose by Guy, and three of them he claims were by convey. And actually, he claims that the conception is also due to convey. So, I don't know why Convey didn't put at his name to the authors, but so according to Guy Convey, did it. Okay, so the question is: are there monostable polyhedra with rotational symmetry of order n, which is greater than 2? n which is greater than two. So the original construction has a two-fold rotational symmetry and that's a natural question to ask. Can you do it with more rotational symmetry? And for the next problem, so a girth, the girth of a convex body is just the minimum perimeter of its projections. And they asked, what's the smallest possible ratio of diameter to girth for a monostable polyhedron? And the reason behind it is. And the reason behind it is because actually what they did is that they constructed a planar polygon and showed that if you elongate it long enough, so if you elongate it much, then it will become monostable. And so that's why they wanted to find the smallest ratio. And they also asked what the set of convex bodies that can be uniformly approximated by monostable polyhedra. And in particular, is it true if the sphere can be approximated? Is it true if the sphere can be approximated arbitrarily well by monostable polyhedra? And these problems appeared, some of them appeared in this article of Shepard that I mentioned, and also later, for example, in this geometry book of Croft-Falconer Guy, and there is a book of Kremkin that cites these problems, and they claim that they are due to convey. Yeah, actually, I think that they thought of Hauser distance, but I don't know exactly when it was defined. Hauser distance, I mean, but I took it as Hauser distance. How can you uniformly approximate something? Okay, so, and to state my result about this, I need some notation. This, I need some notation. So, diam k is just diameter, g of k is just girth, dh denotes houser distance, and for the sake of the younger people, I just put here the definition. So, the Hauser distance of K and L means that you want to cover K by an outer parallel body of L. So, you wonder, so you want to guarantee that every point of K is close to a point of L. To a point of L. And here you want to guarantee that every point of L is close to a point of K. And the minimum lambda, which satisfies both conditions, is called Hausdorff distance. Okay, and B3 is just a close unit Bohr center at the origin. And my result is that for any n, at least three, there is a homogeneous, and any epsilon, there is a homogeneous monocebra polyhedron. Homogeneous monostable polyhedron, which has an n-fold rotational symmetry and which is closer to the unit ball than epsilon with respect to Hauser distance. So this answers the first question, right, because we have the required symmetry and half of the last question because we can approximate the unit ball. And actually, it answers the second question because it's easy to see that for any convex body, diameter divided by Girls is minimal for Euclidean ball. Earth is minimal for Euclidean boss. So I think you believe it. So it answers the second question: that this formula stable polyhedra, the minimum of this quantity is one over pi. So what's left open is the first half of the third question. And I'd like to say a few words about the proof. And just before I do it, I'd like to claim that I couldn't really construct such a polyhedron, so I cheated. And I'd like to tell you how I cheated. And for that, I distinguish two families of these convex bodies with S stable and U1 stable points. So S you see denotes the smooth ones, and there is a technical condition. Is a technical condition that I need, which is that at each equilibrium point, the Gaussian curvature, so the product of the principal curvatures is positive, strictly positive. And by SUP, I denote the family of convex polyhedra with these numbers of stable and unstable points. And center just means that the center of mass physiology. Mass physiology. And what I could prove is that if epsilon is given, SU are given, and you take any subgroup of the orthogonal group, then for any centered G-invariant convex body, smooth convex body, there is a centered G-invariant convex polyhedron which approximates your body within distance epsilon. Okay, so it means that any Okay, so it means that any family in the first can be approximated by arbitrarily well from a member by a member in the second family in such a way that the numbers of the stable and acpoles remain the same and you preserve the symmetric group. So that's the statement. And this implies also that there is a polyhedral gumbit, right? Because if there is a smooth gumbas, then there is a polyhedron. There is a smooth gambler and there is a polyhedral gambler. And so, this is the cheat here: the trick here: that I construct a smooth body, which is very easy. I will just give an idea how to do it. And then we use this approximation theorem. And I'd like to, okay, yes, so the construction or a sketch of how to find such a smooth body. Find such a smooth body, monostable smooth body close to the ball, you just pick the vertex set of a regular angle and put small cones. So you take the convex hull of the sphere, you lift up these vertices so they are slightly above the sphere, and you take the convex hull, and then the resulting shape will be a sphere, but here there are some small coles and you can. Small cores, and you can check that it lifts up a little bit the center of mass, so it won't be the origin, but slightly above it, right? Which means that here at the south pole, you will have an unstable point. At the north pole, you will have a stable point. You have the required symmetry, and you can check that. Well, here, the apexes of the cones are unstable points, and there are some saddle points you can just check. And there are some saddle points you can just check. Of course, it's not smooth, but so there is a little bit of technicality here how to smoothen out and to guarantee strict Gaussian curvature at the equilibrium points, but you can do it. So this is how to construct such a body. And what I'd like to remark here is that the reverse approximation is easy. So if you have a convex polyhedron, You have a convex polyhedron and you want to approximate it with a smooth convex body, then actually it's enough to just take the Minkowski sum of the ball and the polyhedron. So it's easy. And the other way is not easy, which is for me at least quite counterintuitive. So if you take just a straightforward approach, so I don't know, you parametrize a shape and use equidistant partition of this parameter range, then independent. Parameter range, then independently of the parametrization, you get the same number of equilibrium points on the polyhedral shape, but this number is strictly greater than the original number. So you can compute it. It depends on the principal curvatures at the equilibrium points of the smooth body and I don't know the distance from the reference point. So you need to do, so this is difficult and that makes up the majority of The majority of the proof. And at that time, I thought that then the real question is not to find a monostable polyhedron, but a mono-monostatic polyhedron with this symmetry, which is a stronger statement, right? And that's what I like to talk about actually, at least a little bit. But before I can state the result, I'd like to discuss just one language. Uh, discuss just one lemma from the previous proof, right? So, the previous proof, previous theorem stated so that the approximation theorem stated something like that you can preserve the symmetry groups. So, what are these possible symmetry groups? Well, so I claim that they are all finite. So, for every non-degenerate convex body, the symmetric group is finite. And I just sketched a proof. Okay, so the origin is the center of mass, and then the symmetric. Mass and then the symmetric group is just a subgroup of all three, the three-dimensional orthogonal group. So, if you assume that G is infinite, then you can check that G is a closed subgroup of G. What is non-degenerate? Non-degenerate means that all equilibrium points are non-degenerate and there are just finitely many of them. Non-degenerate I defined for smooth, it means that the Hessian is not non-degenerate. Non-degenerate, so the determinant is non-zero. For polyhedral, there is some geometric condition. If you want, I can tell you, but it's not that important, I guess. Okay, so the symmetric group is a closed subgroup of the orthogonal group. And then there is a theorem, Cartan's closed subgroup theorem that it's a least subgroup of all three. And these are known. And these are known, these are these subgroups of all three. This is a very classical Lie group, so up to conjugacy, it contains SO2 if it's infinite, which means that the body is rotationally symmetric. But then, since we have finitely many equilibrium points, it means that there can be only two where the axis of rotation intersects the boundary. So it's mono-monostatic. We have one stable and one unstable points. Stable and one unstable points, and these points are on the axis of rotation. And there is just a little geometric observation which shows that it's impossible. So there is no rotationally symmetric monomonostatic convex body. So this is the proof. And just one remark before we move forward that since for a non-degenerate berry body, so there are At very, but so there are finitely many stable and unstable points, and they are invariant. I mean, the set is invariant under any symmetry, which is kind of trivial. But it means that if k has a unique stable or unstable point, then it's a fixed point of any symmetry. So the statement is the following. If f is either the monomonostatic family of monomonostatic small Family of monomostatic smooth bodies or polyhedra, then the following are true. The symmetric group of any element of F is a discrete two-dimensional point group. And for any discrete two-dimensional point group, and any epsilon, there is an element of F, whose symmetric group is this given group, and which approximates the unit ball within distance epsilon. Okay, and then what are the two-dimensional point groups? Discrete two-dimensional point groups. These are just the cyclic group and the dihedral group. And actually, I told you the proof of the first statement here, because we have seen that any symmetric group is finite. And if K is monostable or mono-unstable, then all symmetry has a fixed point. All symmetry has a fixed point, but then it has a, and also the axis of rotation is fixed, right? Sorry, the center of mass is also fixed. So there is an axis-fixed line for every symmetry. So it must be a two-dimensional point group. And this discrete because it's finite. Okay, so what is a point group? Actually, I don't know why it's called that. I'm not a symmetric group. It's called that I'm not a symmetric group person, but this is how they are called. So, subgroups, discrete subgroups of the orthogonal group which have a fixed direction are called two-dimensional point groups. Okay, so we've proved the first statement and to prove the second statement, it's enough to prove it for smooth convex values because we have this approximation theorem from the previous result. The previous result, and if we have a given symmetry, then we can destroy some of the symmetries if we just modify the original body a little bit. So, actually, we need to prove this statement only for the dihedral group and even for large values of n, it's enough to prove it. Yes, and so that's the question: how to construct a mono-monostatic smooth body with Smooth body with DM symmetry. So it's a kind of a Gumbus construction again. And fortunately, the original construction of Gumbus works here, but of course, there is a modification. I mean, I'm talking about a modified version. And this will be, and there are two differences compared to the original construction. One is that it has a DNC. One is that it has a DN symmetry, right? And the other one is that the original construction was not C2 class. So, because there was a problem with the two poles, the two equilibrium points. So, it was clear that these are only possible because the gradient is no zero anywhere. So, these are the only equilibrium points, but it was not C2. Okay, so but our construction will be C2. Okay, so we actually. Okay, so we actually define a two-parameter family of star bodies, star-shaped bodies, with the property that for any choice of the parameter, the symmetric group is dm. It's C2 class, its boundary C2 class, and it has exactly one stable and one unstable point with respect to the origin. So this is true for every value of C and D. And then And then we show that for a suitable choice of the parameters, this body has positive Gaussian curvature at every boundary point, so it's convex. The center of mass is the origin, and it's very close to the ball. So that's the structure of the proof. But first, I need to define this two-parameter family, and that's only what I like to talk about. The actual proofs are not. Actual proofs are not that important, I think. Just to give a picture how it looks like. How much time do I have? Oh, 10 minutes. Thank you. Okay, so first I'd like to define a one parameter function, FCX, which is, well, you can see the formula, but of course, the properties are important. And the properties, so this is how it looks like for different values of C. You can see. Different values of C, you can see it. The only important thing is that here at zero and at one, the derivative is one. I mean, the one-sided derivative is one. So it starts always in the direction of this diagonal. Okay, so that's required for actually to make it C2 plus. And then we just make a linear transformation on these functions. So we change actually just the rate. So we change actually just the range and the domain. So instead of one zero, we want minus pi half pi half here. Okay, so this is Fc theta. And G C theta is minus F C minus theta, which means that is the reflection with respect to the origin, right? So if I go back, Fc is just, looks like these curves, and G C looks like the reflections about the midpoint of the diagram. About the midpoint of the diagonal. Okay. And then we just define some ugly function here and don't ask why because it's not my part. I just accept what Peter said actually. So this is some combination of trigonometric functions sine and cos F C and cos G C. Cos FC and cos GC. But so this is how it looks like for different values of theta. There are some important properties. One is that it's always between zero and one. So we want to use it actually as a weight later. And it's periodic with respect to phi. So it starts at one for phi equal to zero. for phi equal to zero then it reaches zero at phi equal to pi over n and it symmetrically goes upwards until two pi over n and then it's repeated so it's p raised to pi over n so this is how it looks like and and then we just define this raw c u function so u is just a unit vector in polar coordinates and so you can And so you can see that you take sine of Fc and sine of GC and the convex combination, where the weight is actually this ugly AC that I defined. So if you want to imagine, so you can imagine that this was always below the diagonal, this was always above the diagonal, so the sign of them is, sine of this is negative. Sine of this is negative, the sine of that is positive. And this function here somehow provides a smooth transition from one to the other. And the period with respect to phi is was 2 pi over n. So you can imagine it as an orange with n slices, right? And then in the middle of each slice, you can find this function. And on the boundary, you can find this function. Bounder, you can find this function, and somehow it changes some transition. Okay, and then the radial function of our star-shaped body, so the distance from the origin is given like this. So, the second parameter D appears only here. Okay, so for example, you can see that if D is very small, then this is very close to the sphere. So, if we already know that it's C. So, if we already know that it's C2 class, then all curvatures will become strictly positive. So, it will be convex. And yes, so you can see some of these bodies here. I think n here is equal to 2. So for D, when D is equal to them, you just get the unit ball. So it's not that difficult to write. And if C is one, you get also balls, but bigger balls. Bigger balls, and here if C gets closer to zero, then it's more and more distorted. So, this is the body. And so you can just prove what I stated, you need to prove that it's C2 class and it satisfies all these properties. And then you get some monomonostatic body with rotational symmetry. This is an illustration for three-fold rotational symmetry. Symmetry: this body, the color indicates the distance from the origin. And you can see that this is really close to the sphere. So, actually, if you want the construction to work, you need to go close to the sphere. Yes. And so it looks a bit like a tennis ball, or I don't know. Just so the way you move. So the way you modify the weight or C, then the blue part will get bigger or the green part will get bigger. So somehow you can just operate. You can just fix your center of mass to be the origin this way. So you can choose. Be the origin this way. So you can choose the values of C and D to guarantee that the center of mass is the origin, right? Just by making the blue region bigger or the green region bigger. So this is actually what I wanted to talk about. Thank you for your attention. Okay, well, thank you very much. Comments? Yes. Around the beginning, in the first couple of slides, you had the formulas like h minus s plus u, right? And they look S plus U, right? And they look they look like Euler's characteristic. Is it coincidental, or is it actually an Euler characteristic for something? It's it's it's yes, it's either characteristic. So there is a corresponding graph, right, for these? Yes, I mean it's actually Morse theory there, but Morse theory theory is about either characteristics. So Euclidean distance function is a Morse function on the sphere. And then the number it's. The number it's known that yes, it's yes, it's it's the it's the point carries for me got it thank you just can you say just a few words about this approximation theorem how you how you get a polyhedron I mean not the technical details but if if you can just say If you can just say the idea. Okay, there are three steps. And there are two delicate parts. One is how to do it near equilibrium points. So you need to do it properly near equilibrium points. You need to take care of preserving the symmetric groups, but that's not that difficult. The difficult is how to guarantee that only one stable point appears near a stable point and one set of point near us. And that's why. One set of monieras, and that's why you need to use this condition that the principal ADI are positive. Because if it's a degenerate, then just, yeah, it's difficult. So that's the first part. Second part is, yes, so there. So you just truncate. Yes, sorry. The keyword is truncating. So you have a smooth body and you truncate it, but and you want to truncate all the all the boundary. To truncate all the boundary, so first you do this truncation near. No, no, no. First, sorry, it was a long time ago. So first, you want to guarantee that at the end, you can get back the origin as a center of mass. So you choose some points symmetrically where you truncate, so make a kind of, I don't know, cone, polyhedral cone, and then you by Then you, by truncating the apexes of this cone and choosing the heights of the truncation up to a certain degree, you can just move the center of mass within a region. Okay, so there is a small neighborhood of the origin within which you can move back the center of mass to the origin. Okay, so and then you keep these regions fixed, then you truncate near equilibrium points and you take care. Equilibrium points, and you take care that the truncations are small enough so that you can move back at the end. And then you can use some kind of epsilon net to truncate all the other boundary points. And then by choosing these parameters that you set up in the beginning, you can move back the center of mass to the origin. Yeah, that's it. Any more questions, maybe from the people online? Poll online, so so my question would be: if uh, did you consider uh like other groups, like for example, if you take the symmetry group of the dodecahedron, obviously in that case, you cannot hope for I mean, you proved that you cannot get one, one, right? Yes. Maybe it's maybe it's too easy, but what is the minimum? Maybe there's a theoretical minimum from algebra, right? Theoretical minimum from algebra, right? I mean, if you look at the orbits of points and like so you mean that not in class one, but some in some other class to construct dodacahedral symmetry? Yes, you couldn't you could you fix the symmetry group, yes? Yes. For example, the dodecahedron, the symmetry group, and then and then you ask what's the minimum number you can achieve minimum number of what of uh What of stable and unstable points? Yes, yes, yes, is that symmetry because now the algebra will tell you that because of the it's basically you look for the lowest orbit, but maybe I'm wrong. I mean, the smallest orbits are and then obviously you can't go below that, right? Because obviously. Yes, so so I think what we did more or less works for monostable and mono-instable. Maybe there are some little technical details that That needs to be taken care of. But it works. And it's a good question how to do it for the symmetric groups in any SU class. Yes, probably he's out. Thank you. Okay. So did you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so actually we started this investigation. We started this investigation to do it for any SU class, which covers your question, as I understand it. But we didn't finish it. I mean, there are only finitely many groups, right? Yes, yes, there are only finitely many groups. With outside of the cyclic ones. Yes, so it's a matter of work. So I think actually it's good for, I don't know, PhD problem. A problem for a PhD student. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any more questions, people online? Just shout if you have questions. Okay, well, let's thanks Schultz once more.
