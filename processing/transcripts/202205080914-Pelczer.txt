So if you go back, well I have all the reading books from ninety three they started, they have many questions like this work, and then don't have that work, but again, something that teachers really should use these. But still processes, but more about what kind of About what kind of again initial state and final state, and how you can, but it's possible to achieve a certain final state. So, these are, again, there are some rules of the game, and you are asking if I start with this initial state, can I end up with that final state? And these are, again, very interesting questions in general. Later on, in much higher grades, they can go with these ideas in variants and stuff like that. Like that. Lower rates, it's more just understanding how things must happen. Confirmation is not possible. So you couldn't find it quickly, but there was another year, four, five, six, with that piling of the tokens in a different, slightly different context a few years ago. There's a big repetition of ideas. I mean, after you start seeing ten years of questions, you say, okay, that's a big recycling of this. That's a big recycling of this going on, which is normal. I mean, you can find new interesting context to use the very same idea when you're doing it. Yeah, so that is a very nice thing again. It's just about understanding the process and what we can going through. Maybe for a contest, the thing is that they need to go through the The options, sometimes you can eliminate some options. Obvious, for example, symmetrical ones you can eliminate very quickly, but otherwise you would need to check each option. Then, let me put it up here the second one. Two years ago, we had the cars. We have the options there. So we have this thing with the cars, and this year we have the LFS, which is exactly the same stuff. So just, you know, I mean, same idea, it's not exactly the same. And again, And again, it's a very simple one, but very nice, and you just have to understand what is going on. How much they took them to draw, make that drawing in ticks, but they might be excellent. Okay, so again, it's really the same idea, it's just in a different context and organizing. In a different context and organize, it's something about what is going on again, some rules of what can happen and just understand clearly. They are very nice in the same type. That was problem 11, so section 4, 4 points question. This one, I guess I took it out, but probably it was the number 4 points. It's not too hard, but that's not necessary three problems. And still in the section of processes, if you want to ask questions, because I'm kind of advancing too fast for my hour, but you can just kind of relating back to some of the stuff we're seeing in the university. We're seeing in the university setting. The problems that we propose, or problems that we use in our test, they want now at the university level for the problems to include examples about indigenous culture or EDI components or gender neutral. Are these things that we should be considering in our problems as well? Would we? I don't think so. Problems as well, but we don't worry about this. But if you come up with something at the university level, this sort of thing. And I'm just wondering what... I mean, again, if you come up with some interesting program that would have contexts reasonable, like indigenous, they have really interesting kind of way to see things. So there might be something format that would Format that would relate, but you don't have to think that way, okay? So just if you have ideas for good programs. Yeah, I'm just saying, even in mathematics, they're saying, you know, for the names, try to pick names that are more culturally appropriate. Instead of using Lucas and Jonathan, pick names from different cultures that may be involved in the contact. Maybe these are some things bye. Some things by Robinson. Thank you. I mean, I'm not only saying that we should, I'm saying maybe it's something that we should think about. That's something we can fix at country level. So sometimes we might change the names, for example, that we use just because. I mean, Valeria and I had a conversation the other day about the fact that if we were to look culturally at who is taking the math bandwidth in Canada, we're going to see some patterns. We're going to see some patterns. Indian students, Chinese students, Eastern European students. Maybe some of the names in the problem should be from those countries so the students can relate with the problem. I relate with the problem structure. I don't really care what's in the, I mean, yeah, I think I see it differently. Can I sorry? I know you want to talk. I would even for the classes and for the context problems, I would like seeing more interesting, like more culturally diverse meetings. Like more culturally diverse names, and I think we have that, like, even in our courts, probably some of the news. Yeah, and I think if we use pictures of students, of middle kids, you know, yeah, like different, more culturally diverse, I think that's that's nice. If we have a kid who will chair a picture of that, if it's relevant to the problem, I think that's nice. Yeah, because like you said, yeah, for our population, you know, the student problem in Singapore. Yeah, I just wanted to mention, I just said that, like, in my opinion, up to you guys, like, for the context. Opinion up to you guys. Like for the contest problems and for the small class classes, the problems in the classes, I'm happy to see more like the things that are more culturally diverse. But there are many cultural redivers from different countries, but if we want f from Canada, so f for sure. At least the problems that uh let's say talk about uh are not Say, talk about knots or some weaving patterns. We can kind of assign this to native people that use in native art. That's what I can think of, but I agree, kind of tend to agree with Perusik, that this is an international event and from all those countries we're talking about there will be culture specific problems proposed anyway. Proposed anyway. I mean, there's no harm in us going with names like that as well, but people, I mean, showing Canada as a multicultural can be done, not necessarily with a name. I just want to support what my colleague said. We can definitely use indigenous names, but make it Intimidate names, but make it shorter. Sometimes I heard from kids writing content why these names sound so strange. Make it shorter readable, because if kid reads the name, he reads an A, not just R A B. And at my university, we worked bash academic here, we worked in person, and we had just calculated three meetings. I just calculated three meetings about indigenization. And I openly asked how could I indigenize my calculus courses? And I mean, at least some applications, maybe find something from the history of development. How did they develop this mathematical knowledge? How did they calculate maybe differently? How do they do this differently from European origin? From European or Greek people. So that would be advice, and I feel that we have to do somehow in here in Canada. So it would be a nice gesture if we use... I mean, we see it in the problems already, I saw it. Anya was a name that was there. I think we just need to be aware of it and where we can, you know, make some adjustments. What's EDI? Equity, diversity, and inclusion. Yeah, equity. Well, okay, so one other thing. If you put in a great one, and the poor guys don't read very well, and you put their, they indigenize the names in every. They indigenise the names in Edmonton. My own word is called something with forty letters in one word, you know. So if you miss such a name there, I don't think it will help the kids, you know, that try to research. Advance it much more. So another thing is let's be two, you know, because I see a lot of hypocrites into this. So if we put some names there, we will really help them. The real help would be if we convince more kids, especially. Convince more kids, especially the little ones, you know, because they can start from the beginning, from reserves and stuff like that, to participate here. Th this would be something that I will support. But just knowing like they do now, like we are EDI overall and we are indigenized everything. And in my university, they are, you know, everything we do is this. But then how many students we have which are indigenous? Very few. And now doing calculus the way they did it in the prairie are you. They did it in the prairie. Are you kidding me? They did no calculus. What's so hard to do? They can have some arithmetics. You know, for example, here in university, no? Like, do it in the first class, second class, not in calculus, because they have no idea what is this. Okay, so let's go with the programs. Can go ahead and have one short remark. We can decide to do whatever we can find appropriate. But keep in mind that. But keep in mind that we shouldn't, all these questions that we put in our contest papers, we don't realize that we have some perceptions of how this has to be perceived and read by the students. And you will be surprised how creative they are to read it differently. So anything that is not kind of common sense or that could be subject to interpretation, culturally specific interpretation, we should try to stay away from this. We should try to stay away from this because this changes the problem as a problem. Because it's not just numbers, we have a text. And Rusita will agree with me that before, when we kind of tried to edit the questions ourselves, we always asked ourselves, okay, how a kid could read it differently? And we tried to prevent all these kinds of things. And every year there'll be a kid that would come with their own interpretation that we didn't figure out. That we didn't figure out, and in their own mind, it kind of makes sense. So they could come up with another answer that, in their mind, because of their interpretation, would become kind of correct answer. So it's something that we have to try to keep it simple and not ambiguously perceived by the students because they're very creative. Rosita, you've been in the groups at the KSF meeting and certainly problems are coming from all over the world. So are you seeing like So are you seeing like different types of problems like what you're talking about, I honestly haven't seen anything. So it's kind of now kind of, I don't know, trendy, I would say, but you never know what it's going to be in three years. So I think we shouldn't be silly. Okay, let's come up with programs if they are nice and if they incorporate some idea. Some idea, fine, but they should be clear. We present this problem to other countries. You keep in mind that it's an international contest, it's not only Canadian contest, so we kind of incorporate the Canadian culture mainly. Yeah, there could be some problems, but not necessarily to make a lot of effort to do that. I think it's it's just a problem comes naturally. The program comes naturally, nice, and I don't think we need to focus on other than the program itself. Can we signal lasting? I just remember that, like, when I was young, when I was reading math books, it's always about boys, you know, like the programs, and then the pictures are always boys. So I think we have moved from there to now, or we include girls, and that's really great to see. And I think the next step, if you just change the names to like Singapore. Names or like simple, more culturally diverse names, but I'm sure we can find that. It's very simple things. I think that's my place to start. And we do. Sometimes the French people that translate in French, they would suggest, oh, this is a nice French name. Can we please use this name? Sure, like we have French-speaking people and with French names. Why not use a name that is entirely French and for the Canadian, for the English papers as well? We can use one English, one French neighbor, and one native like the white Dutch. But there are actually 800 nations. Actually, there are interesting problems with some interesting names. But let's focus. We don't have time. I hear the English. I mean, yeah, definitely. That's open issue. But I think the bigger issue is what Valeria said to be even a real life question, not to Real life question, not to approach it as real life, but really understand that, all right, this is the context, but we want you to see it mathematically. And that's something again that should happen in school. Yeah, every year we had kids who are in the school. No, we're not doing it to anybody or wherever in Canada that has an indigenous background. Because I suspect that they have their own traditional kind of smart questions and they might be interesting. And they might be interesting for you. We may talk to people. I don't see if we have anybody that comes home. If we can find some. We can talk to some people that would suggest something. That's another story, but it is. It's a smart idea that they traditionally use. I mean, not a simple name. What is a name? They talk artificially making it. But if we can borrow, you know, and integrate there. Talk to people if you find some interesting idea, use it and propose problem like that. So everybody is free to do that. Everybody is free to do that. But when you translate them, you keep the names, because I notice in the context we have like names in I don't know, Russian names and German names. You have these different names. That's really interesting to see. So that's a middle. But short names. Still on processes, as I said, this is really again it's a Again, this is one example because we have from up to five, six, but the idea is again you have some transformation, something is happening, so you have a process such that you transform an initial state again, you have to get to a different state. It's again an idea that has been similar goes more on the idea of invariant so the invariant and go that for smaller kids of course it's just understanding the whole configuration but for as you move up to larger configurations you you need to understand functions that exist and so yeah so again as I said Yeah, so again, as I said, there are quite a good number of problems with these processes, transformations, some kind of rules that we are applying, and it's about understanding and applying those rules. Or mix similar so that questions are adapted to. I believe, and it makes it harder. Yeah, well, the idea is to make it proper to be. It must be different. So they never liked the idea if you have the same basically kind of thing and very small change for other levels. So there should be some kind of mathematical change in the solution process. Not only kind of very simple difference. They don't like right there. They don't like what they would say, oh, this is the same problem. Mina change. Yeah. And so there are also word problems where you see that it's again the very same context, but it's changed such that the solution process changes from one data to and we had it also in seven days. 2020, maybe or 2020. It must have been a microphone. Aldric, do you remember? It was very recent. It was very recent, yeah. Yeah, I just took it from 2018. Okay, so then you have these balance questions sometimes, or in which basically are inequalities and With boring symptoms, finding out some relation here, and again, you can adapt that to go for different levels. So this was for 3.5, 6. Usually, this remains in these levels, and not go. Again, this is quite interesting because it's sort of many of these questions are such that you have. Or such that you have a short way and a longer way, which I really like, that you, you know, a chance to everybody, it depends on. Yeah, so same idea, just somehow start for the higher level. Integrating. Or as it was five six there is grams. So what So, what are they using, you said? Usually, they don't suggest not quite to avoid, but of course, if some program really can't work without, so you can put the other one. That's the suggestion to avoid. Well, if you have 10, 20, 30, 40, whatever. Because they may not know in grade 1 to 1, because everybody knows when they go and why. Everybody knows when they go and buy candies, for example. Anyway, so I'm seeing just the difference here. I don't know why, but anyway. Well, they don't learn Gramsci. Oh, yeah. Well, it's not in the curriculum, at least in Quebec, it's not in the curriculum. Not able to get out so much. And in Alberta, they know better how. They're not better they know better common than than crops. But they usually use in the storage. In the storage pods, right. Yeah, and then you have again another situation. This is again a standard problem. Almost every year we have something about folding and what happens when you perlapping and so on. This year we had also a bunch of them with symmetries and and again going through from And again going through from one, two up to five, six we had also this kind of boarding and shapes over micro and stuff. So this is again a context where you can work at different levels and coming up with how to modify the questions. So that is what just um What are possible or not, and then four, five, six, which is possible. Same idea for the process and you know, the main thing is that the main Foiling process, and you know, the question is better to understand in context. I wanted to compare that kind of see how compared to. Bare, like, kind of see how it plays, but this is not exactly the same. Oops, view and page width view. Ah, no, let's just make it like this because then I can so then you have these transformations. I didn't find exactly this one in other levels, but again, these kind of rules of transforming numbers are very common. Numbers, these are very common in the examiner past two, three years lower levels, but it's quite often you have some sort of change, and again you have to understand how these numbers are changing so you can find these processes and numbers too. They're not hard, just again about understanding things happen when we have. Then we had also this with transforming numbers of five five, six and seven, eight is what I get to problems did not include the the little games. Those are again very interesting problems and usually they go at the end of the paper because they can be really hard when you have some Hard when you have some day going on, again, it's about rules and how you can play it, but usually are quite complex. And another context that you can easily modify for different levels, it's very similar to what Valeria showed yesterday with rectangles and parameters. You can find it in the context of parameters, but also in this type of context. So here I think it's very clear. So this is the one, two Anna Mary, Mary John, but you also have crossroad to Mary. But then, so it's basically multi-step drawing. But the same idea is we used differently in three, four. So you had you remember probably this question. Remembering probably this question. So, you need to combine several elements such to add up and take out. So, this is algebra without algebra, that's what we were discussing. Again, I think these are very important types of questions for kids because they need to manipulate whole expression instead of figuring out every element separately. So, this is Be four and in five, six we have again quite often we have the very same idea, just combine different elements and take out the extract. So yeah, this is very close. These type of questions, I see them very close to what they should be doing in school. So this is really something that again should work a lot in school, just like the exchange games and so on. Definitely topics for teachers to work on. And I just let the last one, the configuration. So again, quite often we have that you have certain configuration, then you just have to figure out what, and it's an incredible what is the state or how many you have of a certain element, um, and you know, you can make complex working in this way. Let's not keep it invisible. Okay, so slightly different, but it's just like you know, this setup, it's formulated with conversion once, it's just voice in the other. The question is slightly different, but still you have does not mean that you're solving them identically general. Um just general idea used in the same context for generating different types so this came up also in the right way. So these were the ones I uh selected as um reusing the context to generate different. Using the context to generate different problems because this was to show how if we can come up with this context that we can generate several problems that would be really great. Questions, discussion? I also have a few favorites there, but that's a different question. I thought that would be a good question. That's a different question. I thought that we were discussing this. So I think in general it's not easy to make good progress. It's quite hard actually to make good progress. It's a lot of work. But if we would have a good set on which to work and which to kind of refine and so on, that's that Countries get the problems selected frequently. I think this would be Denmark always they come with problems that have nice images, graphics and context is interesting. The context usually they think, yeah, interesting. And they select usually theirs. Greece, they submit many problems, as they mentioned, hundreds sometimes, and he submits usually very good problems because he is in geometry and always has interesting solids and geometry problems. Not only, but mainly, I would say. There will be many problems from geometry that usually are selected. Well, in geometry, you have, I mean, as you go in up, even in the upper grades, you have like five things you need to know to solve them. Recognize, and there are not big variety of geometrical knowledge we are using in the common up to seven, eight, nine, ten. But they are not necessarily known in schools, so that's that is why it's become a challenge. It's really like solid cubes. Exactly. Solid cubes. Exactly. Solid. Cubes to get the arranged in some way, vis how you see them. So solid. Yeah, he has always many problems like that throughout all grades, all levels. And they often get selected because again there are visuals, there are kind uh it it seems uh they like uh uh problems with uh pictures, but not necessarily. Usually they aim also to Usually they aim also to select text programmes, but mostly for younger grades sometimes every programme will be. I'm not a mathematician, so every year one of the funnest things for me to do is to do the problems for the first time and I always find it so interesting and so creative. So they put jobs to everyone who can go. It's continuous people that are proposing this program. So it's really works by the point. Work by the whole international mount community. So, what's on that mural there? No, well, that was about when they found mass graves of indigenous people. So, then we have an indigenous center close to the metro, Montreal, Montreal. That center, I guess, they faced this on the translation. You know it and still keep quiet. I just want to just appreciation for what Nico is doing, because I think it should be one person and maybe not one person, but I'm Maybe no one person, but a person that accumulates all these problems from years before and use his or her expertise to say this is a problem, deja vieu I saw before, thus this is a problem that fits the style of kangaroo. So honestly, I don't feel what Ildiga feels about these problems because she saw so many of them. She saw so many of them from different weights, and she understands the style, the taste of math angle problems much better than the regular person, even from mathematical area. So I think you have to value this experts in the area of math kangaroo. And this is a very routine and difficult job. So we have to have such people in our team. Have such people in our team, and my appreciation. No, no, honestly, that's not a compliment at all. I'm impressed with what are you doing year after year after year. Not everybody could do this. I'm really, truly impressed. Well, thank you, but I have to say that you know the working groups, well, everybody does groups. Yes, but in Canada. And I'm sure Baleria is also very knowledgeable about special niche of mathematical expertise. It's neither mainstream kind of arithmetic, it's neither kind of sophisticated mathematics. It's something in between. It's something in between, and that's where the hardest part is to find people that understand, that can promote, that can basically trigger this. Because you either get people that are kind of accountants straight, more or less, like crunching numbers, or you get people that are really into the mathematical research. And this is where also parents have difficulties helping with their children. So when they are you get like a parent that is in engineering or in science, like In engineering or in science, like strong background, and sees these problems, and they freak out because they said, Okay, how can I explain to my child grade three how to do this? I have to teach them a system of equations. And that's what they do. They basically, you can hear in these classes, like younger kids' classes, you can hear an explanation from a child who got an answer. They said, When you move this to this side, you'll get negative answers, negative sign, etc. Okay, forget about it. Negative sign, etc. It says, okay, forget about moving. There is no such operation as moving around signs. So that's exactly what is the richest part because when you are trained to think this way, sometimes you don't need algebra even because the alien solution or this unusual solution gets a shortcut through the algebra solution. But it's hard to get it true, especially from like the universe that we are dealing with. That we are dealing with. One thing that I want to mention: there is a new 2020 math curriculum that I want to create in Ontario. I'm not very much familiar with it, and I don't believe that it's ever implemented as intended, because it was put in paper and then it was copied. So everybody went back to the basics and kind of trying to mitigate it at least a little bit. But they introduced a new strand. Introduced a new strand in the curriculum: coding. What? Coding. Yes. And programming. So, for example, what Tel Deepo showed us in the processes questions. You have to figure what happens, what kind of steps are in what cycle. Students are given such kind of questions and such kind of tasks. For example, you have to draw a square, but you have to put it step by step. You have to put it step by step and kind of using some sort of pseudocode to kind of list the steps. I don't know, like given the observations that I have, to me, this is another watering down of what they actually have already limited time to do. But it's just kind of a nuance of something that is already in the curriculum, and they have to come up with some sort of resources. So these questions will probably. So, these questions would probably fit at some point, but I don't really know what they are going to make out of it. Because there are good ideas like project-based learning. Excellent buzzword. But when you see in class, what kind of project-based learning can you do in grade four that is meaningful to this generation of kids that know everything about the world now? About the world now. And that has to also enrich their math skills and enrich them in a way that not only getting this particular answer, but taking some piece of knowledge to be applicable like in many other contexts. So again, it's very artificially done. And I suspect this might end up being something like this, but it's there. So if you're interested, I can send you links to the curriculum just to have a look at what is there. To see if we have it. To see if we have it. Oh, you two have it already? Very. We just take away. Yeah, I have no idea what the benefit of it is unless they make more classes. I see a benefit of having this kind of algorithmic introduction. In terms of programming, great, yes, because this is where the entire kind of society is going, but it's a completely different subject if they want to invest in it. Invest in it. Also, I really see a value of having this historical and kind of question-specific from, let's say, other cultures that they did that. But I see it more in the aspect of history of mathematics rather than like shortcuts to the mathematical knowledge that you need to have in order to go through your life without any problems, like to be able to function. I had a course, Journey through Math. Course, journey through mathematics through ages, journey through ages in mathematics. And it's interesting if we can find something in elementary mathematics, the other ethnical group of people were doing mathematics completely in different way. They didn't multiply the way we multiply them. They didn't add like big numbers, especially in not positional number systems. So if I come up with some problems like that, I was impressed myself because you think like straightforward, this is what I know. Oh, why they did this this way they did. And sometimes this is very elementary, but it has a very good logic underneath. So if we ask how this can be possible or just send people in a direction unusual, then Direction unusual. Very simple logic, but unusual. It catches you, it catches you and just sends your mind into a completely different world. So I would appreciate this kind of problems. Yeah, I agree. I used to have kind of a unit, a small unit in mathematics classes on history of numbers, like how Melanian numbers worked, what system, etc. Worked what system, etc. It was the favorite topic of the grade ones to grade fours. But it's kind of curious mathematics, more or less. It's fine, it's great, it helps you develop, but practically speaking, like you need to know kind of the mainstream of math that you're going to use. We won't go back to Roman numbers. No, we won't. It's going to position a system, but we are using Roman numerals. Anyway, no, we do have that. Yeah, I mean, uh regarding the coding part, uh I have been known to plead for including problems like that. Let's say problems with um number systems like auto and X and etc. Because this is the reality now everything's computerized. So I intend to propose a couple of problems like that. Just knowing that they may not know the profession I might know a doctor binary case. But of course, this is good for training sessions, so kind of by the way, uh during uh twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen, uh and twenty nineteen as well uh 19 as well. I ran in AutoWorld a parallel computer science part of the kangaroo with problems like that. And yes, in the text of the problems, I did include the explanation binary system with this and this briefly. And then which of the following numbers are odd, which are even things like that. So it is possible to touch on those areas. To touch on those areas on the mathematics of computing? That's probably another niche because several people here have basically a research interest and background in computer science. Maybe if you find something that is applicable, it will be another interesting kind of them of questions. We were talking yesterday about a Talking yesterday about a certain level of grade where we want them to start thinking in steps, right? And there's a certain grade where you hit where, okay, now if the problem has three or four steps, this would be appropriate for this age group. I think that's kind of the direction that they, maybe the audio. Yeah, steps always, but in terms of a program, so you know that you have the steps, you have cycles, you have kind of conditions. But some of that stuff's too advanced for But some of that stuff is too advanced for the younger. Algorithm, like algorithms in computer science or algorithm you have in maths, algorithms, obviously. But I mean are there grades where you can say the first three steps of the algorithm are this, what's the next step? Is that appropriate for certain grades? I don't even know. Well, depends. Yeah, no overall, like generally. Overall, like generally speaking, maybe yes. But it depends on how we make the question. It shouldn't be ambiguous, like it should be logically possible to derive the next step, right? So it's not clear. It should be clear. It should be clear. So if I, like one of these buttons who mentioned that yesterday, like open-ended buttons, like one, two, four, what's the next question? What's the next number? Many different people came. Many different people can come up with different rules and put another like different number after that. So it's if the first several steps in the algorithm are such that they definitely suggest what the next step is going to be, it has to be determined. Or you can tell them what the algorithm is doing. Yeah, or something is an algorithm to accomplish something through the first three steps, but it's the fourth one, because we're giving them since it's multiple choice, even though there could be a different Choice, even though there could be a different choice. Yeah, or if we explain this is an algorithm, give a simple example with like five, a number five, for example, or something like that. What will be the answer if this algorithm is applied to this number? Something like that. Yes, it is. Which is essential transformations. Yeah, and they will be hidden sometimes. You don't maybe say operator. No, no, no, of course not. I mean, it could be for the great. I mean it could be for the grades that you don't have to teach them step by step, step by step solving of a problem. But I think that's what we're teaching. For instance, I can think of a problem, let's say, that involves bubble sort. And Josipu mentioned an invariant. It's easy to figure that the invariant of a bubble sort, each step of a bubble sort, is the minimum and the maximum of their place. And I can easily see a a problem. Easily see a problem like that. I listed topics that are, I think, applicable to MathBand Guru from the area of computer science. Some of them, Valeria and I agree, finds too complex, like complexity of algorithms. It's just too high up for canoe. But quite But quite a few can be applied, I think. Even bubble sort, even not calling it bubble sort a problem and just dis describing what it is, I think students of an older grade could figure out where this is going, what's happening even not mentioning bubble sort or sorting algorithm. But just what bubble sort is accomplishing and putting that into a problem, that would be interesting. We actually had sorting problems from time to time like Algero, yeah. Time to time in Kelgaro. It was not necessary, I don't know, but there was so many problems. Exactly, even in the last context, 2022, exchanging by exchanging, swapping to remember that before we had this kind of exactly automatic. And if I may, I would not move toward algorithmization of mathematics in sense of mapping the problems. What is new? New is well forgotten old. So I would mention more, I will emphasize more, let's say. Let's see some old, maybe even old-fashioned logic that students would be able, I hope, to wake up to inspire some young minds toward mathematics. Because if we make everything too abstract, too dry, give the steps, give the algorithm, no coding, we can use this language. Coding, we can use this language for older students, but especially for students from grade, let's say, three up to grade five, six, we can use this well-forgotten rule. So, algorithm is a male word, so it's a well-forgotten thing. I hear what you're saying. The fact that there are some very beautiful problems that we know doesn't mean that they should be used because we are the same but the students We are the same, but the students change every year, right? So, recycling the problems is good because it's problems, ideas. Ideas, yes, exactly. Essentially, this computing is logic. Yeah, it is. Just because um you mentioned different number systems, uh I think I I mentioned it to Nico earlier as well. Um that there is a a wonderful if you don't know what it's what you mean. Don't know it, it's what you mean. James Canton did a wonderful exercise box, which was basically a pictorial version of explaining binary numbers. And I've used it with grade one students, but the idea is immediately. It might be hard to do something like this at Ken Gabo. Example has, especially at those levels, is a little bit of you have to explain the process, and doing that without a lot of work. So all of those questions did have a lot of. A lot of those questions did have a lot of reading involved, which is hard for the smaller grades. But I think those processes, those transformative processes, can be used in multi-computing into math without making it about computing, still keeping it. Did you say co-down? James Tanton. James? James? Tanton? T-A-N-T-O-N? It has websites and I've seen this. I've seen I've seen what you're saying. Yeah, he's very nice, and he used it also for points and writing T? Can you search for submitted to the KSF? Like, in general? Canada? Yeah. Last year twelve or do you remember? Eight? Eight? I can show you later maybe if you want. Maybe if you want to submit it last year, I think now how many we had last year? Very few. That's just a few questions. We were a little bit we are never maybe six to eight. I can show you this, and last year none was select. No more problems, zero. But some years we have some select, and so that is the point. So, Denmark, what it does is that works directly with What it does is that works directly with the teachers. So they collect problems from the teachers, then they do a pre-selection and they do all this finding and so on. They submit very few. They have very high selection because they are very good. And we talked about the ideas from where they are coming and how massive they are. So I think it's just. I think it's more important. During the last three years, we selected. But it's interesting to see those if selected. But we have problems selected. We had, right, of course we had, but this year we didn't have any, okay? But sometimes we had one year we had foot number, I don't think what number. Number, I will report number of problems selected. Well, I'll show you. I'll show you this, but the problem itself, I don't know if I will be able to try with my mouth. I think or maybe we do this. Yeah, yeah, not the selected. The problem she we said, Canadian backing. I have noticed that. Yeah, I should probably select this version. To select good three-point problems, it's much harder to select two or good five-point problems. They have to be hard-hand solvable, and I agree. So, I mean, we can if we if we want to show numbers, we can offer more safe problems than easy to show you some, but uh if you want to share the problems themselves, that may me I may need to do this after. I may need to do this after the conference. So, at 11, I can show you a few that I have on my laptop. That's a very good question. Just in terms of the process of selecting the Canadian group of problems, I've been actually just being inspired to do it in various problems as I'm listening to the different ideas. Do we just send those to you to begin with? Yes, we will send email. I usually send email, but we. I usually send email, but maybe not to everybody. So maybe now we are gonna send email to kind of read the group of programs. So who are the usual people that submit? Just curious. Udiputs, Vitaly did few. Udipo most of the programmes would submit. I occasionally took some, not many. Valeria and Odo used to do. I tried a couple of good science models, but you rejected colours. It was too late, but it's late. It was too late, but you suggest the grade as well? Let's not suggest that next year. I think there was a reason because you sent them to 345. My life last 20 years since I wrote computers and I was okay. I'm mad, but more computer. Yeah, but it's to admit that some people have talents to generate problems. That's a skill. Yeah, people don't. Yes, I can't figure out any interesting problem myself. But if you don't think, try so. No, I've tried. I didn't like it after. It was either it arranged a lot. It's good that you can accept the payroll. Yeah, okay, I'll touch on this connection. But that's okay. So we are trying, and maybe others can come up with some revision that we put better. So you please to hear. But so if you can come with the car. So we have booking break now and then downloading. Oh no, I don't only give you the announcements. I got a text message you can just check out on your phone. No no, they have to need the key. How would you keep? Do they need these keys? They just enact delete them and that's it. No, no, no, no. You can't get this. No, no, no, no. You can't get off the strategy probably. I take notes, everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you for my time. Yeah, so here, yeah, this is a statement of the X. So we have to. So we have to do it. No, we don't finish record. We can turn down to normal one. Okay, I will not continue to see it. It's a cheap button. Oh, okay, so there's a bus and you're going to make up the bus. Yeah, so we're going to the bus leaves at 12.30. Okay, we're hoping to leave here by like 12.05, so maybe grab a quick lunch and then just leave. Because the one after is in two hours. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be late. Okay. Then there's a shuffle to Calgary right here from Lake Louise, right? No. To the airport? How do you go to the airport? Yeah, also I think we're going to go. So I think we're gonna come back to here. Oh, okay. And there's a shuttle. Very important to shuttle tomorrow. Okay, okay. So the shuttle isn't going to like we use. Because I heard the little shuttle. So it's kind of a. Yeah. Anyway, so they have their plans. They're going to make it. About this teachers' conference, send us an information if we don't get the chance to talk about it because it could be a possibility to start thinking about it. I just don't know about it. I just don't know what audience we are writing and what kind of goals, objectives the teacher project has, but we have to find ways to reach teachers, not only teachers, like as many people that could be having some sticks that would be doing it once again. Yeah, okay. Yeah, for sure. We can get your email from you online, I assume. The email is, I can, well, in the list of participants. My email is there. I can also write it as yeah, you better give it because I don't think the list is public. If the list is public, if you make an account of a sign, I don't know if you can punish that. I don't know if you're trying to punish it. VPP 1999, perfect, yeah. You can just send me a quick email just to establish the kind of the connection. I'll respond, you have it already on the file. And whenever you have the opportunity, just send us this information and we can talk about it. Maybe it's not going to be a good fit now, but at least. In the future, at least two, because we are planning on hoping running this end. Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure that by this time you already have kind of the agenda ready and you know what to do, but we just have to see. And if this is feasible, maybe that will be a future opportunity to have some. Maybe that will be a future opportunity to have some sort of conference for other group of teachers. We'll send you information because we do have some documents that we can send you to your LAN program. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's probably, it will take a little bit of thinking to see whether there is a fit exactly right now because doing something that is not the right fit is probably worse than not doing the other way. So let's think about it. That sounds good. You stay in his back and then tie some buttons. Uh do you have to open anything or do you just pop it? I'll just go back and I think we will make it back. Yeah, we might have to be a little early in this. I don't know how much we go. Last session. We were supposed to have lunch at 11.45. But we'll check it out. If there's lunch, we'll eat it. If there isn't, right? Yeah, we can trim something. Yeah. Alright, I'll see you.
