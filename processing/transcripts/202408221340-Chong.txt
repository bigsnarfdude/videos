So I thank the organizer for giving me this nice opportunity to give a talk about my most recent work here. And this is a fabulous place. So thank you all for the invitation. So let me talk about something that I've been working on with my two collaborators, Professor Zhufeijiang and then Shin Ying Shen. And then Xin Lin Shen. Xin Lin is going to start his new position in Chong Keh. Okay. I almost messed that up. Okay. So I've been working on this project for a little bit over almost two years. Okay. So it's almost done. But it's not out on archive yet. But I'm hoping that it will be out by the end of this month. Okay. Okay. So let me go through the background and main result of the work. Okay. So I want to start by recalling the compressible Euler equations. So I am considering a specific type of not fluids, but for classical gas, not for liquids, but for gas. So I will consider this compressible. Compressible Euler system written in its momentum form, or you can rewrite it in terms of its velocity forms. Here, rho represents the mass density, and rho u is the bulk velocity, and here is the momentum. The type of pressure that I will deal with here is for the polytropic with this type of square. And here we will have a little bit of a deposit And here we also I also want to talk about the internal energy, which is supposedly the energy that comes from microscopic dynamics. So when we study uh when people study the Euler equations, normally you have that the total energy of the system is given by the bulk kinetic energy and then there's this little E here, which is the internal specific energy. That comes from That comes from microscopic motions, but normally we don't know how it comes from microscopic. So, today I will talk about how it will arrive from many-body physics. So, generically, for a compressible Euler system, we know that it has a finite time blow-up. So, this is a classical result. I think uh and before the blow-up time, you have you can get really nice solutions if you Solutions, if you start with nice initial data. And for us, we will work, we will fix a time that's before the blow-up time, and we will consider the analysis. Like what Dong Yu was talking about, is you always fix the time before certain bad things happen, and then you do your analysis uniformly. Okay, so that's all. So one of the things that I would like to The things that I would like to the objective of the talk is to rigorously give a justification of the compressible Euler system from many body physics. So the standard ways of doing this is to some people would do it the standard like roadmap is to go from many body physics to Boltzmann type dynamics. So you go to a connect picture. And from a connect picture, people will take the Picture, people will take the hydrodynamic limit to get a fluid-type equation. So that's one way. But of course, there are people that doesn't follow that roadmap. So there's the work by Nachtegel and Yao in the early 2000s, where they start from a quantum many-body system, fermionic system, but they have to assume a But they have to assume a lot of various technical conditions like ergodicity and other things. They have to use local Gibbs states, local equilibrium states, then to derive the Euler equations. And more recently, so this paper was really difficult to read. It's still very difficult to read. And because of that, it's a nice read. Because of that, it's a nice result, but not many citations because it's really technical. And then later on, there's the recent work by Gauss and Paul, which derived the pressureless Euler-Poisson equation from quantum many body bosonic system. And they considered a Coulomb-type interaction. They use an approach that was That was kind of also used by Silvia Safati in proving the classical mean field limit. And where she also derived an Euler-Poisson equation using the method of modulated energy. So later on, so this was pressureless. Later on, my collaborators and colleagues did something similar, but they use a different method instead of using the Different method instead of using directly the module many body modulated energy method, they use a combined hierarchy method, BBGKY hierarchy method, along with a modulated energy method to derive a compressible Euler equation with a pressure. The interaction here is a little bit delta-like, but it's not so it's like short range, so we will talk. So, we will talk more about this shortly. Okay. So, for me, the physical system, since I want to justify the compressible Euler system, there's many ways to do that. I will choose a specific physical system to work with, a physical model to work with. So, I will start with a trap-bose gas system at zero temperature. At zero temperature. So it's well known in the physics literature that if you start with a Bose gas and you trap Bose gas and you cool it, so you cool it down to a certain critical temperature, it will condense, meaning that all the particles will occupy a same macroscopic wave, okay? What we call a macroscopic wave. So this was So this was a big scientific experimental achievement in the mid 90s. And it was awarded the Nobel Prize in early 2000s. So it made the cover of Science Magazine. So here is a bunch of Bose gas and when you cool down a macroscopic amount of them, well they'll cor uh correles into uh they will move in unison. They will move in unison. It's like an army here. And there are excitations running around. And this actually, this picture corresponds to the image here. So if you cool it down enough, this was actually from the paper of I forgot. I think it was the just the I forgot which one. I miss her. Yeah, Miss Gila, Gila group. Okay. So here they cool down a So here they cool down the gas and then they see a condensate forming and then there's excitation. The red part here is just vacuum, some empty space. We can ignore that. That was just not part of the guess. So we will start with this system. And I want to model this. So I want to talk about one more thing I want to talk about. Well, what is Bose gas? Bose gas is a quantum system where there's a certain system where there's a certain symmetry. So a simple way to describe it in terms of quantum mechanics is that the wave function that describes a many-body system has this permutation symmetry, meaning that it's invariant under permutations. Okay? And what I will do is the following. I will consider a trap gas. I have a trapping potential here. And here is a kinetic energy. I will consider n part. Energy, I will consider n particles, and they have an interaction, a repulsive interaction, short range. Okay, so and the box has side length L0. And here, I will, so here, let's look at this picture over here. To save time, I drew the picture. So, I have a picture of a trap both. So, so this is a caricature because I'm writing things like quantum classical particles while they're supposed to be. Classical particles, while they're supposed to be quantum. So I have n particles in a box, and then I trap them in a box of psych length L and here L will be like n. Maybe it will be less than n. So I to quantiti uh to quantify the smallness, I use this epsilon square notation to quantify the smallness. Of course, epsilon can equal one, then the sine length. Epsilon can equal 1, then the sine length is L, but it could also decrease as an N. So this can be strictly less than N. So it can be strictly less than N. Who knows? And I only consider short-range interactions. So meaning within a ball, there's a order one interaction range. So if so if they're far apart there's no interactions between the two. There's no interactions between the two. And they only interact when they're within the radius. Okay. So if you start with a potential that's slightly a softer potential, actually there's another number that's not quite the radius of the support. There's another number called a scattering length. That's also important. Length. That's also important. But I will talk about it in a short. So, okay. So now we have, I oh, here, one more thing. I have this coupling constant here, lambda. And I let so lambda could grow in N. So I am considered really strong interactions. Okay, short range, large box. So here, I can simply compute the average density. The average density. So I have n particle inside a box of size L3, and this is the size of the box. So you can see that this is what I get, 1 over n squared cube. So meaning that n I will restrict myself to the case where n, is it me or these numbers are really bad? n epsilon 3 is strictly bigger than 1, so I have either a constant Either a constant density or a dilute system or a low density gas. Okay? Okay. So other than so like I said earlier, there are two numbers to keep in consideration. One is the support of the interaction range, the effective interaction range, and there is another which is the scattering length. another which is the scattering length. And I will consider the zero energy scattering equation in order to define my scattering length. So this is uh connected to some of the scattering people here. So okay. So I define this uh stationary scattering equation, zero energy, because here it's zero. Okay, so and this is a positive operator because my interaction is positive. So I solve this with a boundary condition of one at interval. With a boundary condition of one at infinity. So this has a nice solution, radial solution that looks like this, up to R zero. It looks like it's and then asymptotically one, okay? And here, this distance here is given Distance here is given by radius minus the scattering length. This height over here. And this part is roughly, so f, f is approximately equal to 1 minus some number over x outside of the support of the interaction. And because of that, I can And because of that, I can define the the scattering length. And it can be shown that the scattering length is strictly less than the support of this length scale, R0. In particular, if you look at this potential, hardcore potential, meaning that from a quantum mechanical perspective, it's like infinity inside. So to know the particle will basically Well uh basically cannot will interact exactly uh how should I say this? So it's saying that you cannot interact within from uh within a ball of radius zero, okay? It's so it's infinite it's like an infinite wall inside and then zero everywhere else. So this is a hard core potential. And you can compute the scattering length of the hardcore potential. compute the scattering length of the hardcore potential. It's equal to R0, the radius of the support, which makes sense. And in fact, if you study this equation with this large parameter here and let the parameter tend to zero, you can actually show that the scattering length converges to the radius. To be more specific, actually this is a classical problem. If you have a V that's not radially symmetric, it converges to the capacity. converges to the capacity of the V. So this is a classical problem. I think this was conjectured by K and then later on it was proved by Michael Taylor in three dimensions with uh when he was studying all these uh uh solidifications of potentials. Okay, so so I want before I continue I want Before I continue, I want to talk a little bit about my system. The system that I have at hand is uh I want to talk about its ground state. This thing, ground state. So it was actually regular uh rigorously proved that in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state energy per particle for a dilute hardcore gas of Bose type has has the energy of this form. It's 4π A0 times the density. And this was the upper bound was rigorously proved by Dyson in the 50s. But his lower bound was off. The important part is that I want to indicate here is the appearance of the scattering length in the energy. Okay. So that so this So that so this uh scattering length captures the microscopic dynamics of the system. So it's quite important at least when you want to study the energy. But the lower bound was not correct in Dyson. He wasn't able to obtain a good lower bound. And this was fixed only 40 years later by Lieb and Inversen in the late 80s, late 90s, where they proved the correct lower bound. So, and the next order correction to the energy was only obtained recently by Furnés and Solovey in two papers, in the 2020 and 2023. So these are big results. They basically confirmed a conjecture of Li Huang Yang. Okay. Li is uh Chung Dao Li and then Huang is Kurt Sen Huang and then Yang is Kurtzen Wang, and then Yang is Yang Cheng Chung Yang. So Lee passed away just recently in San Francisco while I was in San Francisco. So okay, so this was formula that was in their papers in the 50s. And you can see same year, they were also at the Institute of Advanced Studies at that time. So actually, Dyson was talking to them. And then Yang told Dyson about this. So Dyson got interested, so that's why he did the first. Interested in, so that's why he did the first term. But then they were each conjecture, the correction at that time. But anyways, this took another 20 years from Lee before it was proven. And from there, I don't want to make the history too long, but I think the history adds some flavors to this. So, because I'm going to talk about the scaling. Here, these results were done in the thermodynamic limit scale. That means that the number of particle That means that the number of particles inside the back, so this is constant. It converges to a constant. Okay? But unfortunate uh, so but there uh you can only prove so much in here because it's actually quite difficult. So after the work of Lieb and Inbesen, they uh then we start uh then there was an inspired entire regime of something called the gross PDFsky limit, okay, which is epsilon equals to one. Which is epsilon equals to 1, L equals to N. So in that sense, the average density is 1 over n squared. Now, so this is a super dilute gas. Actually, they call it the ultra-dilute regime. And it is in this regime that people were able to show that the ground state energy is characterized by the gross PDFs functional, which is this non-linear Schrodinger functional. Okay? What the imp what makes it why is it called gross PDFsky is precisely because of the scattering length here. Otherwise, it's just a non-linear showlinear functional. And in this scaling regime, that this ultra-dilute scaling regime, it was able to prove that the corresponding one-particle marginal in the limit as n goes to infinity. limit as n goes to infinity converges in trace norm topology to the solution of the gross-Pedievsky solution. So this is what we call 100% BC. So this was proof in the Gross-Pedievsky limit. But this remains a huge open problem in the thermodynamic limit. It's unsolved. You can prove 100% BC in the thermodynamic BC in the thermodynamic limit. And recently, there's some effort that's made to push beyond the gross PEF ski limit, which is by Adi Kari and Brennix Schlein and Fernes also did that, where they push beyond the GP regime, but they are still short from the thermodynamic scaling limit. So the thermodynamic limit is precisely this converged constant. So earlier, we have seen this. So if So if n times x uh epsilon cubed is constant, then this is what we call a thermodynamic limit. But unfortunately, we are always in the regime where this goes to zero. So in a dilute limit regime. Okay. Why am I caring about this? So I'm trying I am actually looking at a s uh my epsilon is not s uh not That's not one, so I'm looking at actually a beyond-gross PDF regime. So okay, so first I consider a beyond-gross Pyevsky regime and I rescale everything in terms of its dimension. Rescale the variables and so I can put the recast this equation in a dimensionless form. So I define a new time variable. And then so if you look at this it is So if you look at this, i it is like the s similar to the scaling of Deng Yu earlier, but he chose it so the parabolic scaling where this equals one. But here I'm going to introduce some epsilon here. Okay, and then we have this. And I also scaled the time, so this looks so after rescaling this, I have this rescaled system where you see a very weird thing happening over here. So if you look at this. So if you look at this, there's uh this over then you have a big constant in front. Actually, this potential here converged to a delta in some ways. And you have a 1 over n over here, which is some type of averaging because there's n square interaction. You have 1 over n here to say that you have a n interaction that matches the kinetic energy, which has n interaction here. So now you have the equal um you have a strong interaction of equal amount of Equal amount of scale of n and n from the kinetic energy. So you're hoping that something will survive in the limit. But here we also have a semi-classical parameter here, epsilon square. And we will let epsilon, we will look at scale where epsilon tends to zero. So the so-called semi-classical limit here comes from the fact that we're rescaling the system in a way that so the That so this is not the Planck's constant that people always talk about. It's Planck's constant 10 to 0. I'm actually rescaling the system so that I can see something interesting. And from this picture, I'm rescaling it to now, this is an order one system. Okay, where now the interaction, this part over. Uh this part over here is in the rescale is actually one over n to the epsilon squared. Instead of order one, it's now interaction. It's one over epsilon. Okay, so just in case I realize I don't talk too much. So now I have to consider this many body system where I have both a semi-classical scaling and a mean field scaling. Mean field is just averaging 1 over n over here. Okay, ah, drew a picture already. Okay, rescale. So it's a here it's too big to see, so you zoom out so that you have an order one picture, and you're hoping to see some interesting classical physics in this aspect. Okay. In the paper, we actually do a little bit more general things. We add more parameters to the problem to make it more To the problem to make it more difficult for the audience. Actually, I didn't do we didn't we this was inspired by earlier work by Erdős Schlein and Yao. So Yao here is HT Yao. So when they were they first derived the growth the nonlinear Schrodinger equation from many body quantum systems they also considered this this type of the equation of the equation. This type of dynamic scaling here with a beta. But so they give some justification of what it means. But since I don't have time to talk too much about this, I will just say I don't want to confuse people, so yes, just accept it at the moment. But in the work of Er Schlein Yao in 2007, they did not, I want to comment, they did not prove the hard. I want to comment. They did not prove the hardcore potential. So it at the st at the level of stationary dynamics, it was already done. People know a lot about the hardcore. But from the time-dependent setting, the hardcore potential, not much is known. Well, one reason is, think of it this way. If you write down the Schrodinger equation with the Hamiltonian, where this is a hardcore, you ask yourself, does the semi-group exist? You don't have cottons. You don't have a cotton type. Have cuttles, you don't have a cuttle type theorem to guarantee the existence of semi-group. So maybe someone here knows how to prove that you have a semi-group if this is a hardcore potential. I don't know where the reference is, so I so the only way I can do this so but I just want to point out that they didn't consider it at that moment. But what they But what they did was the following. They also took the wave function, they form a density operator, and then they took some marg they integrate out some variables to get a marginal. And what they showed was that if they start with BEC, meaning that there's some factorization of the marginal at initial time, they can prove that the persistence of the this factorization, which Deng Yu actually mentioned, is this notion of propagation of Is this notion of propagation of chaos? This is a huge topic in the field. And what they shown, Erdőslein and Yao shown almost 20 years ago, is that yes, in fact this tensor structure is preserved at the level of density matri matrices and the dynamics is governed by a non-linear Schrodinger equation. In fact at the level of beta between zero and one Level of beta between 0 and 1, you have this constant over here, the integral of v. And at the beta equals 1, which is a critical scaling, you get the scattering length coming out in the non-linear Schrodinger equation. Okay, so this makes the page A equals one a very special case. And this so this paper, they tried, but they failed. Tried, but they failed. So it was a 2007 paper. They were not able to get beta equals one. And then later on, they tried a little bit more. For small potential, they got beta equals one, which is an anals paper. And later on, they proved that they can do it for large beta, large potentials, and that turns into the JAMS paper that they had over there. So the yes, so they had basically all the papers. Well, on the side, there was a There was a pickle, Peter Pickle actually did something along the line, but it was less appreciated. So I just want to point it out here. Okay, so let's back to our map model. So for this talk, I will focus on this case. Instead of beta equals one, but I add an epsilon square, epsilon square here, okay? And I have semi-classical. I have semi-classical. If you naïvely follow the argument, you will expect that the effective dynamics for this many-body system is governed by a non-linear Schrodinger equation, like this, with a scattering length. For the hardcore potential, like what you're using, since I would have a scattering length, but for the hardcore is the C0, which is the radius of. C0, which is the radius of the support, okay? So I expect this. So these are the two expect. But then, of course, this is just a heuristic, because n and epsilon kind of couples together. I'm letting n so they're not independent of each other in the way I'm scaling the things. And because of that, this is definitely not a justification. Okay? So, in some sense, I have to study it. If I want to do something, If I want to do something, I need to also study the semi-classical analysis of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. So let me comment a little bit about this. Okay. So the study of this goes back of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation goes back to the work of Girard. He worked on a torus, okay? But he was dealing with a cubic nonlinearity. And then, but he has to assume analytic He has to assume analytic initial data. Then Grenier actually was able to soften up the analytic of the initial data and use Soplov initial data. Both of them worked in WKB regimes where they were able to do that. And later on, but this was in short time. It was only they were only able to do the semi-classical analysis. Able to do the semi-classical analysis in a short time. But the time doesn't depend on epsilon. It's still, but it's small. I think it's like before the formation of caustics or something. You have to be very careful. And then there's also, in 1D, there's Jing Lovemore and McLaughlin also did something where they were able to prove it for all time. The derivation they were able to take the semi-classical limit. And actually, what does the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation? Classical limit of the Schrodinger equation give you, it gives you the compressible Euler equation. Okay, so it was already done here in the late 90s. Actually, Grenier did it very early, but I think he took some time to write. Actually, this was supposedly, this paper was also written in 91, but I don't know why it was published in 99. So I don't understand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, later on, using a complete different non-WKB method, Lin and Zhang, Fang Hua Lin and Zhangping actually considered the same type of problem and they were able to show that in 2D. Actually, I think it's also more than 2D, in higher D as well, that they were able to derive the compressible Euler equation. Okay, so this was this paper. So now the question is how do I derive the compressible Euler equation from many body? First of all I do the following. I define these qua starting from the many body physics which I have the density I can define these quantities here. I can define the density per particle and then I can derive I can define this like a average uh uh this Average uh uh this this type of average momentum operator, and I can also define the energy coming from the many body system. If I just compute the equation uh if I write down the time uh if take the time derivative kind of fiddle with this I actually see that these two quantities satisfy this type of equation where L goes to zero as n tends to infinity. So this is a concept So, this is a conservation law. Well, this is a conservation law. This is a balance equation. And you can see that the as any tends to in this tends to an Euler-type equation, which tends to a conservation law. And because of this, this was the reason why we expect from many buttons we can pass to the compressible oiler. Let me talk about the ideas. Talk about the idea is very simple. There are two parts. The many-body, we already know there's a full blast theory of going from many body Schoeninger equation to Gross-Pigievsky. There's an entire theory for that. And then I just mentioned how from the Gross-Pigievsky, there's an entire theory from this to Euler, compressible Euler. So we put them together. Pretty simple, right? Pretty simple, right? But the problem of yes, and in fact, it is quite simple, but it is just an to combine them is just very annoying. And it took a very long time. And in particular, when we want to consider the hardcore potential in everything, it adds a lot of difficulty to the problem. So let me state the result. So if you start with a very smooth solution to the Euler equation, Smooth solution to the Euler equation, compressible Euler equation, and you can sort it before the blow-up time, okay? And we can sort of pressure of this form. And on the many-body side, you consider some initial state that's called a Bogolibov state. Okay, I'm not and this Bogulibov state kind of is parameterized by the some phi. Some phi, okay? So we will need to assume that phi has four derivatives, and it's some semi-classical derivatives, so it's uniformly bounded here. And we have to assume that if you take this and you form and along with these initial data, you consider this object here, which is the modulated energy. And if initially this is small, And if initially this is small, then under the restriction where n and epsilon has this very weird relation, you can prove the following. The density converges to the density of the many body density. Okay. Um the potential energy. So that is the result. And of course some people would be interested in the rate here. But the rate the rate is can be arbitrarily slow. Arbitrarily slow. It actually depends. The rate of convergence depends on the, at least in our approach, depends on the profile of the interaction. So, in fact, here, if I have an interaction like this, okay, if if it if the contact part here is like uh uh has zeros of certain order, then you get Certain order, then you get arbitrarily slowed. So if you have a C infinity contact potential, this rate can be really slow. Okay? Super, super slow. So that's why I didn't bother writing out the rate. Okay. And of course, all this work doesn't come from vacuum. It comes from, like what I mentioned, my colleagues and collaborator. So this was based on the work of based on the work of Chen, Shen, Wu and Zhang. And then later on Xuan Chen and Shun Chen Shun Shen and then Zhufei Zhang also wrote another. But they covered the entire case from beta between 0 and 1. And I finish the case beta equals 1 and also the hardcore and other. Actually, there are other results in the paper I didn't bother to include here. Okay. Ah well, let's let's so this is the terrible part that I'm going to talk about. So I lied So here this part is only approximately this is only approximately true. This is not the actual result. The actual result is that we do not work we do not work in the canonical picture. Canonical picture, meaning that we do not consider a fixed number of particles. We actually work in the grand canonical picture, where we work with a where the number of particles is a probability distribution. It was easy to present the canonical picture. Now let's look at how do we so to talk about the grand canonical picture, I need to introduce a fox. I need to introduce the Fox space formalism. I have to have this huge Hilbert space that accounts for an arbitrary number of particles, okay? And then I have to... A state in this Fox space is given by an infinite vector, okay? Where you can have zero, it tells you something about the number of particles. You can have zero particles, how much zero particles are. Particles, how much is zero particle, one particle, blah blah blah. And then this is Hilbert space because it has this inner product structure on it, which is pretty trivial. And in order to talk about Fox space, you also have to so this I want to mention this is a non-relativistic quantum field approach. While some people here do the uh the the what is it called the stochastic way, I do The stochastic way. I do it the non-stochastic deterministic way. But we use operator uh use operator algebra instead of stochastic. So there's some operator algebra. Actually, this is the reason the algebra of the grand canonical theory is the reason why we're able to achieve a lot of the things that we can right now. Of the things that we can right now. And in fact, I want to say that so sorry. So we have this. So here, I one of the things about second quantization, that an outer second quantization here is not the most important aspect of the library. So there's this. So, there's this commutator algebra that we have here, but I'm not going to go through too much of it. And one of the things that you can do from the commutator is that you can use this algebra to quantize classical fields to get a pro to get quantum fields. Okay, let's not uh I don't want to talk too much. So, given a L2 classical field, you do you can use the vial operator to construct a so this part is. So, this part is not, this part is just details. I don't really. So, one of the things is you can start with classical fields, you can construct these Fock vectors. And then, so I told you earlier, there's something called the Boliv states, which is a conto-uh, it's some type of unitary, like some type of mean field operator with a second-order correction, which I call Ibog's. Which I call a bog state. That's actually, if you look carefully, this is a Gaussian, it's like a Gaussian-type state. Okay, it's a Gaussian-type state because it's created from second-order operators, okay, acting on a vacuum. The omega here is a vacuum. So my initial state that I'm evolving are some Gaussian or what we call quasi-free states. And then what I put in these states are the correlation structure of the many-body. So I look at these states over here, and what States over here. And what's so special about these states is that the energy of these states is basically given by the gross PDF ski energy functional. So that means that we can start with initial data that's close to the ground state of a Bose gas system. And then we will evolve it at the level of Fox space or the second quantization. So this Cauchy problem. And now, instead of using the canonical Now, instead of using the canonical picture like what we did earlier, now we can define these objects in the cran canonical picture. Okay? And show the following. The density of the many body density given by this can be a little bit more than a little bit of a Okay. Anyways, here so one of the things I want to talk about is I give you an example of how I'm going to prove the spam. So I'm going to compare the many body with at the I'll only do the many body approximation thing. So from the many body density, I can compare it with the semi-defense. Density, I can compare it with the semi-classical gross PFSK solution or the modified gross PDF ski equation. What I can do is I can bound the err uh bound the error by the error of this gamma, these things, these density operators down below. And then to bound this difference of the density operator in Hilbert Schmidt norm, what happens is I can. Norm, what happens is I can actually bound the expected number of particles of some fluctuating dynamics. If you look at this, this is saying I'm evolving a Gaussian state or Gibbs state. Oh no, sorry, sorry. I'm evolving a Boglebuff state, and then I back-evolve it by some non-linear dynamics, okay? And so in order to bound the difference, I just need to bound the To bound the difference, I just need to bound the expected number of particles. So initially, if I start with something that has small number of particles, if I can show by a Granois argument it stays small, then I'm done. And indeed, if I take the time derivative of the expected number of particles, what I get is this commutator with the number of operator with the fluctuating dynamics of fluctuating Hamiltonian. Fluctuating Hamiltonian. So, and then doing some WIC reordering to get all the large terms out, remove all the large terms, then I can show that if I start with something small, it will stay small. Okay? Ta-da. Thank you.
