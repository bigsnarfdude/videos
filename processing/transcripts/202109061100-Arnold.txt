Okay, so first, many thanks to the organizers for the kind invitation. And let me point out that this talk is joint work with Beatrice Signorello. Let me start with the general topic as an introduction. So, I want to start with a symmetric Fokker-Planck equation in whole space. Equation in whole space for the function f of this form with a given x-dependent potential v. In this case, it is known by the entropy method or Bakri-E-Marie strategy that every trajectory converges to the steady state of this form. And most of all, one has an estimate at the decay rate, which is the lower bound of the Hessian of this given potential. This given potential. So, in case that this potential is now a quadratic function with a positive definite matrix K, and if the corresponding steady state is then an unisotropic Gaussian, one knows that this decay rate obtained from the Hessian is in fact sharp. So, the main theme of this talk is: I want to add non-symmetric perturbations that preserve. Perturbations that preserve the steady state. And I want to show that such perturbations can instead indeed improve the convergence, can make it faster. So in particular, the goal will be I want to find an optimal perturbation such that we have the best exponential decay estimate of the following form, solution at time t minus the steady. Time t minus the steady state measured in a weighted L2 norm has to be bounded by this exponential function in the following sense. First of all, the exponential decay rate lambda has to be maximal, and then second afterwards, the multiplicative constant C has to be as small as possible. So let me briefly mention So let me briefly mention where such a question stems from. It comes from stochastic applications where one is often interested in computing expectations with respect to a certain measure. Here you see the form of the steady state that I had on the previous page, and the applications would typically be in high dimensions. And so one way to compute such expectations would be to construct an Would be to construct an ergodic Markov process that converges as fast as possible to this unique measure or steady state. And I should say I will only talk about the PDE context and the PDE relevant aspects, but this construction of such a fast converging process is what stands behind this talk. This talk or this topic. So, here's the outline of my talk. First, I want to construct best Fokker-Planck equations, and we will see that the best or fastest converging Fokker-Planck equations will always be hypocursive. Then, in the second part, I will show you numerical illustrations to show that this really improves upon the previously known results. And in the end, I want to give you. And in the end, I want to give you an outlook to Fokker-Planck equations that also admit time-dependent coefficients. So, here I want to focus on Fokker-Planck equations of this form, which have a linear drift. So, here a diffusion matrix D that is non-negative and a drift matrix C that is positive stable. That means that all real parts of the eigenvalues. Real parts of the eigenvalues are strictly positive. And the starting point is that you prescribe a steady state of this anisotropic Gaussian form with a given covariance matrix K. And the goal is find these coefficient matrices D and C such that you have fastest convergence. So first let me fix the set of admissible matrices. I denote Matrices. I denote this by this script I. So these are all pairs of C and D. D non-negative. Of course, the corresponding steady state has to, or this given steady state, or this given Gaussian has to be in the kernel of the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator, which I define here. And then additionally, you also have. Then, additionally, you also have to prescribe an upper bound on the trace of the diffusion matrix, because if you wouldn't do that, in fact, you see very easily that the decay rate could be arbitrarily large. So, this optimization problem I have in mind would not make sense. Since there is quite some literature in the background, let me start with some simple and known results. Simple and known results. First, the set of these admissible matrices that I have here was characterized by Guillain and Montmarché. And they said if you have fixed a diffusion matrix that satisfies these obvious constraints, then the corresponding drift matrices C must be of this form. So here in this bracket, D is the symmetric part and J Part and J is any school symmetric perturbation. So this gives you all these admissible matrices in this set. The second simple statement is if you have fixed a covariance matrix K and if you have a pair of matrices C and D in this admissible set and if C is positive stable then this steady state that you have This steady state that you have up here is the unique steady state, and moreover, this Fokker-Planck equation here is hypercoercive. Hypercoercive means that for all initial conditions, the corresponding trajectories will converge to that unique steady state, innovated L2 norm with this exponential rate, here an exponential rate. Here, an exponential rate pre-multiplied by a multiplicative constant. And in this talk, I want to discuss the following four questions. So, first of all, which Fokker-Planck equations converge the fastest? Or in other words, which is the largest decay rate, exponential decay rate that is possible? And I want to measure that in the operator norm of the propagator of the Fokker-Planck equation. Equation. And this operator norm, as before, will be considered in this weighted L2 space. Second question. So once this best exponential decay rate is fixed, I want to find what is the infimum of this multiplicative constant C, and I will denote it by C sub inf. Third question I want to address. I want to address. Given any matrix K, the covariance matrix that determines your steady state, and having already fixed the best exponential decay rate, if you then choose any constant C arbitrarily close to your infimum, which pair of matrices or which Fokker-Planck equations will actually satisfy this exponential decay rate? And last question. And last question, which has practical relevance. We want to find the bound on the drift matrix, on the best drift matrix. And moreover, we want to see how this bound grows with dimension. Having a small matrix C is relevant when you want to implement numerically your process, because the smaller the matrix C is, the matrix is the matrix The matrix C is, the larger your numerical time steps can be. So let me first state results from the literature, this paper that I've already cited by Guyan and Montmarté. So concerning the first question, the optimal exponential decay rate, this was completely solved. They identified this rate as the largest eigenvalue of the inverse of the matrix K, which is given from the very beginning. Beginning. Concerning the second question, this means how sharp is the multiplicative constant. So, in their work, they could reach multiplicative constants that were strictly larger than this term here, where kappa is the condition number of the matrix K. And we will see that this is not sharp. Concerning question three and four, they were able to derive a able to derive a growth bound for the drift matrix C which grows like the square of the dimension and let me just add here in order to do that they used for Kaplan equations that have piecewise constant coefficients so that's a little bit out of the framework that I've described so far but let's ignore that until the end of or almost the end of the talk then I'll come back to that. The talk, then I'll come back to that. So, let me briefly discuss the strategy how to improve previously known results. So, here is my non-symmetric Foker-Planck equation, and I want to find the two matrices D and C. And what will play an important role in this discussion is the corresponding drift ODE. So, that's this linear ODE in holiday. ODE in whole space where the matrix C tilde is connected to the matrix C from the Fokker-Planck equation with this transformation that uses the square root of the covariance matrix. And the main tool for our work is the following result that is from a joint work with Christian Schmeisser. So it says, So it says if you have a covariance matrix K non-negative or strictly positive definite, in fact, and if you have an admissible pair of drift and diffusion matrices with C positive stable, then the propagator norm of the Fokker-Planck equation is equal for all time to the propagator norm of the simple O. Norm of the simple ODE. So here the propagator norm of the PDE is measured in a weighted L2 space, in fact in the orthogonal of the steady state, because we want to measure the convergence to the steady state. And here we just have the spectral norm in Rt. So let me just point out what that theorem tells us. So it tells us that this So, it tells us that this PDE optimization problem that I have introduced can be reduced to an ODE problem, which is of course a lot easier. And this equivalence that we have in this theorem here allows us or will allow us to deduce sharp results. Let me just compare the approach that we are using here to the approach that was used in previous papers. So, instead of this equivalent, So instead of this equivalence, in the paper of Guillain and Montmarchet, they use the hypercoercive entropy method. And in an even earlier work of Le Lievre, Nier and Pavliotis, they use the block diagonal decomposition of the Fokker-Plancker operator. So here on this page, I want to show you our main result, which concerns the derivation of the optimal constant. Of the optimal constants. So, again, for a given covariance matrix, I want to address the questions two and three. So, the first statement is the multiplicative constant in your exponential decay estimate has an infimum which is equal to one. Then, next, if you take any constant close to one, larger than one, you can construct explicitly in an algorithmic way. In an algorithmic way, matrices that are coefficients of the Fokker-Planck equation, such that you obtain for the Fokker-Planck propagator norm a decay estimate of the desired form. And then concerning the bounds of your drift matrix, we were able to improve that to a dimensional dependency of only dimension D to the power three over two. d to the power 3 over 2. And here the norm that I am considering is the Frobenius norm. Let me just give you a short idea of the proof and let me mention at the beginning that the proof heavily builds on the previous results of these two papers and then uses certain refinements. So a nice way to see how Way to see how this proof starts is to first normalize the Fokker-Planck equation by introducing the following linear coordinate change, taking the square root of the covariance matrix. So then you have a Foucault Planck equation of the new function g of the variable y. Here is the normalized Foucault-Planck equation. So both of these matrices got the tilde on top. On top, the corresponding steady state is now the normalized Gaussian. So the new diffusion matrix is related to the old one, where this transformation we've already seen how the C tilde, the drift matrix, is related to the old one. And the diffusion matrix now is in fact the symmetric part of the drift matrix. And the J is an anti-symmetric part. Is an anti-symmetric perturbation that is related to the J that you have already seen before in the characterization of admissible matrices. The second step is to construct the optimal diffusion matrix. So first of all, one has to observe that the maximum decay rate of this here propagator of the ODE, which is equal Of the ODE, which is equally norm to the propagate of the Fokker-Planck equation, is the maximum eigenvalue of k to the minus one. And that can only be obtained if the range of the diffusion matrix that you are going to pick is a subset of the eigenspace of k minus one pertaining to the largest eigenvalue. So, one way to realize this choice of the diffusion. Realize this choice of the diffusion matrix is to take this rank one matrix with a vector v that is an eigenvector for this largest eigenvalue. And d is just then pre-multiplied the space dimension such that you satisfy this trace condition. Then after knowing here the symmetric part or the diffusion matrix plus the symmetric part of your transformed drift matrix, we are Formed drift matrix, we also have to find or construct the skusymetric part. And here I will not go into the algebraic details because that's very tricky and lengthy. So there's an algorithmic way to construct that. And in parallel, one constructs also a positive matrix P that we haven't seen before. These two matrices, they have to satisfy this continuous Lyapunov equation. Lyapunov equation, which is written down for the matrix P. And some people in the audience have already seen in other works relations between the Aponov equations and hypercoercive Fokker-Planck equations. So let me point out that I put here this equal sign in red, because in most of the other works, there would be an inequality here. But it's the equality here that allows us to deduce sharp. To deduce sharp estimates. So, as a last step, let me just point out what is the relevance of this Lyapunov equation. I said that the drift ODE of the Fokker-Planck equation, here it is again, plays an important role. And I want to estimate the decay of this drift ODE in a weighted norm with the matrix P, which is defined like this. So, if you just differentiate. This. So, if you just differentiate the square of the norm along the flow, then you get immediately this term here. And this square bracket that appears here is exactly the left-hand side that we had in the last line of this continuous Lyapunov equation. So if you use this Lyapunov equation, you are back to having, on the one hand, the optimal decay rate and the p-norm again, which tells us you that the solution of the That the solution of the drift ODE decays with the desired sharp or maximal decay rate. And you don't only have an estimate here, you have an equality for all initial conditions. That's important. So if you now switch back or transform back to the Euclidean norm, you get here for the propagator, for the matrix exponential of your drift ODE, the following estimate. Following estimate, so you somehow lose the square root of the condition number. But this matrix P, I was not very specific about how to choose that. The matrix P can be chosen in such a way that this condition number is as close to one as you want, which means that this exponential decay estimate can have an exponential decay rate. Exponential decay rate with a leading constant arbitrarily close to one. And this closes the theorem because the key point was to show that the infimum of that was one. Let me just remark at this point that the optimal matrices C and D are not unique. So taking, for example, the transpose of the C tilde. Of this C tilde would then lead to an alternative second choice. Let me now get to the numerical illustration of what we have obtained here. I look at a 2D problem with this covariance matrix epsilon is 1 over 20. Then you have the optimal decay rate, which is equal to 1. And if you now choose any multiplicative constant. Any multiplicative constant larger than one, you can obtain for the Fokker-Planck equation such an exponential decay rate. The best matrices to find for the diffusion matrix is of this form, which tells you already you have a degenerate diffusion. So your Fokker-Planck equation has to be hypercoercive if there is going to be exponential decay. And in the transformed way, your optimal matrix C. matrix C is of this form with the constant μ being related to your choice of the multiplicative constant C. So if you now let C go to 1, you see immediately that mu blows up. So this tells you that the off-diagonal part of your drift matrix, which is somehow a rotation, this becomes stronger and stronger. So reducing this leading multiplicative This leading multiplicative constant to one brings you into a high rotational limit in the Fokker-Planck equation. And from the application point of view, this puts you into a trade-off situation. Either you want the better convergence with a smaller constant, or you want a smaller matrix C, which in a numerical perspective allows you to take larger time steps. So let me now plot what happens here. Plot what happens here numerically. So let me look at these red curves. And the red curves correspond to the chosen multiplicative constant 3. And I plot here the propagator norm of the Fokker-Planck equation on a logarithmic scale as a function of time. So you see this red solid curve that then goes down with some periodicity. With some periodicity. This dashed curve is the corresponding exponential decay rate as an upper linear envelope of this function. Since we have a logarithmic scale in the vertical axis, this means this is the best exponential decay rate that you can get. And you see, you touch this envelope, which you derived with this prescribed constant C for the. For the blue and the green curves, then I reduced the leading constant to 2 or 1.5, and you see you get smaller and smaller leading constants. This black dashed line would then be the leading constant one, which is the high rotational limit. And so these curves are at the same time the operator norm of the Fokker-Planck equation. Norm of the Fokker-Planck equation and the propagator norm of the drift ODE. So let me briefly compare what I've shown you here to the work of Guillain and Montmart. I choose here a multiplicative constant, which is the square root of two. In both approaches, ours and Guillain and Montmarté, we get the same drift matrix, but we get two different drift matrices. So this is our best. So, this is our best drift matrix. This corresponds to the blue curve here, which has this sharp dashed line as a touching envelope. Since the estimates in Goyen-Montmach were not sharp, they need a higher rotational term in order, or in their estimate, in order to guarantee that they satisfy the decay. But it is higher rotational more than necessary, which means you Which means you would need smaller time steps in a numerical discretization. So, here on the right-hand side, you see a zoom for a time interval close to zero. And you see again the red curve, which is from Goyon-Montmacher, the blue curve from our work, and then there are two straight lines, this black and the green curves, which correspond to using symmetric. To using symmetric Fokker-Planck equations. So, what you observe here is at least for a very short time, using a symmetric Fokker-Planck equation is better than a non-symmetric or hyper-coercive Fokker-Planck equation. So, this brings me to the last topic I want to touch upon: using in the Fokker-Planck equation time-dependent coefficients, but keeping the steady state. Keeping the steady state fixed. So, this means keeping the covariance matrix time-independent. So, here is the Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent coefficient matrices, and here the corresponding drift ODE. So, in the work of Guillain and Montmachet, they actually used a split Fokker Planck evolution with piecewise constant coefficients. Piecewise constant coefficients. So, for a very short initial time layer, they used the symmetric Fokker-Planck equation and for the time afterwards, a non-symmetric Fokker-Planck equation in the spirit of this optimal decay estimates that I've shown you. And for them, this was really significant importance because splitting the evolution into these two parts allowed them to improve the decay estimates a lot. Decay estimates a lot. So the natural question is actually: is this just an improvement that they saw in their analytic estimates, or does such a splitting improve the true evolution? And so far, this of course is a question that has to be answered on the level of the Fokker-Planck operator on the PDE level. Of course, this is a highly non-trivial question. Is a highly non-trivial question to really check and compute the propagator norm. But in order to answer that, we have an extension of the main tool I've shown you before. So there I showed you that there is equality between the Fokker-Blanc propagator and the ODE propagator. And this result also extends to the case where you have time-dependent coefficients provided. Coefficients provided that all these frozen coefficients admit the same steady state. But this is exactly the setting that we are having. In both of these cases, you want to have the same steady state because that's where you want to converge to. So in this case, again, the Fokker-Planck propagator is equal to the ODE propagator. So with this tool, I want to show you the following numerical The following numerical case study because we don't have a complete theory yet. So, let me first start with the following small remark. And this is on the level of the ODE, the drift ODE. If you use a Taylor expansion of the propagator norm of the matrix exponential of this drift ODE, you see that this is one plus first-order term, which is the smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric part that you. Of the symmetric part that you put here into the exponential, this is the expansion close to zero. What does this tell us? This tells us that for a short time interval, a symmetric Foker-Planck evolution will always decay faster than a hypercoercive one. Why? Because in a hypercoercive one, recall that the symmetric part of the drift term is the diffusion matrix. Matrix. And in a hypercoercive one, this diffusion matrix is a singular matrix. So the smallest eigenvalue here will be zero. So in a hypercoercive evolution, your propagator will have a Taylor expansion that deviates from one only at maximum with this quadratic term. Asymmetric Fokker-Planck evolution will start to decay linearly. So initially, Linearly. So initially, a symmetric evolution is better than a hypercoercive one. But this backfires later. So you could imagine, well, then let's use or exploit this initially faster evolution, and then let's switch later on to a better non-symmetric Fokker-Planck equation. But at least in those examples that we have checked, you always lose, no matter how small. Always lose, no matter how small your initial symmetric time layer is, you will always pay for that later on. So let's have a look at this plot here. The thick red curve is the reference case where I use this drift matrix for all time from the very beginning. I compared it to cases where I split the Fokker-Planck evolution in two piecewise constant matrices on this small interval up to 0.5. This small interval up to 0.1 and afterwards. So, first, I use on this small initial time interval a symmetric Fokker-Planck equation, which is on this interval up to here better. But this improvement will make the situation worse afterwards. You see, the black and the green curves are above this dashed envelope. So, you always lose if you have improved it for an initial time layer. Time layer. However, if you use on an initial time layer a faster rotation, a hypercursive evolution with a faster rotation, here we have 11 instead of 7. Just on this small time layer, then you see this magenta curve, which stays well below the dashed line. So, what do we learn from that? Using on just this tiny first interval, a faster evolution. A faster evolution will help you for all time to improve your decay. So, in a numerical perspective, this tells us it pays to have a finer discretization with a larger matrix for a very short time interval and then relax to go to a smaller matrix and larger time steps. What I've shown you here is just a story for this example. The question that is still open would be what is Would be what is the best time-dependent matrix, coefficient matrix, and diffusion matrix. So, let me just conclude. I've shown you how to construct for such Fokker-Planck equations with linear drift optimal decay coefficients. The main tool was the equivalence of the propagator norms between the Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding Planck equation and the corresponding drift ODE. And for the time-dependent coefficient case, I've shown you that indeed having non-constant coefficients can improve the decay estimate. So here, as a last step, let me give you two references. The story with the construction of optimal Fokker-Planck equations is in this preprint with Beatrice Signorello and this. Signorello, and this main tool with the propagator norms is in this joint work with Christian Schmeisser and Piatricius Inurello. I think I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Anton, for your nice talk. Is there any question? So I have just a small one. When Small one when regarding the optimality of the convergence to the stationary state you mentioned, as far as I understand, you work with the L2 norm, right? I work with a weighted L2 norm. So my question is very simple. Does it make sense to investigate such problems with the LP norms with respect to in fact? In fact, I would say yes, and I was not very specific about this point, for example. So I should go back once more. Concerning this work of Guyon and Montmarché, they worked with an entropy distance, in fact, and not with an L2 norm. Their work could be translated to the L2 norm, and this is the comparison that I used here. But they, in fact, That are used here. But they, in fact, worked with the logarithmic entropy and an entropy method. And somehow, in between such an entropy distance between the solution and the steady state, or measuring it in L2 as I did here, you would have a whole scale of weighted LP norms. So that would be a natural scale with P between 1 and 2 that would fit. And two that would fit into this scheme that would be easily extendable from the work of Guillain Montmarché. For our work, the L2 framework was important and helped a lot.
