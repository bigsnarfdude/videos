It's proportional biology spoken on building fundamental microbiota cell biology using long-term time-lapse atomic force microscopy. So thank you again for making this analogy. Thanks very much for having me, especially since this is my first math meeting. So I will try to be a biologist that speaks clearly. And if you have questions, please ask. I'm a microbiologist. I did my postdoc in Switzerland. The work that I'm presenting to you is the work that I've done in Switzerland, now brought with me to UCSF, where I've continued to work on it. I've, through my career, been interested in understanding bacterial infections. And for the past 10 years, I've really been focused on understanding one problem in particular, which is why bacteria can persist in conditions in which... Can persist in conditions in which they're genetically sensitive and shouldn't be able to persist. So, for specific pathogens like mycobacteria, which cause infection that's rather chronic and really a pandemic for the ages, one of the major problems that every patient has to deal with is the reality that the bacterium within a population, the isogenic population, as exhibited in this graph, when you add an antibiotic, most bacteria will die off. Antibiotic, most bacteria will die off. But there's a subpopulation of bacteria that will survive the treatment. And when you remove the antibiotic, those bacteria will grow out again. Now, the difference between these bacteria not being resistant to the drug and simply being phenotypically resistant for a certain period of time is that if you add the drug back again, the bacterial population will collapse yet again. So, of those bacteria that survived, many will die off. Bacteria that survived, many will die off later. We want to understand what the underlying principles are that determine why this happens. The problem, though, in biology, particularly in microbiology, is that we've really been focused on studying phenotypes and processes at the bulk population level. The problem is that a phenotype might not reflect, or an average phenotype might not reflect the full variability in phenotypes with In phenotypes of individual bacteria within that population. And the previous line, you add the same drug. Yes, absolutely. Though we can also add different drugs, and we still see this problem. I mean, for tuberculosis, we treat patients with four or five different drugs at the same time, and yet bacteria persist. And it's simply because bacteria at the single cell level, some bacteria are phenotypically resistant. We don't know what those underlying mechanisms are. Mechanisms are molecular or otherwise. And I think what's really, really striking is that all of the molecular mechanisms that have been discovered to date that would allow for enhanced tolerance can be knocked out and bacteria can still persist. So what underlies that process? We want to understand the values. So coming back to the phenotypic heterogeneity within a population, an average phenotype An average phenotype might very well reflect a population, but in other instances, it might be really terrible. And so we're really interested in developing tools that would allow us to understand what those subpopulations are, what are their phenotypic uniquenesses that would allow those bacteria to persist. And so what we really want is to be able to see. See phenotypic variation at the single cell level, and we want to do this in a temporal way. That's really hard for mycobacteria because they're so small. They're on the order of five microns in length and less than a micron in diameter. And so the optical fluorescence microscopy is not really ideal for allowing us to be able to really describe phenotypic heterogeneity as best we would like to. As best we would like to. And so, and at the same time, we really, what we realize is that a lot of the fundamental processes of how bacteria grow, the proliferative processes like growth and division, or the self-efficacing ones like death, we don't understand fundamentally how those are controlled at the molecular level, in mycobacteria in particular, and for other bacteria and pathogens as well. And so, what we've considered is that we really need to go back to first principles. To first principles and redefine how these processes occur, refine our understandings of the phenotypes themselves, and that will give us more perspective on how to even look for molecular mechanisms that might be involved in controlling these processes. So we decided at a BFEL, at an engineering school, me, a biologist, I had no idea what an AFM looked like or how to engineer anything, stepped into an engineering lab and we said, okay, let's build an atomic force microscope. Let's build an atomic force microscope that would allow us to do long-term time-lapse imaging. And what an AFM offers us is single nanometer resolution. So it's 100 times better than we could get by light microscopy. And we can image these bacteria dynamic, for continuously, for days on end, for up to a week, so long as a person can stay awake. Now, what we also get are multiple measures of the bacterial cell. Multiple measures of the bacterial surface. An AFM cantilever, it resonates above a surface, it contacts that surface, so we can measure the topography of that surface. So this is a meeting on shapes and living systems, perfect. But we know what the AFM cantilever is made of, so we know how much force it takes to bend that cantilever. So we can even calculate back stiffness maps of the surface of those bacteria. And we don't just live in a physical world, we also live in a chemical world. Also, live in a chemical world. So, that cantilever actually binds to chemical properties of the cell surface, and so we can measure some aspect of the chemical composition of bacterial surfaces. All of those different phenotypes at the same time on individual cells really gives us a much higher chance of identifying uniquenesses between individuals that might be related back to why certain bacteria survive certain stresses. So, I'll give you just a brief overview of a few studies that we've done, focused on division in particular, some on growth, and how we've redefined those processes. Again, we're identifying fundamental principles that then give us new meaning and justification of how to even go and look for molecular mechanisms that might be controlling these processes. So, the first is division site selection. For certain bacterial Selection. For certain bacteria like E. coli and Bacillusetilis, we understand how those processes are controlled to a certain extent molecular. The only problem is that for mycobacteria, we don't have any of the homologs of those genes that would control those processes. So we don't know how that process is controlled at all. But with AFM, we were really lucky in that we found that the cell surface of mycobacteria, which is characterized as a rod-shaped bacterium, is actually wave-form. Waveform in morphology undulates ever so slightly on its surface. So we just took a profile along the ridge line of that surface and plotted that in time. So this is a chymograph representation of a cell from birth to division. We see this waveform pattern. We see what we call wave peaks and wave troughs all along the length of the cell. As cells elongate, these bacteria elongate from the poles, new wave troughs. Poles. New wave troughs or waveform patterns are added as elongation occurs. This is an old pole, this is a new pole. And so we can measure the dynamics of each of these individual poles. What was really surprising to us, at least for division site selection, was that the central most wave trough seemed to be the site where division was occurring always for a mycobacterium. So our model is Mycobacterium spegbatus, which is a non-pathogenic model for studying tuberculosis. Model for studying physiology related to tuberculosis or non-tuberculous microbacterial pathogens. And we've now extended this work as well in various ways to identifying these same sorts of features on the bacterial pathogens. So we find that this wave trough at the centralmost site is where division occurs. Those were established from previous generations. Generations. And they're inherited to future generations. So it's the earliest, it's the first bacterium for which we identify a morphological feature which would determine where division would occur in the future, and it occurs generations before a division would occur. And so it is essentially, perhaps, a way in which bacteria can pattern and determine where a division could take place. We have an idea that now wave troughs offer a few different sites where. Troughs offer a few different sites where divisions are possible, and then there are other processes that would determine which is the best to use. Just a question for curiosity: have you tried this on E. coli? No, so we can image E. coli, not very well. They don't stick to surfaces very well. The only reason why we can do long-term time-lapse imaging of mycobacteria is that we stick them on a hydrophobic surface. Mycobacteria are hydrophobic themselves, and it's good enough for us to image them. For us to image them. E. coli, their shape is not as amenable to imaging them by AFM thus far. So we've built these sorts of open-ended coffins that we can suck bacteria and just stick them into the coffins and image them. Streptococcus pneumoniae we've also done. That's an ovococcoid bacterium. So we can look at other shapes. We don't see these same sorts of features on those bacteria. They don't grow the same way either. How much is this wave trough's bacteria? Belief troughs are affected by the substrate that you can get. Yeah, they're not affected by it. EM images from the 70s onwards on other surfaces show the same sort of morphology. Yeah. It can under certain instances, yeah. I think there it would really depend on growth dynamics as well per Well, various perturbations would drive bacteria to change their division time versus the elongation time. So bacteria can get a bit longer, and there you might actually get the opportunity to find these inherited further down the line. And so another point is that these bacteria, they don't grow symmetrically from each pole. So that problem wasn't expressing. So I can't solve my question exactly. Because you are sitting here, you are using the you have seated the points already for future where the cell is going to. But if you look on the left side, you need to get another image, which is completely different. Yeah, those are set up. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So we need, I mean, at this point, we really need systematic image analysis software that Khan's lab and Klemolen will talk about is developing to actually go and image that and study those sorts of processes. And study those sorts of processes. The manually for a biologist, it's a pain to do this. But now we have the justification to do that and look at those sorts of processes. Some chemical composition along the surface. Have you mapped that into C for is it? Yeah, so I went to Linz in Austria and understood or learned how to chemically modify cancer. Chemically modify cantilever tips to just image that surface. And we see differences. So, for example, if you put a lectin molecule which binds to sugar molecules like mannose on the surface of mycobacteria, generally mannose is a little bit underneath the surface. But with the cantilever, when we're imaging them, it's like we're tickling the surface. But you can push a little bit harder, and then we start to see that the polar and the subpolar regions are. And the subpolar regions are coated with nanose, or at least they're accessible to the cantilever for this sugar. Whereas in the middle of the cell, which is covered with more hydrophobic substances like mycolates, there it's less so. So there is heterogeneity on that surface, which is awesome. I mean, that just tells me that, for example, for the immune system, the antigen presentation would be different for one cell versus another or a place where a host. Place where a host could interact with a pathogen would not be symmetrical on the surface. So back to division site selection. We thought to ourselves, okay, well, that's great. We've identified this phenotype. We want to go and characterize that a bit further. We built an atomic force microscope set above an optical fluorescence microscope. These are not commercially available. We built our own for a We built our own for a lot of money. But what that allowed us to do is now take fluorescently labeled proteins that we know are involved in division site selection and map the timing of each of these events with physical features that we see appearing by AFM. So the top is just a 3D representation of the height. The middle is actually an error channel. In a perfect world, it would be black. Would be black, but since we lose energy every time we oscillate the cantilever, we can actually essentially build an image of the texture on the surface of bacteria. So, for example, on my hand, if we look with just light, we'd see a shadow in the back, but we actually see texture on my hand, and that's what we see on the surfaces of these bacteria. And we see features that we would never see before, simply because this is a dynamic image as well, and it's fantastic. What it allows us to do is Fantastic. What it allows us to see is that, for example, FTSZ, which is the earliest known factor in mycobacteria, which would localize to the site where a septum would begin to form and division would take place, we also see a kink appear, which we call a pre-cleavage furrow. And only afterwards do the daughter cells actually cleave apart. I'll show some more data on this in a bit, describing how that process takes place. Takes place. So that's wonderful. We've described this process, but we don't understand why a centralmost wave trough is always selected. We don't know of, for example, other factors which are involved in determining why the centralmost point in other vector or mid-cell region is selected. There are molecular processes. We don't know of the homologs. But what we do know is that there are mutants that do divide asymmetrically in mycobacteria. Asymmetrically in mycobacteria, there's a mutant called PARB, which is involved in nucleotide partitioning. And if you knock any one of the members of this gene system out, bacteria will divide asymmetrically on occasion. And so we thought, well, could those asymmetric divisions occur at asymmetric wave troughs? And indeed, that's what we see. These are just height profiles stacked on top of one another for three generations. We see that in some instances, we get off-center wave troughs. We get off-center wave troughs, and it's always a wave trough where division takes place. Why that occurs, we don't know yet, but now we can go and develop forward genetic screens to try and identify what genes would be involved in controlling the morphology of the cell surface or division within wave drops in particular. Now, why does division matter? Well, antibiotics target division. Not all antibiotics, but some do. We've used them to also study this problem. We've used them to also study this process. I think what's rather cool is that some of them are involved in limiting DNA replication, for example, and that is a mechanism by which you can inhibit division taking place. Ciprofloxacin, for example, is one of those drugs. What's cool is that those bacteria will then grow much longer. They'll filament. When you take away the drug, then division will take place. That always occurs at DNA minima. So we consider DNA minima. So we consider that even though there are homologs of genes that are involved in nucleoid occlusion of division taking place where there is no DNA, in these bacteria, there's probably something analogous to that that now we can go and look for and screen for. So we want to identify new molecular determinants inevitably that would determine why division site selection takes place at this waveform morphology, at this wave. Morphology at this waveform trough. And hopefully, that could be, for example, one way to develop new therapeutics for developing new drugs to treat these sorts of infections. I'll actually just show a few more slides only on division. I won't talk about the other work that I think is really cool as well, but you can ask me about that if you want later. AFM is a scanning-based approach. It's like the internet in the 90s, where it's images, it's The 90s, where it's images, it's one line at a time. So, in the middle of scanning bacteria, we saw that on occasion, bacteria would actually cleave apart. So, this mechanical process, we thought, people can study that as well. We've timed that event to happening within seven milliseconds. And so we can scan quickly over just the division site, or we can just hold the cantilever right above where division would take place. Lever right above where division would take place and very rapidly determine how fast that process increases cleavage. What's more, as I've mentioned, we also have a measure of the stiffness of the surface of these bacteria, and we see that the stiffness really increases at the site where division is going to take place, or is taking place, after a septum is completely formed. So, as the septum is forming, as a new material is being added, mechanically that forms a cross-border. That forms a cross bridge, and that already begins to increase the stiffness of the cycle of division that occur. So, whatever is lighter is harder, whatever is darker is softer. You see that. And when cleavage occurs, that goes away. We've timed that as well and really measured the kinetics of the increase of those mechanical properties. And we've identified that certain cell forces are really critical for driving this increase. For driving this increase in stiffness, Turker pressure, in particular, inside the cell, is critical for this. So, if we were to go and use the AFM to literally stab one of the daughter cells to death, we would see that all of a sudden that stiffness would drop. And so, you wouldn't get divisional crane by these two cells now pushing against one another and ripping apart from one another. We have mutants, in fact, that are defective in. Are defective in how the cell wall breaks itself apart precisely at the septum. Those are hydrolases. If we knock those out, we'll actually see that the bacteria will divide, but then they'll stay chained to one another. And so what we can do is come with the AFM and just push on that site and break those cells apart and measure how much force it takes even to break them apart. So in a perfect world, if there was an AFM for every bacterium, they wouldn't need proteins to They wouldn't need proteins to even do this process. But in nature, as we don't have that, they use hydrolases together with the mechanical forces to really time the to determine the time, the optimal time at which to divide. And it's really a combination of both of those forces that determine how that process takes place. And so again, coming back to the impact, well, at least we have a much At least we have a much greater understanding that perhaps targeting cell wall hydrolases and the process of cytokinesis together would be one way, a new way, for example, targeting killing bacteria through targeting the process of cell division. Okay, so that's the cell division work. Just to whet your appetite, we've also used this process to redefine how growth occurs in bacteria. Occurs in bacteria, the dynamics of elongation from each of the poles, as a function of polar elongation from old poles and new poles, as well as mechanically understanding how division takes place. And so just to say, that's important for mycobacteria, because they grow from the poles, the way in which material is inherited to future generations is also asymmetric. And so there's phenotypic heterogeneity inherently. Heterogeneity inherently in the way that material is partitioned to each of the cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it divides much slower, but it elongates in a similar dynamic as faster-growing mycobacteria. So it's actually more symmetrical in how they partition their material on the surface. But there are faster-growing non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens that are even harder to treat with antibiotics than TB. Antibiotics than TB, and those are much more asymmetrical. So I think we really need to take into account that not all bacteria are equal in the body, and we really need to develop tools for treating not only most of the bacteria, but all of the bacteria, also the subpopulations. It's simply by morphology. Yeah, morphology and cell surface. Cell surface features that we measure on the surface that are mostly static. So the surface material is very static for microbacteria. The length of the chains of the lipids on the surface are very long, and so they're very static in time. If you increase the temperature to 45 to 50 degrees, then they'll start to become more fluid and move around. But at lower temperature, And move around. But at lower temperatures in the body, it's not relevant. And so it's losing that. So we believe that that is on some level relevant for measuring certain features. And then I'll just actually finish with this. Again, mechanically, bacteria are not all the same. Whatever is darker is softer, whatever is lighter is harder. We see that these hot dogs are really individuals. Some bacteria grow and increase And increase the stiffness of their subpolar material very rapidly, others don't. And that means that the stiffness of bacterial surfaces is actually a critical feature for how bacteria could survive, which I can talk about later afterwards. But I think I'll stop there and just move to the acknowledgements. And well, before the acknowledgements, say that, well, we've developed long-term time. Well, we've developed long-term time labs AFM. We want to use this. There's a whole bunch of data that we have showcased how it influences biology. There's so much more to be discovered for not only mycobacteria, but all sorts of bacteria. And these principles that we discover for mycobacteria, we realize in many instances are true for all bacteria. So we're discovering new biology. And we just want to take advantage of that using now tools that, for example, Ken's Lab and Stein as well. So, most of this work started when I was a postdoc at Perfett. I have continued it at UCSF together with collaborators as well around the world and as well with Camus Lab. Thanks very much for listening. So, are you seeing, I remember you mentioned something that we were looking at, the building profilers can see, are you seeing multiple tuning patterns? Multiple tuning patterns. Multiple tuning patterns? We know, but that's only because we haven't looked for that. The way in which we image wouldn't really allow us to resolve that, but that's something that we could trouble with probably the stiffness. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think that would be really cool to look at. Yeah. So your seven milliseconds really blew my mind. Seconds really blew my mind. So that's the amount, that's the time scale of the hydrolases actually breaking up the cell warm and form that came from. That's incredibly fast for a chemical process. I don't know if they have to break up the material so fast because I think it's really it's as much the trigger pressure opposing it. And I think that really set apart. And I think that some point, okay. Yeah. Oh, more of a data question. How uh 'cause obviously the AI and region problem tip has to be on there, otherwise you get this line separation. I'm wondering how scalable is this. You talk about bulky parameters. Yeah, heterogeneity also bacteria species and if you take it from a certain point a certain part of the view, but it's It says in part of the field of view, but as if you could sample the whole field of view and across. Yeah, so we've been rather constrained with the space in which we could image at any one time to less than the widest we've gone is 70 microns by a 20 micron space. Newer AFMs are getting better at this, especially with optical fluorescence below. We really know, we Below, we really know we'll have like fiducial markers and we'll know where we want to endures. Develop bacteria that will communicate with each other and use each other. Yeah, maybe. I mean, these bacteria, we don't, that sort of biological process hasn't been described for them yet, I'm sure. Like Myxococcus, I think, they exchange material. Mycobacteria, I think at higher temperatures. I think at higher temperatures, probably would exchange my chronates and maybe some proteins with them. I don't know how relevant that is per se in the body at 37 degrees, which is a lower temperature, unless there are enzymes that would kind of fluidify that surface. But, you know, something to consider in the future, which I'm sure will have relevance. Anotita, Venusaur. Thanks, Anna. Very nice talk. My question is regarding too good pressure. So So, what is the environment in which these cells are living, the bacteria? What drives to compression? So, water. But, I mean, so look, mycobacteria, they're pathogens, they live inside macrophages, inside vacuoles, and the salt concentrations change drastically in those conditions. Change drastically in those conditions. So, sugar pressure will drop in many cases. When you do experiments, at least in some ways. This is just in media with salt concentrations, for example. So what would drive Turger pressure? What would drive Turger pressure? Yeah. I mean, Turger pressure isn't increasing or decreasing per se in our conditions. Say in our conditions, it's just the same. Size might influence it to some extent, wall properties will influence it to some extent. The hydrophobicity of the surface would influence it to some extent. Properties that one would have to take into account. So, for example, mycobacteria, when we stick them inside macrophages, they become really soft. It's their trigger pressure that's really dropping. Really dropping. If you stimulate the immune response of macrophages, first line of the immune system, bacterial actually become hard on their surface. And that's actually because of the cell wall that's being broken apart. So the turger pressure pops them off. So Alex, you show that at the point where we have the separation, the stiffness goes up dramatically. Stiffness goes up dramatically, right? At the same time, we saw that there are two kinds of bacteria: software and hardware. So, for each of those kinds of bacteria, is the stiffness going up to the same level, or it depends on the background of the bacteria? So, bacteria will increase about twofold in their stiffness pretty consistently, and they'll decrease their stiffness twofold pretty consistently. There are molecular reasons why that's the case. And there are also chemicals. So it's not an absolute number, but rather with respect to the property, to the background of the SPC. Yeah, but what I think is really cool is that it's really
