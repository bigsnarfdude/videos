Surprise, surprise. General topic that's been an obsession for way too long than I care to admit. Biopolymers, fibrous systems, including some of the stuff we just heard about. Basically, I want to focus on a different kind of phase transition, which is conceptually similar to most of what Itai was talking about, but different in some important ways. It's a strain control transition, and I want to argue. And I want to argue or convince you that A, it is a genuine transition. It's even critical in the thermodynamic sense. And B, it is key to understanding the nonlinear mechanics of simplified collagen systems, reconstituted collagen systems, at least. And I think can give insights into real excess cellular matrices. Some other things will come up, including critical slowing down, as I said, but let me just. That, but let me just get right into well, that's the kind of thing I want to focus on. And concession time, I'm going to be talking not about excellent matrices, but about reconstituted collagen networks. Okay, that is an important distinction. If there's time, I'll say something about what happens when you add hyaluronic acid. But mostly, these are going to be single-component systems we want to understand deeply before moving on and trying to say something about the. Trying to say something about the real exercise matrices, reductionist that I am. So, among the other, well, among a couple of things that are worth noting about these systems before getting into them, I want to focus on two. They're going to be a thermal, so forget about your Gaussian chains from polymers. And the deformation fields in these systems. The deformation fields in these systems are going to be highly non-uniform. That's key to understanding a lot of what's going on. The jargon there is non-affine. Affine being the kind of transformation you can do of a space with a matrix representation, uniform at all places, the strings are uniform, and so these are non-uniform. That's part of what makes it challenging to understand. And there's been some interesting advances over the years in dealing with that. So, non-linearity, a really nice. A really nice place to start is classic physiology work going back to Fung in my 60s. This is just doing uniaxial extension on collagenous tissue, real tissue, so not just simplified systems, but you can see much the same thing in a reconstituted collagen network. And so it's far from Hockeyan. He's looking at force as a function of extension, stress as a function of strain, you could say. As a function of strain, you could say. And one of the things he does, oops, one of the things he does is plot the derivative of stress with respect to strain. Something I want to be looking at a lot. I'll write it up here. Rather than the ratio of stress to strain, I want to focus on a nonlinear measure appropriate for non-Hockeyan systems, the derivative. So that would be utterly flat. That would be utterly flat in a linear elastic material. So don't think of that as linear or Hockeyan. That would be Hockeyan. This is the derivative increasing with load. Half is to be approximately linear. Don't worry too much about that. That's not rigorous and it's not actually observed over a wider range. But an important thing to note is you can see that that stiffness is changing by nearly two orders of magnitude. So it's a really dramatic effect. So it's a really dramatic effect. You know this from pulling on your tissues, like your earlier, okay? It's not Hookian, better not be, and it's nonlinear in a particular reproducible, highly stiffening, strongly stiffening way. Okay, so how can we understand that? This is what, you know, gets people like us thinking about these systems. And I want to go back to other work, classic work from the 60s. That's in the 1860s, due to Maxwell, who did many, many great things. And among those is something mechanical engineers learn and physicists have only rediscovered in the last few years, it seems. Actually, it's not quite... Rigidity percolation people like Thorpe and others in the 80s knew well about this stuff, but it's certainly come back in vogue, it's fair to say. And Maxwell's argument basically can be Argument basically can be summarized in a slightly oversimplified way to say he basically balances degrees of freedom with constraints. And so if I focus on one of these nodes connected to a bunch of neighbors, and I'll not coincidentally choose four neighbors for a two-dimensional network. So just imagine Hookie and Springs. So these are only Hookie and Springs. They're not real polymers. Springs. They're not real polymers just yet. And what Maxwell focuses on is the number of degrees of freedom per node. And so in D dimensions, there would be D degrees of freedom for this node. In two dimensions, there's two axes along which I can move. In three dimensions, there would be a third. And then he says, well, every time I add a constraint, I subtract from this number of degrees of freedom. And how do I do that? Well, I insert. And how do I do that? Well, I insert this spring. It acts as a constraint, but it's simultaneously trying to constrain two things, the endpoints. So it's an accounting, in an average sense, it's a half a constraint. So I'll subtract Z or Z, depending on where you come from, divide it by 2, where this is a fourfold connected node. Node. Now, when that quantity is greater than zero, I have remaining degrees of freedom. It's floppy. It's not constrained. So that'll be F for me, floppy. And if it's less than zero, I get a rigid structure. It's not, don't think of rigidity as a magnitude of a shear modulus. Think of it, or a Young's modulus. Just think of it as zero or not zero. So I get rigidity, at least at some level, if I reduce a non-zero. If I reduce enough of the original degrees of freedom, there's ways to decorate this calculation and improve it with subtle aspects that I won't go into, but that's the essence. So that gives rise to a critical coordination number, which is 2D. So in two dimensions, that might look reminiscent of the kinds of structures you might be thinking of. They'll be crossing points. Thinking of, there'll be crossing points in this collagen picture. I'll zoom in. There's a fourfold coordinated connection. But in three dimensions especially, it's far from this condition. So at first sight, this picture seems to say nothing about the rigidity of those systems. But however, it's still a useful place to start thinking about it. So here's six, and I'm going to think about connectivity here. Four, you know, might be here if you're working in 2D, but parentheses around that. We don't really usually do that. And I mentioned that I want to focus on nonlinear effects. So I'm going to add strain into this. I'll just put this on the vertical axis. Could be extensional strain or shear strain. The experiments I show you are going to be shear strain only, but you can do it. Only, but you can do extensions. Actually, the fung stuff I mentioned before is extension. And I want to argue that, well, the physics here is, well, there's actually another thing I should point out about it. This is a linear argument. This says whether the system is linearly stable. It says nothing about what happens in a nonlinear regime. And so there's some critical point here, happens to be a critical point. Point. And I want to argue that that shifts to lower connectivity. Actually, we saw already a diagram of that in Itai's talk, but it shifts to lower connectivity, meaning that I can start with a physiological connectivity. So when people measure this for simplified, for reconstant collision networks, they typically come up with a number of about 3.5. So it's below Maxwell's isostatic point in 2D and way below it in 3D. And so the physiological is bound here. And so the physiological is down here. And I want to imagine what happens if I move up this axis in strand. So this is rigid, this is high. Okay, why might something happen there? Well, okay. We actually know from earlier work even going back to flexible polymers, there's reasons to think that you can have stress-stabilized or strain-stabilized systems. Or strain-stabilized systems. But I would argue, we already know this from systems like this. The spider doesn't build the web this way, but this web is stabilized only by being held at the boundaries. Obviously, we know what happens if you disconnect it, it'll go floppy. And so you could imagine forming a structure and then straining it and then having it go rigid. Not what the spider does. And you might also say, oh, but. Does. And you might also say, oh, but hold on, this is essentially a 2D structure, and these are fourfold coordinated. Maybe that's Maxwell. No, not really. I assure you, you could cut a significant fraction of these bonds, probably making the spider unhappy, but you could cut a significant fraction of those bonds, and it'll still be stable. You'll just have to strain it a little bit more to stretch it. So that already suggests that this boundary shifts that way. Boundary shifts that way. Okay, so this works. There is indeed a phase boundary there. We got interested a few years ago, actually going back to work of the postdoc back in Amsterdam, but it was really a question that was answered in work with Abby about seven years ago. Basically, asking the question: what's the nature of that transition? If there is a transition, is it first order? If there is a transition, is it first order? Is it second order? There was some debate. In fact, there's discontinuities in certain things, which would suggest first order, but it's actually critical. Second order, it's a line of second order points. So slightly different from what Itai was saying, I don't think of this as going from one critical point to another. It's a line of critical points in a phase diagram, of which there's a number of examples in thermodynamics. It's a little less common, but it can happen. So it's actually second-order. So, it's actually a second-order line. Now, I want to show you what happens as I cross that boundary in a cartoon that's very useful for illustrating what's going on. Let me see if I can control this. No. Yeah, this is one of the problems with doing presentation this way. Okay, so I'll show you the movie and then I'll just repeat it. I'll show you the movie and then I'll just repeat it. So, what I'm doing is deforming this network, but in a way that might seem weird. I'm not sharing it because what I want you to be able to see is the non-affine rearrangements. And that's actually what you were seeing. Because what I'm doing is I'm doing bulk expansion. And so, if the system deforms affinely, everything should just scale. And if I change my magnification, which is what I'm actually doing, everything should stay fixed. Okay, so I'm actually changing the magnification so the boundaries don't move, even though I'm straight. So, the boundaries don't move, even on straining sound, for example. Okay, so with that in mind, let me replay the movie. Okay, so starting at zero strain, abstraining, things are rearranging a little bit. You can see the straight lines are no longer straight, no longer following lattice axes. And there was a lot of rearrangements right before I stopped. And hopefully, your eye caught the fact that there weren't just large rearrangements. The fact that they weren't just large rearrangements, those rearrangements were also of large regions. Those are going to play the role of critical fluctuations and they have a diverging correlation length. So the correlation length of those regions actually grows. Diverges subject to finite size fluctuations. Now, everything I just showed you is an entirely floppy system. It will not resist any infinitesimal bulk or shear strain. They're all floppy. If I strain it the slightest bit. If I strain it the slightest bit beyond that point, it goes rigid. But that rigidity appears, for instance, this line here will start to go under tension. And so what you'll get is a complicated force-bearing chain that goes from one side of the sample to another. A sort of percolation, but a force. And that's what happens if I continue, and I'm stretching the hell out of it now. This would be a very drunken spider web, but hopefully you can see these red lines. Hopefully, you can see these red lines and it's complicated force paths. Okay? So that's, I think, a useful way to think about this transition. Notice, by the way, that that transition occurred without significant macroscopic alignment. Yes, there's some realignment, but notice that in principle, this transition goes all the way down to this point here at infinitesimally small strains, meaning that I don't need to get significant alignment. So it's not an alignment transition. Yes. Is that a one f exponent initial? Is that a one-half exponent initially? No, this is just a sketch. I'm going to get to exponents. It's not one-half. Okay. But now that's all just hooky and spring. So that's taking Maxwell's original picture and just saying what happens if I go beyond linear stability and strand. Okay? Now, the real systems also resist another. Yes. Oh, so you have a distribution of bench sizes here, which would be heterogeneous. Now I do. I originally started with a diluted triangular network. With a diluted triangular network. Yeah, and so do you look? I mean, is that look like kind of the distribution of bench size? Like, how important is the heterogeneity? Oh, actually, heterogeneity is very important. So, in fact, for critical phenomena, we see even non-mean field exponents, if that rings a bell. And I won't get into it, but a very important aspect of that non-mean field behavior. Of that non-mean field behavior comes from how disordered that network is. So things like that distribution will appear there. Okay. A way to like deal with a whole lot of disorder, yeah. Oh, not. We have studied what happens to, for instance, critical exponents as a function of disorder. But there's many different ways of introducing that. And so I don't think there's a clean answer to your question. But we do know that this. But we do know that disorder seems to be responsible for why we're getting non-mean field exponents, and a contrast with jamming where the corresponding systems are mean field, which is interesting. But yeah. And confession time again, a value of an exponent, whether it's non-mean field or not, I fully confess it's biologically completely irrelevant. It's just interesting physically, okay? Okay? So we all have our interests and priorities. Okay. Anyway, so this system doesn't have any bending resistance just yet, right? So rather than going from floppy with zero rigidity to rigid with finite rigidity, what happens in a real system is I go from yes, here we go. Going from soft to stiffer. Okay? So this is bending-dominated. This is going to go towards stretching-dominated. And by the way, there's something which is not a coincidence here. So I'll point it out. Notice about two to three orders of magnitude difference between the lowest values. This is experimental by the way. This is collagen. And this is collagen at one meg per mil, way below the levels we were just hearing about. It's a tenth of a percent volume fraction. And if you ask the And if you ask the question, what's the relative importance of bending to stretching? It's measured by volume fraction. If I take the same network and I simply increase the diameter of the filaments, I increase the volume fraction, of course, accordingly. I increase stretching energies proportional to that, but I increase bending rigidity quadratic in that increased cross-section. So in fact, this ratio between the maximum stiffness and the minimum. Stiffness and the minimum stiffness is the inverse in the volume fraction, I would argue. Okay? That's assuming a finite length. That's assuming some general, fairly general conditions. Yeah. It's not exact. That's the way it scales with volume fraction. Getting fatter, not volume. Yeah. Okay, so in other words, the bending-dominated regime should be volume fraction, should go like Young's modulus times volume fraction squared. That regime should go like That regime should go like Young's modulus of the collagen times volume fraction to the power one. Okay, so can we analyze this and get a little bit more insight into the criticality? I claimed it was critical. How is this critical? Well, okay, let's start by imagining the region on this side of the phase boundary. So I crossed this line moving vertically, and I'm looking up here somewhere. Something. Now, in the absence of any bending resistance, Hoockeyan systems, they would have been floppy here. On a log-log scale, that's minus infinity. And so I would come up with this dashed line here and follow the line to the right. If you do that, and you can do this with a variety of structures in 2D and 3D, nothing particularly exotic between 2D and 3D here. We're all operating well below this isostatic point. You wind up getting a stiffness which grows. Wind up getting a stiffness which grows as a power law of strain minus critical strain. Going back to your question about square root, it's actually t to the point, sorry, reduced temperature or reduced strain, and when we think of reduced temperature, thinking about this as a temperature-like variable, but strain to the power of 0.77. It's between 0.7 and 8. It's non-mean field, mean field would be 1 in that case, not 1 half. Yes? How do you get this? This is computation. I can... This is computation. I can offline, I will pop up. This is numerically. It would be a little technical, but I would love to chat with you about our current, how we're starting to get volume, these non-municiodized bones in a calculation. Okay? Okay. So, okay, so this is just one bit of evidence to start pointing in that direction. Again, experiments above, various simulations below, where we can tune parameters over a wider range than experiments can. Over a wider range than experiments can. You'll see at least qualitative agreement between those curves. So, how do we understand this? Well, I want to appeal to, and very briefly summarize, an idea going back to Cadnoff, real space renormalization, you could say, to motivate a highly constrained mathematical form for the energy of a system. And I better not, in the cavous of time, go through this. The essence is to say. The essence is to say the key observation about how close you are to the critical point is how big the correlation length is. When it's big, you can rescale the system. The physics should remain the same, but you should look like you're a little bit farther point because the correlation length is smaller in that rescaled system. That's the essence. You get an energy, which is a homogeneous, in the mathematical sense, function of my two variables that take me away from the critical point. One of them is how far I move from that line, either above or below, and the other is bending rate. And the other is bending rigidity, which is also taking you away from the critical point. Because if I bring another axis up here with bending resistance, this line of transition goes away because this floppy region has a finite modulus, just like the rigid region. They just have different values. So they're not distinguished as different phases. So this line of transitions only exists in the plane kappa equals zero here. And by the way, you can stabilize these systems not just by... Way you can stabilize these systems not just by bending but temperature. You can add thermal fluctuations, we've done that. You can add pre-stress. That came up in some discussion. That could be like the ions or something swelling a gel, etc. Other stabilizing effects. Okay, so now once I have this mathematically constrained form for the energy, though, I can start taking derivatives of energy with respect to strain to get things like stress and stiffness, right? One derivative of stress. Of stress with strain is, sorry, one derivative of energy with respect to strain would be stress, and another derivative of that with respect to strain, which would also be a derivative with respect to my reduced strain variable that looks temperature-like, thinking of a thermodynamic analogy with a thermodynamic phase transition. So, two derivatives with respect to that of the energy, which is also the free energy because it's t equals zero, gives me the stiffness of the network. Now, that should. Of the network. Now, that should start sounding maybe from a thematic point of view a little bit like a heat capacity, where I take two derivatives. Yeah, exactly. Now, that's worth mentioning because people do observe and have observed discontinuities in this quantity at the transition. That has nothing to do with whether it's first order or second order line. You can have discontinuities in the heat capacity at a second order transition any day. Now, once you have this, though, you can go back in. Have this, though, you can go back in and plug and rescale precisely by the correlation length and remove, whoops, and remove that from the problem. I don't know why I'm joking this. Here we go. And you get a relatively simple mathematical form that'll look familiar from critical phenomena, no surprise, and actually goes back from other arguments to especially people like Widem and others. You get a simple expression, relatively simple expression for the stiffness. Relatively simple expression for stiffness, this power law behavior we've seen before, and a remaining dependence that should depend on the bending resistance, and another similar power of the distance from a critical clock. You also get some interesting constraints between exponents. So rather than doing simulations and finding a whole bunch of different critical exponents, of which there are many, those all should be derivable from three fundamental ones, the dimensionality, and these two exponents here, so they shouldn't be related. So they shouldn't be like it. And we've confirmed, so Jordan here in two dimensions already confirmed that this holds in 2D. And we've also seen in work with Jordan and another former grad student, Sujad, that it works also in 3D. And this is for aficionados, this is a hyperscaling relation. It's non-trivial, non-methyl exponents in 2D and 3D. So apparently, our upper. 3D. So apparently our upper critical dimension is above 3. Big difference with JAV. Okay. So how about how this might show up experimentally? Okay, so this thing I just showed you is basically exactly what you do for a ferromagnetic phase transition. I won't walk you through, but a whole bunch of data for different magnetizations as function of the field at different temperatures will all collapse. Will all collapse if you divide magnetization by that factor and plot it versus field divided by that factor, or for us, stiffness divided by that factor versus rigidity, mini rigidity divided by that factor. Simulations simply do that. This is actually 2D, 3D, and two different 2D structures, one lattice-based, one off-lattenous. So-called Ricado model. They all do this. You can use this to start estimating these critical. To start estimating these critical exponents, there are better ways of doing that, but it works. Importantly, the experiments show this. Here's collagen. This is almost covering an order of magnitude range in concentration. Remember, I pointed out concentration should map on to theoretically bending resistance, or at least the relative strength of bending and stretching. So that's the way this analysis is done, and this collapse is arguably almost. Arguably almost getting close to magmetic, paramagnetic-like. Yes? And are you also doing this as a function of the Z? No. So we are, and this is not a perfect assumption, mind you, but I will start with an assumption that these networks have the same connectivity, so they're governed by the same point in strain. There's a very weak shift in the critical strain with concentration. In the critical strain with concentration, because the conductivity is slightly shifting. But notice it's a very weak effect. You change the concentration by an order of magnitude, and the conductivity is shifting by a very small fraction. But in order to do the line of critical points versus crossover scaling, you have to do it as a function of your C as well. And you'll need to show that you're not in the L. Well, so we haven't done that. We haven't done that. I would say we. We haven't done that. I would say we want to understand. So, first of all, we wanted to. This is the original evidence, if you like, for the fact that this is a critical line of critical points. You could do this at different z. And so we've done that computationally. But experimentally, you're given the connectivity you have. It's very hard to vary that substantially. Yes? Okay. So, anyway, let me. Let me move on to other previously reported interesting effects in extracellular real extracellular systems having to do with the mechanics like Poisson ratio. How do you do that in your system? Is there a landscape in the widget below which is which is affine? Oh no, ah yes. So it's not that the system is affine above Above the correlation length, it's that the motion is uncorrelated. Yeah. The best way to access the correlation length quantitatively is to do what's called finite size scaling in simulations. Experimentally, it's extremely challenging. And that's one thing I want to get to in a moment about a possible new avenue for seeing that experimentally. Throughout. So it appears. So it appears, I mean, it's, I'll show you some more evidence as we move along, but basically, you should imagine that all along this line, non-affinity is getting really large. And correlation lengths are getting big. Okay, so let's see how that actually shows up in Poisson ratios. So you might know people like Ben Fabry and others over the last 10 years or so have reported Poisson ratios, which are like 10 in extracellular matrix. I don't know if anyone's seen that sort of thing. I don't know if anyone's seen that sort of stuff that bothers people because there's a thermodynamic upper bound on the Poisson ratio of one half, at least for linear elastic isotropic materials. Some keywords there I'll get to. But the basic idea of the Poisson ratio is just that if you take a volume-preserving material, I'll start with that, strain it by 1% along one axis, it should contract by 12%. Contract by a half percent on the two transverse axes. That's a three-dimensional result, obviously. So the minus is already factored into this ratio here between the transverse and the longitudinal strains. And one half would correspond to an incompressible material. And every linear elastic isotropic material better have a Poisson ratio less than or equal to that, because that would otherwise correspond to a system that reduces its volume when you put it under traction. Its volume when you put it under traction. That would look like a negative compressibility, which, of course, is precisely what people report. Actually, this paper here reports a negative compressibility. But the thing I want to draw your attention to is that this upper line corresponds to volume preservation as a function of longitudinal extensions. And notice that these samples, I think this one's fibrant, if I remember correctly, I always get these references mixed up. These two. But notice. But notice that the sample is expelling 90% of the water, dramatically reducing its volume with modest strains. It's a little bit more apparent. I think the second one is collagen, showing the dashed line here would be one half. Anything below that is unphysical for a linear elastic isotropic material, and indeed these systems do that. Notice that it's deviating from that already at strains of order of 1 or 2%. Order 1 or 2%, very small strains. So it is surprising. And by the time you strain it longitudinally 5 to 10%, you've lost 80% of the volume. Pretty dramatic effect. And one thing that Jordan showed a couple years ago is that this actually tracks that same phase boundary, this one. So now we can't, so again, experimentally, you have very little control over that connectivity, so it's a little hard to move along that digirect, that line. That line. But if you measure this nonlinear version of the Poisson ratio, the derivative of the transverse strain with respect to longitudinal with minus sign, it peaks in a way similar to what's been reported in those experiments, coincident with a peak in the non-affine fluctuations. And so actually another, what you can do is you can show, so this is nicely shown in this heat map, this basically shows as a function of different samples. Basically, it shows as a function of different samples with different connectivity, simulation work, of course. And I flip my axes, this is connectivity, and that's strain. But this line corresponds to that phase boundary. And the heat map shows the peaking of this non-linear plus-on ratio right along the corresponding boundary observed for the peaking of fluctuations. So that's the critical line. So that phase diagram is going to. So, that phase diagram is governing that elastic anomaly. And I think I have some time still. Critical slowing down, very interesting subject. We got interested in this again with Jordan because if you've got these big non-affine fluctuations and they have large correlation length, you saw the rearrangements that were occurring in that little cartoon. Those rearrangements are occurring in a liquid. The solvent, the whatever fluid you have. I'm not getting into real extra state or matrices again, but these simplified systems. That suggests dissipation and slowing down because those regions get big. And that is indeed what happens. So this is, just think of this as stress as a function of time, to the following protocol, experimental protocol, strain the system to a particular value of strain. To a particular volume of strain, it could be above or below that line, and ask the question: what happens to the stress after time t equals zero where I incrementally, infinitesimally increase the strength? If it's a solid, then the stress won't relax. That's what happens with the red data here, function of time. So that means that my original strain here was just above that line, above this dashed line, I could say. You could say. And by contrast, if it was in the floppy phase, I would have a system with stress that would disappear at long enough. And so that's also captured down here, coincident with this boundary right here. If I strain above that, I get a non-affine nuclearing solid. Below that, I get a non-affine nuclear forming liquid, but only at long time. So this phase diagram should be thought of as t e goes to infinity number of this kind of thing. Of this kind of thing. And the other thing you start noticing here is: notice what's happening with the gray stuff. This is as you get close to the critical point. You see how these relaxation times are getting large? They're actually diverging, subject to finite size limitations. That correlation time diverges, peaks right at the transition, that boundary, again, dependent on the connectivity of the network, but for a given system, there's a well-defined critical strain. Well-defined critical strain and the non-affine fluctuations peak at that point. This, by the way, shows that discontinuity I mentioned before. Notice the stiffness is a little discontinuous here. So on the left-hand side, this stress, which is relaxing, would appear as a viscosity, because I'm not in a solid. On the right-hand side, you should be thinking about things like K double prime, the loss modulus, but a nonlinear version. But a nonlinear version. Okay, so if I have relaxation times which are getting large, that suggests vestostities might be getting large, and they are. Yes? Can you just remind me how you define the critical strain? It's not related to like the one of the codes I can define. So again, if I'm at the isostatic point, the critical strain is zero. If I am slightly below here, I get very small. Slightly below here, I get very small critical strains. In other words, I have to deform it very little. Or that spider web I was talking about, start cutting bonds and I have to strain it more. So it depends on the architecture of the network. So you would vary it by changing the architecture. Experimentally, you tend to be operating in a narrow range. Okay, but the viscosity, this is actually the intrinsic viscosity minus the fluid part, of course, is peaking again in a sort of heat map in both 2D and 3D right along that phase boundary. 3D right along that phase boundary. And something we were particularly interested in is that this signature here, well, actually, this peaking of the non-affine fluctuations is actually quantitatively the same as this peaking of the viscosity, apart from a pre-factor. So this peaking of the viscosity, notice the orders of magnitude change here. If you plot that versus the corresponding non-affinity, Versus the corresponding non-affinity, you see it's a perfect correlation. That's for a variety of samples with and without bending, particulate systems and jamming, fiber systems with fiber bending. They all, it's basically, there's a one-to-one relationship between the non-affine fluctuations in this concept. And we were excited about that because experimentally, identifying signatures that non-affinity directly has been very challenging. Okay? Chanel. Okay. This is saying just do rheology. Okay. Should I be wrapping up? Okay. Well, just say that we've gotten very interested in incompressibility, which also can affect these networks in an interesting way, that can explain strong synergies such that you can take a soft hyalonic matrix, a soft collagen matrix, add just those two systems together, and the resulting modulus. Together and the resulting modulus is more than order of magnitude. Okay, thank you. I don't know who raised their hand first. So I would like to follow up this question about the line of critical points. So if you go up at a different z, right, across that transition, and then you measure Transition and you measure the same critical exponent. That would indicate that there is one new fixed point by the control zone, but that's not the case. That's not what we see. We actually think we are disorder combinated. So what does that mean? I don't really think we're going to wind up with a single universality, a well-defined universality class. Or some other class. And a single critical point. That's my single fixed point. I don't think we're going to get there. I have to say that the jury's out. That's just my current. If I just limited through these diluted lattices, would it be one fixed point or a line that you can see different exponents? We seem to see different critical xmones. By the way, different strains. So if you go from shear to bulk or uniaxial, you definitely see radically different xmones. See radically different exponents. That's a little less surprising. I think, yeah. So, I have a related question for you. Do you think that as you go to the zero gamma, you will be bothering extra? No, no, we definitely don't. So, you can do that. So, in fact, going down here is precisely what Chase, and actually, that was a collaboration also with Jia Meng years ago. Years ago, did. And we tend not to spend much time there as a group anymore because that's outside the physiological range. But it is interesting to ask those questions and you definitely see non-mean field behavior there as well. I have one other question. Thinking about this rounding, but you said that the line sits only in that plane. And actually, but I don't quite understand that because I would expect that if you start Because I would expect that if you start to have some bandicas, let's say, your time may shift. But it could still be there. You have no transition. But you could still have a minimum, for example, the C, which you are not reaching. Ah, that will be the bending control of rigidity percolation point, which is way down here, also outside the physiological range. But you couldn't. I've forgotten what the number is, but. I've forgotten what the number is, but it's yeah, we're operating in the window between. And so that would not be affected by gamma? Oh, good point. I don't know if that's been studied. What we do know is that this line asymptotes to a different critical point, which is conductive percolation. You have to have at least one conducting path in order to bear stress across the sample. I've been asking lots. Do we go first? Okay. So you're, you know, this transition point, so it's very different than family because it's a lot more heterogeneous. It's amazing because of last transitions. I mean, how do you, like, what are, are there any similarities or how do I think about this transition pencilation where it's a heterogeneous class? Well, the critical slope, I mean, I don't, I don't. Yeah, we're thinking of the. Yeah, we're thinking of this as a critical system. So far, the slow dynamics we see are consistent with criticality. Is it glass-like qualitatively in certain ways? Yeah. It doesn't really like TRE for glass transitions. Anyway, yeah, if I can apply the concept of glass transitions to these biodiversity parts. Probably, I mean, certainly in the jamming business, that connection has been flushed out much more. Yeah. Right. Chances are, that would be useful. So far, everything we see is consistent with critical dynamics. Which I would distinguish. Thinking about this experimental challenge of resolving non-affine fluctuations, is it not possible that the non-affine Fluctuations. Is it not possible that the non-f volume fluctuations create a density fluctuation that you can see in scattering? Or is it possible that the length scale is big enough to even be optically resolvable in a microscope or a super resolution setup? Okay, so great questions. The imaging has been what people have attempted in focal various techniques. In short, it's inconclusive for the critical point. People do see non-affine effects, but But it's just not been sufficient to really quantitatively probe. And by the way, collaborators of ours, including Chaiser's group, definitely still do that. I may have neglected to mention all those experiments I mentioned were from Chais Bundering's group back when she was in Amsterdam before Delft. The other question, though, about density fluctuations is a really interesting one. So, one key difference we think is going on. The one key difference we think is going on with jamming and why we're seeing non-mini field effects has to do with density fluctuations. So, in particulate systems near jamming, you have very little density room. So, very little room to change density, right? So, your density fluctuations are constrained. You get what's called hyperuniformity, right? Restricted, low-Q, long-wavelength fluctuations. If, in the theory I didn't go through, which is a field theory where Bob talks about. Where Bob testifies a bit. If you just by hand impose disorder that vanishes at low Q, consistent with hyperuniformity, it goes mean field. So we think our systems definitely require low Q fluctuations, big ones. And chances are density fluctuations could be observable associated with these. Associated with these non-affine fluctuations. Because what we know from the hyalonic stuff, I didn't get into too much, that we think is imposing local volume on preservation, which will suppress the volume non-preserving fluctuations, and it has a big effect. So we think they're there.
