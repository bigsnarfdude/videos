So yeah, today I want to talk about some results in comparison geometry, some comparison geometry results in four substantive manifolds. I will build up some original geometry arguments leading finally to a substantive isotopic inequality. This will be the main topic of the talk. It's based on Of the talk, and it's based on a joint work with Matteo Cagnolo. And if there's time remaining, I will spend some time to discuss another joint work with Matteo Cagnolo and Terra Pinaponi, Rescue, again on synthetic manifolds, but on something in a slightly different direction. So let me start by discussing, let me start by giving the definition. Let me start by giving the definition of a substantive manifold, and then we'll discuss why this condition is interesting. So, a substantive manifold is a Ramanian manifold, F, endowed with a negative function F. And we ask that we require this F, this manifold to satisfy this equation, this inequality. So, we want that F times the rich tensor minus. times the rich tensor minus the action of f plus the laplacian of f times g is greater or equal to zero okay uh you may notice already uh this is a generalization of the emotional negative rich curvature and if you take f equal to one yeah you get the uh reach the great report you'll get um and the other feature that is uh interesting is that uh we can That we can encode in the definition the boundary. The boundary will always be the set where the function f vanishes. We will call the boundary rhizon, and we will always assume that it is a regular lever set of f and that it is a minimal closed divergence. Okay, so this is the set of manifolds we are interested in. And let's discuss a bit the motivation. Motivation. So, the main motivation comes from physics, and it's good that the previous talks they already introduced some of the things that are that will discuss slides. So, substatics manifolds appear naturally when discussing static space-times. So, let me remind the well, you already saw it in the previous talk. A space-time is a Lorentzian for manifold. is a Lorentzian for manifold. So the metric S signature plus plus plus minus. The minus direction corresponds to the time direction. And we want our space time to satisfy the Einstein field equation, the rich curvature of the metric gamma plus lambda minus one half scalar curvature gamma equal to t, where lambda is a constant. Where lambda is a constant, that is actually a constant, and t is the stress and influence, encoding the distribution of energy in mass, in matter in our spacetime. Okay, if one assumes that our spacetime is static, this means that the manifolds that our spacetime splits as a line cross a three-manifold n, and the metric splits as well as our product. Some worked products: a metric G, a minor metric G on the manifold M plus minus a component in the time direction that depends on F, which is function for that. And we want this function to be non-negative. And again, it is natural to require f to. Require f to vanish of the boundary of the manifold f. And the set where f vanishes is usually associated with the event horizons of a blank narrative. So what can we what why what questions one may ask concerning static space-times when one has to make some assumption on express energy tensor? On the stress-energy tensor, and one possibility is to fix a given stress-energy density. And there are plenty of choices. The most studied one is by far Baker case, the case in which the stress-energy tensor is just vanishing. And in this case, the Eisenkild equations under this assumption of staticity translate into this equation, sometimes called the static equation. Sometimes called the static equation. And this is by far the most static case. But I will not go into details of this one, but essentially we have many classifications, many strong characterizations of the solutions to these equations. This is not the only interesting case. One can study Einstein-Maxwell equations, for the case of magnetic field or the perfect fluids, scalar field. Or the perfect fluids, scatter fields, and so on. So there are many different stress-energy tensors that one may consider and that are interesting to study, and one may try to characterize solutions, static space-time with these special sensor features. But the direction that we want to pursue today is another one. So another possibility is to require the stress energy tensor to satisfy an energy condition. Satisfying energy condition. So we do not prescribe the dispensation density, but we require a natural physical assumption. The most natural one from the standard point of view is actually the dual energy condition. So in the previous talk, Svenir talked about the dominant energy condition, which is by far the energy condition that is most studied by one work. When one works with space-like slides, these space-times. But in the static setting, actually, the dual energy condition is perfectly natural and a bit weaker than the non-conditionation. And if you assume the new energy condition, essentially that the stress energy denser is non-negative in the nouns direction, then it is well known, known at least by recent words, that then the function f. Uh, the function f and the metric g, so when I don't when I write a reach here like this, the reach respectively metric g, so this is an inequality on the manifold mg. So the nice active equation translates to this inequality of x. And this is precisely the substantive equation. So substatic manifolds appear naturally studying Studying study space-times under a quite weak energy. So, this is the main motivation for studying it from a physical perspective. And now let me take a couple of slides to discuss some mathematic features of this substance. So, the first interesting properties is the first interesting properties that actually when one starts. Actually, when one studies non-negative reaching, one has in mind the one model which is RN, nuclear space or quants. In this case, for substantive manifolds, one instead has a quite large set of modern solutions. And this is kind of interesting. So, if one considers work at product solutions of that form where the F appears in the H. Where the f appears in the metric, the f over there is some static dimension. There are many choices of f that give some static solutions. For instance, I can take f to be equal to square root of 1 minus 2n r to the power 2n plus n, where n is the dimension of n. And takes us the base 9 signal from any manifold such that each density is literally n minus 9. With this choice, we get a substantive solution. But there are some examples that are well known in this class. If we take sigma to be the sphere and we take m to be greater than zero, then we get Greater than zero, then we get the Schwarzschild solution. We just take n equal to zero, then we can get so Schwarzschild's solution probably is familiar to many of you, but just remember, Schwarzschild's solution is the main example of static solution, a static bound solution, where the cosmological constant is zero, corresponds to the exterior region of a Of a liquid of mass, one can take something slightly more general and add another term of the form q square times r to the power 4 minus 2n. And again, this is substantive. And in particular, again, if we take sigma to be the sphere and we take the mass to be greater than the q, absolute minus q, then we get the. To then we get the resymost solution. Another well-known solution. This is not static vacuum, this is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equation. And it is, and it models are charged. If you want, these are the main model solutions that we will encounter for the rest of the talk. So, just for reference, let me give a very precise picture. A bit of a microphone. So, the Schmarshi solution, as well as the Reiser-Knoston solution, they have a horizon, boundary component, they have an infinity, that is asymptotically flat. For our intended purposes, asymptotically flat, we have already seen the definition. For our intensive purposes, we just need We just need the metric to go to the theta metric, CC operation, and we need f going to one and yeah. So this is our definition of a sympathetic L flag for today, for this talk. The Sparshill solution and the Reserve Northsome solution, in particular, are flat in this sense. Okay, and our setting, our results will work more in general. We don't need this specific end, but this is the reference model that is useful to keep in mind. This is the main reference model for what I okay. And finally, let me give another example with a different kind of end. If we take same f and we add this time r squared, this is another well-known solution. Well-known solution, if we take sigma to be the sphere again and positive, this is the support anti-december partial solution. This is models a black hole again, but with negative constant. And the end this time is not a symmetrically relative, it's formally compact. And that will force a little bit about conformally compact in the following. And finally, if m is equal to zero, then we have the hyperbolic space. So the hyperbolic space can be seen as a Phase can be seen as a substantive. Okay, this is just saying, yes. I mean, the anti-descenter partial solution is defined usually with sigma being a sphere. Sometimes it is defined as with sigma being an Einstein manifold, any Einstein manifold that realizes the equivalent. Because this is yes, that's the usual function. Yeah, so this, whenever this is true, then we are substantive. But the anti-synter course should be substantially. Okay, so we have plenty of other solutions. That's a nice feature of substantive manifolds. And we would want the GDP results of our theorems before we have this. The following to have these model solutions to characterize this value model solution. The second interesting feature concerns the connection with the Bakerian region. So one may ask, we already have a well-known notion of a well-known generalization of the notion of non-negative rich curvature, which is the notion of dimension conditions for tensor. So just remind. So just remind, just remind that. So if we have a manifold M G tilde, let's call it G tilde, we say that this manifold satisfies the curvature dimension zero n condition if there exists a function psi such that Ricci plus the H minus the P C squared over capital N minus L is greater than what has. Okay, this is for the C D C1 condition. It is It is even conditioned, it is very well studied, especially in the case where capital N is greater than 10. It's been studied quite extensively. And okay, so we already have a generalization of the rich curvature in our setting. So the natural question is: is there a connection between this definition and the Between this definition and the substantive definition, and the answer is yes, if we consider a substatic manifold, mg, with substatic potential f and we consider this conformal change with delta equal to g over m squared, and we relate to psi, find psi as minus m minus 1f, then fact g tilde with this psi satisfies the The CE01 condition. So there is a precise correspondence between the sympostatic condition, formal correspondence, synthetic condition, and CP0 mark. Okay, as far as we know, this precise correspondence was not in the literature. However, there were some insights. For instance, some words by For instance, some people worked by Shah that connected, they noticed that there was some connection between the CD01 condition and the substatic condition. And there were also many work in the substatic sector, but in the static button setting, YouTube shell virus, where they actually used this performance change. They call it the optical metric. Call it the optical metric. It is well used in space-times, but it was used in some sense. I mean, this correspondence is used in some sense, but it was never pointed out precisely, at least as far as we know. Okay. So, what's really nice is that in the I cannot close it. I'll leave it here. Okay. So, what's So, what's quite nice is that recently in the CP01 setting, there have been a lot of work getting the basis of the conformal geometry in this setting, the setting of CD01. So, it is very nice that we already have conformal geometry theory in the CD01 setting. And so, And so, what we did with Matthew Canon was starting from this knowledge, this V01 condition, what can we retrieve in the substatic setting by means of this conformal transformation? Okay. So, in other words, the right distance to use to conform my geometry is the distance with respect to delta. The C D 0 1 metric. C D 0 1 metric. So I will use the distance with respect to G tilde from a point X. Okay, but now the computations I make are all made in the substatic set. So there will be no tilde. So we'll see later. So we need two things. One is the G tilde distance that I call PRO, and the second is the reparameterized distance eta. So we need this other function here. It is a function. function here. It is a function that it is defined as being zero in the point x, we are taking the distance from. And we want the derivative of eta with a factor to be equal to f squared. Why this function will be clear in a moment. Let me just comment on this definition. First of all, eta is defined by a first product V D, and we know that then this eta is a fine smooth function. Find the smooth function outside the catalogus. On the catalocus, bad things can happen. For instance, a point in the catalogus, there can be more than one geodesic going there. And if you compute beta going through two different geodesics, you have no idea what you end up with. So you don't even have a continuity in the points in the catalogus. But outside of the catalogus, everything is good. And another observation is that theta can be thought. is that theta can be thought as being the distance with respect to this other metric, not g over m squared, but g times f squared. So if you take the metric g times f squared, then the distance along radial geodesics emanating from x is precisely. Okay, so in this sense, it's called the recruiterized distance. And it will be interesting, but Interesting, but it's quite hard to actually replace the eta that we use here with the distance with respect to expansion. It will be more geometric in some sense, but it's not straightforward. So we will use eta for our purposes. And what we can do, and this has already been done in the CT01 set, we are just translating this substatic setting. We can prove that the derivative with respect to raw, Derivative with respect to raw at this point here, where theta is the parameterized distance, and h is the mean curvature with respect to the parameter g. So, here there's the risk of doing some confusion, so let me remark again. Rho is the distance with respect to G tilde, H is the mean curvature of the level sets of the distance with respect to the metric G. Okay, so there's this interplay. So, there's this interplay between the two metrics that we need to take into account. But this is quite nice. We have a function that is non-decreasing and it is easily seen to be zero when we start at point x, distance zero. And so, essentially, we have the usual regatti argument that in our setting just says. It can also be written like this: the plush mode rho plus here. And again, I'm not putting a tilde here. So these are all computed with respect to the matrix G. The only thing that is respected is this one. So this quantity is less variable than n minus 1 of n. Yes? Sorry? Ah, why it is positive? Well, it comes from here as well, because it's easy to prove from here as well. It starts to be since this is greater, you find that this is greater than equal to zero. Than zero, and so in particular, f over h is greater or equal than the thing on the right, and the thing over on the right is positive, so f over h is positive. Just yeah, you get both it's easy to just draw, but But no, no, no. No, no, no, I don't start from zero, it increases and stays positive. So, I mean, if you write down it starts from zero, this is positive. The new respect to the outward derivation. Yes, yes, thank you. Okay. Okay, this is this we obtain almost this is a computation and we obtain directly this one. Can directly this one, okay. And this is not something that we did ourselves, this is something that was already done by Wiley in the CP01 setting. We are just translating it to substatic setting. Nothing particularly new here, but it's good, but it's a good place to start. This is the Laplacian comparison, this is the substatic set. And once we have a Laplacian comparison, we can perform comparison, you know. Okay, so what's the first thing that we want to do? Okay, another slide. Okay, another slide of preparation first. So let's discuss how horizons and ends behave under this conformal change, the one between C01 and substatic. If we have a horizon, so if we have a boundary, on the boundary f is equal to zero, and the metric g tilde is g over f squared, so the metric explodes at the boundary, and so it's easy to see that the boundary in the CD. See that the boundary in the C D 01 setting, so with the magnetic field, becomes an end. So the raw distance, the distance from a point inside the manifold goes to infinity as the approach. So the horizon, when we look at it in the conformal metric G tilde, is a fit. On the other hand, the function eta goes to a finite limit. Goes to a finite limit. Sorry, because eta was the was increasing as f squared, and f goes to zero. So you can compute that it goes to a finite limit. So this is the behavior of the Eurozones in the Kilda metric. What about the ends? Well, of course, on the ends, if we don't assume anything, then anything can happen. Okay, so we will focus on a couple of special kind of Special kind of things. The first one, and the main one for the main purposes of this lecture, of this understood, the main one is the F-complete X. Definition of F-complete was already given in the CD01 setting. They are just translating the definition with the substantive setting. It's very different. And that complete means that, first of all, we need the end to remove. Need the end to remain an end with respect to the metric gt. So we want the gt the length of any ray going towards this end to be c or other s to be which is not like possible. And the second property that we'll want is that the integral of f along this ray goes to plus infinity as well. Okay, and this is the reason we need this is to ensure that the function eta goes. is to ensure that the function eta goes to classify which will be crucial to apply the Laplace. So this is also the crucial difference between f completence and horizons. So for all does the same thing but for horizons eta goes to a finite number. Instead for completance it goes to plus this is very important. Yes. Yeah, yeah, it's actually everything would be nicer if you could just write down if we just say beta is the map, is the distance with the second, but unfortunately, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The main model to The main model to think about is the partial solution or in general asymptotically flat. Asymptotically flat manifolds, that definition, for sure are things, but complete ends. You have much more freedom than that, but asymptotically flat. A nice hypothesis of which you have all three that have complete display. Another case that I will discuss briefly that is also will discuss briefly that is also well studied is the conformally compact case this is for instance the case of the anti-dexiter for sheet solution that i mentioned before uh conformally compact means that rho does not go to infinity and so the end becomes a boundary and we require that the boundary is smooth enough okay so under the assumption of component compact the end becomes a sufficiently smooth boundary okay these are the two kinds of These are the two kinds of ends I will focus on, and I will mostly focus actually on the first one. But for the first result, I have to mention both of them, it's mostly interesting. The first result what we proved with Agnolo, but actually this is essential results already proved by Wiley. This is one setting. We are just translating it to the substantive setting. So this is the splitting theorem, the substantive setting. If we have two weapon grid ends, okay. We have two F concrete ends, then the manifold must split. It doesn't split like a product. No one tells us that f is a function of s. So this is not directly a product. It's a bit build, but it doesn't matter that much. The important thing is that it splits. So we have a good characterization of how the metrics are done and the topological characterization of these solutions. And another interesting observation that we can make in society setting. Make this accepting that makes not much sense in the accepting, but so we can make this splitting theorem even if a boundary is present. It's exactly because when we work with the metric, the boundary goes to infinity. So it's not in the way of true essence. So we can still apply to the splitting theorem, even when a boundary is not empty. So in particular, if the boundary is not empty and we have two F complete. And we have two at complete ends, then the boundary must split as well. But usually, I think I mentioned it, certainly brought it, but I think I mentioned it that we are interested in compact boundaries. So this would be non-compact, so we would like it. So if the boundary is not empty, there must be at most one complete empty. And a similar result, again, this was mostly done by Wiley with some tuning to be done here. But using standard arguments, one can also prove that if one has two conformally compact ends, then the manifold splits, but the splitting is incompatible with that going to infinity, so it cannot happen. It's a bit weird as an argument, but you can prove that. As an argument, but you can prove that there cannot be two conformally compact ends, nor there can be one conformally compact and one end-complete end. So essentially, there can be at most one end. If there are two, if we limit ourselves to these two kinds of ends, there can be at most one, or there are two, but there are two. Okay, the proof is nothing special once you have the Lafashan comparison, but The function comparison and just apply the standard sugar drama technique. To prove the second one, you need the argument by Casuer, but it's also very classical for the splitting of compound. Nothing really special here. The crucial point is that we are using the right kinds of ends and that we have the opposite ends. Okay, another comment on two is that this result for conformal compact ends was already pointed out by Pushel Seamon in the setting on button static methods. So this result extends unknown results by Michelle Seamon to all substatic solutions. And I should mention also that this proof also uses the optical method Also, use the optical method, tilde equal g over f squared, but in a different way. They use the new splitting theorem of the space-time using this object. So it's different proof, but probably standing from the same source, it's information of the other. Okay, the second result I want to talk about, and now I will focus on, this is this will be local, but from now on, we will not focus on. But from now on, we will not focus on more compact ends, we will focus on F-complete ends. Okay, but first, let me write down something like the Michel Grammar model machine, the subsetting. For this, we don't need an end. We just need the distance per point and see how it evolves, how this quantity evolves. So the standard. So, the standard problem of complicity is that in the negative reaching the area of the boundary divided by the sphere operator is a monotonically non-increasing function and the same force for volumes divided by the p. Okay, this is now my question. We had an analog of these results in this setting. So this A of T, the area function, is also increasing. Here, rho again is the distance from the point x, and eta is the reparameterized distance. And notice that if we are in the non-negative rich case, which means f equal to 1. case, which means f equal to one. When f equal to one, rho, eta are all equal to the standard distance, and this makes you the standard. And similarly, we have also a magnetic version of it, which is slightly more complicated, but again, if you take f equal to one, this is one, this is one, and you get precisely the homophonicity of the point. Uh, top layer one, okay. Uh, let me say a couple of words on how this is proven. Uh, so the proof actually is based on the fact that we can rewrite the Laplacian comparison as the divergence of a field, a vector field, being less important. So you take X would be F. X would be f to the beta to the power n minus 1 number. This vector field has no negative diversity. This is another way of writing the Laplace compensation. And then it's just an application of the diversity. Of course, one has to be very careful when there's complocus, and there's some work to be done, but can be linked from here that this is true. So you just apply the diversion's theorem, you get an integral on. An integral on two different level sets of row. And then you use that you know x, you replace x with here. And then you use that rho is actually the distance within terms of g means that tabla rho, the normal tabla rho is one over f, and u s is something that I have the monotonistic of the other function. And building on it, And building on it, you can also prove equalisticity for B. I will not I will skip this part. You can build that. Once one has the equivalentity of the area function, then it's just a matter of functions. Okay. Instead, what I want to talk about now, this will be important for follows, is to redo, remate what we have done, working with. Working with hyper surfaces instead of points. So now we look at the distance from an hyper surface and we consider hyper surfaces that are homologous to the boundary. So we have an upper surface, sigma, and we want it to be homologous. Want it to be homologous to the boundary. So that means that there is a component. So that means that there is a compact domain, omega. Okay? And this compact domain has a boundary. The boundary of the domain is the boundary of m plus the and we also want the mean curvature of sigma positive. And under these assumptions, we can essentially repeat the same construction before. We can define the reparameterized. We can define the reparameterized distance with the same ODE with a slightly different initial condition. So eta is not zero on sigma. It is equal to n minus one f over the curvature of sigma. Why this choice? Because this is the same computation that we did before for the evolution of this quantity. With this choice of initial condition for eta, this is zero for uh at the start at the starting point. Until you start working on this. Okay? And then, exactly as before, you get the Laplacian. Nothing different here, except for the fact that we have a different initial computation for it. Okay, and again, same computations, one can prove that the area functional behaves at the same polymer. I called it area functional. This made sense when we were at the distance from a point, but just. Just the contact that here it's not really an area that we are computing. This is the integral of one over eta to the power n plus one, and eta is this function. So what we are computing here is the mean curvature to the power n plus one. H should have to the power n plus one. At least at the beginning. Okay, so what we get when we apply the fact that it is non-increasing, we get that We get that the functional a completing zero is just this integral here. Okay? And that's greater or equal than the functional a for any subsequent value of t okay, in particular it's greater or equal than the limit at the case of functionality. Okay, and what we found is essentially a wind model. Okay, so the integral of h to the power. So the integral of h to the power n minus one greater or equal than some quantity. Okay, the only issue here is that we don't know the limit that we have is not something really geometric or intrinsic. It may depend on the choice of sigma. So we need to make an assumption of the end to guarantee us that that limit there does not change if we change sigma. The assumption that we have to make, assumption of uniformity of the n. Assumption of uniformity of the end. So we need to ask that whatever two hypersurfaces we take, the limit of their quotient is going to one at infinity uniformly. This means that beta does not vary widely if you change the initial adverse vectors. This is a technical assumption. Yeah, I will comment on it in a second. Let me mention it that if this is. Let me mention it that if this is true, then we can define, then this limit is well defined, it doesn't depend on sigma, and we call it the asymptotic load function. That is our well-known quantity in the regional negative case, and this is the realization in the substantive set. And this limit is actually equal to the limit of the functional v, it's just a dip down, essentially. And yeah, so we have here the DR, and this gives meaning. The ABR, and this gives meaning to power window inequality. Let me mention a couple of things on the uniform ends. So when this condition holds, the end is called uniform. And this condition is technical, but there are cases in which we know that it is true. For instance, if f goes to one at infinity, then the n is uniform. So for instance, asymptotic at 10 n is i uniform. Are uniform, and also there's another condition you can make of the norm of the gradient of the UK. It decreases, if it goes to zero fast enough with respect to the distance from that's also fine. Okay? And also as a final comment, particularly for the F, it's actually possible to compute the ratio, it's just one. As long as F is one, it's As long as I use one in the screen stuff. Okay. We don't think it's complicated, so you expect to be true quite in general. But what can happen is that, I don't know, if you have two hyper surfaces that are far away. Far away, and we have a point at infinity where the geodesic follows two very different paths, and on one path that f is much greater than the other side, then it doesn't so I expect that you can probably create something like that, but it's delayed. So, you need to have to web some big, large jumps at the PAD, but I guess it's hard to do. So, it's a good thing. So it's a good question. Can we find better properties, better cases, case rumor in general? I will point out that if we were able again, replace theta with the distance with respect to the other metric, then this is automatically satisfied. We will not need uniform maths because then it follows from the primary equivalent, essentially. So I guess that's the I guess that's the care would be the best way to uniformity to replace beta with the corresponding quantity with the distance with respect to this other matter. Yeah, it's completely. Okay. So again, with all that said, so what we have proved using the modulicity of the area function is the Waymore inequality. So integral of h over x to the power n minus one is greater or equal than yesterday from Peggy's answer. Yes, the prolongation answer for any sigma that has strictly positive curvature, and it is homologous to the market. Furthermore, if the quality goes, then the metric splits. Again, there are a lot of synthetic manifolds. So there are also a lot of synthetic manifolds that satisfy a quality property. So not just multiple. See, so not just work with product. No one tells us that f or eta are functions of r. This is not a workman product sweet thing. Okay, it's more complicated than that. There are plenty of solutions that are not working product and that satisfy your quality. There are a lot of sets up. Okay, I'll mention that this has already been proven in the negative rich correction setting by Gossin Mazieri, and there's also a proof. Macieri, and there's also approved based on instances and the Ricardi, which is more in line with the one. I have to discuss this if anything important. So why were we interested in the Why were we interested in the Wilmore inequality? Because there is an approach by Filignono Masseri to prove that magnetic inequality by means of the Wilmore. And so that's what we talked about, the last part. So in the approach of Sugar Masseri, they used the window inequality on the isolated sets, and they exploited the fact. And they exploited the fact that they were working negative sets had the constant curvature, and so the William equality becomes much nicer. And you can use this fact to prove the isothermal equality. Okay? So here, the thing that we have that is constant, that the thing that we have in the remote equality is not H, but. We are the quality is not h, but h over f. Okay? So we will want h over f to be constant. We want to find specimen sets for which h over f is constant. Okay? And the right choice turned out to be to consider the influence of the area among the surfaces that are almost the boundary with fixed, not volume, but with fixed F-bolt. F volume. So we don't take the integral of one, we take the integral of f. Okay, so with this weighted volume and with the standard area, what we have is that the experimental sets should have H variety. That's what's important to prove through inequality basically. So that's why we make this choice. Okay, with this understood, we can state the results and then I will give some results and proof. So we need some technical assumption. We need that the dimension is less than seven. We need at the end this uniform and that's complete so that the remote negative applies. So that the remote quality applies, and we need an exhaustion of multi-ninemizing inverse surfaces. This is due to the way that any inverse surface, the sigma molecules in the boundary, must satisfy this. So we have an inequality that tells us that the area of sigma is greater than the area of the bound. Greater than the area of the boundary, and we can quantify how much greater we determine the right. This is substantial inequality, calling for any sigma modulus boundary. And I should mention that in this case, we do have a strongly cheap result, coefficient in the isolated equality. For the metric inequality, if you have equality, then the metric this time is really a word of and sigma is a perception. Okay, and again, this is not the result is already negative rich without boundary, usually, instead of here. Again, the approach that we are using is the one by Greg Mazieri: the negative reach. Macieri the negative case, but there are other known approaches that work more generally. For instance, Brenda doesn't dimension, and also the same many dimensions. Okay, so let me give some idea on how to prove this theorem. So So, what is the idea? Okay, roughly speaking, this is an heuristic, so let's not care about the technical details. But essentially, what we do is, okay, let's assume that we have our hyper surface sigma b that is the iceberg. We have volume, that's what a fixed volume. Okay, then, as I said, one thing. Then, as I said, quantity check that H must be constant, and then the Wimbledon equality that we have just proven gives this inequality and bring H outside the integral, and you get the bound on the outsumption. And then, particularly, if one computes the derivative of the IFPerimetric profile, which is the one that gives for. Which is the one that gives for any volume B, it gives the corresponding area of the isolated metric of that volume. Assuming again that's moves, that's why. At the moment, we are not, we are just everything is fine. I think it's fine. Then I hope. Good. Okay, so again, sorry, I was here. So, again, if everything is good, everything works well. Then you can compute the derivative of the ispirimatic profile, and one can compute quite easily using the fact that the superimmatic gap constant h of r f, one can compute quite easily that this derivative is exactly h of r f. And then one can use the remote inequality. The remote inequality determines that h over f is less or equal, greater or equal than this quantity here, where the area of sigma t is yes with the violent area of sigma v is less than equal to 5. So, this is just the minimum, the previous minimum. Okay, so here essentially we have a transaction. Have essentially we have a differential equation, differential inequality, okay, and you can solve it using the fact that you know the limit when B goes to zero, you have the boundary, so the i is half line, and then you take the limit rate you get our experiment. So, everything was worked well, uh, assuming that uh there are nothing happens that they have this metrics, that Let me mention what can go wrong. So how do we solve some of these issues? So for instance, the existence of light-perimetrics, what we use is the method of Kleiner that uses the existence of this output minimizing exception. That's why we had to assume that all this is. Assume all this is so what we do is that since we have this source theorem, we can take one of these large spaces and work only inside this box. And then since we are in a compact set, then it is known that the specific problem has a solution for each one of the and then essentially we We can run the argument. What can go wrong? The issue metric set of defined for QP can either touch our boundary of the large hole that we have taken, or it can touch the boundary, can touch the URI, the boundary part. So one can check that it cannot touch the It cannot touch the horizon. Let's check that. One can prove that this cannot happen. And this is essentially a consequence of the fact that H over F is positive for our resident. And what about if it touches the larger resources that we've taken? Then again, that can happen. That can happen, okay, but we can still run the argument. H over F will still be constant when we do not touch this large surface, okay? And when we do touch this large empty surface, we can check any way that H over F is greater or equal than H over F on slash boundary. Okay. And also, okay, so when As long as everything is positive, there's no problem. And we can check that H cannot be zero or negative. And this is another delicate argument, but we can prove that there cannot be any minimal ever surfaces homologous to the boundary side of it. And this is a combination of our Riccati evolution, the curvature, because the Because our evolution of the mean curvature essentially gives us a variation of minimal effect surfaces starting from that one. On the other hand, our alpha minimizing surfaces we can take the microbes flow and produce affiliation of the incomplex surfaces. And these two things are incompatible in some sense. So we can prove that Niemann Pressurfaces are not allowed. And we can also show that H over F cannot be negative because if H over F is negative, then the output in MySQL will be minimal, and this is kind of standard, but it's given for instance Maxieri. And if it's minimal, again, for the point, for the previous point, this can happen. So essentially, we always have the issue metric, they always have both. They always have positive curvature, so we can apply the wheelbarrow and the argument. That's the main idea. Let me mention some possible direction from here. First of all, it would be nice if it's possible to remove our technical assumptions. So, remove the existence of Lexosium bottom surface. This can be done, for instance, if we can do the existence. The existence of the permission flow in the specific setting, then this should produce us the exhaustion that we need. Another question is, can we go beyond the M7, so higher dimension? Let me mention that what's been done in the non-smooth setting and my Brendan Speaker, these other groups. These other proofs of the experimental inequality, they don't need this dimensional restriction. So, perhaps that's going to do our results using these other approaches. One can wonder if the reversion comparison can be applied to other results in performance geometry, so we have some estimates or eigen or some check theorem for the eigenvalue of the reversion. Yes. Yes. Expect that many results of some of the rest of the block should work in this as well. For instance, one interesting one should be constant equality. Again, one way maybe you'll be able to find the appropriate flow in the setting. And finally, wonder what happens to the home case. Another possible direction is to slightly generalize the specific control. is to slightly generalize the specific condition. So instead of greater equivalent zero, greater equivalent minus mu g, with the constant mu. Equality case, in this case, they are called the p-static solutions. They are quite studied, they are connected with a famous conjecture, so this might be another direction that might be as well as a generalization of rich literary bottom across which we find as I mentioned. I think fine guys, as I mentioned, it would be nice if we could replace eta by the square distance. Okay, I think I said I have something mentioned.
