Really bringing together spatial analysis across different spatial molecular technologies that's really cutting edge for the field. He's a professor at Harvard Medical School and then Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. And we're absolutely thrilled to have him here. So thank you, GC. Thank you, Elena, for the kind introduction. And I first of all like to thank the co-organizers for The co-organizers for a fantastic job for putting together this excellent schedule. Despite this challenge time, I think we'll still have a lot of interesting signs to discuss. Looking forward to that. So I will begin with talking a little bit about my personal feel about the integration. And this comes from a little bit two angles. So, first of all, A little bit of two angles. So, first of all, we all recognize that a cell has multiple components and they are just getting more and more. So, one of the things that we recognize is that there's a lot of interconnections between these modalities. And this goes beyond the traditional DNA, RNA, the protein, the central dogma, but more so in the connections between these other. Other with perhaps less well-known modalities, such as the epigenetics, such as the metabolum, and the splicing, and so on. So, for example, these things are very interconnected. For example, the epigenetics can have a big role in regulating the RNA transcription, or the splicing can also Can also mediate the translation. So now that we have all these different modalities in the cell, it begins to become a difficult task to think about as a system. So how do we represent all the information together as integrated cell states? So also in this individual cell, we say we have So we say we have this model make information, but usually for each of these measurements, we can only measure one or few of these components. So then this really becomes a missing problem. So then one of the interesting tasks that many people face is that can we just use computational tools to infer some of the modalities that's unmeasured, but the ones that are measured? But the ones that are measured. So, mathematics modeling plays a key role in understanding both of these challenges, right? So, first of all, the conceptual level, so we have all these very established statistical or computational tools, such as the causal inference, vector analysis, networks, multi-scale dynamical systems, and so on. So, they were very well. So they were very well equipped to apply to this moleomics problem and to integrate the system more than the sum of the individual components. On the more practical side, we also have a lot of these tools that are available that allow us to systematically build the To systematically build the prediction models from the knowns to unknowns and systematically evaluate this. So, today, let me just focus on one particular aspect of this integration, which is the spatial information. So, in this traditional, now when I say traditional, it's still only six or seven years old, but it feels like a long time already. But most of the people. And most of the people in this field work on this single cell RASIC technologies. And what it does is that it's great for identifying the cell types and cell states inside the systems. But in the meantime, it loses the spatial information because the cells have to be isolated from the tissue. In the meantime, the more recently, the spatial transit. The spatial transatomics field is booming, and oftentimes what it involves is that it involves some sort of barcode and also involves imaging. So then it's kind of the different data than the sequencing data that we are familiar with. But what it provides is the actual spatial information in addition to the cell types and cell states. I can use one example to demonstrate that why such Example to demonstrate that why such spatial information is absolutely critical. So, for example, this brain, we know that the brain is perhaps the most complex system in any animal. So, the brain has a very complicated but organized structures. So, we know that each of the functions of the brain is often carried out by a specific region. A specific region and not by the cells everywhere. And we still don't know what the exact reasons underlying that, but we do know that the spatial information play a critical role. For example, based on the work from the Stanley Innocence Labs and the LM Brain Institute's lab and many others, now we know that the distribution of the cell types have a very distinct Of the cell types that have a very distinguished spatial organization patterns. We also know that these cells, they don't reside in isolation, but there's very close interactions, especially synapses between these neurons that mediate these functions of the sprain. So, and this is actually And this is actually just the example, and there are many examples for other systems that say the spatial information is important. So, the experimental approaches for mapping the spatial transatomics can be largely divided into three different kinds of types. And the first type is called this in-situ hybridization. What it does is that you design this fluorescence. A fluorescence of probes that are targeting specific genes. So each of the genes is represented in different colors. So if you just do it in the very simplistic way, then the number of the genes that you can detect is limited by the number of the colors. But there are a number of approaches, such as the sig fish, such as the myrrhfish, and And others, dartfish, and so on. So, what that does is that it can use this trick of this multiple hybridization to combine the signals from the different imaging together to, as a combinatorial barcode, as shown over here, to recapitulate. Recapitulate the expression. And in this way, we can often get to hundreds of the genes, no problem. And the most recent advances can give you even transendomic-wide information. The second kind of approach is the spatial barcoding, followed by the sequencing. And the typical, the well-known examples are the 10-nex VCM and also the And also the slide-seq. So, what it does is that it's put the tissue on the slide, and then you use this spatial barcode by using these microarray or these B's. And then once the barcode is incorporated into this RNA, then you can do this sequencing using the traditional sequencing methods, and that will preserve the. Methods and that will preserve the information. And the third kind of method is the in-situ sequencing. So, what it does is that the sequencing is done at the in-situ before the sequencing, these are get amplified. For example, by this padlock probes, and then you use these fluorescent Nucleotides to synthesize one nucleotide at a time. And in the end, the sequencing information can be recapitulated by these kind of images such as that. So the kind of the common type of analysis for this type of data are kind of like this. So the The most typical approach is just say what are the cell types and where are they distributed in space. So then in addition to that, there are a number of the spatial transotomic specific kind of analysis, such as now we have the spatial patterns of individual genes. Of individual genes and also the combinatorial patterns, such as the spatial clasping. And you can also think about the spatial temporal trajectory. You can also think about the cell-cell interactions because now we know which cells are close together. So, there are a number of the challenges for analyzing this kind of data. So, first, on the technological side, On the technological side, we know that the gene coverage is often limited. So for the MRFI and sickfish data, we often have about hundreds of the genes far from genome Y. For some of the sequencing-based technologies, such as the VCM and SLISIQ, so then the challenge. Then the challenge is that we have, although we have the genome-wide information, but the spatial resolution is usually low. So it's maybe like five to ten cells per spot rather than single cell resolution. Most of the technology so far can only generate the 2D data, and it is still challenging to recapitulate these 3D tissue structures. And a kind of unexplored unexplored area is that the imaging associated technical biases is not as well studied as the sequencing associated biases. So on this computational side, there are lots of the challenges. I'm only listing a few. So first of all, now So, first of all, now for this imaging type of approaches, for example, so each of this transcript must be allocated to the individual cells. So, for that end, we need to delineate these cell boundaries very accurately, something we call this cell segmentations. There's a lot of studies on this field, but the problem is still far from resolved. So, also, even you know these locations of individual cells, it's still not Cells, it's still not straightforward to build this proximity network for things like the cell-cell interactions. The reason being that, first of all, oftentimes the morphology information you get from imaging is limited. And secondly, even if you can recapitulate all the morphology, the kind of shape of the cells, such as the neurons, can be pretty. Such as the neurons can be pretty complicated. And how to infer the proximity information from that is not obvious. So we are familiar with the clustering cells based on the gene expression patterns. We are not very familiar with how to classify the spatial patterns, both at the cellular level and the sub-cellular level. And we are not familiar with the high. Familiar with how to study the cell-cell interactions by taking account of this spatial information. And finally, the behavior of the cells can be dictated by this inner work of the gene regular networks, but also an important input is the extra signals from the environment. And how to dissect these components is still Components is still not well studied. So, in this case, I'm going to focus on this sick fish or cortex study that Elena introduced in the beginning and as also part of this hexathon data set. So, this data comes from Long Kai's lab and is generated by his student Xu Sha. Student Xu Sha. So, this is a, we're looking at a one millimeter area inside this mouse visual vortex. And as I said, so the spatial transatomic data is obtained by using the sick fish technologies kind of recapitulated on the top. So, this is showing this image of the field. So, we are looking at from the So we are looking at from the layer from outside to the inside, and each of the dots represents an individual transcript. And if you zoom in these areas, we can highlight these individual transcripts further. And you can see that each of the genes is actually represented by combinations of the four colors. And that is why you can get hundreds of genes rather than just four or five genes. Four or five genes. And in total, we have 125 genes and 15,000, nearly 16,000 cells. So, with this data, the kind of the first challenge we're facing is that how do we identify the cell types, right? So, as I said, the main challenge is that the number of the genes is kind of limited. If you just use the unsupervised clustering, then you probably would not go very far. not go very far in identifying the cell types. So this is what motivated us to further integrate this external single cell RNA-seq data. In this case, it's generated by the TASIC from the Alan Brain Institute. So the kind of the approach we are doing is this. So first we take the genes that are common between The genes that are common between Sig fish and the single-cell zig data. So we have 130 genes, 13 genes in common. And using these genes, we take advantage of the cell type label in the single cell RNA-seq data, and we build a supportive action-infrared gene model. And we found that in this case, only with 4A, three genes. Uh, 43 genes, so we can get about 90 percent of the accuracy. So, with that, using that model, then we can then test this on this, apply that to this sig fish data, and then we can assign this cell type labels to this sig fish data. So, this is just to show that how it works. It works. So, most of the cell types that we find, the major cell types, we have about 90% of the accuracy or more. And if we compare this derived the SIGFISH signature compared to the original single-cell R-SIG signature, then we got a pretty good agreement between the two. Agreement between the two, and this is the spatial pattern of the cell types inside this tissue. So, the second challenge that we're facing is that how do we identify the spatial patterns? And we have basically one image per gene. So, then if we have about in this case, we have over 100 images to look at, and it's Look at, and it's a little bit difficult to detect these spatial patterns by looking at individual images. So, this is why we derived this hidden Markov random field model. So, Chen Zhu was the one who led this study. So, the basic idea is that we do the spatial clustering by combining both the gene expression patterns. Designing both the gene expression patterns as well as the spatial localization. So, for example, over here, where you have the neighboring cells, they have similar gene expression patterns, then this region collectively will be assigned to a single domain. So, just to clarify, this method will work only for the spatial Only for the spatially coherent genes. There's these genes, on the other hand, they are highly specific to individual cell types that should be excluded before we do this analysis. So when we apply this to single sick fish data, so the results look quite similar to this anatomic structure. So you can see this layer one to six, and over here as well. well so uh this pattern obviously looks very different than these cell types then uh we try to understand uh what when the places they are different is it uh uh true or or is uh some sort of technical artifact so one thing that we kind of uh happy to see is that uh the uh spatial uh domain information do capture the variations that are not obvious in the cell type. That are not obvious in the cell type. For example, in this group of the cells that are assigned to the same cell type over here, there are clear differences visually by looking at this morphology. You can see that they differ between these domains. So, suggesting that this domain information does capture biologically relevant variations. So, therefore, these two things. Therefore, these two things are the cell type and domain information, a complementary information. And we can combine these together, try to understand this within cell time variation that is associated with the spatial patterns. So to that end, we focus on one group of the cells called the glimptergic cells, which compose about 50% inside this visual cortex. And by comparing the gene expression pattern, By comparing the gene expression patterns across the different domains, we identify these distinct signatures that are associated with each of these domains. And then when we use these signatures to reanalyze the single-cell RNA-seq data, then we find these distinct clusters that resemble these kind of the spatial domains. For example, we can see that. For example, you can see that these O2 domain-specific signatures is only expressed in this set of the cells and pretty much nowhere else, suggesting that these cells can be unambiguously assigned to this domain O2. So, this is kind of the way to use the spatial information back to annotate these. Annotate this RA-seq data. So just kind of summarize this part by explaining a little bit of the data sets hosted in the hexathon. So the TASIC, the training says, anything that has to do says the TASIC, that means the single cell RA-SIG data. So this is the top is the single cell. The top is the single cell RNA sick data, and the cortex, the testing data, that's the cell metric, the cell by G matrix for the sigphage data. The sigphage labels data that contains this cell type annotation from our RSVF prediction, as well as the domain information predicted from the HRMF. Annotic data label. TASIC data labels are the cell type labels annotated by the TC group, as well as some location information that's corresponding to where the cells are physically dissected from. And then there's this coordinate data that is for the sig fish. And then this is the last one. The last one is corresponding to these genes that we find are spatially associated. And these are the source of these original data sets. So let me see. In the rest of the time, so let me talk a little bit about the Geoto. So this is a new work that's led by Led by Ruben Dries and Chen Zhu in our lab. And what this is, is an end-to-end and generally applicable toolboxes for the spatial transatomics data analysis as well as the visualization. And when we did this work, I was talking about, we realized that as a field, we still lack this. Still like these kind of these toolboxes for analyzing this kind of the data. So it would be nice to have a comprehensive pipeline to address this challenge. So to make this as generally applicable as possible, so we just requested this simple input with the With the cell coordinates as well as this gene-by-cell expression matrix. And from that on, then we can do a series of the functionalities. So mostly they can be divided into three groups. One is the cell type identification, and the second class is the spatial pattern detection. And the third group. And the third group belongs to this cell-cell interaction analysis. And to further help the researchers to explore the data, we built an interactive visualization to call Joto Veyor. And this is the website of our two boxes. And these are the two development websites that give you the more up-to-date information. Information. So we have tested the geotone for a number of these technologies. Actually, some of these technologies are actually in this multiplex proteomics and not just limited to these spatial transiomics. So these technologies, they vary greatly in terms of the scales as well as the depth. The death as well. So, all of these examples are already deposited in the Geoto website. So, in each of the data sets, we give the specific instructions how to reproduce the data analysis that we did. Let me just show this example, the SIGFISH Plus, and to demonstrate a little bit. To demonstrate a little bit the capacities, the capabilities. So I talk about this clustering already, but I mean, actually, I don't need to repeat over here. So the things that are more interesting from the spatial point of view, I think, is that the spatial patterns. So the one thing The one thing it works is to find these spatial coherent genes. So, roughly speaking, what it means is that are there any genes that expression pattern has organized spatial patterns and not just randomly? For example, this genes is highly expressed in the top regions, but not at the bottom. So, we have a number of the tools both published and developed by our And developed by ourselves to identify the spatial patterns. So, we are showing the results by these methods we developed called the BINSPACT. This is led by Ruben Drace. So, in this sigphage plus data, we have 900 cells. This is for each of the cells, we have 10,000 genes. And these are the And these are the kind of the layers inside the cortex. And you can see that these genes have pretty distinct spatial layer patterns. So we also do this hidden marker model to identify domains, which are not repeat over here. But one thing that I thought that might be interesting to and kind of unique here is to talk about this. is to talk about this spatial cell cell interactions. So in this case, we know which cells they are next to each other. And we can use that information to say that are there any genes whose expression levels is sensitive to which cell types is running. So for example, if we look at this endothelial cell, We look at it as endothelial cells. In this case, it can be next to either estrocytes of the layer 4 neurons or layer 6 neurons. And we want to compare these different settings to say adequate genes with expression levels changes significantly. So to that end, we computed a z-scores based on these permutation tests. Test. So, first of all, we see that these genes that are endothelial markers, they actually have pretty much low Z scores, which is what you expect because these are the marker genes that should be expressed for every single cell. But there's more interestingly, there's these subset of the cells whose expression level is strongly dependent on what's neighboring those cells. Those cells, and those perhaps maybe reflect some sort of cell-cell interactions. So, we in addition, we can also think about the cell-cell interactions in a more symmetric way. So, we can imagine that one of the cells, they provide this ligand and the other cells provide this receptor. Provide these receptors. And these sort of ligand-receptor interactions is very common in the cell signaling, such as development and in the cancer. So, but in this case, a little bit similar to that, but we expand that to integrate both the ligand and the receptor information. We can define a score jointly. And again, we compare with the random patterns, and then we use. Rather patterns, and then we use these differences to identify those are things that can interact compared to others. So, in this data set, we identified a lot of these interactions. The ones that are red, that represent those are enhanced by the cell type, cell type interactions. And the ones that are blue represent those are. So, represent those are the antagonistic interactions, and the size of this circles represents these p-values. So we also have some functionalities that deal with the data that do not have the single cell resolution. This is just the beginning. There's a lot. Is just the beginning, there's a lot of work to do in the future. I'm just giving you one example here that for the 10x genomics, the VCM data, for example. So each of this spots does not contain just one single cell. It's actually 55 microns in diameter. So typically it contains about like five, ten cells. And then in that case, it will be kind of challenging to discuss. It will be kind of challenging to discuss the cell type of the specific spot. So then the question is: can we somehow estimate the distribution of the cell types rather than just assign each spot as a unique cell type? So to that end, we integrated the single cell RSC. The single cell RS-seq data together. And we use these gene signatures identified from the single-cell RS-seq data as a query to calculate this enrichment score using a number of the algorithms. Some of them require the whole single CRA-seq matrix, and some of them just require a list of the signature genes. Signature genes. And we compute a number of the statistical tests to calculate the enrichment score. So when we apply this approach to this VCM mouse brain data, we are happy to see that the enrichment scores we predicted are quite in line with these anatomic structures indicated below. Indicated above, sorry. Whereas the null Whereas the known cell type marker genes, they actually have a poor resolution compared to the enrichment score that we calculated. As I said, there is still a lot of work to do in this domain of the data that do not have a single cell resolution, and we are actively developing new methods in that area. So, finally, let me just explain a little bit. Explain a little bit about this data visualization toolbox in the Geoto. So, basically, this is a web-based application. And we can load the data as well as the annotations from the JAWDA analyzer. We can also save the data from the viewer back to this JAW analyzer to do the iterative analysis. Analysis. So, some of these interesting features that we have these kind of buttons on the left that allow you to interactively explore the data. And when you do that, both of the images can be upgraded, can be updated simultaneously. I should say that this particular slide shows this 10x VCM from the mouse brain. On the left is the physical space. Physical space and the right is the UMAP in the expression space. In addition to that, you can also overlay this additional information from the imaging. So for example, these staining images that can tell you how many cells are there in this individual spot. So a nice application of this viewer is that we can simultaneously display Display the annotations from a multiple analysis. In this case, it can be spatial domains as well as the cell types. And you can select the cells of interest to compare them more closely better. And also additional features is that you can look at the transcripts at a sub-cell level. level. So and you can also compare these co-localized display selected genes to test if they are spatially co-localized and so on. So that's it. So I just want to thank the people who have contributed to this work. This is a tremendous effort involved many people in the lab. I mentioned Ruben and Chen who And Chen, who led this development of JOTO. And Chen also, they both are involved in this previous analysis of the siegfish data in this used in this hackathon. This is a very nice collaboration with the Long Kaiser Lab in the Caltech, and our work is funded by the NIH, HAN Lab, and Human Cell Atlas. So I will end here, and I'm happy to take any questions. Happy to take any questions. Thank you, JC. So I think Luciana is going to organize the questions. Yep. Hi, everyone. So if you have any questions, feel free to post here on the chat. So we can start with a question while people Start with a question while people are preparing their own. So, GC, thank you for the nice talk. Is Kyoto extendable for custom spatial analysis? Like, I mean, if someone comes with a new spatial approach, can they use Gyoto? Is it custom? Can we apply Gyoto to our data to our approach? Yeah, definitely. So, as I said, the only input that we need. Input that we need is the cell by gene expression matrix and also the localization, the coordinates of the cells. So the detailed analysis could need to be adapted, I guess, depending on the exact situations. But many of this common tasks can be done without any modifications. Okay, oh great, that's great. Okay, oh great, that's great. Thank you. Yep, thank you. We have one question here. So, which software are you using for the web app and interactive visualizations? So, in the web app, we used Java to develop these web app. There's a lot of these new tools. Tools. What is it? The tree. Sorry, I'm not familiar with this. Some of the packages. I don't know if Chen developed that, but I'd be happy to send more details later. It's also explained in this bio archive that we posted just a month ago. A month ago. Yeah, so the next one is when you have like sick fish or more fish data, can you use inferred cell morphology as an additional feature for cell clustering? So that's a very interesting idea. Right now, we know yet. We just use the gene expression. So we are exploring. We are exploring the connections between the morphology and the gene expressions. We realize that they are, a lot of information can be predicted from the morphology, such as the cell type information. I mean, a lot of times can be predicted. But so far, we have not integrated these together to define the cell type. But that's a very interesting idea. The cell type, but that's a very interesting idea. And, like, just as an addition to that, have you tried, or is it possible to use Guilloto to overlay single-cell protein expression with the gene expression? You mean the same cell? Yeah, if I have like two slides, for example, one from Codex and one from Seekfish, can I integrate both data? So, I guess in that case, the things will be more complicated, right? Because then the codex and the sig fish will be measured in the different cells, if I understand correctly. So I was thinking if you use serial sections. You mean like from a similar samples, but not the same cells, right? Yeah. Right, so yeah, so we are talking about a match the samples, but not exactly the same cells. But not exactly the same cells. So I think that's, I mean, a lot of other groups have done this, so we have not done it ourselves, right? So I think it will be interesting and it's feasible to combine these informations together on the population level, right? To say, okay, how many distinct subpopulations are there? It will be, in my mind, Be in my mind, maybe other people would disagree to say inside an individual cell, what's the relationship between this proteomic information and the RRA expression variation. In my mind, that would be kind of difficult, but maybe other people may have different opinions. Okay, thank you. So, next one. So, next one. So, are cells localized by X, Y, like central points, or by polygons to when to allow cell size or shape to be assessed? I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question. So, are the cells localized by an XY point or by polygons? Polygons. Yeah, I don't know if 181. I don't know if Aiden wants to ask herself the question. Hi, GC. Here's my question. When you're doing the spatial part of the analysis, you have the polygon, so the kind of the shape, the line coordinates basically of the physical shape and size and everything like that of the cells. I see. That of the cells. I see. Or are you just using the centroid or the xy position? Oh, I see, I see. Positionally just the matrix of xy coordinates, or have you got the actual polygon? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, I see, I see, I see, yeah. Thanks. Thanks for the explanation. I think ideally you want to use the polygon information, right? Because that will be more accurately. There are a number of things that are we didn't do that. We just used x, y coordinates. A is that for A is that for to do that, which you just said, the polygon, the shape has to be known very accurately. That's a challenge. So, and also, even if you can do that, right, so some of the cells may have a very complicated morphology, maybe not as simple as a regular polygon. Like, you may have this very long, you know, the dendrites in the side. How do you take that in front? How do you take that into account to assign these networks? I think that's kind of a challenge that the community will face. So probably going to be more research in the future. That answers your questions. So one more question here. So does the current resolutions of the spatial data allow cell cells? Allow cell-cell interaction analysis, like such as the same cell type, but express different genes when they are close to different cell types? So to a certain degree, yes, and it's definitely more so than the single-cell RAC, right? So we have to put things into perspective. So if you just like the ideas of questions before, right? If you just simplify the The cell location as XY, you know, the coordinates, right? You can already identify the cells that are close versus that are far away. There's a caveat to that, but this is already useful to predict the cell-cell interactions. And we have some examples already showing that it works. So, this is a published Published in this nature paper we published last year on the sinkfish plus, and also in this bio archive in the geoto as well. But it's not perfect. I have to say that it's not perfect, especially when the cells have a very complicated morphology, then to identify the cells that truly interact from those that are just close is not a trivial problem. Close is not a trivial question. Is there a way that you can check the quality of the predictions of the HMRF model, like if they are relevant, if they are biologically relevant? So yeah, so the way that we do that is we compare with known biological knowledge, right? So Knowledge, right? So, for example, in this case, we compare with the anatomic structure in this Alan Brain Institute, right? So, to see if to what extent there is agreement. We also can look at the gene signatures that are specific to these domains and to say that if to what extent these genes are functionally relevant, I mean, to those who specify. Relevant, I mean, to those specific domains. It's just like all kind of the real data analysis, right? There's no ground truth for you to give a p-value or like the error rate and so on. So we have to rely on the biological knowledge to interpret. How would you show the different units of measurements when you integrate single cell RNA sequencing and sig fish, for example? And sig fish, for example, different resolution, yeah. Uh, you mean the number of the genes? Uh, I guess so. I don't know if the person who made a question wants to clarify. Uh, this is Prativa. Thank you for the great talk. Um, my question is about if we have different units of measurements for gene expression. Genites of measurements for gene expression in single-cell RNA-seq and sequence. I see. So the units, okay, so it can be okay. So the bottom line, they're measuring the same thing, right? So the RA seq can measure the UMI, which is the count of the transcript, whereas the sigphage is also measuring the number of the transcript. Measure the number of the transcripts. Each dot is a transcript. So fundamentally, they are comparable. Now, but having said that, there are these technical platform specific. So that needs to be taken into account when you do the comparison. For example, when you do the single-cell RNA-C. The single-cell RNA-seq, the ones that you detect are mostly the highly abundant genes, right? Because the ones that are expressed the lower part, they were just squashed. Whereas the C-fish does not have this problem. But the sick fish has its own, like, you know, the technical variations related to the imaging. So, and so that's, I'm not saying that you should just directly compare. That you should just directly compare these counts by counts. You do need to do some sort of normalizations and the batch effect correction and so on. But the main reason is like you have the two technologies fundamentally that introduce a bias rather than just that conceptually there's fundamental differences in the units, I would say. Now we have a question from Sheila. Now we have a question from Sheila Gazafar. So she wonders if, for intracellular mRNA analysis, how biologically relevant is the position of the mRNAs and where the proteins are expressed? So that's a really interesting question. I think this is the underexplored territory. So the short is that very little is known about that. That's right, so but we see some kind of publications that talk about the collocalization of the mRNA and the protein that actually are translated by these RNA. So there seems to be like a correlation between the two. To what extent this is true and biological meaningful, that remains to be seen. Meaningful that remains to be seen. Thank you. So, next question from Christine Wells. So, in addition to losing spatial information, tissue dissociation also loses cell sensitive to the dissociation method. So, depending on the dissociation method we use. So, can you point to cells seen in one method and not the other? And how does this would impact cell? And how does this impact cell classification methods? That's very interesting. We haven't thought about that. Right. So I would guess by comparing these two technologies, they will probably tell you which genes are likely to be affected by this dissociation. Dissociation. And then, how do you use that information to do the cell classifications? I don't know. I mean, maybe if I would start from the beginning, I'll probably just remove those genes that are highly technically dependent. Other than that, I don't have any good idea at this point. But that's a really interesting question. Yeah, I think this was the last one. Not sure. This was the last one. Not sure if people still have more questions. We still have a couple of minutes. Well, so I think that's all the questions so far. Okay, great. Thank you very much for the input. Yes, thank you very much, GC. It was a great talk, and we had a lot of questions. Just to remind you that we have a brainstorming session. You that we have a brainstorming session with GC at 9 a.m. band time. I have no idea what will be in your own city and country, but feel free to join. Feel free to interact also on the Slack. There's a special theme channel for the spatial data. And let's thank again GC for a great talk. We have a break of about 37 minutes. 37 minutes, and so for the next speakers, feel free to use that room or any other breakout room to test your slides and everything and make sure everything is okay. And so we see you in a little bit. And thank you again. And if the speakers have any questions, they can post it on the contributed presenters Slack channel as well.
