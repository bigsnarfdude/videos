Okay, so thank you very much for a good introduction and also to the other organizers for the opportunity to give a talk. So today I would like to report about the joint work with Aaron Braille, Alex Perley and Charlé Jao, which is in preparation. So let me give some introduction, some motivation. So, we will consider generalized Kumer type varieties. So, let me first recall about the generalized Kumer variety, which has been constructed by the Will. So, we start with the avidian surface. Let's take n any integer which is greater or equal than two then we take Nilbert schema of points on length n plus one on A. These are not simply connected, but we compose with the Hibert channel morphism and then we compose the separation. We control the solution left. So this is the let's call this composition sigma and then we consider the fibre over zero we we call it command A and this is And this is a particular manifold of dimension one. And in fact, the second number of bit is seven, so it's not deformation equivalent to inverse kin, so of 0.73. In fact, this construction. In fact, this construction can be further generalized. So, this is due to the work of Yushioka and Baton Kai. And it's generalized using modules spaces of stable shifts on Arabian surface. So, let me briefly turn to words. So, here we consider given cohomology. Okay, and then we put on it a pairing, the so-called muca pairing. Let me recall it as for everybody. Right, so this is the pairing. So that is in fact a lattice, the local lattice, and as a lattice, this is four copies of the hyperbolic plane. And then over it, we put a weight-to-watch structure, which is introduced by the one on the H2 of the Bingen surface so that. That is zero part this one and we have the one one part okay and then we consider uh the algebraic mukai lettuce, so algebraic classes in it need let me well I denote it in this way. I denote it in this way, and it's given by the one one class is in the Mucan in the Mucan letters. Okay, now Now we take a vector V inside the algebraic Mukai lattice, which is primitive and whose square with respect to the Macau pairing is greater or equal than six. So actually this assumption we put it because at the end we We put it because at the end we want the modular space which is non-empty, but also we want it to be of dimension greater equal than four. And so let's say if H is a polarization on A, then we consider the moduli space of H Geese semi-stable. Table shifts on A with the okay, that with plus B and under the assumption that some genericity assumption, so if H is degeneric, in fact, this moduli space is This modular space is not one dimension this curve process. Okay, and this is more or less by the work of Bukai. Now, Yoshioka defines a map from this guy to the product of A with the dual labinar surface, the pixel. Being a surface, the pixel. Okay, so what is this map? So the way to get it is morally to consider firstly you take the determinant of your shift and on the other side you take the dual of the determinant. So what is that? If P is the Poincaré bundle, then the Poincare bundle Then the Poincaré bundle induces an equivalence between the boundary derived category of A and the one of the due one. So on the other part, you precompose the determinant with this equivalence. So this is more or the map that you should consider. Let's call it Consider, let's call it AB, and what Yoshioke proves is that AB is a albanesomorphism. And if you take the fiber of the zero of this map This map. Then, this is a smooth projective Italian manifold of dimension. It is given from here, B square minus two, which is the formation equivalent to the example of OB. Okay. And maybe if you don't see, but let me just write the name. So I refer to these as the generalized Kumer variety. And also we see of generalized format type. We say of generalized format type if it is intercalary deformation equivalent to such a thing. Okay, so this is what we have, but now let me remark one thing is that if you want to, if you're interested in projective deformation of this generalized Pumer type. Of these generalized Pumer type polarized varieties, then the general projective deformation of a hypercaler manifold in this deformation equivalence class is not of this form. So, let me just write a general project information over. Of these examples is not of this form. In fact, you can see it by computing the dimension of the time engine to the local deformation space, which is given by basically you compute the H11, which is H one which is uh six sorry five seven minus two but then we are interested in the projective information so the moduli will have four dimensions while those examples are controlled by the deformation of the abelian surface and in that case here this is four dimensional so you miss one dimension. So, somehow, the ultimate goal, so the final goal is to give an explicit description of a general polarized dipercular manifold in this deformation class. So the looks different. of generalized commercial time which is something that it is not known at this moment okay so before continuing Continuing to give a motivation about what we do, let me recall a bit about the case of K3N type. Okay, so in this case, yeah, this has already appeared in many of the talks before, like Giovanni's talk. So many examples arise from cubic forcles. So why? Which is a smooth degree surface in EP5. In particular, yeah, just the moduli is somehow an open subset inside this linear system. So So, if you compute the dimension, this should be 20-dimensional. And in the case of Ktrian type, this is somehow what you want, because the moduli for Ktrian type is for the polarized Ktrian type is multi-dimensional. And yeah, so we already, there are examples that of projective altercular manifolds. Projective particular manifolds associated to this cubic fourfold, but let me phrase it from the point of view of the right categories. So, from this perspective, we look at the bounded-derived category of coherent shifts. Ships why and in this case there is a semi-orthogonal decomposition, so we can break the derived category into pieces. One part is easy because it's given essentially by three-line bundles. And while here we have a subcategory which I denote in this way, which is known as the Kutzensa component, Y. And the point is that this subcategory is a non-commutative matrix surface. So, you know, So in a cheap way to explain this non-commutativity assumption, this non-computativity property, sorry, is that if y is special, suppose special could be fourfold, we have that the Kutzensa component is equivalent to the derived category of a temporary surface. So it's commutative in some sense. It's geometric, but tricker but uh but this is not true in general but not in general okay and uh and now uh the idea is to consider modular spaces of stable objects in this quote of component and uh uh yeah get uh families of bipercular mantles from that this is what is done by buyer Buyer clouds okay newer and still let me just summarize the result in two lines. The fact is that you get 20-dimensional families of Of arised and which are deformation equivalent, which are of Catrian type out of mobile spaces of stable. Of stable objects and new way. Okay, and in fact, this kind of approach also works for the case of Bush and Kai varieties of different dimensions, which appear in the injunction. So also, so let me just say other families with a similar approach from Michelle Mucari parameters of even dimension. Dimension. This is something I worked with Alex Bernie actually. Okay, so this is for the K3N type case. Now, let's go to the case of generalized commerce type. So, yeah, we want to Yeah, we want to get a. We are kind of inspired by the case of T3 of the component and T3 and type. So let me tell you the steps that are part of this work. So the first step is we construct to construct A non-commutative deformation of the derived category of an ambiguous surface. A is an ambivalent surface here over a four-dimensional space. Space. Then, second, we construct stability conditions over this non-commutative deformation to construct stability conditions over these definitions. And then the last part, which is related to the goal we said before, is to realize every general polarized particular manifold of a generalized polar type. Type as the fiber of the urbanization F of a modular space in this non-commutative deformation of a modular space of stable objects. Of stable objects in these non-commotic radar surveys. Okay, so what we have achieved now is. What we have achieved now is part one and part two, and the part three is in preparation. What I would like to do today is to talk about the part that we have completed. In particular, I would like to explain part one, which I think is nice to is a nice construction. Okay, so let's try about one. So I'll try to state a theorem of one. To do that, I need to introduce to fix. So fix L irrang two sub lattice in the algebraic muche lattice of A. Which is positive to rectum, primitive sublatus, which is positive death. Okay, yeah, you may wonder why we make this choice. Maybe I can give you some brief explanation about it. So, the first one is that if you look at the orthogonal complement of L inside the Inside the given cohomology, which you recall is this one, and this rank six. So, in particular, if you look at the period domain and yeah, so modulo some quotient, uh, this guy with the usual given by the usual quadric inside here, uh, this uh for the next. This four-dimensional. So, this is somehow the place where we want to make the deformation for our goal of the work. And also another reason which is related to point three is that so if you start with the generalized variety with a polarization, yeah, this is something so you should. So, Yoshioke actually proved that there is an ojisometry of this form, which is given by the Mucymorphism. This ojry is between the V-perve inside the mucy lattice and the H2 chromology of the Of this guy. So, in particular, here you have the polarization, which goes to a class in H prime inside here, which is positive. So, somehow you can associate to, once you fix it, you have a L like this, which is the saturation of the lattice generated by V and H prime over here. Okay, so just achieve motivation. And then, yeah, let's state theorem. So there exists a four-dimensional variety with The finite dominant map, and I'm sorry, I go to the other side for now. Comment. Of the purple and a linear category A over U such that so here somehow this notion of linear category is essentially a nice infinity category where it makes sense to have a family of Have a family of these categories over E. So there is a well-defined base change. So, somehow such that there exists a point in U where this non-commutative deformation is in fact the one you started with, so it's the derived category of A. And while for every point in U. In a U the base change in U is two carabyl carriability. Okay, so in the rest I would like to give an idea of the construction of this non-commutative family of ability of non-commutative abilities. Family of non-commutative abelian surfaces. Okay, so yeah, so for the proof, the starting point is with the Kimmer surfaces. I really recall just you all know very well, but let me just recall the couple of things for the notation. So A is our abelian surface, and we have this. Surface, and we have the involution on A given by the multiplication by minus one. So this has 16 fixed points. And the Kumar surface, Kumar K-3 surface is realized as so you take the quotient by the fixed locus of this. The locus of this involution, and then the minimal resolution, which let's call it as is uh two three Okay, and uh moreover, you can in fact see the However, you can in fact see the Kumer K3 as well. So you can in fact maybe if Pi are the fixed points, then you can blow up the PIs inside A. And then you're gonna get the exceptional divisor of this blow-ups of this blow-up, and then the S's of this. The S is obtained as the two-to-one cover of a tilde, which is branched at the images of these exceptional divisors, which I call EI, branched one. Yeah, so Okay, and let me just remark one thing. So, in particular, those are contained in the pico best, and we do not by kick. We denote by K the Hummer lattice, which is the minimal sub-lattice generated by those classes inside the NH2 of A. And in fact, for instance, note that those are an even set since they are the branch of the color. So, in particular, in Of the cover, so in particular, inside this cumar lattice, you have classes like this one, and then there is also more, but let me just point this out and also oh, maybe yes, yeah, thank you. Sorry, yeah, yeah, inside the corner, thanks a lot. Um, ah, and then I'll. And another thing also from this construct that construction inside here, you also have a copy of the H2 cohomology of A, in fact, with the intersection formula multiplied by two. Okay, so this is from the point of Lattice theory. Now, let me move to the side of the right categories. So, here we have the result. So here we have the result, I mean we can apply the result of a bridge linking grid. So here on one side you have the bounded derivative category of S. On the other side you adds the involution on A and in fact it induces an involutive auto equivalence of dBA. Of dBA generating like lexicon by G, the group generated by this evolution, and they look at the somehow G equivariant shifts on A. And in fact, the boundary direct show that the boundary category of G equivariant shifts, the one called the invariant category, is equivalent. There is an equivalence with the There is an equivalence with DBS. Okay, so this is the result. Since I need a bit more general structure for this invariant category, let me recall something more about that in a more abstract scenario. So just a brief recall. So if we start with G, we find that abelian group. abelian group I am everything I work over C and T is a C linear category okay so what is an action of G on T so a G action okay so in a in a cheap way So, in a cheap way, it is the data of for every element in the group, you associate an equivalence, an outer equivalence of the category T. But then you need something more, you need also compatibilities with the group structure, which are going to be some isomorphism between functors, plus compatibilities. And once you have the group action on a category T, we can consider the gene variant category. So, what is that? So, objects in here are essentially linearized objects in k. So, it's the data of a pair in theta where Where P is an object in T and theta is a collection index over the group of what of so those are isomorphisms of your object E with the essential image G and then again you have compatibilities with the With the group structure. And then you can also define the multi-solves in a compatible way. Let me just tell you this part. Okay, so yeah, we have a group action. We considered the invariant category. And now the key result for us to point is a result of erogen. So we show that if you consider That if you consider the dual group of G, so the group of characters G, then in fact it has an action on this invariant category. And an action such that if you take the invariant category with respect, the one with respect to the The one with respect to data. And then you take the binding category with respect to this dual action. Then this category is equivalent to T. So you come back to the original category. Sorry, I'm going to go ahead and do this. It's a choice of an I don't want to take the one paper. Yep, okay, other questions. Okay, so this is what we want to use in our case. So, in our case, we have that result of BKR, and by combining it with the Elagine result, in this situation, the dual group is just Z over two. So, we get it is an action on. On DBS, on the derived category of the Kumar surface, in such a way so that if you look at the invariant category with respect to this dual action, then this is equivalent to the bounded direct category of k. Okay, and in fact this group action is not too bad. So using the equivalence of BKER, which is explicit, we have that. So the action So, the action is generated by an involuntary outequivalence IS of which is given by is given essentially by the composition of spherical twists of spherical objects with the tensorization with the line. With the tensorization with a line boundary. So, yeah, maybe you don't care about this explicit thing, but just to tell you that you can explicitly manipulate it. Okay, so now what we want to do, we had the statement in mind, and the naive idea is that we want to take a deformation of the derived category of S together with this group action. So, idea, ideally. Ideally, this deform DBS together with this involution in such a way that this is a generator of a good picture. And in order to do this, we can use some results coming from the work of Adelton and Thomas and Ulsutoda. So, at the end, the key point is that the requirement that in the deformation this involution preserves the sympathetic form. So, for this motivation, we give the following definition. So, we consider k tilde, we define it as the minus one eigen space. Of the action of the of the this evolution on the Muccai lattice of S. And we call it the derived Humar lattice Okay, and why we give this name. So, why we give this name? So, in fact, like a Q basis, for instance, for this lattice is given by those plastics. Remember, the errors. Generating the Kumar lattice, and also you can show using maybe the inverse of BKR, but anyway, you can show that there is a geosometry between the even cohomology the mucai lattice of A with our intersection form scale by two. Uh, R scale by two, and this is isometric to the orthogonal complement of this uh of this lattice inside the Muckel lattice of S. Maybe let's give it let's call it a phi H is a organizometry and uh yeah so in particular is a reminding what I Is reminding what happens in the case of the classical Timer Lattice. Okay, so yeah, so why we consider the minus one eigenspace? The reason is that the condition coming from the results in deformation theory is that you, in order to make that deformation to work, you require that require that mean that the minus one eigen space so this k tilde remains algebraic mean that the k tilde remains algebraic in order to be clear Okay, and so if you directly do that with the Kumar surface, somehow it's not okay for our purpose because if you really keep essentially if you really keep K algebraic, so the Kummer lattice, then you're just gonna remain in the locus of Kumer surfaces. So you will have a three-dimensional model. You will have a three-dimensional module, which is not what we want. So, we need, but the solution is to pass to a Fourier partner in some sense. So, yeah, let me explain this. So, we consider So here we have this phi h. Recall that at the very beginning in the statement we have fixed a rank 2 sublattice in the algebraic part of this, this L. So we can consider the image via this viol and then let's take the saturation of the lattice generated by this image of L and this K tilde inside. Tilda inside the mouchai lattice of S okay, this in fact splits in a copy of a hyperbolic plane and another lattice lambda or lambda is a lattice of signature one fifteen. One fifteen okay, and now we are almost there in the sense that we can use results of LOV, which tells us basically the derived RELLI, which tells us that there exists a projective K-3 surface T with the function. With an equivalence of BBS with DBT, such that this equivalence, if you look at the action on the Mukai lattice, so that you get an ogisometry on the Mukai lattice, then this sense, this copy, so unless we have this copy of So, once we have this copy of a hyperbolic plane, μ, it sends it to x0 plus v score of tz. Okay, and why? Okay, why we look at it, why we are interested in it, because now what we can this equivalence, so it induces an isomorphism. Equivalence, so it induces an isometry between the Muckelattis of S and the one of T, and is a large isometry. So, in particular, from that, so psi H induces an embedding of lambda inside inside the lattice of Tima, but in particular, it goes in the algebraic part because it's a OJ is. Part because it's OJ isometry, but moreover, it goes to the H2 part of the algebra. So it goes here. But in the degree two part, because by the choice of T that we have done, the part in U goes to H0 and H4 and this is orthogonal. So in particular, So, in particular, what we gain is that we can see T as a lambda polarized K3 surface. And then this is something we like because so here, remember that we wanted a deformation that keeps k tilde algebraic and k tilde is inside here through this equivalence, so through the audio geometry that it induces. The OJ geometry that it induces, it goes to the algebraic part. So, and k ta is primitively embedded in the algebraic ink like this of Titan. So, what we do is to look at the modules space of lambda polarized filter surfaces. Lambda. And so that our, and we consider now t, so we change it to this right partner with the with our lambda that is given by by that primitive embedding. And also the involution. Okay, so here we have a path to a free Mukai partner, but it is enough to. Kiparner, but it is enough to consider the conjugate involution of the involution IS that we considered at the beginning. So we have this plus it equivalence involution on dbt given by the conjugation. So this sine minus and this is what we define. And this is what we deform at the end. So, by the previous comments, that we have not really explained the detail, but by results on the correlation theory before screening. On this modular space of lambda polarized K3 surfaces, and in fact, with a little bit more detail, it differs to a group action to a group action on the deformation of a DB. Okay, so let me try to conclude with a picture of to summarize the construction. So the picture is the following. We said that we are considering this modular space of lambda polarized K-3 surfaces, and up to a finite cover we get a mini thermally. Family, let me use tau. This is a family of lambda polarized entry surfaces. So in this study, you have in particular is the formation of so over a point u zero tau u zero is the Tau zero is just given by p together with the with the polarization, lambda polarization. And yeah, so here we can look at the right category, which has an involution. I write i u zero, but in fact this is just the same as dBt. dBt with the involue the out equivalence it. So somehow we have this point which gives the formation and over u we have a tau u which is a lambda polarized k3 surface. If we look at the derived category of it then there is an involution I u which is Which is a deformation of IT that we consider. Okay, and then what we can do now, we pass to the invariant category. So we denote by AU the invariant category of d beta u with respect to this group action. And by this actually not hard to Not hard to check it, but it is first with you to Beckman and Uberdick that in fact such a invariant category is a two Calabial. So you can Calabial perfectly. And so this is the one that we This is the one that we get in the theorem. And okay, so this is about part one. Then, for part two, actually, let me maybe just say two words. The part two was the construction of stability conditions on this family. But in fact, the key point that we use is a result of McRee, Merot, and Sellari that they prove that if you start so. That if you start, so our category is the invariant category of something that is not bad, is the derived category of a K3. And in fact, if we start, they show that if you start with a stability condition, let's say on the B on the derived category of this K3 surface, and then which is fixed by the group action in a proper sense, then it induces a stability condition on the invariant category. So this is the key point that we use in the construction. In the construction. Okay, and then the last part is still somehow in preparation because it requires to produce families of stability conditions and moduli spaces associated to them on this U. And yeah, for the moment, the theory is done for admissible subcategories in the derived category. So, here there is something more to Category, so here there is something more to do. So, okay, I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much.
