Okay, this morning we have Jakob Sticks giving the next of our survey talks. He's going to give us an invitation to Annabelian Giapatrino. Thank you very much for the invitation, and first of all, for the conference. Going to write the proposal to get a conference in such a nice place because this is always a bit of work in the background, and we all appreciate the result of it. I'm going to start talking about NVIDIA and drug a trade, but I'm starting with prehistory. So, prehistory is what came before the notion of anabelian geometry was coined. It starts maybe with a starts maybe with the theorem of Martin Schleier in 1926. That said if k is a field such that the absolute Galois group is non-trivial but finite, then this implies that there exists an ordering for the In the field, and actually, it's of characteristic zero, therefore, and the algebraic closure is just obtained by adding the root of minus one. So, this is very much in line with what we learned in Max's talk about reconstruction. So, you give yourself an algebraic invariant and you learn some structure which is there. So, you can cook up an ordering. You can cook up an ordering here. The next theorem already made an appearance in this conference, that's the theorem of Nike and Mucida. And that's 1969, 1976. If K and L are number fields, then Then if we take the natural map that maps field isomorphisms to isomorphisms of the respective absolute Galois groups. And I deliberately changed the order because as we already also learned, the Galois group has to be considered as a fundamental group and the fundamental group is covariant on the geometry. And this is sort of the dual thing. So this map. So, this map turns out to be a bijection, and for this to be true, I have to pass here to what's called outer isomorphisms. That's because, so yeah, y1 of bash of k is the absolute Ganov group, but this notation disposes of the base point and we pay the price for it, then everything is only defined up to sort of dragging around a loop between two base points. Dragging around a loop between two based points, and that's conjugation by loops, and that makes things only well-defined up in our isomorphism. Okay. Sorry, may I ask a really ridiculous question? Any question? I think that's the same as the isomorphisms between the associated bands and the stack of bands. So, is there some sense in which we're really talking about the classifying stack of the Gallot group and not the Gallo group itself? Uh yeah, there is. Uh uh maybe I come to that obvious later. Um not in exactly these words, but you can then easily translate and tell me. So this was already present in Martin Lifke's lightning talk, and it will it also features in the abstract of Peter Heng's talk, which we have on Thursday. Okay, what's the next result I'd like to? The next result I'd like to highlight, it's still prehistory, is the theorem of Mosto, which you maybe not expect here. That's 1973, and that's a theorem about compact hyperbolic free manifolds. So we are talking about the smooth category, and we have a Riemann metric with constant negative curvature minus one. Reminds one. So these spaces are uniformized by the three-dimensional hyperbolic space. And this gamma here is the fundamental group. And then it was proven that isometries from x to y, so here isomines in the metric sense under map pi1 are in bijection with outer isomini. With outer isomorphisms of the corresponding fundamentals. Okay, this is of course a bit beyond the topic of the workshop, but nevertheless it tells us where what might be a crucial property of spaces where these phenomena occur. These phenomena occur. So H3 is contractible, and therefore this X here is a topological K gamma 1, gamma 1 fundamental group. And this implies by topology that for any space T, homotopy classes of maps from T to X are actually in bijection with outer homomorphisms from the level of fundamental groups. Fundamental groups. So this is the piece of topology in the game. So from the right hand side you immediately get some topology, so some topological map, a homotopic class of that. And what comes next is remarkable rigidity. That's what it's called in this field. In this field, namely that every homotopy class which belongs to a homotopy equivalence actually contains and contains it uniquely, so existence and uniqueness, an isometry. Since epsilons you can flatten things out so that there it becomes an It becomes compatible with metric and it's also unique with that property. So I'd say this is the part of where geometry enters. And so I've in the framework of MAX I've introduced sort of an intermediate step topology. Okay, so that's the slogan. So KÏ€1 spaces should be important because they Should be important because if they behave like in topology, there should be something you could start with. And also, I'd like to phrase an abelian geometry as the attempt to transform this picture into the et al. arithmetic world, where the et al. topology has to play this role. And for varieties which are anabelian, and in this Which are anabelian, and in this here it becomes tautological because, well, if I don't tell you what an anabelian variety is, then I can tell you anything. Yeah, but the fact is nobody really knows how to pin down what really an Anabelian variety is. But for certain varieties with interesting arithmetic and geometry, this eternal topology of the variety should capture the essence of geometry. This is what it is. The essence of geometry. This is what Anabelian geometry tries to achieve. Okay, so this was the prehistory, so we move on to history. And for the history, it starts in 1983 in a very old-fashioned way, namely that was a Famous letter written. It's really a letter on a typewriter. You can find facsimiles of that on the internet easily. It's a letter from Grotendieg to Faltings. And in order to set yourself in the mood, at that time Faltings just had proven the Model conjecture, which afterwards should hold maybe the Model Faltings theorem, or Fautics theorem, I don't know. There, I don't know. Is there an established terminology for this yet? Maybe some 40 years after, it should be. Because I think people still can relate to this as the model conjecture, although it's a theorem now. Fault is theorem. Faultics is theorem. Fortex theorems. Yeah. Okay. Faultics has more theorems, so I. So I prefer to call it the model Faultics theorem, right? Because a model conjecture in Faultics to me. Okay, so. Okay, so the Modette Faulting's theorem was just proven, and this in particular went through a Tate's conjecture for abelian varieties and their H1s. So let me explain. So let's say for simplicity over a number field. Okay. So we have some a billion variables. We have some abelian varieties A and B over K and then homomorphisms over K from A to B map by the Labic Tech module to homomorphisms of the analytic Tech modules. And on the left hand side we have a K-equivariant. So on the right hand side this are homomorphisms of Galois representations. And then because the right hand side is a Zalma. The right-hand side is a ZL module, and the left-hand side is only a Z module, which better tensor with ZL, and then this becomes a bijection. So I first translate this into fundamental groups. So the fundamental group of such an geometrically connected variety sits in a Shou-exact sequence, and as a base point, I take the origin. Base point, I take the origin to get things straight. So here is pi one of the base field, which we already agreed to is the absolute Gano group. And there's a section given by factoriality of the origin. But nevertheless, because this one is a Boolean and in fact isomorphic to the product of the La Mectate model, so in some sense, here on the right-hand side, you see a fundamental group occurring, which is not conceivable. Occurring, which is not conceived as a fundamental group usually. So you can take pre-images and conjugate and get a Gala action, so an action of the right-hand side and the left side, which is, you can either use the zero section or use the fact that this is abelian to get that this is just the usual Galois representation that we have on torsion points cooked up in limits to get this tape modules. Later, if this Later, if this becomes a non-abelian group, then this will only be an outer action. But I think the way I devise everything, I'm not talking too much about this. So, but anyway, the right-hand side gives us the, so it focuses on the emodic part of the fundamental group, and then it says that if these are isomorphic as colour representations, and since this is a similar product, this is the same as. The same direct product is the same as that the fundamental groups are isomorphic. So if the fundamental groups are isomorphic as groups augmented over the base, right? We are talking about a relative context. It's over a field. So this by one data should also be relative over the canoe of the base field. So if these are isomorphic in particular, this one is non-empty, and then there's an element in here. Okay. Okay, but this only sort of is an approximation of an abelian geometry. And maybe our intuition also tells us that we shouldn't expect this to be an abelian because I just told you the fundamental group is abelian, so it seems not to be non-abelian. But nevertheless, given an isomorphism of. But nevertheless, given an isomorphism of pi 1, we know at least that this space is non-empty, and therefore a bit more care tells us that there's an isogeny. And there's even an isogeny prime to L for every L. And this is already quite a lot. It's not showing that the two are isomorphic, but it's it's pretty close. Uh so are are they isomorphic? Are they isomorphic? No, they're examples, but they're not. Okay. This is only locally isomorphic, right? Because look at the complex case, then you have here final free Z modules, and the data you're getting is only the completion of those letters as moving. So it's a genus thing. Okay, so at least. Okay, so at least they're isogenous, and maybe well, I don't know what Brotoni was stimulated by, but this is sort of close to asking, so what extra data do we actually need in order to really have this arithmetic rigidity that I alluded before, that you really get a homomorphism between the underlying varieties. Okay, and Okay, and I should also mention that those abelian varieties at least satisfy the requirement that they're K by 1 spaces. They're just not abelian, but they're K by 1 spaces. So that's in line with the reasoning. Okay, so in general, we have this etal fundamental group functor. It goes from varieties of a k, let's say geometrically connected maybe, and we are ending up in And we are ending up in profinite groups over the Ganoir group. And so I mean, some x over k is mapped to the should exact sequence like that. And now I'm starting to ignore the base point. And here, since I didn't put pointed varieties here, I have to work up to Up to inner automorphisms from the kernel. So the base k is fixed with a fixed structure of the fundamental group, with a fixed base point, but you may lift the base point to different ones of x. And therefore, sort of everything you're doing is the identity on the Gala group here. And so you can only move around the base point by loops here from the kernel. Kernel. Okay, and if I avoid geometrically connected, then I'm just losing this one here. But I wanted to say so. So this sequence you get by elementary Galois theory in cases where the fundamental group is just some unramified absolute Galois group of your function field. And then this is elementary infinite Galois theory. So this is not very deep, but you could look at this by saying, well, This is by saying, well, in some sense, pi 2 of spec of k is trivial, and then this is the homotopy sequence associated to this vibration. Okay, so we have this functor, and in the spirit of reconstruction, or in the spirit of alibi and geometry, you're asking yourself what are good conditions. yourself what are good conditions to impose on either side so that you actually get an equivalence of categories. So you need to do some restrictions probably in order to have a chance. Probably are in order to have a chance. And yeah, so the main theme in the reconstruction that we saw was that usually you're translating equivalence into the two things, that you want something fully faithful and also essentially subjective. Subjective. In this business, you're not really interested in essentially subjective because you simply argue that you're only interested in pi1 data, which just lies in the image of this functor. And so you artificially make the right-hand side smaller so that this is nothing to worry about. And then this becomes about fully faithfulness statements. And so in a sense, you're asking yourself when is In a sense, you're asking yourself when is homomorphisms from x to y actually in bijection with homomorphisms over bubble of k of pi over x to pi over y. And on the right-hand side, this has to be out of homomorphisms in the sense that I try to explain here. This is more much too complicated, so people start out by asking that only isomorphisms are preserved under this. Are preserved under this. And then there is a weak form where you only ask if there is an isomorphism of fundamental groups, whether this is equivalent to that there is an isomorphism of varieties, and both sides have to be compatible with the structure. And both sides have to be compatible with structure relative to k. And then this home version here, I write it once more, now with t and x and different positions, because this has a slightly different This has a slightly different flavor. So here I'm asking x and y to be an abelian. And I'm yet to offer you what I think about this. And here I'm only asking x to be an abelian. And t should be just maybe smooth connected. Yeah, probably I'm I'm forgetting the property to ask for connectedness because I'm so used to it. Just pi one for non-connected ones is sort of Pi 1 for non-connected ones is sort of silly. And so, this is a running assumption that I have. And so, please forgive me if I'm forgetting the word connected at some point. Right, so here you're asking whether the functor which is given on the right-hand side is actually represented by x. And this is a very conceptual question which you can ask. Okay, let me say a few more comments. Say a few more comments. So, if you take either of the two, let's say this one, and assume that x is allowed to be spec k, then we are actually talking about k-rational points of y being in bijection with sections of the natural projection map up to conjugation. And this is the question asked by the section conjecture, which was. Quite the section conjecture, which was also mentioned in Martin Lutka's talk. Okay, yeah, one more comment on fully faithful and equivalence. So an equivalence technically, I think, is if you have an inverse function. And so categorically, these two approaches. Categorically, these two approaches are equivalent, but aesthetically, constructing an inverse functor is much more satisfying. And actually, this is what reconstruction is about. You have your algebraic invariant, and you try to reverse engineer what the functor has done to your geometry and get the geometry back. Whereas fully faithful seems a bit like Fully faithful seems a bit like abstract categorical nonsense. But the truth is, in recent years there has been terminology coming up for this. So this approach was called bianomium. And this approach was called mono-anabilon. That's terminology from Moshizuki. I think that's understandable what it means. That's understandable what it means. And I have to say, the results I'm presenting you about bionabelian geometry, bionoglian-anabelian geometry, they most of the time actually pursue the first route. They try to reconstruct, and sometimes you don't succeed to reconstruct everything. For example, sometimes you have an isomorphism of fields that you want to construct, you can reconstruct. You can reconstruct really the elements of the field. You can construct maybe the multiplicative structure or the additive, depends. And therefore, you're sort of almost there. And from a map on the pi1 data, you get a map on the geometry. And it's compatible with multiplication, but you don't know whether it's compatible. I know you don't know how to describe addition in this field, but you can prove that the map that comes from isomorphisms of the pi. That comes from isomorphisms of the pi 1 data actually obey addition, which is already there. You can't reconstruct it, but you can talk about whether the existing addition is preserved. And this is sort of then where the mono-anabelian approach sort of has to call the feet and say this result is only bi-anabelian. But most of the results I know are sort of very close to being mono-anabelian from the start. From the start. So there's a lot of reconstruction in this business as well. So I wanted to mention a few conjectures by Rotendig in this letter. So first of all, he said he thinks that Nabelian varieties, they should be thought of as iterately fibered in elementary Nabelian varieties. So these are, everyone has smooth, whatever, probably constant topology. Well, whatever. Well, probably constant topological type, maybe small projective, in proper case, vibrations, and the fibers are elementary anabelian varieties. Okay. This is empty statement, because if I don't tell you what an elementary anabelian variety is, you get nothing. But he says that certainly he thinks that hyperbolic curves should be elementary. And abelian. And hyperbolic means that the Euler characteristic, if it's an affine curve, is negative. And maybe this is only the characterization of characteristic zero. Maybe the better characterization is in terms of, so the curve is x, so the field k, and so x to the power is non-abuelable. Monovial. Because then you also capture curves in positive characteristics like the FI9, which happened to also be very unabyled, but wouldn't meet this requirement. But the second one, which is much closer to the notion of panabelian geometry, we're talking with an invariant which is not abelian. So those should be there. And note, according to Grottendieg, whether a hyperbolic curve is actually an abelian should be. Hyperbolic curve is actually an abelian should have nothing to do with its form over k. It should just be a geometric statement. So, yeah. Okay. If we're in characteristic zero, then this fundamental group is known. And if you vary the point of a moduli space, the isomorphism type doesn't change. So, certainly, if you're of an algebraically closed field, you can't expect any of these things to happen for curves, right? Because this is a nice A nice topological invariant, which is just locally constant in good families. This is very different in positive characteristic. And since I'm mentioning here, I don't talk about it later. So there's current trends in unequivocal geometry where you try to do an geometry over algebraic closed fields, but in positive characteristic, because they're the fundamental rules. Because they're the fundamental group. Just look at smooth projective curves of genus at least two. There, the fundamental group varies dramatically in phones. It jumps very wildly. And this goes back to work of Raino, Saidipop and Tomagava, and many others. And so if it wants that you can either call this a bug of the fundamental group or it's a feature, right? So if it's a bug, if you want to have a good geometric If it's a bug if you want to have a good geometric theory, but it's a feature if you want to have interesting arithmetic which is already encoded in varieties of algebraic close fields, but positive characteristic. So in some sense, those cases which we should consider as geometric, they have lots of et al. arithmetic information. So that's an open field to still be explored. Yeah. Um yeah. Oh yeah. And uh some other uh varieties Gotenig mentions is uh Mgm, so the modernized basis of curves. And I think he also considers the section conjecture. So in some sense, a spec of k, where k is maybe some field of absolute finite type, he considers as an abelian, maybe not finite fields, because finite fields have Fields, because final fields have procyclic Galois group. And he also makes a conjecture that any smooth variety should have an open basis for its topology consisting of an abelian varieties. So when you talk about vibrations, what comes to my mind is that they're really only a birational thing. It's hard to make an actual vibration without blowing something up. So I'm curious how birational is what we're talking about here. This is a good question. So you're basically asking about limitations of the theory. In dimension one, you don't see this because there's always a unique smooth model and you can't blow up anything, right? In a higher In a higher dimension, you can blow up, and if you blow up a smooth center, things again smooth. The fibers are rational, and therefore fibron is isomorphic. So if this would be true for either of them, then so so with the exception of the last one, right? So but but uh you see that uh you would cook up a a retraction of this blow-up, which is never going to happen, right? Which is never going to happen. Which means that varieties where they're sort of rational sub-varieties contained in, they're not good candidates for end-of-minute geometry. If you're asking your variety to be a k pi1 algebraically, so for the etau fund group, and let's say smooth projective and Euler characteristic non-zero, then those varieties have large forms. And those varieties have a large fundamental group in the sense of color, large algebraic fundamental groups, and in particular they're all minimal. Okay, so in higher dimension, this is very restrictive, and only very selected varieties should be NVL. And actually, this is a challenge I saw, which actually is a sneak preview of this afternoon, right? So I'd like to know. So I'd like to know good other candidates of algebraic K1s which are not concocted from curves and vibrations of curves. Because I don't know anything. Okay. So yeah. So why the name an abelian? At least for curves, I already stressed that those are curves which have non-abelian fundamental group, but I think this isn't capturing the essence of it, right? So the fundamental group being non-abelian. So, the finite metal group being non-abelian is not enough. For example, if you take a how are these called these surfaces called which are isogenous to an abelian variety? So abelian variety model is something total-free, finite group. They are hypoelliptic, biolliptic. Any geometers in the room? So so you can have abelian surfaces modular or finite group. Surface is modulated a finite group which acts freely, right? In the classification group, it's Kodag dimension zero. And those fundamental groups are, of course, virtually abelian. They're also non-abelian, but this doesn't count, because if this would be an abelian, then also the cover given by the abelian variety would be unabelian, and abelian varieties are never unabelian, so to speak. With one exception. So abelian varieties of a finite fields are unabelian. So it's very weird. Okay. Okay, I emphasized algebraic kÏ€1 and let me talk a bit about this. So you have the etal topology and you have the finite etal topology of a Ethereum connected variety. And this means we have a comparison map if f is a locally constant sheaf. Sheath on X, so its fiber in some point is actually a representation of the fundamental group. And so we get a comparison map on cohomology in the opposite direction, which compares the group cohomology of this model given by the fiber with the et al cohomology of the local system. Child homology of the local system. And we call a variety an algebraic k pi1 if this is an isomorphism for all such f. And they should have constructible stocks, the finite stocks. Okay, an example of this is given by the Given by the spectrum of the field, because the atomic cohomology of a field is nothing but Galois homology, so the cohomology of its absolute Galois group, which happens to be the fundamental group of the field. Okay, and also x is a curve, and geometrically, it's not a projective line. Then this is also a case I want. And I wanted to state one proposition and actually prove it. So if k is algebraic closed and x over k is an algebraic k pi 1, and for simplicity we ask the proper smooth. And also that the Euler characteristic et aladic v and L is different from the characteristic is non-zero. Is non-zero, then the fundamental group has a trivial center. And more precisely, oh, okay, more precisely here, if U is an open If u is an open, then the centralizer inside pi 1 of this open is trivial. And this is sort of very far from being abelian, right? Even open subgroups have nothing that they centralize. And in particular, the example I just had before fails with something else. And And so Moshizuki coined the term slim for these kinds of groups, having this property. And much earlier, Franz Ort suggested to call those groups anabelian groups. And I kind of like it. And sort of anabelian varieties should at least have an abelian fundamental groups. So the proof is fairly easy, therefore, I can give it. I can give it, and I'll also give it for a reason I explain afterwards. So, if we have an element which is in the center, so I'm not proving the moreover, which is an easy deduction of this. If I have an element in the center, then I can look at an open subgroup and the corresponding finite entire cover that gives. Our cover that it gives. And because sigma is in the center, Galois theory will tell you that it induces, well, as a deck transformation of the universal covering, something which descends on every level, so to speak. And now the open U is actually the fundamental group of this covering. And in here, we have conjugation. And here we have conjugation by sigma, which of course is the identity. And if I restrict it here to this open, then this becomes what actually this automorphism sigma u does on the fundamental rule. So that automorphism is a deck transmutation which is actually trivial on pi one. Now, only thing I have to do is look at homology of u. Of u geometrically, xx u geometrically. Well, oh no, I don't have to pass the dollar true because I'm already there. Since this is a finite eta cover of a K by 1 space, you know that essentially by Shapiros remember that this is also a K by 1 space. So a talc homology is actually a group cohomology of your open. And then what this automorphism does here is the idea. Here is the identity because it's the identity on root cohorting. Now you simply compute the Lefschetz number one of sigma u. This is given by the trace of a pullback on homology, so alternating sum of traces. And since this is the identity, what you compute is actually the Euler characteristic, which happens to be. Which happens to be just a multiple given by the degree of the water characteristic of your base, and this is non-zero. So you conclude that the Lefschetz number is non-zero, and the Lefschetz number is the number of fixed points. But now we have trouble because we have a deck transformation which has a fixed point, and that needs to be at the identity, because any deck transformation is uniquely. Because any deck transformation is uniquely determined by what it does on one point. And if it has a fixed point, it has to be the identity. And now you're doing this in the whole tower, and you see that sigma is the identity. And therefore, this is done. Okay, so why have I told you this proof? I told you this proof because it features an essential technique in an abundant geometry that you In an abelian geometry, that you work with abelian invariant like homology, but you're not doing this restricted to your variety x, but you're doing it compatibly in the whole tower of all covers. And only then the whole strength of an abelian geometry unleashes. If you exploit the information the tiny bit, you can come up with the high-power machine of abelian mathematics, and so to speak. And you see how that varies in coverings. And then results like this come up. Okay, so the upshot is unabelian varieties should have an abelian fundamental groups in the sense that they are very far away from being abelian in this sense. Okay. Okay, next topic is the only results. And so there's theorems by Hopp from 1919, 1994, which say that if K and L are finite generative fields, Finally generated fields over Q and later the positive characteristic. So then, so function fields of finite transcendence degree, then isomorphisms from K to L are actually bijection with altar isomorphisms of the absolute Galois groups. So this is a high-dimensional Neuki-Fecheta theorem. And oh yeah, something I forgot to mention. Something I forgot to mention. So, this is not early results, but I should mention here. So, these results here, and also the Neukeshida theorem, are bi-Anabinian results. But the Neukesh-Chichita theorem in a mono-Anabinian version has been established by Yoshio Hoshi in 2019. 2019. So he completed the program to actually reconstruct the number field from its absolute galaxy. Then when it comes to curves, I should mention Hiroaki Nakamura, early 1990s. He had some results about genus zero curves and And for time reasons, I'm writing them down, but I'm writing down the main result of Tomagava's. Not maybe the main result, but a striking result. Namely that if X and Y are hyperbolic curves, and they have to be alpha in here over Over finite fields K and L, then isomorphisms between parameter of X and parameter of Y of X and Y are actually in bijection with isomorphisms out of I over X, I over Y. So why is this remarkable? This is remarkable because This is remarkable because, first of all, this happens over a field which is not considered to be an abelian because its absolute gamma group is just procyclic, so abelian. And secondly, because this is an absolute result. So I'm not taking a reference to a base scheme. And also here, I'm not referencing the map to the absolute colour group. From that, he introduces a similar statement for curves over half. Curves over hyperbolic affine curves over finitely generated fields over Q. And that goes via a specialization technique, which gives an interesting Anabelian criterion for good reduction of such hyperbolic curves, which can be translated into a factorization criterion for maps into a moduli space of curves, which in itself sort of is a glimpse of anablier geometry of MgN. Glimpse of anablomier geometry of Mgn and would be nice to explain here, but for time reasons I can't. And I could then also have mentioned that I extended this to some general context of some dense open in a normal space. But yeah, for time reasons I shouldn't. The second remarkable thing about this theorem is that it starts out by reconstructing the set of points via the set of sections. So the set of sections here one would conceive. Set of sections here one would conceive to be a very badly behaved set because well you're trying to construct a section starting from something which is a free group. Of course you only have to lift generators and then get sections. So there should be an abundance of sections and actually there's an uncountable many of those. But he can reconstruct those which come actually from rational points by Rational points by just saying that those are the sections which, when considering the tower of all covers where the section lifts, so to speak, the tower of covers where the corresponding fundamental group contains the decomposition group of the place, then all of those curves should have k rational points. And that uniquely characterizes it. And the existence of rational points can be controlled by a Lefschetz trace formula, which Which we sort of have at our disposal as long as we can pin down in an ambiguous way the Frobenius element in the value group. And this can be done. Okay, so there's a reconstruction process in this. And then one uses global class field theory for function fields. And one arises at the multiplicative group of a field. And one way to process further would One way to process further would be to look at this function field, modulo the so the multiplicative group of the function field, modulo the multiplicative group of the constants as being the projective space of the function field, and then applying the fundamental theorem of projective geometry that Young that we saw in the first draw. And it's not quite what is applied here, but it's a bit like that. So it's also about reconstructing lines in the space. Constructing lines in the space and so forth. So there are some similarities. Okay, then really um um main achievement in the subject is by Ushizuki. Subject is by Ushizuki. The number two of the third is the number three if the part two of the third is the simple but uh no part two was the monodroming criterion for the reduction, part three was the characterization of the sections that I just said. Sorry, I forgot. I'm just at page number four. I have page number seven, and I already knew that I have to go through to have some things. So, but this one I have definitely to tell you. So, if case performance. Tell you, so if k is contained and qp finally generated, so called a subpiadic field, and this has been generalized to generalized subpiadic fields by now. And x over k is a hyperbolic curve, and t over k is smooth, then homomorphisms from t to x over k, very X over k are in bijection with homomorphisms over Gal K of pi 1 t to pi 1 x. Well, not quite, because then the section conjecture would be part of it. So t of spec k would have k rational points and sections, so the section conjecture we still don't know. So we are taking out of equation the the constant map, so we're asking the map to be dominant, and then the corresponding map on pi one is is open, and then you have a pijection. And then you have a bijection. So this is pretty close, and it's even so that you can pass here to the geometric pro P part of the fundamental. So geometrically, pro P is enough. And the basic insight here was that you should look at Pierre-Koch theory to get the geometry out of the geometry. To get the geometry out of the arithmetic. Okay, another nice application of if you have a statement like even an isom statement for hyperbolic curves, I had planned to show you that this can only help for fields, as base field whose absolute Galois group has trivial center, or even as an abelian in the sense that I explained. Sense that I explained. It's a five-line proof, but unfortunately, I can't tell you. So the time of the talk is too small, actually. But it doesn't actually have a choice to work this out. The next result I had planned to tell you is a result by Koenigsmann, which also was mentioned already. Which also was mentioned already. This is about the birational section conjecture over p-iadic fields. And so birational means that you're not only looking at varieties, now you're looking at function fields. You're looking at function fields. There, the fundamental group is just the absolute Galo group, and it protects by restriction to the Galois group of the base field. And now, of course, if you have a k-rational points, you can't assign a section by functionality. But what you can do is you can look at the corresponding decomposition group here, which has a projection down here, and this splits. So, there's a J1 as the inertia. T is one as the inertia, and this extension splits. And so every section which lands in a decomposition group is sort of considered to be arithmetic enough to sort of satisfy the generalization of the virational section conjecture. And Krinigsman does prove that if k over qp is finite and x over k is a curve, it's been passing to the generic part. Because we're passing to the generic part of hyperbolicity, holds as soon as you've taken out enough points, at least. Then every section here comes from a rational point in the sense that its image is contained in a rational decomposition group. Okay. Yeah, so this is proven in a marvelous application of logic. Of course, all proofs use logic, but this one is a bit of mathematical model theory. And the idea is so simple and so elegant that I have to show you. So you look at the field which is cut out by the image of your section. Right? This is just some field, it's an extension. Some field, it's an extension of your function field. And by construction, the absolute Gamer group is just the Gamma group of the base. So this is the map by restriction, because the inverse map is just the isomorphism, the section that you started with. This is tautological. Okay, a bit like the theorem I started with, Artin Schreier, which constructed an Constructed an ordering out of basically nothing, well, tiny bit, because this is the Galois group of a periodic field, one can come up with a valuation on this field. And you can even show that the inclusion k inside m happens to be an elementary equivalence in terms of model theory. So it's an elementary extension where sort of every statement which is in the Which is in the theory of these fields, which is true over M, is also true over K. Now, the statement that X of M is non-empty is a statement that you can talk about. And because this is tautologically true, because M contains the generic point, this implies that also there's a K-rational point. And now once you have a K-rational point, you play a game, passing to time. Points you play a game passing to towers and doing a limit argument, which is standard, already occurred in the Neuke-Vicida proof, basically. This proves the theory. And it's just this elegant trick of looking at this field, which happens to have the same theory as the base field, and using the tautological point to verify that there has to be points. In Germany, we would say it's in Hausenbreich. It's a very technical. It's a fairy tale where you're in a swamp and you save yourself by taking a tail and you're pulling yourself out. I was a famous liar, right? But he told these kind of stories. And this reminds me of this. But it's great. I think it's a gem of the theory. Okay, when did I start and when should I stop? These are different questions. Second? Different questions. Second? There's that bell that rings. Okay, the bell hasn't run yet. Yeah, I mean, the schedule says 9 to 10. Okay, so now I reached paragraph 3, which says further developments. And here I meant to tell you how the theory has ramified after these classic results. And I already mentioned that people study characteristic p-phenomena even of algebraic closed fields. Closed fields. I haven't told you that by rational theory of encouraging zero, so reconstructing a field from the function field has been a field of active research for function fields also of algebraic closed fields. The names of Bogo, Molov, and Chinkle have to be added here. And I think it's a theorem for dimension at least four. So dimension two. So, dimension two is a bit of doubt, and dimension one certainly doesn't work because if you're a curve of organ algebraic closed fields and you look at the Gamma group of the function field, then this will be a profinite free group of cardinality, I think the cardinality of the field, so there's nothing to gain from. But as soon as actual geometry occurs for surfaces and higher dimensions, you can actually cook up the field depth. Then there are versions where you Versions where you try to get rid of using the full invariant and pass to smaller chunks. So, so-called minimalistic approaches where, so here I told you already geometric OP is enough, this is one direction, but the result by Koenigsborn here, as Martin also mentioned in his lightning talk, has been generalized to cases where you only I think have the two-step new potent part of the stellar groups by Florian. Scalar groups by Floria. And yeah, this is also the place where I should again advertise Martin's result that this is birational, and we clearly want to have the same statement for the full periodic curve. And so Martin did in his thesis an intermediate step where we sort of take something where we've localized that a huge set of points, but there are infinitely many which remain, hardly too many, I think. And then various versions of that. And then various versions of this, and managed to prove the section conjecture there. Then, certainly an important topic is the question what happens in higher dimensions. And in higher dimensions, I think it will be natural to do two things. You should replace the fundamental group by Group by the full eta homotopy type. And because this is more in the spirit of what the topologists tell us, right? So you want to have an isomorphism of geometries. And in topology, you would use the full homotopy term. And then it'll be a white statement that the algebraic invariant captures at least morphisms in the homotopy theory. So with Alexander Schmidt. We managed 2015 to show that if k is a field over Q finally generated, and X over K and Y over K are smooth varieties which embed into a product of hyperbolic curves. So, this is not a closer open immersion. Not a closed or open immersion, this is just in a locally closed immersion. Then if you take isomorphisms over k from x to y, you get a map by this functor to isomorphisms in the homotopy category of pro-symptischial sets over, and this is the point where Europe. This is the point where your question, this is now of the homotopy type of spec K, and this is something like V K. And now you get maps between et al here and et al there. And we didn't manage to prove that this is a bijection, but we could prove that this actually has a retraction, which is good enough for a weak statement. If the etyel homotopy types of these kind of varieties is isomorphic over Is isomorphic over big alk, then actually the variety is isomorphic. And if you apply this to the natural candidates, which again are k by 1s, so these are the strictly hyperbolic RT neighborhoods. So you have an iterative vibration where each fiber vibration has a compact. Fibration has a compactification into a proper smooth curve where the boundary divisor is relative fine with tall and the whole thing has the merics of being hyperbolic. Then these are k by 1 spaces and then actually the retraction is injective and therefore this is a bijection. And this proves that an Anabelian statement in the isom form for higher dimensional varieties. And now finally the reason why I left this, because it The reason why I left this because it also positive answer gives a positive answer to this question here. So I should mention here that Yoshio Hoshi has later extended this to cases where the field is also allowed to be again subpiadic. So our result sort of used techniques from Tombagavo or final type fields and he mingled in these kind of results. These kinds of results. Okay, I have still lots more things to say, but in your time and your patience, I think I better stop and thank you for your attention. First, in this you're going to have the telehomotopic type. Then I guess natural to think about the space of match between If you're taking a space here, you want a space there, and since you're in the homotopy business, the best you can expect that this is a homotopy equivalent. You can expect that this is a homotopy equivalence between the spaces. And so I would claim that the homotopy type we get here is kind of rather discrete. It's just a finite set of points. Because these sets are finite. Is that like the lost opportunity business? Is that how we think about it? Well, in the yoga of it, of course, right? But of course, proof techniques don't care much. Philosophically speaking. Philosophically speaking. Philosophically speaking, yeah, yeah, but I'm not a philosopher, so. The other question: so if you just take an absolute pro-finite proof of properties, are there cases where you can prove that the functor automorphism is representable? Good question. Uh I have no idea. Very good question. But this uh theorem of matrix key you said that it works also for generalized subfit pay addicts? Yeah, yeah. What what is what does it mean? So I think uh this means that uh you replace this QP by the uh By field corresponding to the wid vectors of FP bar. Sort of kills a lot of arithmetic. I think that's really interesting, these kind of developments, because that's towards the question of how much arithmetic is actually necessary in order to have an an abelian statement. So the initial idea of Grotendig was a finite type over Q, and we now know. And we now know that there are an abelian phenomena and positive characteristic even of algebraic closed fields. And something in between is also possible, but it's not exactly clear what. Just give a summary of what you didn't have done. Well, there was this neat proof that if you have an abelian geometry for hyperbolic curves, then actually the Galois group of your base field has to be an abelian, so center-free. That's very easy. Take an element of your Galois group. If it's not the identity, then there's an element called a J for some reason that sigma of J is different from sigma, from J. Now we take the elliptic curve with J in Now you take the elliptic curve with J invert J. You remove zero and you look at the base change with this element of that curve. So you twist it so that it becomes an elliptic curve of J invariant sigma of J. By construction, the two hyperbolic curves are not isomorphic. But since the base change is by conjugation on the absolute Gao group, this is the base change by identity on the hyperbolic. Change by identity on the pi1 side. So, as pi1 extensions, they're isomorphic. If you have an abelian geometry, then there is an isomorphism on the underlying curves, which shows that the J invariants are the same, contradiction. Okay? So, in some sense, over finite fields, you shouldn't have enabled geometry for alcoholic curves. Oops, I like the theorem. This is because that's an absolute statement and not relative over a base field. Okay, and I plan to. Okay, and I plan to also tell you a lot of things about the section conjecture which happened recently. In particular, I have a recent preprint with Alexander Betts where we use monodromy techniques, as in your talk. And to sort of reverse history, initially I think Rotenby thought of an geometry, of another program, another approach to the Model conjecture. And now we're using Lawrence Menkert's proof of the Model conjecture to adapt it to. Conjecture to adapt it to the anibelian situation to show that the theorem is take K, a number field, no CM subfield, and X over K is a smooth proper genus at least two curve, so hyperbolic. And then the image. Then the image of the set of Selma sections, those are the Galois sections of the fundamental group exact sequence, which, when restricted to a decomposition group, actually come from a point. So in the search for rational points, we are used to doing a local global approach. And I think it's also reasonable to do this in the section conjecture. So you assume that locally already you know that you come from a point, and you only want to know whether this interpolates a global. To know whether this interpolates a global point. So the image of seller sections inside the local points for any finite place, this image is in fact finite. And this is sort of the first uniform finiteness statement in the second conjecture. It's not the finiteness of the set of sections itself, but at least if you look at the V-addec component that they can have, that's among. Half that's among a finite set. Essentially, it uses the machinery of Lawrence Eckertesh and applies it to sections. And also, because we are making no request on this place V to be a place of good reduction of anything, we have to extend the Lorenz-Lengertesh machine to the case where we have bad reduction. Thank you for this nice question. Nice question, giving the opportunity to yeah. Ah, hi Florian, good to have you in the audience. So concerning this, the last assertion, yes, can you can on the out there? So you say it is finite. Do you know that it is bounded? You mean uniformly bounded regardless of no, we can't say this. Yeah, yeah, you're right. This is a natural question. I have a second question. Once upon a time, actually Bokanschik said something about this. Is there any progress? Is there any progress? Should one be the intersection injection, the intersectional injection and eventually overlap for our hyperbolic varieties? Yeah, so of course I remember that we have drawn Yeah, so of course I remember that we have a joint paper on this and it's a frame paper for sure.
