Interrupt me any time in case something is not clear. Well, first of all, what is a causal Fermi system? And well, it's an approach to fundamental physics, which involves a novel mathematical model of space-time, and the physical equations are formulated in these generalized space-times. And then, as we shall see. And then, as we shall see, there are different limiting cases. First of all, the so-called continuum limit, in which one gets the quantized fermion fields interacting via classical bosonic fields. And then there's the quantum field theory limit, where one gets real interaction of quantized fermionic and bosonic fields. So, this last point is ongoing work, and I will tell you more towards the end of the talk. End of the talk. Okay, I should say at the beginning, unfortunately, in 40 minutes, it's not possible to give a systematic and detailed introduction to causal Fermi systems. And therefore, there are different ways to proceed. One way is to explain a little bit how it all developed, how the objects and the causal action principle came up. Or the other possibility is to jump right into the mathematical structures, giving show you the general definitions. Show you the general definitions and all of that. And I thought that it's best here to take a mix of these two approaches. So this means I will briefly tell you what the starting point is. I will show you a few general ideas. Then I will give you a motivating example. And after that, we will hopefully be ready to enter the general mathematical setup. Setup. Okay, how did causal ferment systems develop? And again, I wanted to point out again, I mean, I hope that this is the best way to proceed. And but in case something is unclear, as I said, please interrupt me anytime. Well, first of all, how did causal ferment systems develop? And this started when I was a young student. You see, it's more than 30 years old, this whole approach. And at the time, I was a student. Was a student taking a relativistic quantum mechanics course, and we learned about the Dirac theory and Dirac's hole theory. Of course, you're all familiar with all of this. So the idea is that the vacuum is not just empty space, but one has a whole sea of Dirac particles, all of negative energy. So this Dirac C is filled. And this also explains pair creation because you can take a state from the negative. You can take a state from the negative energy solution and bring it into a positive energy state. And then we were told right away: well, there are problems with this naive Dirac C picture because the C has an infinite charge density, it has an infinite negative energy density, so therefore this does not really make sense. And we were then told that one should better forget about the Dirac C. The Dirac C. It's not really needed in the modern description of quantum field theory. And the way to think of this is that the Dirac C in the vacuum is not visible due to symmetry. So it's like in a Dirac C is in a homogeneous isotropic configuration, and therefore the contributions by all these Dirac particles forming the C drops out. And in fact, also this point of view is also. Point of view is also implemented in the whole formalism of quantum field theory. As you probably know, well, there's this reinterpretation of this creation annihilation operators of the C, or in more mathematical terms, one performs a wick ordering. And in this way, one gets a Hamiltonian, which is bounded from below. But at least at the time, I was not convinced by this procedure because I've thought that, well, the inter- I've thought that, well, the interacting Dirac C should be visible. This is suppose you take the Dirac equation in a classical external potential. Then, this is no longer a homogeneous and isotropic configuration. So why should the effect of all these Dirac particles cancel out? Also, it seemed to me that pair creation is an evidence that the Diraxy is real. I mean, if there's no Diraxy, how can you then create a hole in the Diraxy? And at the time, I took all this quite seriously. And at the time, I took all this quite seriously, and I was not willing to, whatever, hide all these problems in the mathematical formalism. And instead, I was thinking about: well, what is the way out of this problem? And so my sorry. So my way out of what I had in mind was that one should really take the states of a diracy seriously. One needs to take them into account in the whole form. To take them into account in the whole formalism, one has to carry them along in the whole analysis. But then, of course, there's a problem of the naive diracy, how to avoid that. And then Pierre took a quite radical point of view or opinion, namely that one should formulate new type, a new type of equations. So the physical equations should be formulated in a different way, in such a way that these divergences no longer appear. No longer appear. And in general terms, the idea was to formulate a variational principle directly for the family of all wave functions. So the intuitive picture is that when you minimize this action, then all these wave functions, they organize themselves, they interact with each other. And the minimizing configuration should be precisely that, where all these wave functions. That, where all these wave functions form the completely filled Dirac C. Now, if you have an interacting situation, and of course, everything gets more complicated, and then as a result of this interaction of all the wave functions, these wave functions should get into a configuration where they all satisfy the Dirac equation, say the one-particle Dirac equation with a certain classical potential inside. Potential inside. And this should serve as a definition of the electromagnetic potential. So the electromagnetic potential should not be the input or the starting point, but it should be just a device in order to describe the collective behavior of all these wave functions. Okay, so this was kind of the starting point. And while I can't follow the whole path which led me to the causal action principle and the causal Fermi systems, instead I want to now Instead, I want to now show you this motivating example. And I want to pick up a sentence which we had on the previous slide: namely, I wanted to formulate a variational principle directly for a family of wave functions. The question is, how can this be done? And let me explain this in a simple example, simplified, oversimplified example. Maybe we just take a two-dimensional discrete space-time, so one space, one time. So, one space, one time dimension. Suppose we can take a lattice, for example, with a certain lattice spacing. Well, in this space-time, we want to now formulate this variational principle, this action principle. And in fact, we do not want to make use of the nearest neighbor relation and the lattice spacing, because the idea is more that space-time itself should come up or come out of this minimization process. So, we don't want to start with certain. Want to start with certain space-time structures from the beginning. Therefore, it's better and it's also simpler that we forget about lettuce spacing and nearest neighbor relation right away that we work with space-time simply as having this discrete set of points. Okay, now we want to set up a variation principle for wave functions. Now, what is a wave function here? We simply take a finite number of functions. Number of functions defined on this discrete space-time on this finite number of space-time points mapping to the complex number. So we have now something like a complex valued wave functions on this discrete space-time. Now we introduce a scalar product just abstractly on these wave functions. And suppose we author normalize them, and then we have an f-dimensional Hilbert space, finite-dimensional. Hilbert space, finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Now, an important object for what follows is the so-called local correlation operator. And what this is can be understood most easily in our orthonormal basis. Namely, what we do is we evaluate the wave functions at a given space-time point labeled by Tnx. Well, and then we take two of such wave functions and simply multiply them together. simply multiply them together so one of them complex conjugated so this is something like a scalar product at a given lattice point of these two wave functions well and then the diagonal entries of the resulting matrix are simply the densities of all of these wave functions and if j is not equal to k this tells us about correlations of these wave functions again at this given lattice point so this is now a matrix and So, this is now a matrix, an F cross F matrix. It can also be introduced abstractly as a linear operator on the Hilbert space in the following way. So, the way to understand this, so we have like a scalar product on the right side or an inner product on the right side, and then we represent this with respect to the Hilbert space scalar product. And then an operator comes up here, like a signature operator, and this is what the local correlation operator is. Now, this is just from the construction. It's a Hermitian matrix, and also it has rank at most one and is positive semi-definite. This can be seen most easily that this local correlation operator can be written in the form E star E, where E is simply the operator which evaluates the wave function at a given lattice point. Okay, so now what do we have now? Suppose now we denote. Have now, suppose now we denote the space of all permission positive semi-definite operators of rank one by curly F, then to every point of our discrete space-time, we can associate a corresponding operator, namely the corresponding local correlation operator. Excuse me. So this gives us a mapping from space-time into this set curly F. This set curly f and now the idea is the following: we want to disregard all the objects on the left. In particular, we do not want to use nearest neighbor relations, lattice spacing and all of that. Instead, we want to work exclusively with the objects on the right. So, we only want to work with these local correlation operators. Good. And then now we want to set up a variational principle. How can this be done? Well, the nice thing is we only have very Only have very few objects. I mean, we only have this finite number of linear operators or these local correlation operators. But now we can also multiply them together. And if we take a product of two, this tells us about the correlations of wave functions at different space-time points. And one can, for example, take the trace and take square sum over all space-time points, and then you get like a non-negative functional, and then you can do. Negative functional, and then you can do you can minimize this, for example, under certain constraints. Okay, so this is how it works in principle. This variation in principle is in fact too simple, so it doesn't have nice features, but the whole setup here is already quite similar to that of causal Fermi systems. And therefore, let me now move on to the general definition of causal Fermi systems. And I hope that it will be understandable now after the preparations. After the preparations, what all this is about. So now we can be the starting point: we take a Hilbert space, similar to this finite dimensional Hilbert space we had earlier. Then we are given a parameter n, the so-called spin dimension. Then we consider the set of all linear operators on this Hilbert space, which are self-adjoint, have finite rank, and have at most n positive and also. At most n positive and also at most n negative eigenvalues, if we count multiplicities. So, this is similar to this set curly F which we had in our example before. Now it has a bit different structure because of this positive and negative eigenvalues. And I will explain you soon what this means and how this comes about. And finally, we introduce a measure on curly F. So measure here is meant as an integration measure. Is meant as an integration measure. This is something we can integrate over. And the idea is: well, instead of summing over space-time points, as we did here, it's better to work with integrals. And for integrals, one needs a measure. So this is the basic object. Well, of course, this is quite abstract. So therefore, I think it's probably best to give you another. Sorry, there's one more thing before I give you the example. Let me know how does the real variational principle look like? So what is the causal? Principle looks like. So, what is the causal action principle? This works as follows. So, suppose we take two linear operators in curly F. So, these are two symmetric operators of finite rank. Then we can multiply them together. Then we get a new operator which has again rank at most 2n, but which is no longer symmetric or self-adjoint. I mean, if you take the adjoint of this operator product, then the two factors change, so are interchanged. So, are interchanged, and well, in general, these operators won't commute, so therefore, x times y star is not the same as x times y anymore. And as a consequence, this operator will now have complex eigenvalues, but at most 2n of these eigenvalues are non-zero, and this is what are called a non-trivial eigenvalue. So, we get 2n complex numbers in this way, and now we can follow. And now we can form the Lagrangian and the causal action as follows. So we take the absolute values of these complex numbers, take their differences, square it, sum over all the eigenvalues, and then it's a certain normalization constant. So this is the Lagrangian. This is now a non-negative number, which always depends on pairs of space-time points, on x and y. Well, and then we have this measure. Well, and then we have this measure ρ. So, this means now we integrate both x and y with respect to this measure, and then we get a non-negative number, which might be infinite. This is the causal action. And now we can minimize this action under variations of the measure rho under suitable constraints. Well, and these constraints are needed in order to get something which is mathematically well posed, you get non-trivial minimum. Well, pose, you get non-trivial minimizers, and in fact, for the remainder of the talk, these constraints won't be important. So, therefore, it is maybe best if I don't spend too much time on them. Okay, so this is the causal action principle. And now let me give you a concrete example, which is also close to the physical applications: namely, how can one describe Minkowski space or say Lorentzian space-time if you want to do this in curved space? You want to consider curved space. Space, we want to consider curved space-time. How can this be described by a causal Fermi system? And this view works as follows. It's in fact quite similar to the example, to the model example we started with, except of course that we now have wave functions on our manifold. So we denote the Mgs in our Lorentzian manifold. It's a spin manifold. So we introduced the spinner bundle, which means that the fibers are now four-dimensional. Fibers are now four-dimensional complex vector spaces, which are endowed with an inner product of signature 2,2. So, this is the usual inner product on Dirac spinners in space-time at every space-time point. So, this is what we noted here like this, and denoted by spin scalar product. Well, and then there's, of course, the Dirac equation. Okay, and having these structures, one can also, first of all, the Cauchy problem is well posed, so one can. The problem is well posed. So, one can start with initial data and construct the corresponding solution of the Dirac equation. And in particular, one has a nice base of solutions, say spatially compact, smooth solutions. And on those, one can introduce a scalar product by integrating over a cushy surface. So, this is the usual scalar product on dirug spinners where you just integrate over space. So, the integrand here comes from the probability. Here comes the probability density of a Dirac equation. Well, and then one takes the completion and gets the Hilbert space. So, this is the usual solution space of a Dirac equation. Well, here in curved space-time. And now we choose a subspace of this Hilbert space. This is now what is H. They say for simplicity of presentation finite dimensional. And once we have done this, we are back in the setting of our. Setting of our model example, maybe we can now again introduce the local correlation operator. We are on the right. So, in other words, we represent the spin inner product with respect to the Hilbert space scalar product. And taking into account that the signature here is 2, 2, these operators have rank at most 4 and have at most two positive and at most two negative eigenvalues. I should say if we have an infinite number of wave functions, Number of wave functions, then it may be necessary, and in fact, in most applications, it is really important to introduce a regularization. So, here we have something like a modifier. So, it maps the wave functions to, say, continuous wave functions, and then one forms the local correlation operators after regularizing. And here, there comes a certain length scale comes into play, which you can think of as the Planck scale. Play which you can think of as the Planck scale, just a microscopic length scale. Okay. And now, again, it's similar to our example earlier. We introduced curly F as the set of all linear operators which are self-adjoint, finite rank, and now have at most two positive and two negative eigenvalues. And then we get a mapping from our space-time, from our Lorentzian space-time into curves. Into curly f. So, to every space-time point, we associate the corresponding local correlation operator. And the final step now is to take the so-called push-forward measure. So, we take, we introduce a measure on curly F, which is defined as follows. Suppose we want to measure the volume, say, of a subset omega here. Then we take its pre-image, which gives us a subset of the Lorentzian space-time, and then we just take the U. Space-time, and then we just take the usual space-time volume of this subset. So, in this way, we get a measure here on the right side, and then again, we forget about the left side. We want to work only with the objects on the right. And this gives us now a causal Fermil system of spin dimension two, because we have at most two positive, at most two negative eigenvalues. So, this is how this construction works. And well, it gives us, brings us into a certain It gives us brings us into a certain mathematical framework, and the nice thing is that also the causal action principle is formulated in this framework. And moreover, space-time and all the structures therein can be recovered from this framework. And before explaining this a little bit, let me make a few general remarks just to make clear what I'm doing here. So the nice thing is that we end up with one basic object, namely this. Basic object, namely this measure rho, which is a measure on a set of linear operators of Hill space. So, therefore, this measure describes everything. So, all space-time structures, wave functions, and so on. And the underlying structure is that we have a family of fermionic wave functions because then we put these local correlation operators and all of that. So, the measure rho was constructed out of this family of wave functions. Functions and the geometry is also encoded in all these wave functions. So, in the slogan, you could say matter encodes geometry. You could say, Well, this is what we call as quantum space-time. I also wanted to point out that this causal action principle describes space-time as a whole. So, you minimize a functional on space-time as a whole. This is a bit similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action in GR. And this causal action principle is a non-linear variational principle, again, similar to Principle, again similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action. And then you might ask: well, well, how does the linear dynamics of quantum theory come up? So, what about the superposition principle? And in fact, this linear dynamics comes up in a certain limiting case, which I will explain later. Okay. Good. Maybe just to give you some kind of better physical intuition, intuition, how Intuition, how can one think of all of this? Of course, as usual, I mean, this interpretation is more a way of rephrasing the mathematical structures in a more understandable or more intuitive way. And there are different ways to do this. One way is to understand the operators in curly F as possible events. I mean, this is kind of the local correlation operators which could happen. Be could happen, you could say these are possible events. Well, and then there are the operators which are in the support of my measure. So these are operators in space-time. These are the events which are realized in space-time. And space-time itself is made up of all the realized events, and the physical equations relate all these events to each other. So, this is at least one way of thinking about this. Way of thinking about this. In fact, if one looks at this on a more technical level, there is quite a nice connection to Joe Freulich's ETH approach, events trees histories approach, to quantum theory. And if you want to see this, you could look up. We worked this out in a paper. Okay, but now let me explain a bit more what I mentioned earlier. I said, well, you caused a Fermi system, the measure rho is the basic object, all the other structures are derived from it. Are derived from it, how does this work? Let me explain this only schematically. I mean, I don't have too much time, of course. To this end, let's just start abstractly with the causal Fermi system of spin dimension n. We introduce space-time as the support of the measure. So all the points where the measure is non-zero in simple terms. And if this is done like this, well, then the points, the space-time points where they are linear operators, and this is kind of important. And this is kind of important because this is what gives space-time a lot of additional structure. For example, if you take a space-time point, you can compute the consider the eigenspaces of this operator, or you can take two space-time points, multiply these operators together, compute the eigenvalues, and so on. And if one does all this in the correct way, then one really gets quantum objects, spinners, wave functions, one gets geometric structures, connection curvature. Geometric structures, connection curvature, one is a causal structure, one has analytic structures, and all basically all one needs for doing physics. And just to give you an impression, I mean, we can't do all of this. In this setting, spinners come up naturally. Nami, how does this work? Suppose now we take a space-time point. So then this is an operator, and this operator has rank at most 2n. So, therefore, if we take the image of this operator, this is a subspace of the Hilbert space of dimension at most 2n. And this is what we denote by Sxm, just a suggestive notation. So this is our spinner space or spin space. And on this space, one also has a natural inner product. Namely, one takes the scalar product, but it turns out to be very useful to also put the space-time. Also, put the space-time point operator inside as a signature operator. So, this gives me an indefinite inner product of signature at most to n, at most n, at most n. Okay, so this means the picture we have, we have a big Hilbert space, so the underlying Hilbert space H, and then to every space-time point, we associate a subspace of this Hilbert space. Okay, and next we want to represent the vectors of the Hilbert space. Apparently, these are just abstract vectors in terms of wave functions in space-time. How can this be done? So suppose we take a vector in our Hilbert space u, and now we want to associate to it the wave function, corresponding wave function denoted by psi u at the space-time point x. Well, what we do is we Well, what we do is we simply take the vector u and we take the orthogonal projection to the spin space. And then we have a corresponding vector in the spin space. And we can do this at every space-time point. And this way, we really get a kind of wave function, spinorial wave function in space-time. Okay, there's maybe one more object I wanted to point out without entering details. Now we have now this physical wave function for each vector on the Hill. Function for each vector in the Hilbert space. One can also consider a corresponding kernel and sum over basis, orthonormal basis. This is the so-called kernel of the fermionic projector. And this is in fact very useful for all the computations because they make it possible to compute the Lagrangian and the causal action and all of that. And also for the geometric structures, let me see, maybe I should skip a little bit. Well, I mean, there's also a notion. Well, I mean, there's also a notion of connection and curvature. Maybe just to give you the basic idea. So, this P of XY, so this kernel of the fermionic projector is a mapping from one spin space to another spin space. So, therefore, it gives kind of a relations between space-time points. And this can be used to really construct a parallel transport and introduce a notion of curvature and all other geometric structures I would like to have. And finally, And finally, one has the causal structure. And this is kind of the most important point. Also, this is the reason why it's called causal Fermi system and causal action and all of that. If you take two space-time points, then we can multiply the operators together and compute the eigenvalues. And as I said at the beginning, these eigenvalues are in general complex, but they could also be real. So, therefore, one can make a distinction and we say that the points are spaced. And we say that the points are space-like separated if the eigenvalues are all have the same absolute value. They are time-like separated if they are all real and do not all have the same absolute value. And in all other cases, they are light-like separated. Well, it turns out that this causal structure really gives you back the causal structure of Saminkowski space if you consider certain examples from a more absolute From a more abstract point of view, one can also understand what this causality means if one looks at the structure of the causal Lagrangian. Namely, if two points are space-like separated, well, then all, just by definition here, all the eigenvalues have the same absolute value. So therefore, if you look at this Lagrangian, the Lagrangian is zero. So therefore, this is the best one can do. So the Lagrangian vanishes. And if I And if I now looked at the corresponding Oda-Lagrange equations, it turns out that they also vanish. So, this means, in other words, two points with space-like separation do not interact with each other. So, they are not connected to each other in the Euler-Lagrange equations. And this is kind of a general notion of causality, which comes up here. Okay, maybe this should be enough. I have, well, I've on the general structures, but in case you want to see what. But in case you want to see, well, what are the underlying principles? Well, somehow there's a local gauge principle built in because these spinaurial wave functions can be transformed locally. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle is built in. And there's also a kind of equivalence principle built in because, I mean, this whole setup is invariant under diffeomorphisms of space-time, because then, well, again, you get a measure, and there's a certain way this measure. And there's a certain way this measure transforms, and there's no more a priori structure here. But space-time and the causal structure are emerging. In other words, if you minimize the causal action, then the measure changes, then also its support changes, space-time changes, the causal structures change, and all of that. Okay, now I wanted to talk about limited cases because, of course, the main point of the talk is to explain you how to get the connection to quantum field theory. But maybe just Theorem. But maybe just briefly, what is the procedure here and how does this continuum limit work? Maybe this becomes clear in this diagram. Well, on one side, we have this abstract framework of causal fermion system. We have quantum geometric structures, the causal action, and all of that. And then in a certain limiting case, we want to get a description like in the usual physical description. So we want to have Dirac fields, you want to have gauge fields. Fields, you want to have gauge fields, gravitational field. And the setting we end up with is second quantized fermions and classical bosonic fields. And the point is that this causal action principle really then gives rise to corresponding field equations. So the field equations like Maxwell-Einstein are derived from the causal action principle. And this is worked out in detail in this book. And schematically, it works as follows. Of course, I have to be very brief here. Brief here. What is the input? What is the output? I mean, the input is one has to specify what is the vacuum. So the vacuum is formed of completely filled Dirac C's, and the three parameters here are the masses of the Dirac particles. And one can also be more ambitious and describe include quarks, neutrinos, leptons, or do you want to model the standard? The standard model of particle physics, then we have to take many Dirac C's and direct sums of Dirac C's, and this is all part of the input. One also, okay, then one has to regularize this on the Planck scale, and one further input is that this regularization breaks the chiral symmetry in the neutrino, in the direct sum and describing the neutrinos. So, this is also an input. But as I said, this all is only an input. This all is only an input on how the vacuum looks like. And now one perturbs the system by introducing a general bosonic potential. This is now the classical bosonic potential. And then the question is, under which assumptions on the potential does the resulting system still satisfy the Eudelagrange equation of the causal action principle. In other words, do we still have a minimizer of the system, of the causal action? Of the causal action, and the answer is yes if this potential here has a certain structure, so this gives like the gauge groups and couplings and all of that, and if this potential satisfies the classical field equations. So, this is how you get these classical field equations. Okay, but now we want to move on to well, go beyond the classical interaction, in particular here at the conference we're interested in quantum. In particular, at the conference, we're interested in quantum field theory. How do you get what is missing, and how can this be achieved? Well, maybe one thing which is missing is, well, we have a scalar product given abstractly, but a priori, we don't have a representation of this scalar product as an integral over wave functions over hypersurface. And this is kind of crucial for the Dirac equation, for the probabilistic interpretation of the Dirac equation. Interpretation of the rock equation. Related question is: What about current conservation? Are there conservation laws in this framework? And then ultimately, we want to know, well, what is the corresponding quantum state? What are quantum probabilities? And this is what I want to explain you in the remaining, whatever, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And well, of course, I know that I can't enter details, so therefore, again, let me try to explain you the basic ideas. Basic ideas. And this construction of the quantum state appeared just recently. So, this is joint work with Nikki Cameron from McGira. So, how do we proceed? So, the starting point are we have two causal fermion systems. One without tildes, which describes the vacuum, say Minkowski space, Minkowski vacuum, which is built up of these Dirac Cs. Well, and then we have a second space-time denoted with tildes. Time denoted with tildes, which can be very general, can be interacting. We don't really know much about it. Then we have abstractly like the corresponding space-times, the support of the first measure, the support of the second measure. Now, the idea is we want to compare these two measures at a certain time t. Okay, what does compare mean? Well, there is one. mean well there is one mathematical object which can be used for this purpose and the so-called non-linear surface layer interval. Let me explain this in simple terms. I mean what does it first of all what does it mean to specify a time t? So this the way this is done is that we introduce a set omega t or omega tilde t, which is always the past of this time. So like all the points So, like all the points in the past of this Cushy surface, say. Well, and then the complement is the future. In other words, like we decompose the spacetime into the past and the future, and then we always integrate over these space-time, over these regions of space-time, and they are connected to each other by the Lagrange. And we always integrate once over the interacting space-time, like here, and once over the non-interacting, the vacuum space-time. So, you're interacting. Vacuum space-time. So, you're interacting vacuum, interacting vacuum, and always also once over the past and once over the future. So, this means this is how it looks like schematically. Well, and this is a way to kind of get information. How do these measures compare to each other at a given time t? Okay, now there's a general shortcoming of General shortcoming or problem here, namely, a priori, these two causal Fermi systems they live on different Hilbert spaces. So this means how should this L of X Y make sense? I mean, the first thing one has to do, one has to identify these two Hilbert space with the unitary operator. But this unitary operator is not uniquely determined. So this means there is a huge freedom to unitarily transform. Freedom to unitarily transform one measure relative to the other. How can one deal with this freedom? Well, the way to do it is to integrate over all these unitary operators. So this means we have to take the unitary group or compact subgroup thereof and then integrate over the group with respect to the Haar measure, say. Okay, and this already leads us to this partition function. leads us to this partition function, so the so-called partition function. So we integrate here over the unitary group, then we have here the exponential of, and this is this non-linear surface layer integral. And this, well, this is in fact really the only way I see that one can really kind of compare the two measures. So somehow just from general considerations, one ends up with expressions of this structure. Okay. Okay, and now we want to get more information on the interacting space-time. Well, and the best way to do it is to kind of probe the interacting space-time using the objects of the vacuum space-time. Because the vacuum space-time is well understood, we know there are free fields, we have wave functions, we have all the familiar structures. And now we want to describe the interacting space-times also in terms of these structures. Also, in terms of these structures. And to this end, we put here insertions into the integral here. So this dot, dot, dot are now objects in the vacuum space-time. But since here the rho tilde comes up, this gives us information really on the interacting space-time, but in the language of the vacuum space-time. Okay, so this has some analogy to the path interval. So, this has some analogy to the path integral formalism, but this is more formal analogy. Because what we integrate over here is not field configurations, but it's unitary operators which just take care of this freedom of identifying the two causal fermion systems. Good. So, now the next step is: how do these insertions here look like? Okay, Felix, you have five minutes. Five minutes. Five minutes. Five minutes. Okay, fine. Then sure. And I know that I'm getting to the limit of what one can really explain in 40 minutes. So, but therefore, let me just be brief here. What is the idea? So the point is that one has, a quarter-fermil system has many more structures, which I haven't talked about yet. Namely, one can introduce like linear fields, and one also has concerns. And one also has conserved quantities, so there's something like current conservation and things like that. Okay, maybe there's no point in explaining this. Well, maybe first of all, these linearized field equation is also some kind of causal propagation speed which one has, which I also won't have time to enter here. This is now again a surface layer integral, but in one space-time. So we always integrate one variable over the path. integrate one variable over the past and one the other variable over the over the future well in this dot dot dot these are certain variational derivatives acting on the lagoon and then there are conservation laws so there's really something analogate of dirac current conservation or there's a symplectic form and all of this can now be used to introduce kind of the familiar objects in the vacuum space. In the vacuum space-time, one has linearized fields, one has a scalar product, one has a symplectic form, one has a polarization and all of that. One has a complex structure on the bosonic fields. And using this, one can also introduce operator algebras in the vacuum space-time. So I just wrote right here the usual commutation and anti-commutation relations, and on the right side. Relations and on the right side, or here these inner products here. So these are the kind of the structures from the coming from the causal ferment system. Okay, now this, as I said, so this is now done in the vacuum. So in other words, one has the usual objects of a free field theory, both bosonic and fermionic. And all these operators generate an algebra, A, which you can think of as the algebra of observables. Algebra of observables. Okay, now what is the quantum state? Well, the quantum state is a mapping, abstractly speaking, from the observable algebra into the complex numbers, which should be positive. I mean, in case you are not so familiar with this algebraic formulation, you can also think of this state omega t as simply the trace of the observables multiplied with a density operator. With a density operator, or to make it even simpler, as the expectation value of a Fox state. In fact, like all these different formulations. I mean, this is the most general formulation here. And now, in order to get this state, what we need to do, so we need to make precise what we mean here. Omega t applied to an operator of the algebra should be now such an integral which we had earlier. Now we have to determine. Which we had earlier. Now we have to determine here certain insertions. And here on the right side, this is all on the caudal Fermi system side. So here we have to specify certain surface layer intervals formed of linearized solutions in the vacuum. And well, maybe there's no point in explaining this in detail, but what I want to point say again here, so these are kind of these surface layer integrals, the non-linear surface layer integrals. Non-linear surface layer integrals, and they involve here the linearized fields, which also come up here on the left side in these operator algebra. So, in this way, to such an operator, one can associate a complex number. And this is what the state is. And the state is, in fact, positive. One can also form, represent this state. Well, could get a whatever Fock representation or a general GNS. Representation or general GNS representations. What is really like in the whole one has the whole machinery, the language of quantum field theory to one's disposal. Well, let me now give an outlook. So where are we now? What remains to be done? First of all, I mean, this definition of the state is quite abstract. The question is, well, what is it? I mean, is it really what we would like to have? And to this end, one has to compute these group integrals in more detail. Group integrals in more detail and in a certain limiting case. And it turns out what one needs to do is one needs to let the dimension of the Hilbert space tend to infinity and also let the regularization length, say the Planck lengths, tend to zero. And it turns out that in this limiting case, it is in fact possible to compute all these group integrals quite explicitly. And it turns out that this also makes it possible to describe general. It makes it possible to describe general entangled states. And we know quite, I want to understand quite explicitly what does it mean that this measure rho tilde describes an entangled state. So this is quite clear right now. This is ongoing work with Nikki Cameron and Moritz Reint, yes. And well, what else needs to be done? What is what we are also working on again with oops, sorry, again with Nikki Kamer and Moritz Reinteus is what is the dynamics of Is what is the dynamics of the quantum state? I mean, so far we can introduce this quantum state at any time t. The question is: well, what is the time evolution of this quantum state? So we would like to have, say, unitary time evolution on Fox spaces. Is this really possible? Does one get this? And the answer is yes. And well, I mean, why is it unitary? I mean, this has to do with all these conservation laws. This has to do with all these conservation laws. I mean, the fact that we have these conservation laws of the causal Fermi system enforces the unitary, the unitary time evolution, the time evolution to be unitary. So the scalar product on the Fox space is preserved. And also in this limiting case, one really gets like a linear time evolution, but there are tiny corrections. And this is also something we want to understand better, namely, we hope. Better, namely, we hope that these non-linear corrections might explain or be able to explain collapse phenomena. But of course, this is all ongoing work and time is out. So let me just thank you for your attention. And also, I should point out, so we have like a web platform where you can see more details, also links to videos and all of this. So thank you very much. Thank you very much, Felix, for the nice talk. So let's thank those. Yeah, we have time for one question or maybe two quick questions. Okay, this is Robert. Just a quick question. So relating to the motivation in some sense, do you see that a certain parallel to Ellen Kohn's program of non-committee? Ellen Kahn's program of non-commutative geometry in the sense that so there you start if you start with some manifold, spin manifold, you can extract a spectral triple. And then on the other hand, you can go back from a spectral triple to reconstruct a manifold. And of course, then you generalize this to the non-commutative case and you take the spectral triple as the defining. Spectral triple as the defining object, so that there seems to be a parallel to the causal fermion systems. Is that would you agree with that? Of course, yes, there's some analogy in kind of the general procedure. I mean, in this non-commutative geometry, one also wants to no longer work with space-time points. Instead, one rephrases this in terms of operator algebras, and then one can recover space-time. Then one can recover space-time at a later point, and one can also generalize space-time structures. I mean, so up to there, the procedure is kind of similar. However, then the details are quite different. In particular, in the approach here, kind of the Dirac operator, which is kind of central in non-commutative geometry, does not play this, is no longer the central object. Instead, it's these wave functions, so this family of wave functions and then. Of wave functions and then the corresponding measure which they give rise to. So, this is really the basic object. And then the analytic core is the cause action principle, which tells us how these wave functions organize or how they interact with each other, but there's no reference to a Dirac operator anymore. I should also say, well, other major differences that here everything is done right away in the Lorentzian setting. I mean, this was the starting point. Right from the very beginning, I worked in Spain. Right from the very beginning, I work in space-time always, and this causal action principle is, of course, designed such to get an action principle in space-time. There's this causal structure, causal cones, and so on, which come up. In non-commutative geometry, on the other hand, everything is done in the elliptic settings, say on a Riemannian manifold. And this is also crucial because otherwise the spectral action principle is not well defined. Of course, there are also approaches in Lorentz. There are also approaches in Lorentzian non-commutative geometry, but there are some problems, and this is not well, this hasn't been worked out to a to a not well, there are not many people working on this because there are some problems. But therefore, well, I mean, I don't want to comment on these problems or not problems, but I mean, the general idea is like, you know, community Germany, one starts in the Riemannian setting and then later tries to extend this to the Lorentzian case, whereas here it is Lorentzian right from the beginning, and therefore one is closer to Causen. And therefore, one is closer to causality and space-time structures and all of that. I should also say: I mean, I don't see a connection between the causal action principle and the spectral action principle. I mean, I was asked this quite often and also we looked into this to some extent, but there doesn't seem to be a simple way of relating the two to each other. So, therefore, really like the core of the theories is really different. Okay, thank you, Olaf, Recizen. Thank you. Olaf Rezizen. So, hi, Olaf, if you can make a very quick question because we are running out of time. Just wanted to ask the same question that I asked yesterday in the context of GBQFT, namely, so how is how are measurements and let's say classical observables, classical fermionic observables implemented in your framework? Okay, well, maybe then let me just share my screen again. And go back, let's see, go back here. I mean, somehow. So you can think of this omega. So, where was it? So, this omega, you could say this is like my state. So, if I perform a measurement, I simply compute this quantity here and this dot, dot, dot, this is my classical observable. So, mine's the observable. And this is now formed of operators, just the usual field. Just the usual field operator, so to speak, in Minkowski space. So here you have a clear prescription: what are expectation values of measurements and all of that. And one should keep in mind, I mean, this is done at a fixed time. So therefore, this measurement, well, also this state here doesn't need to have nice transformation behavior under Lorentz transformations and all of that. I mean, there's no reason why it should. There's no reason why it should be like that. So, I mean, here I have to like distinguish fixed-time hypersurface, and then I can compute the I can define the state and I can compute expectation values. And when I should say, well, classical fermionic, I don't quite know, Olaf, what you mean by that. But I mean, one has here like both bosonic and fermionic field operators, and then you can take expectation. Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay, thanks. Okay, thank you very much. Let's thank the speaker again.
