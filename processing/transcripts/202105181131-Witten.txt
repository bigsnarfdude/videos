Thanks, Meena, and thanks for the invitation to give this talk to all the organizers. So I wish I had exciting new results on covanophomology, but I don't. So I'm going to be at the end I'll update a couple of things, but mostly I'll be telling you about things that are a little bit older. So I'll be talking about the Jones polynomial of a knot and its refinement known as Covanohomology. The first to make a physics-based proposal for Covanohomology were Gukov, Waffa, and Schwartz in 2004. And they suggested that vector spaces associated to knots that a few years earlier were proposed by Ugri and Waffa were related to what appears in Covano homology. I re-expressed this construction a few years later in terms of gauge theory and the counting of solutions of partial differential equations. And that's the And that's the story I'll describe today. And I've given a variety of lectures on this, several versions of which are available online. And today's lecture is closest, actually, to the last of these three. In any event, the goal is to construct invariance of a knot in R3, or more generally, a link. Or, more generally, a link. In the simplest version, the invariance will be obtained by counting with signs the solutions of an equation. The solutions will have an integer-value topological invariant p. And if a n is the number of solutions counted with signs with p equals n, then the Jones polynomial of the knot is going to be the sum of an q to the n. Now, to get Kavanov models, Now, to get Kavanaugh homology, the situation should be categorified. That means for each n, we want a complex of vector spaces whose Euler characteristic is a sub n. Now, as far as I know, you can only categorify the counting of solutions of an equation if the equation is the equation for critical points of some Morse function. At any rate, that's what categorification is going to mean in this lecture. So, our equations will be P D E's in a certain dimension. So, H will be. In a certain dimension. So h will be a Morse function that depends on functions in that dimension, the functions that appear in the PDE. And the gradient flow equation of Morse theory will be an equation in one dimension more. But let's put aside categorification for a moment and assume we were just trying to describe the Jones polynomial. Now, the equations whose solutions I claim we should count to define the general The Jones polynomial and eventually Kavan ohmology might look author if written down with no explanation of where they come from. And one approach, which actually has been my approach in various lectures, is to explain the physical setup and try to deduce from there what we should do. And I could have considered doing that today. Not everyone would find it helpful, although I'm sure some of you would in this audience. Instead, I'll take a different approach where I mode. Then I'll take a different approach where I motivate the equations from what appears in a known mathematical approach to Covanophomology, at least in its simply sincly graded version, which is symplectic Covanohomology, developed by these authors, among others. And there probably are more recent references I should be citing. So going all the way back to von Jones' original work, most approaches to the Jones polynomial define an invariant in terms of some presentation of a naught. In terms of some presentation of a knot. For example, you consider a projection to a plane, like I've actually drawn because it's hard to draw a knot without depicting it with a projection to the plane, or some other knot presentation. Then you define something that's manifestly well defined when you're given a presentation, and the magic is to show that the choice of the presentation didn't matter. That's never obvious, and that's where the magic is. And there always is some magic. Now, an approach based on counting solutions of PDEs has the opposite advantages and drawbacks. While topological invariance would be manifest, given certain generalities about elliptic PDEs and assuming compactness is under control, but it might not be clear how to calculate. Of course, the idealists have manifest three, or in the categorified case, four-dimensional symmetry together. Four-dimensional symmetry together with a method of calculation. How might we achieve this? So, the way I'll interpret this question is the following. Suppose we have a PD with the property that counting its solutions gives the Jones polynomial. What further property should that PDE? So we would have a good way to count the solutions in practice. Now, we'll adapt what's been done mathematically in many problems that involve counting of solutions of PDEs. Solutions of PDEs. So, a natural try is to stretch a knot in one direction. So, here's a highly stretched knot that's been stretched in one direction, which I've called the U direction. In other words, the stretch direction is parametrized by a real parameter U. And one wants it to be the case that except near the ends, the solutions are independent of u. Now, not every PDE is going to have that property. So I haven't told you what the PDE is or how the knot enters the. You, what the PDE is, or how the knot enters the PDE, but there will be a PDE, and the precise conditions you want on a solution will depend on the knot. And then you want it to be true that when you stretch the knot, you get a solution that's independent of you, except near the ends. We won't get that for free, and in fact, with Kyoto, we had trouble getting it. We had to include a perturbation of the simplest version of the equation we wanted to study in order to make this true. Well, if it is true, well, whether it's true or not, but it's most useful if it is true, we define a space M of U-independent solutions. We can think of these as the solutions in the presence of infinite long strands that extend in the U direction. So we have a link, well, a non-compact link that looks like this, just a lot of parallel strands in the U direction. Whatever our equations are, we consider the U-independent solutions. Solutions. And the space of such solutions I've called curly M. Now in M we define two subspaces, L sub L and L sub R, consisting of solutions that extend over the left or over the right. For simplicity in my terminology, I'll assume a given solution extends in at most one way, but that's not really necessary. But if it's not true, it's technically more complicated. For example, a point in L sub L represents L. L The point in L sub L represents a solution in a semi-infinite situation where the strands terminate on the left but go to infinity on the right. And the point in L sub R would represent the opposite. Now, if we have a global knot with the strands that end on both ends, I keep saying not, but it could be a link. A global embedded one manifold that looks like this, where the parallel strands somehow end at both. Trains somehow end at both and are terminated at both ends. The global solutions are simply the solutions in the middle that extend over both ends. So the global solutions are intersection points of L sub L and L sub R. The integer a n that appears as a coefficient in the Jones polynomial is going to be the algebraic intersection number of L sub L and L sub R, which will be the count with sines of the solution of the global equation in the The solution of the global equation in the presence of the knot. To be more exact, a n is this intersection number where we only count intersections where the topological invariant p is equal to n. Now, in the language of intersections, categorification can happen. Well, how can categorification happen? So we have an M, and it has two sub-varieties, L sub L and L sub R. L sub L and L sub R, and we took the intersection number. We want to categorify that intersection number. Well, where has the intersection number of two sub-manifolds been categorized? That's what floor did in floor theory. So categorification can happen, and I mean here the original version of floor theory for symplectic manifolds. So categorification can happen if M is a symplectic manifold and L sub L and L sub R. And L sub L and L sub R are Lagrangian submanifolds. Then, fluoric homology, in other words, what physicists would call the A model or mathematicians would call the Foucault category of M, will give a framework for categorification. Now, from the point of view of today's lecture, the reason all this will happen is that even before we stretch the knot to reduce to intersection. We stretched the knot to reduce to intersections. The equation whose solutions we were counting are equations for critical points of some Morse function h. Physicists call it a Morse functional because it depends on fields that is infinitely many variables. But it's a Morse function in an infinite dimensional situation. It'll be an middle-dimensional Morse function in the sense of floor theory. So we'll come back to that event. So, we'll come back to that eventually and we'll categorify. Now, anyway, that's the framework we want to head for. In heading for it, well, as I said, we could have started with the physical setup, but instead of starting, and that would have been clear to a certain fraction of the audience, instead of heading, starting with the physical setup, I'll start with something else, which I hope will also be clear, at least to a fraction of the audience. So, a known version of A known approach is symplectic covant ophthalmology, which at least in a singly graded version describes covant ophthalmology in terms of floor theory for a very specific M. So a description of this M that was proposed by Kamnitzer and exploited in a mirror version by Caldust and Kamnitzer, and which was part of the guide in my work. Guide in my work is the following. M can be understood as a space of Hecki modifications. So, again, some of you probably are quite familiar with Hecki modifications and may know much more than I do, but I presume not all. So, I'm going to spend some time explaining what's meant by the phrase a space of Hecki modifications, and also very importantly, what it has to do with PDEs. So, here, C is going to be a Riemann surface. C is going to be a Riemann surface, and G for me is a compact gauge group. But when we discuss Heckey modifications, it's important to consider the complexification. So G sub C is the complexification of some compact Lie group G, and E will be a holomorphic G C bundle over C. Now, a hacking modification of E at a point P in C. There's another holomorphic G C bundle E prime over C. G C bundle E prime over C that's presented with an isomorphism to E away from P. It's not just isomorphic to. The statement isn't just that E prime and E are isomorphic away from P, but you're presented with the isomorphism. So the Hackey modification is the pair consisting of E prime and this isomorphism. So for example, what could such a Hackey modification be in a simple case? B in this simple case. Suppose that G C is C star, the complexification of U1. Then we could think of E as a holomorphic line bundle over C. A holomorphic line bundle L prime that's isomorphic to L away from P is obtained by twisting with what's called O of P to some integer power, where O of P is the line bundle whose sections are holomorphic functions, except that... Are holomorphic functions except that they're allowed to have a simple pole at p. So we modify a section of L prime is the same as a section of L, except it's allowed to have a pole of order n at p, or maybe it's required to have a zero of order minus n if n is negative. So that's what would be meant by Heckey modification in the abelian case. Now here the integer n can be thought of as a weight of the Langlands GNO dual group of C star, which is another copy. Group of C star, which is another copy of C star. So the weights of C star are integers, and here a Hacky modification at a given point is labeled by an integer. And well, an insight in different ways of Langlands and Godwin and Witzenov is that the weights that will arrive when we make these modifications are weights of a dual group. So the reason I call the Lie group here G sub C is that when we do gauge G sub C is that when we do gauge theory, the gauge group will be the compact real form, which I'll call simply G. Now, in general, for any G, there is a corresponding Language G and O dual group, which I'll denote by this simple, and I'll just call G dual, with the complexification G dual sub C, such that Hecke modifications of the holomorphic G C bundle at P occur in families classified by dominant weights or equivalently finite-dimensional representations. Or equivalently finite-dimensional representations of the dual group, or equivalently, its maximal compact subgroup, since the dominant rates or finite-dimensional representations of those two are in parallel. For example, well, let's consider what's perhaps the simplest example. Suppose that the complex Lie group is GL2C. Then we can associate to a GC bundle a rank II complex vector bundle E over C. Over C. What would be a hacky modification of such a rank two bundle? Well, I'll answer that in a second, but first I'll say that one thing that makes this example simple is that the Langlands GNO dual group is the same thing again. And well, a minimal representation of the dual group is the two-dimensional representation. And a Heckey modification dual to the two-dimensional representation is as follows. Locally, we can Locally, we can trivialize E and write it as the direct sum of two trivial line bundles O in a neighborhood of the point P where we're planning to make the Hecke modification. And then we could say that in the same local decomposition, E prime is O of P plus O. So O of P plus O is a rank II bundle that's isomorphic to E away from P with an obvious isomorphism. And that isomorphism will extend over the rest of C, even though this description didn't or might not have. So that's an example of a HECI modification of a rank II bundle of a minimal type. Minimal type means it's dual to this two-dimensional representation. The difference from the abelian case is that there's not just one hecky modification of this type of P, but a whole family of them arising from the choice of decomposition. Arising from the choice of decomposition of O of E rather as O plus O. So because of the dependence, well, what we really did here was we picked in which direction the decomposition as O plus O wasn't important. What was important was the first summands were without a pole. And so because of that dependence on the choice of that first summand, the hacky modifications of this The HECI modifications of this type at P form a family parametrized by a copy of CP1. Now, suppose we're given two endpoints on R2. Well, I'll take our Riemann surface for the moment to be the complex plane, which is the same as R2, but viewed as a complex manifold. And we're given two endpoints on which we're going to make Heckey modifications of this type of our trivial rank 2. Of our trivial rank to complex vector bundle E over C. So in this case, I've labeled six points in the plane. The space of all such Hecky modifications would be a copy of Cp1 to the 2n with one copy of CP1 at each point. However, there's a natural sub-variety M inside CP1 to the 2n, which is defined as follows. Well, let's add a point to it. Well let's add a point at infinity to compactify C to Cp1. So now we're making Heckey modifications of a trivial bundle O plus O over Cp1. Now we have this family of Heckey modifications Cp1 to the 2n but generically when we extend them over CP1 Okay, so we have this family of Heckey modifications of a trivial bundle over CP1 that makes a new bundle over CP1. That makes a new bundle over CP1. By consideration of the first churn class, you'll see that this new bundle is generic, it has first churn class 2n, because the first churn class changed by one with each HICI modification. And that means it's generically going to be the direct sum of two copies of O of N. So we can, by insisting that it has the generic behavior, we get a sub-manifold of this thing. Of this thing. So, or what I wrote described here slightly differently. We can twist back to zero first turn class by twisting E prime by O of minus n times the point at infinity. This is then a rank II bundle over Cp1 of zero first turn class. It's generically trivial. And if we ask that it actually is trivial, we get a Zariski open subset of Cp1 to the 2n. If we'd been working in PGL. If we'd been working in PGL of 2C rather than GLF2C, we wouldn't have needed this twisting and we would have defined m by just saying that E prime is trivial. Now, this M that I've described is the M which is used in symplectic Covana homology, at least for this case of the two-dimensional representation of the dual group being SL2. So symplectic Kavanaugh. So symplectic Havana homology, at least in that example, is constructed by considering intersections of Lagrangian submanifolds of that space I just described, the space M of multiple Hugging modifications from a trivial bundle to itself. So that was an algebraic geometer's description of that space. But remember, our goal was to get a description of the Jones polynomial and Cavano homology. Anohemology, where topological invariants will be more obvious than they might be in other approaches. For that, we want to describe the space of hecumodifications in terms of PDEs. So we want to describe the same space M as the space of solutions of some PDE. Well, in the work I did with Kapostin on gauge theory and geometric languages, it was an important fact that M is a mod Lie space of a certain solution. Space of a certain solution, of solutions of a certain system of PDEs. But there is a trick. It's displaced in dimension by one from what you might expect. So the algebraic geometer's definition of M involved bundles on a two-manifold at R2, which was simply the complex plane in the example I gave. Or we compactified it to CP1, but anyway, it was two-dimensional. But the PDEs are going to be in three dimensions. There'll be PDEs on R. Dimensions. There'll be PDEs on R3. As a result of this, everything in the rest of the lecture will be in a dimension one more than you might expect. So to describe the Jones polynomial, an environment of knots or links in three-space will count solutions of some PDEs in four dimensions, and the categorified version related to Covano homology will involve PDEs in five dimensions. The three-dimensional PDs that we need are known as the Bogomolny equations, which were originally introduced to describe magnetic monopoles in gauge three. They're equations for a pair A and phi. A is a connection on a G bundle E over a three manifold, and phi is a section of the corresponding adjoint bundle. In other words, it's a three-form, sorry, it's a zero-form valued in the adjoint bundle. And if we were And if we write the Yangtze curvature as f equals dA plus a wedge a, then the Bolgomo equations are like so. They say that the curvature is the Hodge star acting on d sub A of F. D sub A is the gauge covariant exterior derivative. So these are elliptic differential equations modulo of the gauge group, and there's a vast literature in them from many points of view. For example, Example, T.N. Hitchin wrote a book called Physics and Geometry of Monopoles, which was about these solutions of these equations. And there's much, much more from many points of view. So the Bogomoni equations have many remarkable properties, but for today we'll focus on just one aspect. We'll consider the Bogomoni equations on a three-manifold, which is a Riemann surface times R. Well, any connection A on a G bundle over a Riemann surface determines a holomorphic structure on E, or more exactly on its complexification. You simply write the connection as a 0, 1 part plus a 1, 0 part, and you use the 0, 1 part of the connection to define the complex structure of the bundle. In complex dimension 1, there's no integrability condition for a d-bar operator. So whatever the connection is, d-bar A defines an Is d bar A defines an integrable holomorphic structure on the bundle. So, if you in particular, if you have a gauge field over R times C, you could specialize to any point Y in R, and then you could restrict any G bundle with connection over R times C to Y times C, and that'll give the holomorphic bundle E sub y over C. But if the Bulgamani equation But if the Bulgamoni equations are obeyed, E sub y is canonically independent of y. Indeed, a consequence of the Bulgamoni equations is that the 0, 1 part of the connection is independent of y. This should be y not r, up to conjugation. If we parametrize the real direction in w3 by y, then part of the Bogomoni equation is this. equation is this. So the bulk of moli equations, they're equations for one form in three dimensions, so there are two real equations, sorry, three real equations, but two of the three real equations can be put in the form of this one complex equation. And this one complex equation tells you that up to a gauge transformation generated by minus i phi, d bar a is independent of y. So, the Bulgarian, okay, the Bulgarmon equations, if we have a solution everywhere on R times C, would give us a constant family of homomorphic bundles over C. But we don't want a constant family there. We want a family that undergoes jumps due to HECI modifications. Modifications. The Bogomoni equations admit solutions with the singularity at isolated points in R3 or in a more general three-manifold W3. So let me first describe the picture for U1. You fix an integer n, and you observe that the Bogomoni equation has an exact solution for any point in R3. Phi is n over 2 times the distance from that point x0, and f is dou d phi. So this formula, this was the Bogomani equation. But we have to remember that f was supposed to be the curvature of the connection. And this formula defines a closed two form. Well, you need to know that this phi is harmonic. It's harmonic. It solves the Laplace equation away from x equals x0 because this is the potential due to a point charge. So it's sort of the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation with a point singularity. So star d. Singularity. So star dφ is therefore closed. But for f to be the curvature of a connection, the period of f, that is, its integral over a two-sphere that surrounds the singularity, has to be an integer multiple of 2 pi. And that's why n has to be an integer. So therefore, for every integer n, this is a solution of the Bulgar-Monny equations for u1. So this sentence is what I just told you. This sentence is what I just told you. The formula is to find f and not the line bundle and the connection A on that line bundle whose curvature is F, but they exist if and only if N is an integer. Now for G equals U1, since the Bulgarian equations are linear, they have a unique solution with singularities labeled by specified integers at specified points in R3. So this is an attempt to draw R3 with some points in it that have been labeled. R3 with some points in it that have been labeled by integers. Now I'm going to assume the integers add up to zero, which is need, it's the condition that the given solution vanishes at infinity faster than one over r, I guess. Now we pick a decomposition of r3 as r times r2, and we identify r2 as the complex plane. Let's say the singularity is Let's say the singularities are at yi times pi. yi is in r and pi are some points in c. Well, as long as y is not one of the bad points, the indicated solution of the Bogomoni equations determines a holomorphic line bundle L sub y over C, and this naturally extends to L sub Y over C P1. That's where we need the sum of the ends to be zero, so that the solution vanishes fast enough at infinity that the line bundle naturally extends over C P1. The line bundle naturally extends over Cp1. L sub y is constant up to isomorphism for y not equal to one of the yi's, because when y isn't one of the yi's, the Bulgar Monni equations are satisfied and they make L sub y independent of y as a holomorphic bundle, as I explained. But even when y crosses one of the yi's, the argument still works as long as you keep away from the bad point pi in CP1. In CP1. So the holomorphic type of Ly jumps when you cross the bad points, which was at y equals y sub i, but it doesn't jump if you remove the one point p. So this means that by definition, the jumping of the bundle when you cross the bad point is a heckey modification. So in this abelian case, by consideration of the first turn class, you can determine The first turn class, you can determine what the Heckey modification is. The Hecke modification when you cross the bad point is precisely the most general abelian Hecke modification at the point Pi. Now, since I took the sum of the charges to be zero, Ly is trivial at either end. Y goes to minus infinity or plus infinity. So this solution of the Bogomoni. This solution of the Bogomoli equation describes a sequence of Hecke modifications that starts and ends at the trivial line bundle. So that's the abelian version of what we want as the space M that we will use for the Jones polynomial and Covano homology. We can do something similar for any simple E group G. This construction was introduced by Hooft more than 40 years ago, and it's important. More than 40 years ago, and it's important in physical applications of quantum field theory. You let t be the maximal torus of g and little t its Lie algebra. You pick a homomorphism rho from U1 to T. Up to a Waal transformation, such a rho was equivalent to a dominant weight of the dual group G dual. That was, I think, closely related to Langland's definition of the dual group. And what God of Noitzenov said was even closer to what I'm saying. Neuts and Olov said was even closer to what I'm saying. So it corresponds to a representation R-dual of the dual group. So now we turn the singular solution of the U1-Bogomoni equations that we already used, but for the case n equals 1, into a singular solution for g by simply mapping u1 to g via this embedding row. So, that way we get a singular solution with a point singularity at a chosen point, and the singularity, the type of singularity, is labeled by this representation of the dual group. Then we look for solutions of the Volga-Mondi equations for G with singularities of this type at specified points yi times Pi in R3. I said this type, but we are allowed to use a different row for each I. row for each eye. So the points, we have a lot of points in R3. Each point is labeled by, in general, a different representation of the dual group. So the picture is the same as before, but instead of labeling the points by integers, they're labeled by representations of the dual group. In this example, points row one, row two, row three, row four. So the points are labeled by homomorphisms from U1 to the maximal torus or One to the maximal torus, or in other words, by representations of the dual group. Also, now we must specify that we want a solution that goes to zero infinity faster than one over r. In the abelian case, that was equivalent to a condition on the representations, the sum of the n should be zero. On the non-abelian case, no matter what the representations are, we need to impose this condition. Now, given that Now, given this, such a solution describes a sequence of HACI modifications at Pi of type ρi, mapping a trivial G-bundle over CP1 to itself. So this space is actually a hyperkalar manifold, essentially first studied by Peter Kronheimer in the 1980s. And we can view it as a hyperkalar manifold, but for today we're going to only Kayler manifold, but for today we're going to only view it as a complex symplectic manifold. So if we pick a decomposition of R3 as R times R2, that picks one of the complex structures on the hypercaler manifold, and in that complex structure, M is the moduli space of all HACKI modifications of indicated types at the indicated points, mapping a trivial bundle over CP1 to itself. So you can use this. So, you can use this construction to explain various properties of spaces of Heckey modifications. But for today, we want to focus on the fact that for the application to knot theory, we want M to be the space of U-independent solutions of some equations. So, M I defined as a space of PDE, solutions of some PDEs, but they were PDEs in three dimensions. Dimensions and they weren't independent of any of the three coordinates in that picture, they depended on the choice of a finite set of points that's not translation invariance in any direction. But we want to have a picture like this, where M, we have some PDUs, and the U-independent solutions are supposed to correspond to M. Well, we described M by solutions of some PDEs on R3, so now we will have to think of M as a So now we will have to think of m as a space of u independent solutions on R3 times R where the second factor is parameterized by U. And then we're supposed to get back to this picture here if we look at only solutions independent of U and then forget about U. So, well, this is a non-trivial fact. If you take a generic P D and D dimensions, good luck in regarding its solutions as the U independent solutions. As the U-independent solutions have some elliptic PVEs and U plus and D plus 1 dimensions. That's only going to work on a very good day. I hope what I'm saying is clear enough that that last statement is clear. But in this case, there actually are natural four-dimensional PVEs that work, sometimes called the Kw equations because they had appeared in my work with Kopostin. There are equations for a pair that I'll still call A and Phi, where A is A and phi, where A is a connection on a G bundle over a four manifold now, and phi is now a one form on the four manifold valued on the adjoint bundle. So anyway, these are the equations. And those are again elliptic equations model of the gauge group. And in a special case where the four-manifold is W3 times R, where W3 is a three-manifold, a solution being independent. A solution being independent of U means that A is a pullback from W3. And then we assume that phi takes this form where this phi is also a pullback. Then these equations reduce to the Bogomoni equations. So, our space of solutions of the Bogomoni equations are the U-independent solutions now of some equations in four dimensions. Dimensions. So, the singular solution of the Bogom-Molni equations that we've already studied can be embedded. In other words, the one represented by this picture. It has singularities of points, but when we add a fourth dimension, the points became lines. So now we have a solution of a four-dimensional equation with the singularity along a line rather than a single single single sign With the singularity along a line rather than a point. And in fact, this is an elliptic situation. So, I mean, I described the local model for the singularity, but you can generalize it. In general, if Y4 is a four manifold and S is an embedded one manifold labeled by a homomorphism from U1 to the maximal torus or by representation of the dual group, then it makes sense to look for solutions of the Kw equations on Y with the singularity of. On y with the singularity of the indicated type along s. And you can count, well, if you can resolve some compactness issues, which are actually not highly non-trivial, then you can count those solutions weighted by sines and get an integer that will characterize this situation. So we can do this in general. So we can do this in general on y, but now if we specialize to this case that the solution is independent of one coordinate, then as I've already said, the u-independent solutions are parametrized by this space m of solutions of the Bogomolny equations. And moreover, you can show that these are all the solutions that have reasonable behavior infinity. So in this stretched situation, the solutions are going to become independent of you and Going to become independent of you and will reduce to a solution will reduce to one of the solutions of the three-dimensional equations. So what do we have so far? We have an elliptic PD in four dimensions. We have an interesting way to specify what singularity it should have on an embedded circle. And we can even count solutions. Well, we can hope to count solutions, modulus and subtle technicalities in that situation. But this sounds like it. Situation. But this sounds like a ridiculous framework for knot theory because there's no knottedness of a one manifold and a four manifold. So, what are we talking about? Well, a couple of things are missing from what I've said so far. There are a few directions to go next, but I want to head for categorification, which will also resolve the point I just mentioned. In heading for categorification, In heading for categorification, I'm going to first get what's called the singly graded version of the theory, which is the version which is graded by the cohomological grading but no Q grading. That's the version of symplectic covenant ophthalmology as developed by authors I mentioned at the beginning of the lecture. I'll very, very briefly mention what one has to do in the framework I'm talking about. Do in the framework I'm talking about to get the Q grading, but there won't be time to do justice for that. So, what is categorification going to mean? Well, I briefly said a word about that at the beginning, but let's go in more detail. Let's practice with an ordinary equation rather than a PDE. Suppose we're on a finite-dimensional compact-oriented manifold n with a real vector bundle v over n, and we're given a section. So we can define an integer by counting with So we can define an integer by counting with multiplicities, in particular with signs, the zeros of s. That integer is the Euler class of the bundle V. So that's an equation, namely S equals zero. It wasn't a PDE. Since we're R on a finite dimensional manifold N, the condition S equals zero is an ordinary system of equation for finitely many variables, not a PDE. For finitely many variables, not a PBE. But we're practicing with ordinary equations, that is, equations for finitely many variables, as opposed to differential equations. Now, in general, as far as I know, you can't categorify the Euler class of the vector bundle. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be. But suppose that the vector bundle is the cotangent bundle and the section is the differential of a Morse function. Then the zero. Then the zeros of S do have a natural kyeoglorification that's described in what's sometimes called Moore's homology. You define a complex V with a basis vector, size of P, for every critical point P of H. Here I'm going to assume for simplicity that the critical points are non-degenerate. The complex is Z-graded by assigning to each size of P the index of the critical point P, and it has a natural differential that's defined by counting gradient flow lines between critical points. By counting gradient flow lines between critical points. So, concretely, I think I might have Q and P backwards here. Well, what I've written is that D of psi P, okay, D of Psi P is the sum over Q of N P Q times psi Q, where the sum runs over all critical goal points Q is Morse index is one more than that of P, and N PQ is defined by counting, flows from P to Q. From P to Q. So I guess with what I've written, I think what I've written is internally consistent. A flow is a solution of the differential equation in one dimension. It's the gradient flow equation. To find it, you pick a Riemannian metric in the manifold n, and then you can write down this equation that dx dt is minus the gradient of h. And counting its solutions, you get these integers and You get these integers, and they make the differential whose homology is Morse homology. The complex you get is independent of the metric up to quasi-isomorphism. What you count are actually one-parameter families of flow related by time translations, that is, by constant shifts of the parameter t in the equation. So, in this way, not any equation for many variables, but the equations for critical points of a Morse function can be calculated. Points of a Morse function can be categorified. So that tells us what we need in order to be able to categorify the problem of counting solutions of the Kw equations. We have to be able to write these equations as critical equations for a critical point of a functional. So the Kw equations have to be writable like so for some gamma, which is a function that depends on a and phi. And then the associated gradient flow equation will be a PDE in five dimensions on the five manifold R times Y4. And it will take this form. dA dt is minus delta gamma delta A and d phi dt is minus delta gamma delta phi. And that equation has to be elliptic so that it makes sense to try to count its solutions. So we're actually asking for a lot because a generic equation isn't going to be a gradient flow. generic equation isn't going to be a gradient flow equation sorry a generic equation will not have a generic pd will not have this form and even if it did these equations will generically not be elliptic and it won't make much sense to try to count these solutions well actually it's generically not true that the kw equations are equations for a critical point that's just as well because we don't want to categorify An embedded one manifold and a four manifold. Since there's no knottedness, that wouldn't give us anything. However, the Kw equations can be written as equations for a critical point if the four manifold is W3 times R for some W3. And if singularities are present on an embedded one manifold S, there's a further condition. The Kw equations are equations for critical points if and only if S If and only if S is contained in a three-manifold W3 times Q with Q a point in R. So now we're back in the situation where knottedness does make sense because the knot will have to be in a three manifold. So to make categorification possible, we have to be in this situation that leads to knot theory. S is an embedded one manifold in a three-manifold W3. So, when we do take y4 to be w3 times r, so the kw equations become equations for a critical point of some functional, we can consider the corresponding flow equations in five dimensions. They, quote, miraculously, unquote, turn out to be elliptic PDEs. They were also discovered by Andrei Haydis and are sometimes called the HW equations. Since they're elliptic PDEs, it makes sense to hope to count their solutions and to develop a version. Their solutions and to develop a version of Morse floor theory, which would be the categorification. So, naively, this leads to categorified not invariance for any three manifold W3, but to justify this claim, you need some compactness properties for solutions of the equations under consideration. It's not really clear what conditions on W3 you need, and it's conceivable that a proper proof will require the Ricci tensor to be non-negative, which Tensor to be non-negative, which is a very strong condition. The case that, on physical grounds, one would really expect to work is the basic case of R3 that is associated to the, hopefully associated to the usual cohanophomology and its generalization to other knots, other groups, and representations. So, what I've described so far is supposed to correspond to single. To singly graded Cavanophonology. The only grading I've mentioned is the grading that's associated to the Morse index, in other words, to categorification. In the mathematical theory, you would say that the singly graded theory becomes trivial. It doesn't distinguish knots if one decategorifies it and forgets the grading. What that means here is that if we decategorified, then the embedded Then the embedded one manifold did not have to be in any in the three manifold w3, it can move arbitrarily in the four manifold, so it can be unknotted. That's the explanation from this point of view, that the singly graded theory has no information if you decategorify it. So this sentence is what I just said. The physical picture makes it clear where the additional Q-grade in the Fovan. Where the additional Q-grading of Covana homology should come from. It's supposed to come from the second Chernkress integrated over the four-manifold Y4. But for topological reasons, this Q-grading can't be defined in the construction as I've presented it so far. The second turn class can't be defined in the presence of the singularities we've assumed. Roughly, an instanton, well, first of all, there's instanton bubbling, an instanton could shrink to a point. Instant bubbling, an instant could shrink to a point, but we could prevent that from happening, but we can't prevent it from instant on bubbling if the bubbling occurs along S. I've cheated with that explanation. But anyway, it's true topology. I shouldn't have mentioned instant on bubbling. I should simply say to define the second German class of a bundle over a four-manifold, it works fine if the four-manifold. It works fine if the four-man fold is compact. Here it's not compact because the bundle doesn't extend over S. So, some topological conditions would be needed along S to be able to define the second term class, and the necessary conditions are not satisfied. So, in precisely this situation, we do not get the Q rating. We have to do something a little more complicated. The four manifold should be a manifold with boundary. manifold with boundary and the knot s has to be placed in its boundary. Well I've drawn an example where s actually is a link consisting of two unknots that are linked. And then I've drawn a boundary w3. And there's a very funny boundary condition along W3 that I don't have time to describe, but it involves a singularity along W3. And then along S, there's a composite singularity, a composite of the one I've talked about. A composite of the one I've talked about when s isn't in the boundary, plus the extra singularity that you have anyway at a generic point of the boundary. So in this more complicated situation, even though y4 is a manifold with boundary, the necessary conditions to define the second turn class are satisfied, and you can define the second turn class. So the boundary condition is defined by specifying The boundary condition is defined by specifying a singular behavior the field should have along the boundary with a more subtle singularity along the not. So a boundary condition defined by requiring a specified type of singularity isn't as familiar as something like Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. But you can show in this case that the boundary condition does have all the formal properties of a standard elliptic boundary condition, such as Dirichlet or Neumann. So Rafe and I. So, Rafe and I wrote two papers on this actually. One with the first one without the not and the second one including the nod. And then Cliff has reformulated the subject in this paper. So, when I say all the usual properties, for example, if we're on a compact manifold, but it has a boundary with this kind of boundary condition. So, I haven't here drawn why four is compact, but suppose we. Here, drawn why four is compact, but suppose it is compactified out here. On a compact manifold, for example, the linearized Kw or Hw equations will have a discrete spectrum, as they would for a more familiar elliptic boundary condition. And other things you might be accustomed to for elliptic boundary value problems will also be satisfied. So the Morse floor theory of the HW equation with this fancy boundary condition is supposed to reproduce doubly graded Kavanaugh. Produce doubly graded Kvan morphology, with one grading being the cohomological grading and the second grading being the Q grading associated to instant on number. I think I have to mention that part of Michael Attiya's vision about the Jones polynomial way back in the 80s was that the variable Q of the Jones polynomial would be related to insulin number in four dimensions. And what I'm telling you is actually a version of that. Though I was a skeptic back in the 80s and for long after. The reason I was a skeptic. The reason I was a skeptic is that Turns-Lyman's theory in three dimensions captures a lot about the Jones polynomial, but can't be related, not in the spirit of this lecture anyway, and not, I think, in the spirit that Michael wanted, to instantons in four dimensions. Now, so I've perhaps whizzed through this too fast, but this is supposed to be covalent ophthalmology and its generalization for other groups and representations. There's also a variant of this. There's also a variant of this for odd covalent ophthalmology. For this, you take the dual group to be spin 2n plus 1 for some n. So that means g, which is the gauge group in the description I've been giving you in this lecture, is sp2n mod z2. And then pi 4 of G is Z2. So a simple E group that has non-trivial pi 4. Simple E group that has non-trivial pi4 is of type sp2n or sp2n mod z2. So that's why I consider precisely this class of dual groups. So for other groups, pi4 would be trivial, but for this symplectic group, pi4 is Z2. So a G bundle over a five manifold has a Z2 value characteristic class, which I'll call Zeta. In the Morse floor theory, you can modify the definition of the differential. You can modify the definition of the differential by weighting each gradient flow trajectory with an extra factor of minus one to the zeta. And that will not affect the fact that the differential is a differential, the fact that it squares to zero. Precisely because zeta is a characteristic class. It's the factor of minus one to the zeta is multiplicative in connected, I guess, in connected sums. So this is the candidate for odd. So, this is the candidate for odd Cavanaugh homology if you specialize to the case that the dual group is SU2, which is the same as spin3, and the two-dimensional representation. Well, what would be needed to rigorously define these invariants? The main thing that's needed is information about compactness properties of the Kw and Hw equations. So, compactness properties of these and related equations has been the topic. Equations has been the topic of a series of papers by Cliff Talbes in recent years. And I'm hopeful this will lead relatively soon to a proof of well-definedness and topological invariance of these invariants. If that did happen, how would we know that it was related to the Jones polynomial and covon opinion? I'm hopeful that there would be multiple strategies, most of which I would have no idea about. There's only one I can suggest. Well, there might. Suggest. Well, there might be others. For example, Mina Arcanogic's work is close enough to this that it might make other might suggest other options. But the only possible strategy that I've worked on was in the work with Gayoto that I mentioned before, where we really didn't, well, I'll mention a paper later where others extended it to five dimensions, but Gayoto and I were in four dimensions. We tried to show directly, without referring to the physical picture, that the Jones Panon. Physical picture that the Jones polynomial can be written like so, where a n is the number of solutions with second German class for the Kw equations. So as usual, the starting point was to stretch the knot in one dimension direction. So here I've drawn a four-manifold, which is R3, but I had trouble drawing R3. I drew a compact portion of R3. R3 times a half line. Then there's a knot in the boundary. I've called it K. I've called it K. It's been stretched in one direction. So there's occasional jumping, but generically it's independent of U. U is the stretching direction. We tried to understand what the solutions would look like after stretching. And we had a plausible scenario to recover the Jones polynomial from counting of solutions, taking into account what you could say about the stretched solutions. This has been extended to the categorified case by... Been extended to the categorified case by Golakov and more. So, and you can hope to ultimately make contact with perhaps the work of Mina Akonadic and perhaps other things. So, I think that's what I have to say for today. Thank you for your patience. To summarize, I've tried to motivate without requiring too much familiarity. Requiring too much familiarity with physics, but instead, as motivation, I assumed you were familiar with symplectic Cavana phonology, which I know was probably only a good match for a fraction of the audience. But starting with that motivation, I gave what I hope was a plausible explanation of why one would be led to study certain elliptic PDEs in three, four, and five dimensions as candidates to describe the Jones polynomial and Covanophomology in a way that would be manifestly topological invariants if you. Topological invariant, if you can understand the compactness issues. And as I said, I guess that's what I have to say for today. Thank you. Let's thank Edward Britton. Questions Thank you for a very nice talk, Edward. I wonder if you have any thoughts on how to reproduce Rasmussen's S invariant of knots from Kw equations with numpole boundary conditions. I'm woefully ignorant. Is there any characterization of it you can tell me that I might understand? I'll be answering on the fly, regardless of what you tell me. The answer is probably no, obviously, but I guess there's. Well, if Jake is in the audience, he can probably give. Audience, you can probably give more count of it, but there are several definitions. One is based on spectral sequences. I think this was the original one. Kronheimer and Roth actually have a gauge theory definition, but that's based on instant on homology of a node. I think they make some connect sound that hopefully can do something. So it doesn't look immediate to me how to connect it to. Well, as you can see, I'm not long for it. Well, as you can see, I'm not too long formed, so I'd be happy to talk about it more, but I don't have any useful suggestions. Yeah, the reason I'm asking is it's one of the interesting topological outcomes of covenant homology, so it's part of the theory and that's motivational for your question. I don't even remember what instant floor homology is. You mean Floor's original homology? Yeah, they use. Floor did two theories: symplectic manifolds and instantans. Manifolds and instant lens. No, no, no, it's instant lens on four manifolds. So we take not in S3 with a singularity what we would call alpha value I. I know that. Yeah, okay, right. So I know that Krona-Bimarovka did a lot of work for SO3 insulons with a very special monodromy, where the stabilizer was O2 rather than SO2. Yeah, that's part of that work. Yeah. So gay study drain. Yeah, so sorry to uh so the Krohim or Mrofka paper had a mistake. I mean, the day there's no interpretation of this invariant with instantular homology, they retracted it. Thank you. But yeah, I think maybe for Edward, so there's this deformation of one of homology. I mean, that was the original definition to Lie homology, where you introduce an extra differential, and Lie homology is just. And the lead homology is just z plus z. And whatever grading it lands in, it's s minus one and s plus one. So s is the average of the gradings of the two factors of z in under this deformation. I see. And can you, okay. Well, I certainly don't know how to make contact with that, but that sounds like it might be instant onology is much farther from the content of my lecture than what you just said is. I don't know how to do what you're saying, but. I don't want to do what you're saying, but I mean, Lee homology is actually SL1. It's sort of a trivial theory, and there's a deformation from SL2 to SL1. Okay, then I won't be able to answer the question, but I will tell you how you think about the deformation from SL2 to SL1. You don't mean SL1, you mean you mean, well, more like GL1, the maximal torus of SL2, I hope, is what you mean. Yes, yes. So actually, so. So actually such information was part of my paper with Google Guyoto. So okay, how would you okay? Let's just discuss something more basic. So let's just suppose you're talking about the Jones mono. I wish I had a picture to talk about. Let's just look for a picture of a note. Okay. All right. Well, I'm wasting. All right. I'm wasting time. Okay. Okay. When I. The Jones polynomial is supposed to come by counting solutions of an equation. I describe the equation and the singularity. Okay. Well, since the Jones, by definition, isn't categorified, but we do want the Q grading. We have to be in that case where the knot is in the boundary of the four manifold. So it's a rather complicated thing. So it's a rather complicated singularity. But anyway, we're on a half space, R3 times a half line, and there's a funny singularity on the boundary and a more complicated singularity along the knot. But then we look at solutions which are trivial at infinity, or they're as trivial as they can be given the boundary condition. I'm slightly worried about making an oversimplified statement. At least if you go to infinity, not near the boundary. Go to infinity not near the boundary, the solution is trivial. But you can deform that and consider a solution that near infinity is not trivial but rather has a constant one form built into it. Because the equations, wherever they were, like here, there's a one form in the equation, phi. And you can ask phi to approach a constant at infinity. Well, phi wage phi has to be zero, so the constant is highly constrained. But for example, phi can be. But for example, phi can be dx, where x is one of the coordinates, times an element of the Lie algebra. That's a good boundary condition at infinity. And it builds into the story a projection of the knot to the plane. But it also builds into the story a reduction to the maximal, a quasi-reduction to the maximal torus, namely the subgroup of the gauge group that leaves phi fixed. I have no idea how to get Lie homology. I can only say that that's a good way to only say that that's a good way to get various things into the picture. And if Lee homology is related to reduction from SL2 to GL1, the first thing I would try to do would be to do something in the spirit of what I said. As you can see from the discussion, I have no idea if it would work. But if that's, well, that's an example of what would come to mind that is worth trying, at least. Sounds plausible. Yeah, thank you. Further questions? May I ask a question? So, in relation to Zeitel-Smith, are you implying that instead of Taubna, they're using C cross C star? So they would not have a singular boundary condition at the initial point of array. Initial point of array extending along the cigar. I'm extremely forgetful. They actually describe their space in a different language. And I haven't reviewed this recently, but Kamnitzer explained in a paper. Explained in a paper I mentioned but didn't cite in detail that the Seidel Smith space. I'm worried I have the references wrong anyway. I'm sorry, I apologize that this is not, I'm not stating all this very accurately. But anyway, the space they use, although they describe it in a different language, is a space of hacky modifications of this minimal type. So yeah, I can explain the isomorphism that I probably. I can explain the isomorphism, but I probably shouldn't try to do it here. But yeah, there's the slot of the slices in type A you can also write in terms of these hacker modifications. Well, maybe it's hard for me to know, but maybe you should say just slightly more for the rest of the audience. Yeah, the very rough idea. The very rough idea is, yeah, I should think about this myself. You know, that you think about these Heka modifications. You know, so what is this doing? This is, you know, looking at a vector bundle on a disk, thinking of that as a module over functions on the disk, inverting the parameter of the disk, and then choosing a different submodule in there. A different submodule in there, invariant under t. And the way to make this connection, it's hard to describe without writing everything down, is that, and it's also been a little lot, so I'm trying to remember, you know, it involves looking at the action of t on the quotient of two lattices and thinking of that as a nilpotent. So, like, you know, to get two row nilpoten. To get two row-nil potents, you look in C Laurent polynomials and C2. And when you have two lattices, one inside the other, you can look at the quotient. T acts on that, and it's always going to act by a two-row nil potential. And I'm sorry, I'm not sure I'm actually going to be able to describe this clearly off the top of my head without writing anything down, but there are several circumstances. There are several sources. I can probably pull one up and put it in the chat. I'm sorry, I was trying to understand the physical explanation for why Zeitel-Smith should be trivial at the level of polynomial, but not trivial at the level of homology. Well, there are a bunch of people in the call who can answer much better than I can, but as far But as far as I understand, in the A model version or Fokay category version that they did, they literally didn't have a definition of Q. And you were saying that the reason was that there was no boundary for the ray, so they could. Well, I don't know if it's equivalent to what you're saying. In this, I'd better not answer in the context of their. I'd better not answer in the context of their work. I can answer in the context. Sorry about the background phone ringing. In my presentation here, we only get the Q grading if we introduce the boundary to help us. We're fundamentally not like we're trying to define the second term class, but we're not on a compact manifold without boundary. And the not all And the knot all by itself in the middle doesn't work, but the knot in the boundary does work. To explain that in detail, I would have to explain precisely the boundary condition on the boundary. It's kind of a long story. But when I say it works, it actually does a little bit better than just working. If you take the quantum invariance of a three-manifold, they actually require a framing of the three-manifold. And if you change the framing, they change by a power of Q. Of Q. That gets an interpretation here because it was oversimplified to say that the boundary conditions let you define the second term class. They let you define it not as an integer, but as an element of a Z torsor. And that's the Z torsor is trivialized if you pick a framing of the boundary. And it precisely mimics what's known for the quantum invariance of three manifolds. Any further questions? I have a question if nobody else does. You also studied the GL1-1. Yes. Did you put it in the related framework? Yes. Well, we did GL. This was. Well, we did GL. This was with my then student Viktor Mikhailov, who broke my heart by leaving for biology, unfortunately. He was brilliant. I mean, he is brilliant. Okay, we did GLN slash M in general, or SLN slash M, but in particular, GL1 slash one. I'm not sure what to tell you, though, on the fly. In that case, is your theory four-dimensional? Five-dimensional, still, it's still five-dimensional, I should say. Okay, instead of a boundary, okay. Let me try drawing, just in case I can, although I'm not gonna. Okay, so in the picture, as I've explained it, we live on one side of a boundary, and there's a weird boundary condition there, which I didn't explain. There, which I didn't explain in detail. In the story that was related to supergroups, which were matrix supergroups, UN slash n, and also orthosymplectic groups like OSP something.
