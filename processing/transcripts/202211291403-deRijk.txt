Yeah, precisely. So we go to part two essentially and uh it's still joint work with Monty, Paul and Arn. Um right? It was on, yeah. Okay, so I don't know. But it used I mean, it just worked a minute ago. I mean, it just worked a minute ago. Okay, well, anyways, I will just press. Okay, so the setup of my talk, so I first will recap essentially a little bit what Paul already was telling about, and that's the spectral problem for the pattern coming from Fitchukna-Guma system, and also explain what the difficulties there are. And then how you can actually put this in some yeah, more formal framework of general stability or spectral stability problems that you get from Spectral stability problems that you get from slow, fast, traveling wave equations, essentially. And then we will apply this framework and I will show like roughly how this applies to the Fitch Nakuma system and then provide some outlook. Right, so the spectral problem for pattern from in front in the Fitch-Nakumo system. So again, we have the Fitch of Nakuma system. Wow. What's happening? Okay, I guess anyway. Okay, so this is the this is the same system um now it's working in the network. Okay, now it's working. Okay, so this is the same system uh Paul was just describing. So we can write it in the co-moping frame in this way, and then we can find traveling waves, and one of the traveling waves we find is this pattern from in front, right? And the goal is to understand the spectral. is to understand the spectral stability, but then later also to prove the non-linear stability of the pattern from the fronts. And closely related to that, and this is also what Paul already touched, is this marginal stability conjecture that is that if you start from steep initial data, then such a marginally stable front is selected, this can be pushed or pulled front, right? So either it propagates with the linear invasion speed or it's the largest part of the spectrum is an eigenvalue and then it will be pushed and you get some invasion speed that is actually given by the non-linear dynamic. That is actually given by the monument dynamics. Right? And this conjecture has already been proven, but not in a setting of pattern-forming fronts, but actually in a setting of monotone fronts, but without comparison principles. So that gives hope because comparison principles are, of course, not working in this type of equations for pattern coming from. Right. So what's the spectral problem? Right, here it is. So we can linearize the equation that we get this time of... That we get this type of operator. And I linearize here about a general traveling wave solution, which is, of course, then a stationary solution to the equation in the co-moving frame. And then it's general knowledge, okay, I think this is well known, that the spectrum is then given by essential spectrum and point spectrum. And this is no other for pattern point front. What I should note here is that we work actually in special function spaces, so one-sided, so we apply one-sided exponential weight. And that, of course, makes sense because if you look at this thing, Makes sense because if you look at this state, the infaded state, I mean, the infaded state is going to be unstable, right? I mean, because otherwise, I don't get pattern, like a pattern invading the state. So I need to kind of stabilize this state, and this I can do by here imposing a one-sided exponential weight, right? Okay, so right, so the essential spectrum, this essential spectrum is determined by the rest states, or the like, no, I should not say rest state, about the asymptotic states of the pattern from in front. Of the pattern from in front. So one asymptotic state is the wave train, and the other asymptotic state is the rest state, which is invaded. This we already marginally stabilized, so then the spectrum looks like this, right? So you get this kind of cusp. And to determine the spectrum, you can just, I mean, in the limit, this is just a constant coefficient differential operator. So the spectrum is determined by the Fourier symbol, right? And you just look at it for imaginary eigenvalues. Okay, then the two more difficult parts is the essential spectrum. More difficult parts is the essential spectrum on the other side, on the left-hand side, which is coming from the wave train. So here the spectral problem is essentially posed on a periodic domain. So you get a family of eigenvalue problems which are parameterized by the flow-k-loft parameter, right? So this is just general flow-k-loft theory. And to find the point spectrum, we actually have to look at the eigenvalue problem on the unbounded domain and try to find exponentially local solutions. Yeah? Okay, so this is just, I think, some recap that most people uh know. Recap that most people know. So, as I said, this is hard because here we really have to solve, I mean, we have non-constant coefficients problems, so we get a non-autonomous linear equation, and I mean, the dimension is here 3, so this is non-trivial, yeah? So, this is not easy to solve such equations. I mean, there's no storming field theory or such thing available. Right, so for flow k for the for the for the wave train, you have the flow k theory, so this means that you get this kind of problem posed on a, on a, on a, on a bounded. On a bounded domain, where you have these kind of twisted boundary conditions, right, where this is the flow k exponent. And so we are looking then for non-trivial solutions to determine this essential spectrum coming from the wave train and to determine the point spectrum coming from the spectrum. From in front, we look at this problem, but then on the unbounded domain, and we look at solutions that vanish at plus or minus infinity, we'll turn onto a good. Yeah? Okay, so, right, so the central question here is: as I said, this is hard. I mean, we have to understand. This is hard. I mean, we have to understand some non-autonomous linear ODE in three dimensions. And of course, we have this small parameter, and we are at the multiple time scale workshop. So maybe the slow-fast structure might help us here. And yes, it really does. I mean, so we have here essentially the traveling wave equations. And what you see is that the eigenvalue problem kind of inherits this slow-fast structure that you have over here. Not fully, right? I mean, you have this lambda here, and I mean, lambda might in principle be large, so it's not really this kind of epsilon. It's not really this kind of epsilon that you have everywhere around. But the important thing here is that if I set lambda to zero, then I actually get that the eigenvalue problem is nothing else as the variational equation of the traveling wave equation about the solution I'm linearizing about, right? So one could say that if you want to determine the spectrum close to zero, which is the delicate part of the spectrum, right? Because if we go back to these pictures, you see that we have here touching of the spectrum to zero. Of the spectrum to zero in case of the wave train. So it's actually important to not only control the spectrum to leading order, but actually to control its fine structure, right? So to also control derivatives here. Yeah, so this is the most difficult part of the spectral analysis, the most delicate part of the spectral analysis, and I mean this actually comes from translational invariance of the uh of the pattern from in front. And uh so yeah, one would hope that one can kind of use this slow fast structure of the variational equation to perturb in lambda. To perturb in lambda. Yeah? Okay. And this is what we're going to do, and we're going to do that in a more general framework. So I just look at some abstract nonlinear evolution equation with some small parameter, and I assume that the traveling wave equation, so the equation that gives me the existence problem for the traveling waves, that this can be written as a first-order system in slow-fast form. Yeah, this is precisely the case for the Titan-Council equation. But for many other equations, this is also the case, right? Also, the case, right? You're minor at Gray-Scott equations, these are also famous equations for which you get traveling wave equations which have such slow path structure. Right, so here we just assume that we are in general dimensions KL, right? So in the Vichy McGumbo, there would be two fast dimensions and one slow dimension. Okay, so then there is some repetition that many of you know here, or I think all of you know here. So if you have such a problem, you can, I mean, you want to construct solutions. I mean, to construct solutions, you can use GSPT, geometric singular perturbation theory. You write fast and slow equations. I, by the way, noted that, okay, note that in Pulse Talk, red and blue were switched around, but to make it more exciting, I did it the other way around. Anyways, so you construct a singular orbit, what you do is you just concatenate, so you glue solutions of the fast layer problem and the slow problem, which is defined. Problem on the which is defined on the slow manifolds, you glue them together, you get some solution, or well, some formal solution because this is not an actual solution of the equation for epsilon is zero. But then you have GSPT and under certain conditions, I mean, of course, things can be difficult if you lose normal hyperbolicity. But yeah, what we assume is that we can actually find the traveling wave solution in the neighborhood of this singular structure. Okay, so this singular structure is going to be important also in the spectral stability analysis. In the spectral stability analysis. Oh, sorry. Right. So, what is important to note is that these transitions, like these, are heteroclinic orbits. Yeah, and this we will also use in the spectral analysis. And generically, points lying on these low orbits, like on the slow parts, they will be normally hyperbolic, yeah, except for some isolated full point potentially. Yeah, and this is also what we will encounter, as the poll said. I mean, we have. Fall set. I mean, we have fall points in some of these better formic fronts. Okay, so for these normally hyperbolic points, you expect that we have this kind of division. I mean, there were k false directions, and we have precisely k eigenvalue of the imaginary axis, and the rest lies naturally on the on zero in the limit epsilon is zero, right? Okay, so this is just what normally hypopotis, a normal hypopolistic. Okay, so now we look at the spectral problem, so we linearize this abstract nonlinear evolution equation, we get this linear operator, we write the eigenvalue problem and get as a first-order system. And since we have that at lambda is zero, the eigenvalue problem is nothing else as the variational equation of the traveling wave equation, which is in this case given by such a structure. So you get such a block structure, right? So we have a linear problem where we have kind of a slow, fast block. Where we have kind of a slow, fast block structure. And this block structure is going to be very important in that in the spectral analysis part. Yeah? So, right, this is the kind of structure that we have, and now we want to understand that structure essentially in the limit epsilon to zero. However, the problem is, I cannot just take here a limit epsilon to zero and expect that I get a good equation for all psi on R, yeah? Because it depends where psi is, right? If I converge to such a slow solution or whether I converge to solution. Converge to such a slow solution, or whether I converge to such a fast solution, what the right notion of limit is here, right? Like you have in the existence problem, right? There is not just one epsilon limit, you have a slow limit and a fast limit that you can take. And so you should do the same in the spectral problem. So you should partition the real line in parts where you lie close to the fast transitions and parts where you lie close to the slow transitions, right? And what we expect if you just look at the slow orbit. Just look at the slow orbits that I mean, by normal hyperbolicity, you kind of have this division of eigenvalues which are small and lying close to the origin, which are the small eigenvalues. You have the eigenvalues which are order one bounded away by normal hyperbolicity. These are the fast eigenvalues. And so you expect that these fatal eigenvalues kind of are distributed like this, yeah, at random points over here, except for isolated fault points. And so this suggests a decomposition of the solution space and kind of The solution space in kind of stable solutions, unstable solutions, and center solutions. And this can be captured with the concept of exponential die and tricosmics, right? And the idea is then to obtain leading order dynamics in each of these subspaces, right? So in the center subspace, in the unstable subspaces, in the stable subspaces, for the intervals, the slow intervals, and the fast intervals separately. Yeah? So, and then if you have this leading order control, this of course leads to reduction. Leading or the control is, of course, leads to reduction, this used to reduction of complexity because these spaces are lower dimensional, so you expect that the equations that give the dynamics in such equations are easier equations to understand, right? So in the case of the Witcher-Naguma equation, the center direction will be a one-dimensional direction. So this means to understand the dynamics in that center space, you just have to solve a scalar ODE, right? Oh, and and we can do that. We can solve non-automatic scalar ODEs, and that's not too hard. Scalar openings, and that's not too hard. Yeah? Okay, I should also mention this is more an analytic approach towards these kind of spectral problems. There's also a geometric approach, which is, I mean, so there is a long, long list of authors who worked on this, and I just mentioned here a few. So, I mean, specifically regarding the Fitchov Nagumo equation, it's it's it's Esther who who did some uh who did some work there uh for wave trains. For wave trains. Right. Okay, so exponential dichotomies, what is that? So essentially, you have to think about: if you have such a non-autonomous linear equation, which our spectral problem is, with an evolution, and I and R is an interval, that what I have is that I kind of decompose the solutions based on that interval and solutions that are decaying in forward time and solutions that are decaying in backward time, right? And so this is captured by a projection and constant CMU. Projection and constant CMU, such that the projection kind of commutes with the evolution, not really commute, but I mean, okay, you have this property over here. And if I apply the projection and I look at the subspace of solutions with initial conditions vy, they decay in forward time, whereas solutions that lie in the kernel of V, so that are lie in the range of I minus Px, they uh decay in backward time. Yeah, so this is stable substance. Okay, so that's the concept of substantial dichotomy. Exponential dichotomy. And trichotomy, I mean, you have a similar picture, but then you also have a subspace of bounded solutions in both forward and backward time. Note that there are different concepts around of exponential trichotomy. Some trichotomies, some alters here also allow for some growth here. I mean, that's not what we want in this case. But there, I mean, you will find this also in the literature another way to find it. Yeah? So here I have three projections, centers, stable and unstable projection. They completely span the solution. Projection, they completely span the solution space. You again have this commuting property down the center direction, forward decay for the stable subspace, and backwards exponential decay for the unstable subspace. And note that if I have an exponential trichotomy and I apply a weight to the problem, so I look at the weighted non-autonomous equation, then I get an exponential dichotomy for that equation. So, I mean, this is not too difficult to prove. I mean, you multiply. proof I mean you you you multiply here then everything a vector e to the e dot x and so you also get exponential decay here yeah okay right so how to establish such decompositions of the solution space so we have to distinguish between fast and slow transitions okay so now for fast transitions so this means that I have that I'm that I'm close to such a heteroclinic connection between these Between these low metaphors. And let's for the moment assume that this is a heteroclinic connection between normally hyperbolic points. Yeah, so that means that that heteroclinic in the layer problem is essentially connecting two hyperbolic equilibria. And that implies, because then in the limit, I'm close to a hyperbolic autonomous matrix equation, where of course I have exponential decay in forward time, and in backward time, I'm just standard ODE theory. So then I can. Um so and I can can can uh like uh push these uh these these exponential dichotomies in the limit plus and minus infinity forward and backward on onto the half lines. Yeah? So I get exponential dichotomy on both half lines. And this is so in this in this uh in the limit epsilon to zero uh in this upper block of the variational problem. Yeah? So I took here a limit of the variational problem setting epsilon to zero that leads to Problem setting epsilon to zero, then these two components vanish because remember there was this epsilon in front. And here in this upper block, I have now an exponential dichotomy. And now I can use, because I have this triangular structure, and I can use variation of constants, right? In essence, I have to just solve an inhomogeneous problem, and I know how to solve the homogeneous problem, so we know that this can be done via variation of constants. And then this yields an exponential trichotomy, right? Because it's well known that if the homogeneous problem has an exponential trichotomy, Problem has an exponential dichotomy that the corresponding inhomogeneous problem has then bounded solutions. And this gives me the bounded direction. Okay, so this is just coming from the triangular structure. And then if you have this triangular structure, so in the limit epsilon to zero, we can then perturb, yeah, so we can look at the actual eigenvalue problem, and then you have to add some additional matrix, but this matrix is going to be of order epsilon and. Matrix is going to be of order epsilon and lambda, which we both assume to be small because we are interested in the small spectrum. And we have to then distinguish between parts of the half-line where I correspond to r plus and r minus in the limit. So kind of I have to distinguish between psi where I'm close to this part and close to this part because I have this this this cut essentially of this heteroclinic here. And then I can use again variation of constants in this problem over here. Constants in this problem over here, and I know that these are small essentially, right? Because I have here exponential decay, so I can control everything and I can iteratively put again this psi into its own formula. I mean, this is kind of a fixed point formula. I can put it in again, and then I get expansions of this solution to the eigenvalue problem in epsilon and lemon. So I can arbitrarily expand, and as long as I understand the dynamics in this problem, which is of course a lower dimensional problem, in the Fitch-Nagumo equation. Lower dimensional problem. In the Fitch-Nagumo equation, this is just a two by two matrix. So I have a problem that I understand. I can understand, make sense of this, for instance, with sturmium field theory. Also, I can then push forward to the actual 3x3 problem, yeah, via such expansions. Okay, so yeah, this is explicit in terms of this system over here and its exponential vibrant. Right. Okay, so uh So, uh right, so what do I do for the passage along the slow manifolds? Uh there I use that at each point that I take, I have such a splitting of stable and unstable eigens uh values. This means that again for the upper block in my variational problem, I have that this is pointwise hyperbolic and slowly varying. Uh so this gives me an exponential dichotomy. This is again some results which is classical from the literature. If I have Which is classical from the literature. If I have point-wise hyperbolic coefficient matrix, which is slowly varying, it gives me an exponential dichotomy. And now the eigenbuilding problem is of this structure, right, where we have an exponential dichotomy in this upper block, which we get by roughness, like perturbing and epsilon from and lambda from this problem. Yeah? Okay, so if I have that, what can I do if I have such a problem and I have in this upper block problem, so this is precisely the structure of the eigenvalue. Precisely the structure of the eigenvalue problem or variational equation, if you want. I have an exponential dichotomy in this upper block, and then I can fully diagonalize the problem. So this is the Riccati transformation. It's actually old results in the literature, but it was never really applied for these spectral problems. I mean, this is in joint work with Arian Duman and Jens Wademacher, actually during my PhD. So, okay, so you can make this decomposition of the solution today, right? And again, here, this center guy. And again, here it is, center dynamics, for instance, in the Fitch-Mickel mode, this will just be a one-dimensional problem, which is fully explicit, essentially. And you see that this u, which you get over here, satisfies a matrix Riccati equation, which is this equation over here. But in essence, this is higher order, right? This is this epsilon and epsilon over here. So essentially, U just satisfies an inhomogeneous problem. And this we can solve. Because for the Virgin-Council case, this is again just this 2x2 system, and this is. System and this is, I mean, it's just a nomogenous 2-2 equation. Right, so this again gives me explicit denominator control in terms of lower-dimensional, slow, and fast subsystems. And it gives me an exponential trichotomy just by the decomposition that I have over here. Right here, I have slow dynamics, so this gives me center dynamics. And here, I know that this has an exponential dichotomy. So, by roughness, this thing has an exponential dichotomy to it. Right, okay, so now let's proceed and let's apply this to the See, it's and let's apply this to the Fichot-Nagumo equation. So now let's look at the wave trains in the hyperbolic regime. So, what we get, we connect here two normally hyperbolic points, so we get exponential trichotomies here. And here, we get exponential trichotomies here. And here, by the Riccati transformation, well, same for the lower part. I can paste these exponential trichotomies at these corner points. I mean, because their spectral projections are going to be close, and I need to match then solutions on these two intersections. So, this matching gives me. These two intersections. So, this matching gives me, because here I have six unknowns, because I have an exponential trichotomy all the way over here. So, this gives me three unknowns. Here, three unknowns. Matching linear system of six equations in six unknowns, setting the determinant to zero, gives me a spectral, gives me a spectral curve, lambda in terms of the loque multiplier nu, and I only need leading order control because the analyticity of this curve in nu, I only need leading order control on this curve. I only need PMOR control on this curve and on its derivative to prove such a thing, which is the stability of the essential spectrum of the wave track. Okay, so the same I can do for the non-hyperbolic regime, but the problem is here I have these fault points, and there I need separate analysis, and that's actually what Paul was already referring to, how to transition from this part to this part. We need to do this separately with Loab methods. Because I have collision of spatial eigenvalues, and I cannot expect such a partition of solution space in center state one. Of solution space in center stable and unstable. For the rest, I do get that by the same arguments here and here, but here by different arguments, because actually here I have a front which connects a hyperbolic equilibrium to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium. So I actually have a Fischer-KPP front over here. And so I have, because of algebraic decay, I actually get not only exponential dichotomies on both half-lines, but I actually get an exponential dichotomy on the full of R. Yeah, that comes from the algebraic decay. Yeah, that comes from the algebraic thing. And this is related to the fact that in the Fischer-KPP equation, if I apply the exponential weight, I do not get an eigenvalue at zero. Okay, so almost at the end. So now, what do we do for the pattern-forming front and the point spectrum? Actually, we proceed in precisely the same way. So we establish exponential dichotomies this time because we are only interested in the weighted problems, so in the weighted spaces. And so I can kind of... I can kind of look, I can take the center and stable space together and the unstable space together because I have an exponential weight. So I get exponential dichotomies on all these parts and I can paste, paste, paste at all these points. I don't need to match. And I actually get an exponential dichotomy on the whole of R. And so this immediately yields the absence of point spectrum for lambda spawn. Right, so what's the outlook? The next steps are, of course, to get from The next steps are of course to get from the spectral estimates to get linear estimates that then the next step would be to establish the non-linear stability analysis and the final goal would be to establish such a marginal stability conjecture. And yeah, that was it. Thanks. Questions? So the part where you talk In the part where you talked about looking at the exponential type for the parts of the trajectories that are close to the normally hyperbolic parts, why do you use the system in the in the fast time scale and not in the zero scale? So I mean, okay. So so so actually actually what you actually actually what you what you do there is you you use the system in the slow okay so essentially what you do is you you look at you look at the following I mean okay so you have to you can go to the slowest time scale let's say the slow time scale is given by zeta or something yeah so and you you would look at the at at the kind of rescaled um coefficient matrix in the limits the colours. The colours? Light and the colour. Oh yeah, okay, yeah. Okay, so it would s you would look at this, at this, and then if I go back to the original coordinates, you get this epsilon psi here, and this is kind of giving me the slowly varying coefficient. Right? So but I I just I mean, so this is y you I mean, you're right, you use you use the I mean you u you used rescaling in some sense, right? Be used to rescaling in some sense, right? But I just put this under the rug essentially in this presentation now, because otherwise I need to introduce more notation. Okay, but you performed the analysis on the slow scale and then you go back to the fast scale. Well, actually, yeah, so to be honest, I mean, the point is you do apply the roughness results in the fast time scale. Yeah, because you want the slowly varying coefficients. So essentially, the So essentially the system you perturb your exponential dichotomies from or your is this system. So this is in the fast time scaling. But it is to get this system you of course need to know what the corresponding system is in the slow time scaling. Any other questions? Not then, then thanks both.
