Washington is going to talk about reconstruction. Thank you. Thank you very much for inviting me and giving me a chance to tell you some things. I'm happy to be interrupted at any time with questions, objections, confusion, joy, whatever's on your mind, please feel free to vocalize. I was thinking about what I should do because I'm honored and terrified to be the first speaker. In some sense, I feel like I should maybe establish some context. Maybe establish some context for what might happen this week. So I'll try to do that a little bit, but I also want to have a sort of framing result. And I guess it should be one in which I participated because that's our culture. So I'm going to write down something, but really I'm not going to focus on it. But I want to try to provide, so I could frame the discussion we're going to have. So here's a theorem that you might have seen me talk about before. This joint work with Coliar. It was joint work with Poliar, Mark Melson, and Will Solomon. This is a special case of it. It goes like this. Let's say I've got two varieties, and let's say that these are normal, objective, geometrically integral varieties of fields. And let's say that the characteristic of k is zero. So we're in a characteristic k situation. And let's also say that the dimension of x is at least four. And this is part of the special case aspect of this. There's more general things that are true in different dimensions and so on. Okay. I mean, less general things. Then the statement goes like this. And this looks very strange person. Okay. Then, any homeomorphism of the underlying Zariski topological spaces algebraizes to a unique isomorphism of schemes. So in some terminology, you might say that the Zariski topology is a complete invariant of a variety of, you know, of a nice enough variety over a field of characteristic zero. Are we assuming L is characteristic zero? That follows from, well, that, no, if I meant to assume that I would have. If I meant to assume that I would have assumed that, but it's one of those, it looks asymmetric, but you could also make that assumption. If you want, it's harmless. It just happens to work without making that assumption to the endless. Thank you for asking that. If you drop the dimension, then you have to pay more attention to the nature of the field A. Sometimes it has to be finitely generated. Yeah. But dimension one, let's think about dimension one for a second. Especially topological space of a one-dimensional space. Logic space of a one-dimensional scheme. Not so interesting. So obviously it's not going to work there. You've hit a theme. The dimensional one case will come up later. At least you get the cardinality of K. Yes. You get the cardinality of K. Yes. So you don't... That's right. You don't get nothing. Good. Yes. Very good. In dimension zero is what you get nothing. Can you say that again, please? In dimension zero, really. In dimension zero. Dimension zero is obvious on the hand. Beautiful, beautiful. Dimension zero, you get obvious. But as sticks, we'll talk about later in the league. There are very interesting things that happen in dimension zero, but you need to retain more information than just the Zariski topological space. So he's going to talk about what happens if you keep the Galois group and nothing else. That's the beginning of a very beautiful story. Okay. Let me say corollary of this. Corollary of this, again take x, x, and y as above. Then any equivalence, I'll write, I don't know, this is like a temporary notation. Is there an actual notation for this? Induces an isomorphism. I'll say what that is in a second. I'll see what that is in a second. And here, this means, it's a colored shadow. Here I mean, this is the category of constructible atal abelian, I guess, abelian and etal. So this is like a topological replacement of this theorem of Gabriel that I'll bring up in a little bit. So this might look more like something you're familiar with with the idea of a completed variant. I start with a scheme, and I pull out of this case a category that's associated to it, and the assertion is that if I have an equivalence of these categories, then the schemes are isomorphic. In this case, in a somewhat constructive way, in the sense that from such a thing, I get such a thing. Get such a thing. From an equivalence, I get it next to one thing. And the proof of the corollary goes by recognizing that you can recover this topological space from a category of constructible. So like I said, I want to use this to kind of frame a discussion about algebraic invariance and what's been understood about the reconstruction or characterization of a scheme from invariance you naturally associate to algebraic universe. What comments, questions, thoughts, or feelings do you have about anything I've said so far? Especially the youth are strongly encouraged to voice their questions. Yes. Oh, no, I was a little bit, so here, one of the key assumptions in the one of the things your hypotheses do for you is they tell you that the global function. Do for you is they tell you that the global functions are the base field. If you have an isomorphism of schemes, if you just take the induced map of global functions, you get an isomorphism of fields. But you put your finger on a really key, you'll see this come up again, this idea goes back about 100 years, that from some auxiliary structure, you've defined some geometric object over a field, you've taken out some thing, and then magic happens and you get the field back. That's the key, that's the absolute key to the whole thing. So thank you for bringing that up. So, thank you for bringing that up. The terminology geometrically integral is usually in reference to a Bayes field. Yes, but in this case, you can, that makes sense as an absolute notion. So, there's various ways to say this. This is the way that we've said it in the book you wrote. The way that I might naturally say it is something different, which is you start with a scheme. The scheme always has a map to the spec of its ring of functions, of global functions. Functions of global functions. And so we're really talking about the property of that canonical structure map. We're saying that the ring of global functions is a field, and the canonical structure map has this property. So it's really intrinsic to the scheme. Thank you for pointing that out. Yes, yes. That's important. It's not even necessary that the scheme is projective. No. Finite type is enough and normal is maybe helpful than the maximal subfield in the way. So it's intrinsic. Um, yes, there are many other circumstances where you could recover the base field. That's also, yes, thank you for pointing that out. For most of the rest of it to be true, we need some hypotheses. And for some of the results we prove that I'll maybe hit on later, we don't need it to be projected. For some, we do. It depends on the dimension. It's kind of a mess. But you're absolutely right. There's a lot of ways you can imagine recovering the fuel. Elsa's on your mind. I should say, in reference to how people sometimes teach their class here, this is also the lecture from today's calculus class. So you might hear some questions about integrals coming over the Zoom. That's a joke. So let me provide some context here. And now I've struggled with how to provide, I can't provide a comprehensive history of the entire subject because I don't know it myself. So this is me. Myself. So, this is maybe a little idiosyncratic. So, I'm just going to say, it's sort of like a stream of consciousness that I wrote down on paper, and now I'm just going to repeat it to you. So, please do feel free to interrupt. The idea here is that we start with some kind of a geometric object. And from when we extract some sort of algebraic invariant. So, by geometric objects in order, we can call this x. I'm going to assume. We can call this x. I'm going to assume x is something like maybe a lovely ring space. x is x l x. Our geometric object is going to come as a thing with a sheaf of rings. You can imagine it's a scheme, it's an algebraic space, it could be a stack. But for the purposes of kind of just keeping track of what's going on, I suggest you consider a smooth projected variety. And what might you extract from it? Well, there's a whole bunch of things you could try to pull out of it. Well, there's a whole bunch of things you could try to pull out of this that are somehow shadows of this object in the algebraic world. Some look more algebraic than others. Well, I made a list, a somewhat random list. It has a motive. It has a derived category plus or minus its tensor structure. It has a category of coherent sheaves plus or minus its tensor structure. As a category of quasi-coherent quasi-coherent sheaves, plus or minus its tensor structure. I don't really mean minus. I don't really mean minus, I think you know what I mean. It has a tall fundamental group, it has various hodge structures, some piece of the cohomology. And then the one that's referred to over there. This looks a little different from the others, but the way you should think about this is that this is really just the post-set of irreducible close. Closed subspaces. That's really what this risky topological space is. It's not really a topological space. It's just this poset that you pull out. It's like the collection of all the algebraic cycles together with an understanding of how they specialize. That's all it is. So I would call this algebraic, since it's a poset. Set algebraic, I think so. But you might ask yourself, But you might ask yourself, sort of, in general, what should we mean? What is an algebraic invariant? And pondering this list and the various results, I came up with a sort of a theory about what an operative invariant is that might not be right at all. But it struck me when I looked at this: how many things have the following feature? One answer. One answer. Oh, and let me add something else to this list, by the way, because I mean, there's something that we're so used to that seems trivial to us, but like the function field, it's an amazing thing. We have a variety that in other geometric theories you don't have, right? Complex analytics spaces don't have a function field, manifolds don't have a function field, double electric spaces don't have a function. So there's actually, this is an algebraic invariant too, but it's like a, it carries a ton of information, so it seems to us less interesting. So one answer. Seems to us less interesting. So, one answer, I think, for what an algebraic invariant is, is it's a model of a first-order theory. You think about there's a theory of groups, there's a theory of rings, categories, modulo this issue about size, which I think is actually a really profound, like a very serious problem. If you think about having a small category, then that's something you can write down as a first-order theory, categories, or triangulated categories. Or triangulated categories, or abelian categories, or whatever, it's something that you can axiomatize efficiently and sort of express in first-order logic. Postat is an example of such a thing. One thing that's interesting is if you think about like a hodge structure, if you try to think about how would you write that down in first order, it's very hard to imagine what you do. I mean, I'm not a logician. I'm not a model theorist. But I think to do this right, you need to know how to complexify the Z module. The Z module. And so you need to have this huge language that has all the complex numbers in it. You have to have a ton of structure pre-built for you before you can even express what a Hodge structure is. And of course, one wonders if this is related to how hard the Hodge conjecture is to prove. Okay, so the idea is you pull out some kind of alphabetic invariant, which I'm saying sort of very, very broadly. It could be any model. Oh, the other thing maybe worth pointing out is topological spaces, geometric objects themselves are very, very not first order. That one way to understand their complexity. That one way to understand their complexity is you can't just write down a simple set of axioms, first-order axioms for topological spaces, because you can't control, say, the number of open sets. You can't write down, you know, you can't prefigure a collection of unary relations that tell you what openness means. And I think this is related to why we want to find these invariants. We want to reduce the complexity in some way. Even though categories seem very complicated to us, they're sort of intrinsically less complicated than geometric objects. That's one reason that this theme. That's one reason that this theme keeps appearing, I think, in the history of the sector. Okay, so now I made a list of like a bunch of examples of this. And I'm just going to sort of spray the list out here, because I think they establish sort of interesting things. While I'm erasing this board, please feel free to say something or ask a question. I'll wait. What happens when you say singular? Is that a normal? Singular instead of normal? Here? Yeah. It's true more generally than that, but it's just that, okay, that theorem is pretty hard to prove. And so there's a lot of complicated things that have to happen. So like each individual step, you can get away with something weaker, but they, like, it's a forcupine of complexity, and so the cools are all pointing in different directions. So you just, there's one homogenizing. Is one homogenizing hypothesis that handles all the issues for you? Now, maybe that's a pretty bad answer here. A better answer to your question is, if you make it not normal, imagine a normalization of something that has cuspidal singularities, the geometry changes without the topology changing. So you see that something has to be, some hypotheses have to be imposed for there to be anything reasonable about it. That's maybe a better answer to your question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for asking that. All right, so let me start with like the this is this is going to be the least comfortable complete invariant of a geometric object. So making it by the number zero. If x is a compactly generated topological space, I think this is what you need. Okay, I'm not a topologist either. I'm not even sure I'm a mathematician, by the way. Okay, so you can make this. So you can make this thing, which is a total singular complex, singular simplicial set. So you know, the zero simplices are the points, and the one simplices are the one simplicity, and the two simplicies are the two simplicies. And you can assemble this into a simplicial set. You've probably seen this before. Okay, and this is an example. Simplicial sets are a first-order theory. Order theory, right? You're writing down a thing. You have axioms for the thing. You write down the thing. So, topological space, complicated. Simplicial set, less complicated. I get one from the topological space. Okay, and then the simplicial set, and I think I'm doing this in the right order, but someone, I'm always confused about who's eggs or why what's going on. There's a map of this geometric realization of this thing that is a Humptop equivalence. That is a Homotopy equivalence. And by the way, this is a beautiful way. You can then produce the singular homology as the cellular homology of the CW complex that you have here. That inverts the order that we usually learn things when you read Hatcher or whatever, but it makes much more sense rather than doing cellular homology with the spectral sequence of a filtered space. It all makes sense for this point of view. But this is in some sense telling us that the formation of this simplicial set is algebraic invariant of the topological space. This algebraic invariant of the topological space is complete, it characterizes the topological space in this very strong way in the Homotopy category. I think that's a cool example because a little bit out of what we are usually thinking about in moderate geometry. Zero, one. Now this belongs squarely in our wheelhouse. What's a wheelhouse? Anyway, that's my question for you is what's a wheelhouse? What's the deal? Veblen and Young, this is about 100 years ago. So I think this took place between 1914 and 1918. I mean, it was a continuous stream of papers and thinking and books and whatever. They tried to understand the essence of linear geometry. This is part of the gradual movement toward axiomatization that happened between the mid-19th century and the first part of the century. Mid-19th century and the first part of the 20th century. And one of the ripe targets for this was projective geometry, because there had been a ton of work on that going back centuries. It's a foundational subject in all sorts of areas. And they thought about what it really means to take the projected space of a vector space over a field. So V is some vector space over a field K, and the dimension of V is at least 3. Otherwise, we're going to run through a similar kind of degeneracy problem we had to before. NRC problem we had before what dimensional scheme is. And it could be infinite dimensional, by the way. I don't mean, this doesn't have to be finite dimensional. It's just something which is dimensional. These three. So they were thinking, what does linearity mean? What is linearity? Okay, and they came up with the following idea. Linearity is about the lines. It's about collinearity. So from this, can you pull out? So this has some rich linear structure. I've got linear subspaces. All linear algebra applies here. Linear algebra applies here to generate what I would call like the linear geometry, you know, sort of one of the basic geometries, linear geometry. But what if you just keep the set of points, and I don't know how to actually how to say this right, points of PKD. So this is just, this is a set, okay? Plus a collinearity relation. So this is a turnaround relation. You take three points and you ask, are they collinear? Are they collinear? If you like, you could also say, I take the set of points and I take the set of lines. Then that's all I keep. That's all I keep. I don't keep the field, I don't keep the vector space, right? You see what I'm saying here? Okay, and what they proved is their theorem says if I have two such things, they say more than this, but one conversion, one particle. They proved, given two, Given 2, so we've got kv k prime v prime. And let's give this a name. Let's call this p. Excuse me. My great power with chalk is to strongly public. So p, let's call this p of, I don't know, p sub, oh, this is going to be very p sub k of v. This is going to be the set of points and lines. And lines without the field or V. So if I take two pairs, field vector space, any isomorphism, so any line-preserving bijection from PK of E to PK prime B prime uniquely linearizes to a map from the bold PK of V, the bold PK prime of V prime isomorphism of schemes, if you like. And the classical way of saying that is obviously not to say it that way, it is to say that what you end up with is an isomorphism of the fields together with the semilinear isomorphism of the fields. A semilinear isomorphism of the vector spaces. So an isomorphism from P to K prime by phi, an isomorphism from P to V prime, which is P linear, such that, I don't know what to call this F, and let's call this gamma. F is induced by gamma. Does this make sense? And actually, you know, what they really proved. Actually, you know, what they really proved is just starting with one of these structures that is an abstract projective structure, so it says a set of points and lines that satisfy sort of the natural axioms. Any two points are on a unique line, every line has at least three points, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You can actually reconstruct a field in a vector space so that the thing itself becomes isomorphic to vector space that you get this way. The abstract vector vector space. Yes. You can do more than this. You can do more than this. You can't do arbitrary maps. You can do embeddings. And one way you know that a theory is good is that there's like hodge-podge results that tell you that you haven't really folded out everything. Okay. So another way to re, I mean, one way you could rephrase this, which makes it look more more. makes it look more, makes it look similar to the thing I started with is that you can also, you could define a sort of topology of linearity. And so if I start with this projective space, what I can pull out is this point set again. And then it has a topology, so this So, it is generated by linear subspaces. So, here I'm in. You said these are closed. You've got to pay attention to what you're doing. Maybe the vector space should be finite-dimensional and whatever. But the point is, you can rephrase a bunch of this by saying you get out a topological space, and that topological space is a complete invariant. It's a if you have a homeomorphism with the topological spaces, you get an isomorphism with this view. So, you could rephrase it so that it looks very similar to the variant upset. Very similar to the thing that I said. It's sort of the first example of an algebra-geometric reconstruction type of result, like I said, about a century ago. Okay, and of course the great miracle, as has come up several times already, is where is the field? Where is the field? Where is the field? Well, we know where the field should be. Now, what is k? K should be the point of one line. Of one line, you know, without infinity. These are supposed to be projective lines. If you take one point, they throw it away. But then actually, take another two points, just call them zero and one. And then the challenge is like, you've got to make the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication satisfying all the axioms. And the beautiful thing is that these are encoded in these classical multi-century-old results, something called Desarik's theorem and Pappus's theorem, but Desar's theorem is now a configuration. Configuration. There are geometric properties of lines and so on that actually build the arithmetic results, the arithmetic operations for you. And in fact, I would argue that this is one of the birthplaces of modern model theory because what's happening is you're making a structure and then you're showing how to interpret a field of the structure. And that theme has run throughout model theory in the last century as far as like, oh, all sounds. At the time, they didn't say it that way. It didn't happen until the 30s and 40s. Okay. Okay. I'm going to pause again. I'm going to get your feelings. Should we talk about topological spaces or a little bit of linear geometry? Now let me tell you something that you learn as children. And this is the first thing you learn about alternative geometry is another example of this, which ends up Which ends up being reincarnated in a whole bunch of different ways. So I just want to point out this one. Look what the first things you learned about affine schemes. This is going to look totological, but it will sprout into something else in a second. You may recall that affine schemes have this universal property. If I take any locally green space and I map it to spec A, I can pull back global functions. So I get the map. Global function. So we get a map in rings from A to gamma x o x, and this is a bijection. So this is maps of locally ringed spaces. So the amazing thing about spec is that it has a universal property in the category of all locally ringed spaces. But one way you can think about this is it's telling you that the formation of the ring of global functions is a completed variant for affine schemes. Like I said, this is topological. It's like, what is it? Like I said, this sounds topological because what is an app on space? But here's an example: you're pulling a ring out, and that ring completely determines the geometric structure of specific A. But you make it, you know what it is, you know what that is. Now, I want to follow this with a sort of a chain of subsequent results that are increasingly related to this if you say them the right way. So, you know, one thing you can note here is that to give a map, To give a map from A to B, you can also think about giving a map from the module category of A to the module category of B, let's call this B. That maybe preserves tensor products, is a tensor functor, and maybe it has some exactness, some amount of exactness. And then the idea is that sort of the identity Is that sort of the identity in this one little category, we go to the identity, and then you just look what happens at the endomorphism rings. So I can go back and forth between maps of rings and sort of maps of these tensor categories. In some sense, I can think about the module category as like a, I don't know, categorical replacement for the ring itself. And so one might wonder if there's a more general, see, I can always do this, I can imagine, like, what if I just. I can imagine, like, what if I just played x and y? I could think about the module category over O Y, I think the module category over O X, and I could think about tensor functors plus some kind of exactness. So, in other words, I can wonder if sort of every scheme is affine in the sense of this categorical version of the shift of brain, the categorical version of goal of functions. And this is turned. And this turns out to be very true. I mean, true in many situations. Maybe I should say partially true. Sorry. But let me tell you sort of a stream of results that kind of led in that direction indirectly with this time. So perhaps the most famous one, the earliest one, it was early and then it was late because it happened several times in different ways. It's not called the Galvio-Rosenberg theorem. And what does that say? In its current form, and maybe I'll put the last. In its current form, and maybe I'll put plus plus, I think Rondenberg has a paper about this where he removes some of the hypotheses that even Rosenberg had to keep, who removed many of the hypotheses that God Real had. So if X and Y are quasi-separated schemes, oh, and then there's a paper by Calabrese and one or more other people, where they do this more generality by a completely different method if they don't have to express it. But it goes like this: take two quantities separated schemes. Take two quasi-separated schemes, and I look at their categories of quasi-coherent sheaves. So forget about the monoidal structure, but the price I'm going to pay for that is I'm only allowed to consider equivalences. Then what I get out is an isomorphism. And maybe you're more familiar with the sort of easiest version is if I have. The easiest version is if I have coherent sheaves, I can have a reasonable thing, I don't know, something predictive rights, or something that makes you comfortable, but that doesn't matter that very much. I can make the scheme out of the category. I can, you know, you look at it. Do I even remember how this works? You find the points, you make the topological space, you can figure out what object the line bundles, you can eventually reconstruct the structure sheath. I don't know if you've ever seen this proof. If you haven't seen it, one fun thing to do is to just try to work this out yourself. So reconstruct. yourself. So reconstruct x from cox. Okay, it's not trivial, but it's not that bad. You can physically, and so the thing I have written here with constructible sheets, that gives you back the topological space, and then via this mysterious thing, you get the whole scheme back. Here it's actually quite direct. You can make the scheme, in a sense of the ring space, it is a scheme, out of the category from here and changing it. Okay. So that's like the first version of trying to figure out how Like the first version of trying to figure out how to give this sort of universal athleticness schemes. And then now the path diverges slightly, and then it'll come back around. So let me tell you, if you take this idea, but you move it into a place where it doesn't, where you're sort of one stacky level up, but then you say things completely differently because you aren't a stacky person, and you also aren't an algebraic geometer, and you get this. So, Tanaka and Krine, first Tanaka and then Krine. What I'm going to say I think is really what Tanaka proved. So, roughly speaking, it says a compact topological group, I think I mean Hausdorff when I say this, G, is uniquely determined by, I'll tell isomorphism about that. I'll isomorphism. By its category of finite-dimensional complex representations. And this has been used to great effect. And there's more general versions of this that don't only work in the category of complex topological groups. You could look at algebraic groups and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the idea here is that, again, you make the group, you think about G as sort of the automorphism. Think about G as sort of the automorphisms of this functor, the forgetful functor from representations to vector spaces. And then you have to figure out how to put the topology on it, and so on. But there's some way you can actually make the group again from the category of representations. Now, I don't know why that seems, oh, why is this at all related to this thing I was saying over there and this thing I erased over here? Ref G is equal to the category of coherent sheaves. Is equal to the category of coherent sheaves on BG. So they were actually thinking about this question of how to make something universally, how to make something affine, categorically affine, but for a certain stack. And people gradually realize that that's what was really going on here. So now there's this sort of kind of industry of trying to figure out the right context for these results. So I don't know. As many people thought about this at the time. About this over time. We bought Alfred Leisner. Sorry, my handwriting is really bad. I had Alfred Leisner as an undergrad. He was a good undergrad. Alfred, Paul, and Rid, lead. I thought about this a bit. I thought about this a bit with Albert. I don't know. A million people have thought about things like this. But what ends up happening, if you sort of smash all these things together, here's what ends up being true. For many spaces, types of spaces, X and Y any and many types of models. Types of modules. M, if I have a tensor functor, I don't know how to say this, mx to my, an exact enough tensor functor, any, let's see, any tension function like this is isomorphic. Is isomorphic to m upper star for some f from y to x. Okay, so kind of the ultimate meeting point of the Tom Key Krine thing, and in some sense the zebra version of the Galvio-Rosenberg thing and the universal property of affine schemes is this. The module category, you know, you can take the category of all OX modules, you can take linear Ox modules, quasiminario X modules, you get it perfect. Modules, quasi-minor analytics modules, you get perfect complexes, there's an affinity category. There's many different versions of this. I'll come to one in a second that's a shadow of this with derived categories. The tensor category is like the structure sheet, affine scheme. It's like the ring for an affine scheme, and then these tensor functions correspond to the maps. So, in that sense, this category is a complete invariant. In a very strong sense, you get all the maps, not just the isomorphisms. Yeah, I just guess it was a bit of a mess. Yeah. You have to prove that I guess that any two fiber functors are. Well, I think what they proved is this, what I wrote. That there's... But given the fiber functor. Yeah, but in this case, there's a canonical fiber functor, which is the forgetful functor. This is what the original work was. I guess I think it is. My question is what do you mean by the category finite dimensional representations? Because an abstract tensor category you don't have the proper oh oh yes sorry so if you take the actual category of actual representations and then use it with its canonical fiber functor, I think what Tanaka actually did is he was like, look, a representation is a representation. It has an underlying vector space. That's what it is. He showed that you can recover the topological group from this The topological group from this, from this. Then Krein figured out: what is the abstract underpinning of all this? And that started the story that you're talking about. And of course, this culminates much later with gerbs of fiber functors, and it gets much more sophisticated. But in its simplest form, it's just, you know what a representation has an underlying vendor space. Yeah, I'm just quibbling with the statement, I think. Oh, about the. And it's not just about the category, it's also about the category. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Good, yes. Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Good, yes, thank you. Koopals are good. I'll be breakfast cereal. Thank you. Good. Important point. Even though I argue with you, you're quite right. Yeah, so there I think it's well needed three point five, I guess, right? Or some s some statement that says that two fiber partners are local. Two fiber functors are local. I mean, it's true that two fiber functors are isomorphic in this case, but that's a separate theorem, I think. That was my complaint. Yeah, good. Great. Okay, excellent. All right. What am I doing? Oh, okay. So now let me sort of do something that looks either like it's more generally. Usually, that looks either like it's more general than this or less general, depending on which of these references you're going to read. So, what are we saying? The category of coherent sheaves, with or without this tensor structure, is more or less a complete invariant depending on what you mean by that word. Do you want to care about isomorphisms or do you care about morphisms? That's sort of the story that's developed for what we actually is. So, now let me say, this is called five in my notes. This is called five in my notes, but it really should be four. But I'm gonna use this with myself a little bit. So, this is gonna look completely different. But I think this is really kind of one of the key one of the key theorems that underlies a lot of what's happening here, and it has a meaning. So, I'll tell you what I mean it means. So, given smooth, projective x and y, And y any equivalence g of x and d of y is a Fourier type transform. Just like a formula, you can write down what that means. But let me tell you what it really means. Okay, so what it really means. Okay, so what it really means, maybe I should say what it is. Some f of our category product so that phi is isomorphic to what I get if I do r per 2 lower star of your thing, of L per 1 upper star of your thing tensor with L. So whatever, this is just some formula, but what this is actually saying, if you think about what But what this is actually saying, if you think about what is really happening, this looks a lot like a burrito equivalent statement. What it really means is that phi uniquely extends lifts to the DG categories. What is the notation for this? Does any other notation for this? What's the notation for the DG category? Okay, that was too. Okay, let's do DGG of X. What? I can't write that on the board. Okay. So Orlov's theorem that you may or may not have seen in your life is actually telling you that the derived category is a complete invariant for the DG category associated to X with respect to equivalences. And the DG category is sometimes viewed as sort of like some, it's closer to X itself. It's closer to X itself. It's a first order figure. You might get confused if I try. Now you might wonder: is, oh, and maybe I should say there's more that they prove in this line of reasoning. Vladimir Morlov. So I guess what I'm saying is, sorry, sorry. A little clearer here. All the theorems that you see in classical theorems are written in these terms, in terms of d of x, terminals. Kernels or whatever. But keep in mind that what we're allowed to prove is that what we're really talking about is this drive, is this category, this DG category of drive. But anytime I write down an equivalence like this, I'm really talking about an equivalence of these dg categories. And so you can ask yourself, to what extent is the DG category a complete invariant of X? Or the drive category, the sort of equivalence, equivalence. So Bondo and Orlov, they sort of kick this off with this beautiful result. If the canonical class of X is ample. class of X is ample or anti-ample, then any equivalence induces an isomorphism. And that looks a lot like Gabrielle Rosenberg theorem and the other thing I wrote down about constructible sheaves and stuff like that. That I, if I have an equivalence, I get an isomorphism. So it looks like a complete invariant. And again, it's a beautiful paper. I want you to read it. Prove this beautiful paper. Everyone should read it at least once in their lives. It constructs x from its ref category using the amplitude. I mean, that tells you what the ser functor is. It has all sorts of properties. You can get the points and whatever, the topological space in the sheet of reference. But, as many people have shown, many times, started with Mukai, I think, and continued by tons of people over time, all of whom are amazing mathematicians. I'm not saying that, but I just don't have the full list of all the people who thought about it. Well, I just don't have the full list of all the people who thought about this. If kx is arbitrary, in other words, if we don't assume anything about it, there are tons of examples where this fails. There are many examples of d of x equivalent to d of y, but x is not isomorphic to y. There's tons of examples of that. The most famous example, the reason why. The most famous example, the reason this is called the Fourier McCullough transform, being an abelian variety and it's dual. A, A dual. That sort of kicked off this whole long line of reasoning. Now, what did we say before? Let's see, we had the category of quasi-communicable sheaves, and we had isomorphisms, and then GMOS isomorphisms, and equivalent to Z isomorphism. Now we've got the drive category. Now we've got the derived category, and sometimes equivalences give us isomorphisms, and sometimes they don't. But then we had this other thing that was the tensor structure that told us that if we made it look more affine, we would get more universality. And so this is something that is another kind of long chain of results. It's related to both number 3.5 and number 5. And that is number 6. Okay. And this is something I think really initiated by Vomiter, but I hope someone. Initiated by Balmer, but I hope someone will tell me if I have the history wrong. That's fine. It's better to tell me than just be mad. So here's what Balmer proved. And there's many other things in this chain of math, some X and Y are schemes with Netherian topologies. This does not mean they're Netherian schemes. Then any equivalents d of x and d of y of tensor triangulated categories again induces an isomorphism for x to y, again by reconstructing x from g of x for the sex destruction. Some geometric sensor structure using thick subcategories and whatever kind of basically build prime ideals. And I should say that the Vought-Half-Leissner version of this and some of the Albert-Hall Lee stuff and some of the Lurie stuff is about the category of modules being the infinity category, the DG category, the tensor probability. And so Balmer kind of started out this story that then dovetailed with his older story like crossing here and sheaves and the sort of newer version of the sort of infinity. And the sort of newer version of the sort of infinity categorical formulation of things to kind of grow together into this bigger picture about the tensor category being like the ring for a half on the screen, giving us what we have there. A comment about history. Can you say again? You want to comment about the history? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, oh, okay. Ballmer definitely was developed far more when this sort of idea emerged, but both of them about the same time. Great, thank you. Good. I appreciate it. Thank you. Good. I appreciate that. Okay. When do I stop doing this? You started at 10 pasts. Okay. Let me... I was going to mention the Torelli theorem and here. Now I have to make a decision. Okay. My decision is I'm going to just keep saying things until the hook comes out and pulls me off. I mean, uh. Let me know. What? And tell the audience to let me know. If you just get up and walk away, I'll stop talking. All right. So that's kind of a long chain that I think is all related to the first theorem you've ever learned in algebraic geometry, which is that the ring of functions is the same thing as an affi scheme. That's how the calculation is doing. All of that's all. Than doing all that stuff. There's a different direction that I think is also interesting. This is number four. Can I ask a question about the automotive category? Please, please. Suppose you know that on the derivative category it's compatible with the tensor struct. Yeah? Do you know that the DG lift if it's If it's if it's maybe I just know it's given by an export um I have no idea. Do you know? Does anyone know? It seems like you need to get back to the other thing. If you say all the things, it seems like it must be relative to something, right? And then you know what these things are. They're basically maps. So then from that thing architect, it's quite a different architecture. Yes, but I think there's also something that says that when you do this, it's unique. I don't know who. There's like a unique enhancement. That's what there's There's like a unique enhancement. There's a bunch of results saying that the enhancements are unique. So once you know through this other thing that there is an enhancement that respects the tensor structure on the DG category, then it has to be the only one that also looks at the other thing. I guess my question is, should one interpret this Balmer theorem from the Lukian theorem? Think of it as an Orlov theorem with probably, yes. I'm not the world's expert on this, but it. Is it? No, go ahead. No, go ahead. No, no, I don't want to speak for you. What am I doing? Yeah, go ahead. Maybe it's a question for later. Okay. All right, so number four. This is less ostensibly algebraic, and as I said, a little bit less first order, so a little bit more mysterious. And the reason I'm bringing this one up is it unlike, basically everything I've shown you has the property that it's constructive. When you have the thing, you can make the scheme. The one I started with, you can't actually do that. So here's one that, well, the way I'm literally about to rally, started out this whole chain of reasoning. But when you prove, I mean, okay, you proved two different. I mean, okay, you proved two different. I'm gonna say it the way that he didn't say it. So a compact Greenman surface is determined by the hot structure, which is to say the hot structure in H1 of X is really to say IP. Way to say IP the Jacobian. The polarized hot structure because the Jacobian has a principal polarized variety. Now, here, let's see here. I think what I'm saying is true. You can't just make the curve from the Jacobian. I don't think that's something that you can do constructive, but I've never seen a construction of the curve from its Jacobian. What? Then what do you do? Do you intersect some things together? Do you do something similar? Intersect some things together? Do you do something special? Yeah, as a principal polarizer being working. Yeah. I think you take the support of the Fourier-Loka transform of the polarization. Ah, and then that gives you the curve back. Yeah. Oh, interesting. I forgot to remove one off. Oh, okay, okay. So this is more constructive than I thought it was. It's a very nice proof of the tool I've been using this. Ah, oh, cool. Okay, maybe I'll look for this. I'll talk to you. Okay, maybe I'll look for this. I'll talk to you about what the reference is. I mean, ostensibly, this doesn't look constructive because it looks like it's saying that the moduli space of curves is embedded in the moduli space of varieties, but maybe it's not clear to me, it was clear to Orlov, how to actually make the curve out of its Jacobian or out of its construction. And there's two things that this birthed that I just want to mention that this will actually return to the original framing of everything. So the first Everything. So the first is, so four things seven, which is, you know, what do you do? One thing about this is that it requires you to understand, have available singular cohomology, so it only works over the complex numbers. So what's an adequate replacement for the Hodge structure, and you're saying characteristic P? So here's a conjecture that Martin and I formulated a long time ago that we have not. That we have not been able to prove. We can prove it in a bunch of cases, but we can't prove it in general, and we also can't get anybody else to prove it either. If you start with x and y, so given smooth projective x and y, if I have an equivalence from g of x to g of y, now we know that this is not going to. Now we know that this is not going to say anything about xy being nice. This is not going to tell us about xyzomorphic. Okay. But we also know it's given by a kernel, and so there's an induced map on shadow theory. And now shadow theory has an actual filtration on it by codimension. So if the induced map respects the codimension filtrations, then x and y should be birational. X and Y should be by rational. Okay, so we can prove this for a bunch of. We started out doing this for K-3 surfaces because we're trying to study there for you, but Kuiper does for K-faces P. But this feels a lot like this, where you replace the cohomology with its Hodge filtration, the draft category with its corresponding filtration on the child theory. That's sort of like the equivalent of the equivalence? No? No? What do I want to say? You asked me if I want to say what this induced map is? No, what the what the I mean the numerical equivalent is oh oh oh for the chalculinity? Yeah. Sure. Should we say numerical equivalents? Okay. Fine. Is that good? Is that doing good? Right, right. Doesn't matter. How much do we care? Stronger statement. Yes. Stronger statement. Yes. Martin is pointing out that we should make the weakest version of child theory to make it the best possible statement of this injection. Good. Okay, so one kind of Torelli shadow is like, is there something like this that's true? So one way to rescue the derived, the deficiencies in the derived equivalence world is to add the tensor structure. I'm saying another way that we think at least works by rationally is to add the sort of filtration structure. The sort of filtration structure. There's a fencer product, but now there's a sort of filtration. Seems like that should give my rationality. It's hard to prove. There's another totally bizarre-looking but amazing reflection on the Torelli theorem, the outshare context, the Vogomola prototype in Chickol. Vogoma KorotiF And then silver, and it goes like this, right? If you start with C over K, so K is an algebraically closed field, C is a curve, you can think about the Jacobian as a set. So you can do this. You can take A to be the k points of the Jacobian of C. You can take S to be the k points of C. To be the k points of so that you can pick one of C. And inside of S, you can take T to be the image of C of K in S. So every point of the curve gives me a divisor of degree 1. So what do I have here? I have an amelior group, I have an A torsor, and I have a distinguished subset. Okay? That's what I get out of here. I get this sort of A S T and this thing they call the abstract Jacobian. You say I've thrown away the geometric structure. I've thrown away everything except for this set-theoretic incarnation. And Boca Molo query Taiya Michiko asked to what extent And Boca Moller Kurt Techniciko asked to what extent this determines the curve. What Zilber proved is, using some serious model theory, is that AST is abstract Jacobian, the abstract Jacobian determines the scheme C. It's a completed variant. This abstract incursion. It's a complete invariant. This abstract incursion of the Jacobian is a complete invariant of a curve of an algebraic closed field. Really cool. And again, the key is: you look at this thing, you're like, where is the field K? Where is the field K? It's a similar problem. Again, I've got a group, a set. Take away any of one of these parts. It's not going to work. But again, there's one of these amazing magical things that happens where you can interpret a field as a structure. That's the model theory. The field and the structure, that's where the model theory comes in, using a very difficult result of the image, building up decades of work by Zolberchowski and others. That gives you the field, and then you use, like, you know, you gradually build up the Jacobian of the actual Jacobian, and then you use the actual Terovian. That sort of replica. Okay. Now, if you look at this for a second, you start to realize that this abstract Jacobian is actually encoding something slightly different. So there's a sort of rephrasing of what the abstract Jacobian is. There's a rephrasing of what the abstract Jacobian is. The abstract Jacobian is equivalent to this. And this is one of the things that Zilber realized when he started writing this out model theoretically to really encode the structure of the model theory. It's equivalent to keep the underlying topological space of C and the linear equivalence relation on the visitors. Okay, now maybe it's hard to see why that is, but if you imagine, you know, these are the points. If I know when two points are linearly equivalent, then I can sort of figure out what sums of points are linearly equivalent. And so what that's really telling us is we keep the topological space and the linear equivalent relation on divisors. That's the same thing as keeping the center actually coping. And Zilbert tells us, using model theory, open algebraically closed field for a curve, that gives us back the curve. So here's this general, I don't know. So here's this general, I don't know, result that I first, this is what I first proved with Martin years ago. This is true for, if x is any nice enough, variety of dimension at least 2, then if I take a topological space together with linear equivalence, this is a completed variant of x. So, this is like an upside-down version of the Turelli theorem. Instead of keeping the classical topological space as some of the geometry and the cohomology, you keep this Risky topological space, which is just the post-set of algebraic cycles, and this linear equivalence, which is like the first turn classical. This is a complete invariant. This is the appropriate generalization of this business, this build of all of prototype machine learning. And the amazing thing is, in dimension two and high, you don't need model theory. This works over, you don't need the field view algebraically closed. Server, you don't need the field to be algebraically closed. You need much less. All you need is algebraic geometry. Why am I saying that to you? Because then 10, we showed this to Janos, and he realized that you can reconstruct, I'm going to be done in just a second, you can reconstruct equivalence from Equivalence from a topological space. Which is not easy, and I'm happy to tell you at some point about some of the ideas that go into this. And so then it turns out if you put all this stuff together, you only need x. And that is the theorem that I started with. And there I will conclude. And then I will conclude. Thank you. Last questions? I'd like to remark that it's Beyerson and Polishuk who did this quick proof of the true radic. Who and Polishuk? Balisin and Polishuk. Oh, very nice. Beylansin? You said Beylansin and Polishuk? 1999. Fantastic. Amazing. Thank you. I wanted to ask, so since you kind of came around full circle back to your first statement, so for two you told us that we can get the schemes back from those risky topologies, and then as a corollary, you were getting the schemes back from the con like constructable sheets. And, you know, and the route was to go from like constructable sheets to Structural sheets to root you. But I mean, maybe this is a silly question, but I was a little bit surprised, but any of who is that way around? Is there some work more directly from the construct? We don't have a more direct way to go. But not that we figured it out. But if you think about Gabrielle's theorem, at some point you need to make the functions. Making a topological space you can imagine is not ultra hard. Is not ultra-hard, and it's clever, it's smart. But you sort of try to pick out simple objects or some kind of irreducible object that will sort of give you the coset guy, that is the Zersky topological space. How do I find something that I know categorically is describing an object supported on an irreducible thing with minimal rank? How do we find a line bundle on an irreducible closed subscript? If I can find all the objects like that, then at least I can kind of identify postets, and if I know maps between such objects, then I can figure out the specialist. Between such objects, and I can figure out the specialization relation, so I can kind of reconstruct the topological space relatively straightforwardly, I suppose. But then, how do you get the functions on an open set? So, when you have the category of coherent sheaves, the functions are in there because O is in there and match mode. O, or, you know, if you take line bundles and twist them up and like maps, the coherent structure basically gives you back the function structure. That's sort of built into that category. But with constructible sheaves, the coefficients could be like Z mod L. I mean, you could even just take the Z mod L. I mean, you could even just take the subcategory, Z mod L. And now you have no function structure at all. Where does the function structure come from? So it goes by this incredibly indirect route. We do not have any way of reconstructing the scheme directly, but it seems to be characterized by that category. Thank you for asking that. Can you say about that or not basically organisms? Is there a way to hear me? Yes. I've always wondered, is there a way to translate Zilbert's argument to other than zombie? I don't know anyone. Oh, great question. I'll answer your question in a second. So, we've tried very hard to do this, and we have failed. But one thing worth noting, the one thing we've succeeded at doing, to show The one thing we've succeeded at doing is showing that this is false over other fields, or not over all other fields. There are counterexamples to this kind of statement over other fields. There are not counterexamples to this statement. Oh, and then you can't see. There you go, there you go. There are not counterexamples to this statement over other fields. They're not counterexamples. But there are counterexamples to this one over other fields. Right? So, hold on, very strong. So, um. Was it a bad the other field? Was it a value field or a mass field field? No, no, no, the function field of mg. The universal curve violates this, basically. That's what happens. Two universal curves, because the universal curve doesn't have enough Picard group, for the Picard group, for linear equivalents to actually tell you much. You basically just have this RC topological space, which is almost nothing, because it's just an infinite set with a co-finite topology. So what happens is when there's too much monodromony, you don't have enough Picard to get enough linear. To get enough linear equivalence to even hope to reconstruct anything. So it's not a weird, it's just the universal curve, it's a counterexample. But that tells us that there is something really different happening here than what's happening here. So one of our goals is to understand really what is going on here. We haven't yet understood. So that does that that kind of addresses your question, I think. Great. Thank you for asking that. That's the one I do. That's the one I'm doing. Now, your question was: what about maps that are not equivalent, not isomorphisms here? And the only answer that I've been able to think of, and I haven't really written this down, is if you start over algebraically closed field, then finding atomorphisms should be something you can cover. But there's a fundamental problem that see linear equivalence does not behave well with respect to pullback in general. So, the most you could hope for, I would guess, at first is something about flat morphisms, maybe. But it's really hard to tell how to really transport linear equivalence backwards. That becomes the sticking point. I think we start again, let's say at 10:40.
