Is Otis Chodos from Stanford, and he'll talk about mean curvature flow of generic low entropy initial data. Otis, thanks. Thanks very much. So I've never given a talk in this format. So in case, particularly the people in Banff, if my handwriting becomes too bad, please just shout me down. And so what I'm going to talk about is joint with Kyung-Si Choi, Christos Manpalibis. Politis and Felix Schultz. All right, great. Okay, so I think we're all familiar with the concept of mean curvature flow. So for me, I'll only talk about mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces. Not to say the other situations are not interesting, but that's what I'll have to say about. Have to say about. And so obviously, if you take a closed embedded hyper service and you flow it, it'll eventually become singular, right? Okay. And so then, as I think everyone is aware, in general, the singularities could be quite complicated, right? So we, I think it's fair to say. I think it's fair to say that we don't know that much about the general situation of like what could the general sort of singularities look like. And what I would like to talk about is the following question, which I think is pretty well known among people. Of course, I'm not claiming to answer this question, but I'll at least. This question, but I'll at least talk about some recent progress. Okay, so obviously, I have to tell you what a generic initial data means, and then I should state the theorem. But so let me just say so, at least maybe Gerhard can correct me if I. Maybe Gerhard can correct me if I've got this wrong, but at least Ilmanen attributes this conjecture to Gerhard. And so. And so conjecturally, at least for a generic choice of initial data, only cylindrical singularities should appear. Okay. So I don't know if that's if you want to. If that's uh, if you want to disagree with that, but maybe that's in two dimensions, I may have said something like that, okay? Okay, so all right, and so since since I'm attributing things to people who may or may not have said them, I'm going to add a little bit to this conjecture. This is probably due to Brian White. So you might also dream that in the in the BRACI flow setting, there's only multiple steam one in this. Setting, there's only multiple steam one in the singularities as well. Okay, so um, okay, so I it's it's not exactly clear the provenance of this conjecture, but in any case, um, the uh there's quite a good reason for dreaming of proving such a thing. Um, so in Alex's talk yesterday, he talked about the mass drop. Um, and so in his talk, he talked about showing there's no mass drop in particular for such flows. Drop in particular for such flows. Other consequences is following. So if you have only these sorts of singularities, then the stratification theorem of white and then the refined versions of by Kolding and Minikozzi tell you the singular set is really, really small under this situation. Set is really, really small under this situation. I mean, as small as you can hope for. And then Troy Hasselhoffer Herskovitz, and also with White showed that if you have such a flow, then the flow is well posed in a certain sense. So the weak flow is essentially. In a certain sense, so the weak flow is essentially unique. And I guess at the moment, this is known for k equals n minus one, but I'm hoping they can do everything eventually. So we'll see. And so in particular, so these are some reasons why you might dream of studying generic, so this generic mean curvature flow problem. And so historically, I should mention the sort of the pioneering work here. The sort of pioneering work here. And so, Kaulding and Nikozi essentially solved this problem in the linearized regime. And so they developed a notion which they called entropy stability. And they proved that this implies that an entropy stable shrinker or singularity model implies that you have non-existent. Implies that you have non-negative mean curvature, and then by Gerhard's classification, this implies that you're a cylinder. Okay, and then I guess Kohli Minikozi removed a technical hypothesis from that. Okay, so this is kind of the linearized version. And okay, I should, but as we'll see, well, I'm not going to talk too much about this result. I'm not going to talk too much about this result because it seems quite hard to localize this theorem. And so, this entropy stability actually is going to be lurking behind what I talk about today, but it's not going to be like obviously the main mechanism. So, if I have time at the end, I'll maybe discuss the differences. And so, in case you don't know what the entropy is, I should just say because I'll refer to it. So for M n in R n plus one So, one way to define entropy is just that it's the optimal. Oh, I guess I mean soup, don't I? So it's. So it's the optimal Gaussian area over all scalings and translations. Okay. And so by Huskins bonded to C. So entropy always goes down along the curvature flow. Okay. Okay, so are there questions? Okay, so that's good. And so Okay, so that's good. And so here's the theorem that I'll talk about today. So there's going to be some constant epsilon naught so that for any closed embedded any closed embedded three manifold in R4 so that lambda of m is less than or equal to the entropy of m is less than or equal to the the bubble sheet okay um then there exists m prime which is a small c infinity graph over m Over m, and I should say arbitrarily small, okay, such that the mean curvature flow of m prime has only spherical, like only s3, s2 cross r, s1 cross r2, and all with multiple c1 singularities. Okay? Okay, so under this low entropy assumption, then the theorem that we prove is that indeed only these singularities arise. So the multiplicity one here is not, I mean, this is sort of a scam statement, right? Because obviously they have to have multiplicity one by the entropy condition. So we're not ruling out multiplicity one in any real sense. We're just assuming it away, basically. Okay, so I don't want to lie about our theorem. Our theorem. But I guess the interesting point is that this assumption is actually relatively large in this business because actually you can be above the entropy of the bubble sheet, which is kind of interesting here. Okay. And so after we wrote this paper, Felix's student proved a very nice theorem, which is the following. Which is the following. So if lambda of m is less than or equal to lambda of s1 plus r2, then perturb to m prime. And there exists a mean curvature flow with surgery starting at M prime. Right? So I think this is a Right. So I think this is a really nice result. And so he, you know, his essentially that what he proved more precisely is that if there's a flow with only S3 and S2 cross R1 singularities with multiple C1, then there exists a mean terms of flow with surgery. Okay. And oh, yeah, sure. Sorry, just to make sure I'm thinking about this right. So in that theorem, would you expect that this Would you expect that this perturbation is necessary under the entropy assumption? So, some example. Oh, sure. So, okay, I guess, like under this assumption. So, I guess we don't strictly speaking know, because I guess there's no shrinkers in R4 explicitly known below this condition, but there's no reason to believe that they don't exist. Like, so that's a good question. So, like, star doesn't. So, like star doesn't rule out other shrinkers. But we also don't know any examples, I think. So it's a bit of a funny business, but I think there's good reason to believe that there should exist other shrinkers. So it depends on who you are, but I think it seems likely that there's kind of quite a few shrinkers below this. Some sort of gluing type construction. Yeah. Are gluing type construction, yeah. I mean, it so the difficulty is that Jacob and Lou proved that they should be. Um, so like uh shrinkers below this with this entropy condition should be diffeomorphic to R3. So there's some kind of like wiggled, wiggled R3. But I think it's it's kind of plausible to imagine that such a thing exists. Um, it's possible that I mean, it's possible this theorem is vacuous. Um, so yeah, but so we don't have an example, but uh. So we don't have an example, but uh, so I will say that this, if you, if you, you stated this theorem in our in our surfaces in R3, then there is there it you do prove that you can avoid non-trivial singularities. So I'll just say like in R3. So if you have m in R3 with lambda of m less than equal to two, then you can you can perturb so that the uh the the there are um only s1 cross like only s1 cross r and s2 singularities and there there's definitely some shrinkers below um n should be two like the uh or yeah yeah sorry the angular torus for example has n should be less than two so there are there are shrinkers i don't know how many of them there are but yeah that that's a that's a fair thanks yeah no problem any other questions Any other questions? Okay, so I'll just say sort of the application of Daniel Holgate's theorem is that, again, he has this very nice corollary. Okay, and so what he proves is that if you have M3 embedded in R4 with entropy below the bubble sheet or less than or equal to the bubble sheet, but of course he immediately perturbs this as a strict inequality. So it's not. Is a strict inequality, so it's not so you really avoid the bubble sheet for the statement. Then you're isotopic to the round S3, and so this sort of you know, this bound improves the low entropy condition in Bernstein. So, I think maybe Lou, I'm not sure what Lou will talk about, but maybe she'll talk about their work on the low entropy Schoenfleys theorem. And so, Daniel Holgate showed that actually you can weaken the entropy assumption a little bit and do a bit sort of work with a bit higher entropy condition. Okay. And so, obviously, once you have a mean curvature flow with surgery, many people have shown that you can take the mean curvature flow with surgery. You can take the mean curvature flow with surgery and turn it into an isotopy. So, several people in the audience, physically, even, and some, I think, remotely. Okay, so great. So, what I'd like to talk about in my remaining time is just a bit of the strategy of the proof. And so, and I And I'd also like to kind of explain a bit about the difference between this theorem and we have another paper where you use kind of different techniques, although related, to prove something similar, but different. So this gets kind of potentially a little confusing. And so the first choice, the first question, I guess, is sort of like, how do you talk about generic in this problem? Okay. So if you start with your initial surface, well, then Your initial surface, well, then what does it mean to perturb the initial surface? How do you know where to perturb? And so, our answer, which is kind of simple once you see it, is that you should take the initial surface and embed it in some foliation locally nearby and flow all of them at once. Okay. And so the hope is that for good S. S M T S is better. Okay, so that's just that's going to be the theme. So maybe the mean curvature flow of this starting hypersurface is quite bad, but if you choose an S at random or a generic S in some sense, maybe life is better. Okay. And so let me show you now how this leads to the study study. The study of ancient flows. Okay, so it's, I mean, it's well known that singularity analysis in geometric flows should be related to the study of ancient geometric flows, but this leads to a particular type of ancient flow, which is a bit interesting here. And so let me kind of draw this funneling picture. Okay, so suppose that we take our initial surface and we flow it. This is supposed to be my pictogram. And instead, we also take this M0 S and we flow it. Okay. And so I should say that M T S are disjoint as S varies with T fixed, right? That's the state of. With T fixed, right? That's just the avoidance principle. So I should have said this up here. So when you start with two disjoint hypersurfaces, they remain disjoint on the mean curvature flow, even if you use weak solutions, et cetera. And so that's going to be the key sort of technical tool that we use. So here's my picture. So it's not totally misleading because indeed, I know these flows are disjoint. And so let me choose SJ, which are converged. Which are converging to zero. Okay. And I suppose that I have some singular points for the SJ flow. Okay. And so, of course, I can assume that XJ Tj converge to 0, 0, which is in the singular set to M 0. Sorry, to M. zero to sorry to m zero to the original flow okay there's some there's some issue because there might be non-uniqueness but i'm just i'm going to ignore this possibility okay so let's assume that there's there's only a there's a you know a unique flow coming out of n0 and so what i would like to do so i i first i've i've taken a limit of these singular points assume that they converge to the to the origin and obviously the origin has to be singular the limit of singular points is singular and then i want What I want to do is, I want to rescale so that these singular points are at a unit distance. Okay, so if I rescale around the origin, so the see. So if I rescale M zero around zero, zero, I limit. Zero, zero, I limit to a tangent flow to the original flow. Right, so if I if I have the central flow, I'm rescaling around the origin. The original flow limits to a tangent flow, and then the flow on the right limits, well, it doesn't necessarily limit to a limit to a tangent flow right because i'm i'm changing the well i'm changing the flow at each step even right not just the base point uh well not the base point but the flow but this limits to some ancient flow okay and the key is that because these flows were originally disjoint then this flow uh i think m tilde lies Tilda lies on one side of the tangent flow. Okay, and so that's going to be sort of the crucial ingredient that we have to work with. Okay. All right. Is that okay? Okay. And so if you remember, right, I was hoping that this singular set of the nearby flows was better. Singular set of the nearby flows was better than the central singular set. So, my dream is: let's first, instead of proving this at the level of the singular set of the nearby flow, let's first prove it at the level of the ancient flow. So, your dream is that the ancient flow on one side of my shrinker is better behaved than. Than just the shrinker itself. Okay. And so, well, the I think there's, I mean, there's a few ways to do this, but one option is to show that actually you can classify these. These one-sided ancient flows. Okay, so perhaps just by the nature of being ancient, we know that that puts a lot of restrictions on the flow. And lying on one side of a shrinker, maybe you could classify this flow. Or two, you could say M tilde T has some improvement, but don't classify. Classify okay, right? I mean, either you classify m tilde t and you say that then it must be better, or you don't classify it and you say it must be better, or else you don't prove any theorem, right? That's those are kind of the options. Okay, so in I'll just just in case there's some confusion. So our first paper, we we solved number one for Solved number one for certain shrinkers. Okay, so we showed that for certain, in other words, like certain is compact or asymptotically conical, for certain shrinkers, then the then this M tilde t actually is very nice. So it's shrinker. Well, it's unique. And thus, there exists a shrinker mean convex flow. Right. And then, so it is that one. And so shrinker mean convex flows are as good as mean convex flows. So this tells you this ancient flow on one side is really nice. And so this idea is quite analogous to if you. So if you to the work of Hart-Simon, right? So this, I mean, after the fact, it really turns out that it's really the parabolic version of what Hart-Simon do. And so Hart-Simon say that if you lie on one side of a regular area minimizing cone, then any minimal surface is uniquely one of the foliation that they construct. Okay, and so we show basically the same thing in the parabolic. We show basically the same thing in the parabolic setting. And the advantages, well, in R3, as a consequence of this classification, you can see that at a singularity, which is not cylindrical, you see the genus drop. Okay. And that Um, and that, as a sort of a consequence, this is more localized, right? So, you kind of are working around each point. And also, I think this, just the existence of this flow is quite interesting. So, the Hartzeiman foliation has been used in several places by like Tom Elman and Brian White to do interesting things about cones. So, the foliation itself is an interesting object, but the disadvantage. The disadvantage, well, is that it's hard work and you know, need more conditions on sigma. Okay, so you know, the option one can be done. It's it's kind of uh, it's not so easy necessarily. Um, and in general, you know, we don't know how to do it for all shrinkers. Maybe we can hope to do it more, but. hope to do more but the uh the what i want to talk about today is kind of what's a kind of a cop-out um but i want to talk about option two okay so don't prove the full classification but just prove that things get better and i want to talk about two under some low low entropy condition um And so it's going to be much easier. Actually, I can essentially, we'll see how I'm doing on time, but I can essentially give you the proof, the full proof of the theorem that I stated at the beginning. And it's going to work for more shrinkers, right? So remember, we want to understand what happens near certain shrinkers. And so, well, it's better if we can understand near more. And the disadvantage is it gives you less. Is it gives you less information, right? It says that things improve, but you don't know exactly how they're improving. And so it's always better to know more. And it's also harder to localize. Okay, all right. So that's kind of the world that we're living. Okay, so are there any questions about that? Otherwise, I will go back to the theorem. Okay. So here's my picture. Okay. And so I have my. Remember that the setup is: I have my initial surface, I embed in a foliation. In a foliation. And I want to, and I flow all of the foliation at once. And I hope that some MTS are better. Okay. And so how am I going to quantify better? So let me define this quantity. Okay, and so here I'm for this talk, I'm going to ignore issues of non-uniqueness. Actually, non-uniqueness is very easy to handle in this setting. Okay, so we're just going to pretend that everything has unique forward evolution. Sort of like the level set flow doesn't fatten. Like the level set flow doesn't fatten, but let's it doesn't matter in reality. Okay, so for each initial surface, I'm going to flow it, Bracky flow, right, et cetera. And so the quantity that I want to consider is this density condition. So I want to look over all singularities, which are not generic, right? So they're not cylindrical. And I want to take the soup of the Gaussian density at those points. Okay. And so my claim is the following: that there exists epsilon naught and delta, oops, bigger than zero, such that, okay, as long as I started. Started in this low entropy regime, then the limb soup of this density quantity as I limit in actually drops strictly below the limit, or I mean, like strictly below the value at the place I'm limiting to. The place I'm limiting to. Okay. So, you know, the picture is something like this. Although this picture is kind of wrong, because this is for, so for all S naught near zero. Okay. So this picture holds sort of in some sense, but actually I could then take a point here and then actually it tells me I have to look like this. Okay. This okay, all right, and so uh this implies the theorem, okay, because notice that if D of S is less than or equal to one, then all points which are all points which are not cylindrical have density at most one. Therefore, by Brachy regularity, they're regular points. Right, so what do I do? I start with my, I start at zero, I perturb from one side, that means I must go down, so I get a definite drop. Then I choose something with a definite drop, I choose something again lower and lower and lower, et cetera, right? So if I iterate finitely many times. Okay. Okay, are there any questions about that strategy? Okay, so okay, so there's some assumption missing. I mean, if you start with a smooth I mean, if you start with a smooth flower flow, which only has cylindrical singularities, then the density couldn't drop. Oh, but there's no, I mean, you're souping over an empty set, so it's minus infinity. Oh, oh, thank you. Thanks. Other, I mean, I'm sure there, I guarantee there's an assumption missing, but hopefully it's not seer. It's it's just something technical. But I think that that that should be okay, hopefully. Yeah, yeah. So I don't want to swoop over this, the cylindrical. Over the cylindrical densities. Otherwise, this theorem would definitely break once you hit some generic. I mean, once you hit the cylinders, then you can't prove anything, right? But you can soup away in this way. Okay, so okay, so let's see how you would prove this claim. And so let's reduce it to something about ancient flows. So, okay. So, okay, sorry, let's see our definition. So, what I want to do is actually notice this: the density is upper semi-continuous, so I can choose a point achieving this proof. So, choose like SJ going to S naught and X J T J in the singular set. Right, achieving this maximum density. Actually, you could just do something which achieves it up to a small error. It doesn't really matter. Okay, so then now let's assume. Let's assume that xj tj limits to zero zero. Okay, this is you know, it has some limit up to a subsequence, then I can shift everything so that it limits to the origin. Okay, and then of course, this is going to be in the singular set of m uh and s naught, I guess, right? Okay, so uh Okay. So let's, you know, so here's our, here's our zero zero. Okay, I don't know. I always find these pictures hard to draw. So then rescale by the distance from xj. Distance from xj tj to the origin and past the limit. Okay, so what we get is we get a this flow, right, is converging to a tangent flow. That's what I said at the beginning. So you get a tangent flow. Okay. And then here, this other sided flow, you get. Other sided flow, you get ancient flow on one side. And there's x tilde t tilde with distance one, so that the density of the tangent flow or the ancient flow at x tilde t tilde is equal to the limb soup as j goes to this. Goes to or S oh, sorry as S J as S goes to S naught of these densities. Oh, I'm sorry, struggling today. Okay. Right, so we chose the maximal density points, and then you chose a good sequence so that you're approaching the limb soup, and then density, I guess it could go up, right? I guess it could go up, right? So, density only goes up in the limit, right? Is that clear? So, these are these high-density points, and in the limit, we get this. Okay, so this quantity, let's assume, is bigger than f of sigma minus delta, or I'm going to choose, I haven't chosen delta yet, but okay, you know, you always write the paper in the opposite order. You always write the paper in the opposite order, but here I'll show you how you would choose delta. Okay. And so, right, why is that? Because the density here, this is a possible density at the central flow. And this is controlled by, you know, I've assumed that the Limb suit of the D of S is bigger than D of S naught minus delta, right? And this is bigger than or equal to F of sigma. And this is bigger than or equal to f of sigma because it's a tangent flow to that flow. Okay. Okay. And so, great. Well, now I need to prove that there exists epsilon delta bigger than zero for any shrinker. With Gaussian area less than or equal to lambda for the entropy of S1 cross R2 plus epsilon naught and an ancient RACI flow m tilde on one side. Okay, let me not make that precise, right? You know, you need, you don't. That's precise, right? You know, you need, you don't, it's not quite clear what that means, but it doesn't matter. Sigma. And I'm going to, you know, the Brachi flow will inherit the standard properties of elliptic regularized flow. So it's integral cyclic unit regular, et cetera. Right. And you also can see that the entropy of lambda tilde is going to have to be less than f of sigma. That's a tricky but standard argument. tricky but standard argument. Then the density of x tilde t tilde is less than or equal to f of sigma minus delta. Okay, so this proposition tells us that this can happen. Okay, as long as we chose sigma small. And it's important that we have this delta as being as uniform in the choice of shrinker. In the choice of shrinkers. Okay. So we have our tangent flow, we have an ancient flow on one side. And I want to say that any point in the ancient flow on one side has a definite density drop versus the tangent, you know, versus the tangent flow. Oh, so for all t tilde, not the origin. Okay, so um, well, Well, okay, so as long as you choose epsilon not sufficiently small, then actually this set of shrinkers is compact in C infinity, like C infinity loc. Okay. And so. And so, and even with multiplicity one. So, actually, I can use a compactness argument to assume that delta is equal to zero. Okay, so if I prove this statement for delta equals zero, I can use compactness to get it to get some small delta so that it's true. Okay, so let me see. Let me just rephrase what I want. So, there exists. So, okay. So, the statement that I actually need to prove after I apply some compactness, what I'd like to say. What I'd like to say is that for sigma for is there is there a question? I don't know if there's a title Okay, so So, what I need to show is that there's just some density drop for this one-sided ancient flow. Okay, so using my compactness, this is where low entropy came in, although I didn't really explain that very well. Using low entropy, I just need to prove this sort of qualitative statement, not the quantitative statement. Okay, so here's my shrinker, right? And I have some. Right, and I have some ancient one-sided flow, okay, and I need to show that the density here is strictly less than the Gaussian area of the shrinker, which is equal, of course, to the density of the shrinker flow at zero, zero. Okay. All right. Okay. So. Okay, so assume that this fails, right? So that there's a point equal to f sigma. Okay. Right. And so now actually I claim that m tilde is equal to t tilde. equal to t tilde minus t sigma plus x tilde. So if my my if my proposition fails, actually m tilde is just a shift in space-time of the shrinking shrinker. And so the proof is let sigma tilde be shrinker of tangent flow to m tilde at t equals minus infinity. Okay, so I lie on Okay, so I lie on one side of this tangent flow. I look at the tangent flow at minus infinity. Okay, then I get some shrinker associated with that tangent flow. And so, well, I claim that sigma tilde is equal to sigma. Because in this case, then you're done, actually, because you have equality in the Huskins monotonic formula. And so if not, then I. then either you're in like this picture or you're in this picture right either they cross somewhere or they are disjoint right by the maximum principle and so this can't happen since m tilde was on one side of the of the tangent flow to start with right um so right so this uses the one Okay, so this uses the one-sidedness. And this can't happen. Well, it's just a general fact that two shrinkers have to intersect. So this is the Frenkel property. Okay, so this shows that this is true, and this proves the claim, right? Because we have equality in the Monstic formula. Okay. All right. So now. Okay. So everything boils down to the following. So suppose I have a smooth shrinker, and suppose there's some space-time point, or if I translate the tangent flow associated to the shrinker to that center, then that other flow is weakly lying on one side of my original flow. So the reason you have to assume, you have to allow for weakly lying on one side. Weakly lying on one side is because, well, we started strictly, but then we took a limit. So, strict inequality might limit to a non-strict inequality. Okay. And so the claim is that then sigma is SK times R n minus K. Okay, and so, right, it's clear that the cylinder has this property because, well, you can translate. Because, well, you can translate along the spatial spine, and then you still weakly lie on one side of the cylinder. And even, like, if you take the sphere. So if this is the space-time, like the space-time flow of the sphere, then you can actually translate this flow downwards in space-time and lie on one side, right? That's a nice achievement. Yeah, you have to check. That's a nice treatment. Yeah, you have to check that that works. But actually, what this is saying is that for another compact shrinker, then this you can't do this. Okay, and so I'm kind of nearing the end of the time, but basically I'll try to be to explain. So here's the picture. Well, okay, my picture is long. Okay, so you translate the shrinking flow, and so the Okay. So you find that if you translate this, then you lie on the inside of this, the shrinker. And so if we rescale, time is equal to minus lambda minus two to t equals. minus two to t equals minus one so notice that the the original the original tangent flow is is parabolic dilation invariant so what we get is that oh no that's not right oh yeah that's right t tilde sigma plus lambda x tilde is contained in omega okay so if you if you rescale that the this minus lambda to the minus two slice up Minus lambda to the minus two slice up to minus one. This is what that tells you. And now by considering the speed as lambda, lambda approaches zero, well, you see that, for example, if this wasn't, sorry, suppose this wasn't there, then actually sigma is moving in the x tilde direction and becoming disjoint. So this would imply that sigma was a imply that sigma was a x tilde per graph, which we know that there's no such shrinkers. And using this one, you see that actually this would have to be mean convex. You can use Gerhard's classification. So I'm a little bit out of time. So I'll stop here. But basically the idea is if you think about geometrically what this condition means for the shrinker, then you see that it has to be one of these cylindrical or Or spherical flows. Or does he have time? You have 10 more minutes if you want to. Oh, okay. All right. So I prepared. Okay. So let me do this argument properly. I'm sorry. I thought it was 50 minutes. So, okay, let's slow down a little bit here. So let's just redo this. Okay, so here. So, okay, we have this. This is the condition that we've arranged. The condition that we've arranged. So we've arranged that the space-time track swept out by the shrinker, there's some re-centering so that you actually remain inside of the original track. Okay. And so if you take this and you do a parabolic dilation around the origin, this set, the set T, oh, it's not time space, it's root minus T. minus t omega bar cross t unit t zero right this is invariant under parabolic dilation okay right and so now let's take lambda equals to my so t equals minus lambda to the minus two and rescale that to t equals minus one so then we get root one plus root one plus lambda squared t tilde sigma plus lambda x tilde is contained inside of omega bar right and remember this is the inside of sigma okay all right and so now and this is for all lambda bigger than zero okay but then if you look at this right when lambda equals zero you're just Equals zero, you just get sigma back. Okay, so this is your original shrinker, and it's some one-parameter family of hypersurfaces. And so, well, if you compute the speed of this family at lambda equals zero, right, well, you get, well, actually, this is actually a quadratic term. So the speed is zero, the derivative at lambda equals zero is zero. Lambda equals zero, zero. And so the only thing that matters is this. So you get, like, let's compute the normal speed. You get x tilde dot nu sigma. Okay. But since you're moving to the inside, this should just should have a sign. Let's say it's bigger than or equal to zero, right? If you choose the unit normal for sigma correctly, this should be bigger than or equal to zero, right? And so now, well, on a shrinker, x tilde is a fixed vector. So, right, x tilde is a fixed vector, and a fixed vector.new this satisfies some PDE, right? It's a killing vector, so it should satisfy PDE on the shrinker. And so, therefore, it's either zero or strictly positive. Okay. And so, okay, if it's equal to zero, oh, sorry, let's do the strictly positive case first. Sorry, let's do the strictly positive case first, right? So two, one, okay, one. If it's strictly positive, this means that sigma, if this is the x tilde per plane, and this is x tilde, right? Then this is telling you that sigma is a graph over the x tilde per The x tilde per plane. Okay. But actually, Ecker Uskin and then Liu Wang. Maybe there was some work in the middle. But actually, it's known that this implies that you're a flat plane. Right, so a graphical shrinker actually is just a plane. Okay. And so two, okay, so either. Either Okay, so in the second option, right, so this x tilde dot nu is identically zero. Well, there's two possibilities: either this vector is non-zero or it's zero, right? Right in 2', well, you can use this to see that you split that sigma splits in the x tilde direction. Right, so you have this ambient vector, which always dot is, it's always in the tangent plane. So you see that you split a line. Okay. And in the other condition, well, okay, so now x tilde is zero, so we have to return. X tilde is zero, so we have to return to one plus lambda squared t tilde, right? This implies that t tilde isn't zero. But now we know that this is true for all lambda bigger than zero. But well, this has quadratic behavior at zero, but we could just rescale. So like you find that one plus mu, some t tilde. Sigma is contained in omega bar for mu bigger than zero. Okay, and so now you have to ask what is the normal speed to this variation, mu maps to like one plus mu sigma at mu equals zero. It's a dilation. So the normal speed is going to be x. Is going to be x, just the position vector x dot nu sigma. Okay. And this will have to be bigger than or equal to zero. Okay. Well, unless you're a plane, you actually can get this. Okay. But this is to twice the mean curvature, depending on your conventions. Okay. And thus you see that the mean curvature is bigger than zero. Right, and so therefore you're a sphere by Nyhuskin's classification. Okay, so now maybe I'll stop here. We'll split the difference between 15 and then thanks a lot. Thank you very much, Otis. Give all this a round of applause. Are there any questions? Maybe you should say, are there any questions from, let's say, let's take the in-person audience first? Are there any questions from Van? Yeah, maybe I'll ask a question. So there's this potential scenario that one has a Schwinker where one end looks like. A shrinker where one end looks like a cylinder and some other end looks like a cone. Can you put up those guys away? So, at the moment, like in terms of the things that are written, only under a low entropy condition, right? Under this low entropy condition, then sure. You know, I don't know if I'm, am I still being recorded, Richard? I can stop recording. Stop recording me. Yeah. Record me, yeah. I mean, you're still going to say this to 32 people, so that's that's fine.
