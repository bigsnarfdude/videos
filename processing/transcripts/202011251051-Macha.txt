For the invitation here. So, it's the first time I'm in Banff, and it's a marvelous place, of course. Well, so actually, my presentation, or there will be several results presented in the next few minutes, and these results are done or were done in collaboration with Professor Galde, Professor Nechasova, and also Bangui She. And also, I'm very proud that there will be two pictures in my That there will be two pictures in my presentation, you know, because usually there are no pictures in my presentation at all. Okay, so well, I'll talk about a body with cavity filled with compressible fluid. And okay, so let me switch to my first picture. Yeah, so that's it. I know it's the resolution of this picture is not so high, but I would just like to introduce, say, my system, yes. Say my system. Yes. So the system is called S and it consists of a body and cavity. As you can see here, so the body can freely move in space and it contains some cavity and the cavity is assumed to be filled with some kind of fluid. Yes. And actually, I will present here several results mainly concerning the long time behavior of such systems. Okay, so. Okay, so let me start briefly with history of such research. Actually, the study of this motion traces back to the pioneering contributions of Stokes, Zhukovsky, Poankar, and also Sobolev. And actually, Zhukovsky claimed that the motion of such system will be stabilized after some time, actually, will eventually be reached. Actually, it will eventually be rigid motion and precisely permanent rotations. Well, oh, sorry, sorry. Excuse me. There are many works, but say the full generality or for full general system, it was shown by Diesel Galdi Matson and Zunio in 2016 that actually the Zhukovsky conjecture holds. Holds and they treat the incompressible fluid inside the body. And our aim is to look into the role of the compressibility of that fluid. Yes, so we just put a compressible fluid inside the body, inside a freely moving body. Okay, so let me introduce the governing equations. Well, these are usual, the first two equations are usual compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Navier-Stokes equations. Well, the first equation is momentum equation. Actually, you can see the stress tensor contains some pressure. Yes, so the pressure is given by some barotropic law, A times R power to gamma. This A and gamma are supposed to be positive constants. I will later on show the restriction on them. On them. Then the second equation is a continuity equation or conservation of mass. So the first two equations, as I said, these are usual compressible Navier-Stokes. And then the third equation is a full slip on the boundary. So you can see here, actually, this W is the velocity of the fluid. And on the boundary, the velocity actually is just a rigid motion. Actually, it's just a rigid motion. So, the rigid motion of the body here is here represented by this omega and this eta. So, this omega is a rotation and this eta is transition. And next, we have equations for the rigid motion. Yes, so the first or the fourth equation, actually, here is the conservation of angular momentum. Angular momentum, and the last equation is a conservation of linear momentum. So you can see actually the fourth equation is an equation for this omega, for this rotation, and the fifth equation is equation for transition. Okay, so here, maybe it's a bit unusual. Here, this R is density and W is velocity. Say the reason for this notion is that these two these. These two unknowns are on the moving domain. We can switch to the non-moving domain, yes, to the constant in time domain by certain transformation. And we can deduce actually this system. Yes, so this time the domain is fixed. So you can see it's more convenient. It's more convenient. Here, just there is two velocity fields, actually, velocity v and velocity u. Velocity u is a velocity of the fluid together with the rigid motion. Velocity v is the velocity of the fluid, which is just without the rigid motion. Yes, so this velocity is with respect to the body. Okay, so now let me briefly just Now, let me briefly just mention some a priori estimates. So, we have conservation of mass, we have energy inequality. The energy contains not only the kinetic energy of the fluid and the pressure energy of the fluid, but there is also kinetic energy of the body. These are these two terms. And of course, once we have this energy estimate, we are also able to reduce the weak, the existence of a weak solution. The existence of a weak solutions by say standard Firezo-Leon's theory. Okay, so however, because of the boundary condition we have in mind, yes, because the body may possess any free motion, we are also able to deduce the conservation of the modulus of the angular momenta. And this is something that will be presented here without any. Will be presented here without any further technical details. But actually, if I introduce the quantity which is here called m, yeah, so this is a tensor of inertia of the body times omega plus integral over the cavity of rho x times u. Then actually this particular quantity fulfills this ODE, so the time derivative of m plus omega times m equals zero. And of course, we can move. zero and of course we can multiply the equation by m in order to deduce that the total angular momenta of the whole system is equal to constant yes so that's quite nice because actually the system cannot tend to stop yes so say the trivial solution is not the correct candidate for the long-term behavior now okay so in order to find some candidates let me consider the steady state system Let me consider the steady-state system, which of course looks like this. These are the equations without time derivatives. And actually, there is one issue. There is one non-uniqueness which might appear due to, say, some vacuum regions. Actually, this non-uniqueness was described in papers by Feyerazzo and Petsaltova from 1998. Feyrazo and Petsaltova from 1998 and 1999. And actually, this non-uniqueness is quite a bad issue because we would like to have a unique candidate for the long time limit. Yes. So once there will be a unique candidate for the long time limit, I can say that we are done. Okay, so in order to prevent this non-uniqueness, we would like to assume that there are no vacuum regimes. There are no vacuum regions, and yes, okay, so that will be our assumptions from now on. And we can actually deduce, say, several lemmas observations. So, first of all, a weak solution to the steady state system, if there is any, then it must hold that the relative motion vs is identically equal to zero. Yes, and actually. And actually, if there is any weak solution to the steady state system, then we have this particular set of equations, and these equations are algebraic equations and not longer PDEs. Yes, so that's quite important for us. Okay, and now I would like to talk also about one existence result to the non-steady case. Actually, we were able to deduce that. Use that there exists a strong solution once the initial data is small enough. So I don't want to comment this on, but we would like to show that actually every strong solution which is constructed for small initial data converges to some, say, long time limit. Yes. Okay, so in order to show So, in order to show that there is just one candidate, we use the omega limit set. So, just let me recall that the omega limit set is a set of all quadruples here denoted by v hat, omega hat, psi hat, and rho hat, for which there exists an increasing unbounded sequence of times such that v converges to v hat, omega converges to omega hat, converges to psi hat. hat converges to psi hat and rho converges to rho hat and actually the omega limit set it is compact it is connected and it is non-empty so that's quite standard properties secondly since say the strong solutions the density of the strong solutions is bounded from below and from above then the point in the omega limit set does not contain a vacuum region yes so we can see that the density is also So we can see that the density is always bounded from below and from above. And actually, the omega limit set is invariant under solutions constructed in the previous theorem. So once there is a strong solution emanating from the point of omega limit set, then such solution remains in that omega limit set. Okay, and now I would like to show, or I'm going to show that, say, the omega limit set consists of isolated points. Consist of isolated points because then, of course, because the omega limit set is connected, then there is just one point in the as a possible candidate for the long time limit, and that's our aim here. Yes. So actually, every element of the omega limit set solves the steady state system, and moreover, we have still this conservation of mass and conservation of the magnitude of angular momenta. Of angular momenta. Yes, so these two equations have to be added to the steady state system. And okay, I'll go a bit quickly through this. Actually, we end up with this set of equations. This is a system of eight equations because actually the first one and the third one, these are a system of three equations. Yes. So we can rewrite it. So, we can rewrite it as a system of eight unknowns and say eight equations for appropriately defined nonlinear function f. It can be seen as this, yes. And our aim or our goal was to show that actually the gradient of f under certain condition is regular. Yes, because of course, once the gradient is regular, then there are finitely not finitely many, but there are. Not finitely many, but they are only isolated points can be a solution. So that is our aim. Okay, so sorry, so let me go quickly through that. Actually, this is the gradient of F. You can see it consists of some main part and something what should be negligible, hopefully. Yes, so it consists of some derivatives here. And actually, once Actually, once we assume that the inertia tensor of the whole system has three distinct eigenvalues, and that this rest is small, then actually the gradient of f is regular. So this can be, of course, claimed under certain conditions. So we end up with this theorem. So actually, if we have a cavity which is of class C4. Which is of class C4, this is to have this strong existence result. And if we moreover assume that the three eigenvalues of the tensor, of the inertia tensor of the whole system are distinct, then there exists a zero such that for all a bigger than a zero, the terminal motion of the coupled system reduces to uniform rotation around an axis parallel to the constant angular momentum. Angular momentum M0 of S passing through its center of mass G. Okay, so here I would like to comment this bit because here we have a constant A and I would like to go back to my third slide, I guess. Yes, so okay, fourth slide. Actually, this constant A, it's important, is here in the definition of the pressure. And actually, in order to obtain our main claim, we need to Obtain our main claim, we need to have this constant A sufficiently high. So this means that the main claim is true only for sufficiently incompressible fluid. Yes. Okay, so such theorem is of course not very suitable for some dependence between the decay rate and the compressibility of the fluid. So that was our main aim. So that's why we We treated another case. So, this time we take into account just a system concerning pendulum, not freely moving body, but a pendulum. And in our case, the pendulum is a body which might move, which has just one degree of freedom. Yes, so it can move freely around one axis. Yes, so you can see once again. See, once again, the system is very similar, however, this time the rigid motion is just described by a scalar omega, and it is expressed as omega times E3 cross x. So actually the whole body might move around the E3 axis. And here, these last two equations are equations for the mechanical oscillator. Here, this G is actually a sent diagram. Actually, a center direction of gravity. Okay, of course, once again, we have an energy estimate. You can see here the last term or say the one term on the right-hand side is actually potential force. And that's why, once again, we can deduce the existence of a weak solution. But when we turn our attention to the steady-state system, it's much more. System, it's much more interesting now because it turns out that we are able to prove some kind of uniqueness. Yes. So that's the stationary system. I would like to comment this on a bit. So first of all, this gamma minus one root of this bracket, of this gamma minus one divided by a times gamma times gx plus c, this is actually a density, yes, which is a function of g and c. So actually the first C. So actually, the first equation here is the conservation of mass. Then we have here this second equation. Actually, this L, this can be seen as a center of gravity of the whole fluid. This P is just a projection to the first two variables. Yes, so actually this P of this bracket is just a center of gravity of the fluid. And here you can see there is a scalar times a times. Is a scalar times some direction of gravity, yes? And then we have okay, so the gravity is always the same, or it or it has always the same magnitude. Actually, we can show that if some density and some direction of gravity is a minimizer of energy functional, then say these two values solve the above system, and we can use the direct metric. And we can use the direct method of the calculus of variation to show that there exists a minimizer. So, this means that we have an existence of solution to this system. And actually, under certain conditions, we are also able to show uniqueness. Namely, and okay, so since I don't have so much time, I will skip these assumptions. Yes, just tell me that there are at most two solutions. That there are at most two solutions under certain assumptions to the steady state system. One is with d less than zero, and one is with d greater than zero. So, let me go back. If you take a look here on the second equation, then actually d is something what multiplies the direction of gravity has. And actually, if d is greater than zero, then it means that the direction or the gravity has the same direction as the center. Direction as the center of as the body center of the whole system. Yes, so actually, if d is greater than zeros, then you can you take this particular steady state. If d is less than zero, then you get, say, this upside down steady state. Of course, the second one might be ruled out somehow. For example, we can start with energy which does not allow. Which does not allow to obtain, say, this upside-down steady case. Yes. So, and once we, of course, rule out this second steady case, then we are able to claim that actually every renormalized weak solution tends to just one steady case. So, that's our main theorem here. And this pendulum case is for us much more convenient because we are now able to look into the problem. Able to look into the problem of decay rate and how the decay rate of the solution depends on the compressibility of the fluid. And here comes my second picture. Yes, so this is my second picture of this talk. So you can see this is a numerical simulation. And if we take, okay, so this A, this is the constant in the pressure law. Actually, if we take A to be small, A equals 0. A to be small, a equals 0.1, then you can see this is the dark line, and actually, the decay is quite fast. And if a is equal to 100, so this is the light line, and you can see that there is still some decay, but it's not so fast. So, from this numerical simulation, it follows that actually compressible fluids provides better decay than incompressible fluids. Okay, so there was all and So that was all, and I would like to thank you for your attention.
