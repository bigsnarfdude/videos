Categories will come up in two contexts, and one will be fairly straightforward. And maybe I wouldn't say that much in the second context towards the end of the lecture on a version of logarithmic direct category. But I will give some references. So let's start with the standard construction where we have y smooth variety and then it's And then inside it, there is a divisor D. And maybe this is all happening over a field of characteristic neurons. And there is a divisor which is a divisor with simple normal crossings. So we have several irreducible components, and then they have nice intersection with each other. And there is a standard construction of is a standard construction of logarithmic logarithmic differential forms. So this is something that's been considered by Deline, for example, in his work on Hodge theory. And so you could say that in one way you could define that as differential forms, forms with poles. D such that such a form omega and its round differential of d omega have pole of order less or equal to one along each component of d along each component of d or you could Or you could also say that you're considering usual forms on y and then you throw in expressions like df or those which locally look like df over f, where f is a local equation for some irreducible component of the divisor. And so there are two slightly different things you can do with this, and before I explain them, let's just assume that. So, I just assume that there's an easy example where d is irreducible. I'm smooth. So then we can take a local equation, and so that's really the only form that we're thrown into the usual algebra of differential forms on y. And there are two sequences we could consider. So we could take So we could take k forms with logarithmic singularities or logarithmic k forms, and then on those we can define residue map. Unfortunately, restriction will also have the same. Yeah, so but this is residue. So it just generalizes the standard residue construction for one forms where we just take something like that and then Something like that, and then produce a zero form or a zero form on something that's zero-dimensional. So, in this case, we can essentially say if we have a k form and one of the factors is df over f, we just extract the other factor and restrict it. And so we get omega k minus 1 of d, and there's this rejection, and in the kernel of this. And in the kernel of this, we will have usual forms, those which don't have df over f. So this is okay. So this is one version of what can be done. Another version is that we could take k forms on y and then so if this is this embedding is denoted by i, we can restrict them to k forms on d. On D. And then in the kernel, what will we compute that the kernel is k forms, again logarithmic singularities, and then twisted by minus t. So so these things a priori will have poles. We're just multiplying it by a local equation of t, at which point m moment the poles go away. Moment the poles go away. And so this is a slightly different version of the story. And so this is slightly more common to use in Hodge theory because I guess this is what Delin was using in his work. And so now let's just go to two versions. The story where we start with y would be reduced variety, and then side it could be sigma, which is sub-variety, because everything's reduced, essentially closed subset, so sub-variety. And we can assume that, say, y minus sigma smooth, although this is not terribly essential. So in that setting, we could In that setting, we could try to resolve this and we want some sort of abstract blow-up where sigma gets resolved to a simple normal crossings divisor. And then, if this blow-up is epsilon, then on one hand we can take can take push forward of these forms with logarithmic singularities and then twist it by minus d and so this is something that was in early in the literature was denoted by by sigma and so this is called the lean de Bois complex. Complex. And so if just so that I understand when you say you push forward omega y, do you push one of them or do you take the DRAM complex? It's a very nice question because the answer is both. Actually, you could take the Duram complex with the Duram differential or you could say let's look at the grid. Or you could say, let's look at the gradient algebra without differential. And you could push forward both. And the Lean-Duvoir complex is the one that uses the Ram differential because it was used to study Hoich theory on cohomology of the thing. But the beautiful part of the story, and it will be relevant maybe in the middle or towards the end, that both versions work. And so this is based on So, this is based on De Lean's papers on Hodge theory, and then Dubois was his student. He wrote a book on, I guess, the Ram complex of a singular scheme. But at that time, if you wanted to prove the statement that it doesn't depend on a choice of resolution, at that time weak factorization theorem wasn't known, and so they had to work with hyper-resolutions. They had to work with hyper-resolutions, essentially, covered by open sets, resolve them, and then compare different resolutions. And there was a formalism of simplicial schemes there, and also filter-derived categories for which, unfortunately, I couldn't find a full write-up of all the details that I would care about. But again, it was proved that Proved that this object as a filtered complex of sheaves on Y doesn't depend on a choice of resolution. And if you push forward any particular forms, omega p, then the result again is independent on a choice of resolution. So if y is proper, it computes the ramp cohomology. The RAM cohomology with compact support with compact support of Y without sigma. But my point today would be that we we don't care just about homology, but also the object that computes it. The object that computes it, and especially there will be this game again. So, if for those that are familiar with Hochschult and cyclic homology, so that will be kind of an indication that you have situations similar to homology theories of rings, where you have, say, Hochschule homology, an object that is related to differential forms without the round differential. And then there are cyclic versions, which where you can also turn on. Where you can also turn on maybe the Durham differential. So, okay, so you have this. A second version that you could do, you could look at, again, push forward of forms on Y untwisted by T. So just logarithmic forms. Again, with the same. With the same double meaning, you could turn on the Ram differential or put zero instead of it. And again, this is still independent on resolution. And so again, if let's say that y tilde is smooth. Tilde is smooth and proper, well, it's smooth because it is a resolution, then you can say that this thing computes the usual homology of y tilde minus d, which is of course y minus c. And in fact, if you compare these two complexes and write local formulas for what they are, you see that you could almost say that the You could almost say that one is obtained from the other by serfunctor, by just putting things back to front and then multiplying by canonical class. The only correction is, of course, that the Ram differential is not all linear. So you can define a joint first-order differential operator, but you are not working in a category where standard set reality would apply. But morally, at least here, if we're Normally, at least if you're working with smooth objects, you have the rank cohomology usual and with compact support. So not to be surprising. Okay, so and yes, so yes, I should say that this is based on our joint work with Sergei Arpe. And we actually started with an exercise of proving that this is in. Exercise of proving that this is independent on choice of resolution and with weak factorization theorem for resolutions, this is just a computation with differential forms. Originally, it was much more painful because you, I guess in Delini and Dubois version, they worked with filter-derived category. They proved it for the RAM complex first, and then they said, let's take association. And then they said, let's take associated gradient quotients and then prove that independence for just p-forms. And so that involved much more technology, which is now all pushed, is all hidden in weak vectorization. So our original motivation for that was actually Actually, based on something that's studied in representation theory. And so this is a story that works with a general reductor group, but suppose that G is just a group of GLN, say we're complex numbers, V is the Morel subgroup, which in matrix form we can write as upper triangular matrices. Write this as upper triangular matrices in some basis. And if you're familiar with the general theory, then you'll probably know what B will be in full generality. And so one geometric construction which gets studied a lot is what is called stringer resolution. And so this is what you're resolving is the Is the set of Newton matrices or New Pluton cone? So this is sitting inside Lie algebra of our group. And it's singular, obviously. And one way to resolve it is to look at the homogeneous space G1B, which is the space of complete flags in a standard example, and then take the Example and then take the cotangent bundle, and then there is a morphism that is a resolution of singularities. And roughly what one is saying is that if you take a general nilpotent matrix, then there will be a unique flag that is compatible with this nilpotent matrix if it's the sort of this largest possible Jordan block. And so that would give And so that would give you a point in G mod B. And then, if you try to compute what is the cotangent space, well, if you're modding out by B, then essentially you're dealing with these things, which have at least the same size as these upper triangle or lower triangle neutral matrices. So that's roughly why such a map exists. And let's just denote it by And that's just denoted by n tilde. And so, in representation theory, one studies fiber square of n tilde over n. So I object to representation theory. So you have C, which is M tilde times M tilde, but over N. And so this is a variety which will have several irreducible components. And its representation theory is related to the representation theory of Y group that we all, which in this case would be the symmetric. This case could be the symmetric group. And so one studies the following category. So HF, so this will be DB, G equivariant category of coherent sheaves on G. And so this is called applying F category. So one reach structure that it So, one bridge structure that it has is will have a convolution operation if you take two sheaves on such a thing. And anytime you have fiber square of one scheme over another, you have this convolution product because you can look at the triple pipe product. So you have n tilde times n tilde times n tilde and it will have projections pi 1 2 and then pi 2 3 and projection pi 1 3. So all of them will be landing onto onto our space, which is the double product. So this is what we call Z. So, this is what we call Z. And now the standard convolution construction: that if you have two sheaves here, you can pull them back to the triple product, take the derived answer product, and then push it forward onto projection that kills the second factor. So, that's a kind of a categorified version of algebra. So, you have this monoidal structure on a category. On the category. And so there was a theorem due to this recognition of Morgan Ricci, which says that so HF contains objects. Objects categorifying the affine or wild group. Objects so T S where maybe T S I. So let me just pretend that this is just for this symmetric group and it's easy to fix it for a general reductive group. And then I will be from 1 up to n minus 1 standard. So n minus one, standard generators of symmetric group, such that we have these standard grade relations, Ts T, T s is equal to T T plus T. So these are, again, in the standard setting, when you're trying to describe symmetric group using generators and relationship Using generators and relations, you would have this triple relations for symmetric group. But also in the symmetric group, you will have every generator squared is equal to identity. That's something that you don't do here. That's the difference between Bray group and the symmetric group. And so the original theorem of Visual Cabrico Fendrici was that you could find objects in this category such that In this category, such that you can understand the products as convolution products, and the break relations are observed. But does it mean equal? Sorry? What does equal mean? Yes, that's a good thing. It's isomorphic, so we're not really getting some further compatibility. Not yet, yes. So, yes, of course we want to, but that hasn't been done yet. It is just viewable in terms of configuration? Yeah, yeah. So eventually, once we will rephrase this category, it will be more clear where the spherical objects are even come from. So again, the proof of braid relations was non-trivial and involved techniques which are common in representation theory when you just jump from characteristic zero to characteristic zero. Characteristic 0 to characteristic p, and then it's mysterious, at least to me, at this point. Alright, so maybe let me just add as a comment that, of course, these days you can just understand the fiber product in very straightforward sense in in the derived sense. And so so the the better version is the derived version. Version as the derived version. Okay, so now working towards understanding what's going on here. So again, there was a series of results by Esther Gier Kipov and his PhD student, Sebastian Ørsted. So they rephrased it in slightly different form. So that H of the fine After you find a HEC category, this is quasi-equivalent to the derived category of this, of such a thing. So we will be working on a product of G mod V with itself. And of course it has diagonal action of the group G. But so we want to turn on differential forms on all of this. Turn on differential forms on all of these things. So we essentially consider this space and the group itself as ring spaces. So the space with the risky topology doesn't change, but the functions become graded algebra of differential forms without the Duram differential. So we have differential forms of G mod B, tensor differential forms of G mod B module. B module, or let's say DG modules. And we want them to be equivariant with respect to omega g. So this is, we view g as a group scheme with a non-trivial structure sheaf, which is just the differential forms one of G. Right. And so, among other things, this quasi-equivalence. This quasiquivalence involves, I guess they have a series of three papers, and it involves some foundations where they had to give a specific model for homotopy limits. But the essential part of it, the algebraic part of this, was some involved version of VGG correspondence. VGG correspondence. And so, where it comes in, where you kind of need to first say that if this is understood in a derived sense, then you can write a sheaf of DG algebras, which first has something to do with symmetric algebras, and then you pass the exterior algebras just using some version of DGG correspondence. Right. And then let's say such that such that TSI corresponds to this so we'll look at parabolic. Parabolic subgroups EI, where again in the case of GLM, you still take upper triangular matrices. But if you have a certain value of index, so you look at i and i plus 1, say, okay, let's include one entry right under the diagonal. So that means we have a two by two block and then zero elsewhere. So this is the standard parabolic subgroup. Standard parabolic subgroup. And you can so your G mod B will map to a G mod D Y. So this is kind of a partial flag space. So here you had a complete flag and here, in this case, you're forgetting one of the intermediate subspaces in the flag. And so now what you could do What you could do, you could look at differential forms on G mod B times G mod B, but it's a fiber product over G mod B I. So this is naturally a subset inside the Cartesian square of G mod B. And then you use logarithmic forms that G mod B The diagonal copy of it. So this is, again, so this is a relative product, and so in particular it will contain the diagonal. Okay, so this is naturally sitting inside G mod B times G mod B, and one can see that this is naturally an object here. Now, why this Now, why this has something to do with spherical functor follows from this story, the short exact sequence that I was writing involving logarithmic complex and the residue of map and then usual forms and then forms on the divisor. So you could, from that short exact sequence, you could say that you can also rewrite this using the formalism of spherical functors. I need to generalize that then. You need to generalize the diagonal divisor? Just because this has one-dimensional fibers. So the dimension of this is equal to dimension of G mod B plus 1. And the divisor, of course, has the same dimension as G mod B. So, but this is, notice that we're only considering this for the case of a simple reflection in the symmetric group, and so that's why it's. That's why it's a nice situation. So we'll see in a second that if we're trying to prove the grade relations, we could just say let's in general we could just take an element in the symmetric group and then we say, okay, maybe we can Maybe we can write that this can be written as a reduced product in a sense that it's of minimal length. And suppose that we could also split it in a different way, S1, S2, S3. And then the question would be: do we have a similar equality for products, convolution products of these elements of the HEC category? The category. And so the question is more: if we define these elementary objects, how do we compute their convolutions? And so when we start computing their convolutions, this is where birational maps will start coming up. And so this, suppose we have maybe a sequence of elementary transpositions S1, SK, and so then we have a bot. And so then we have a bot Samuelson variety where we have just G mod B times G mod B at the times. Again, it will be an iterative fiber product. As such, it will be iterated P1 bundle over G mod B. And so here we have G mod P S 1. PS1 and then G mod P S two. And then at the last product, we have G mod P S K. And so such a thing maps to just Cartesian product of Q mod P with itself. And so this is just a And so this is just a map that collects the first and the last elements. And so this the image of this can be understood in the following term. So G mod B has a marked point, just the equivalence class of identity, which I'm writing as B. And then we can act by our element in the symmetric group. Symmetric group on B, and we get a point here. Now we take a g orbit of this thing, and then we take closure, g orbit. And it's clear that g orbit itself has to be smooth, and then in full generality, of course, this will have singularities once you take the closure. And in fact, what happens is this is a resolution. Resolution of singularities. And so one can even see that what happens over the orbit itself. Before you take the closure, as I said, it's smooth. And so on this side, you have essentially G1B and then G guess A plus 1. I guess k plus one b such that you you want to say that g i b is not equal to g i plus 1 b for m i. So essentially, within these fiber products you have those bunch of diagonals where you say that this is equal to this. They're not just mapping to the same point here, but they The same point here, but the diagonal that we, exactly the same diagonal as we had in the double product, but now we have a bunch of them. So if we throw them out, so the remaining piece is isomorphic just to the orbit itself. And then in the closure on this side, when we bring back the divisors, so that's the divisor with simple normal crossings. And it resolves, the whole thing resolves singularities of the closure. Resolve singularities of the closure. And then now everything is based on the computation that convolution TS1 TSK corresponds to to to the complex maybe the algebra. So I'm not using the Rabbi Kreschel of logarithmic forms so let me just say that this one Waltz-Samuelson S1SK so it will be if we're taking forms on this Walt-Samuelson variety Wolf-Amelson variety. There is a divisor formed by the union of these diagonals, pairwise diagonals. And then we have this, let's say, media map here. And then we take push forward like that. So after push forward, it becomes an object, just a complex of sheaves, which is supported on disclosure. And then And then, I guess, after that, so the theorem which motivated us originally is that the braid relations hold between uh this T and S F. This TSM. So essentially, this is a reproving of something that was already known due to Byzerkavenkov and Riccier, but in a different form. So since, again, our Hippo Kondorstead reformulated the defined HECI category. So that's a statement that's equivalent to an earlier result. But here, it's very clear why grade relations hold. Essentially, if we have two different regions, Essentially, if we have two different reduced decompositions of the same element in the symmetric group, they will give in general different Bot-Samuelson resolutions. One of them, its logarithmic forms, will correspond to, I guess, convolution product of one side of grade relations. And then for the other decomposition, we will get a convolution product for the other side. And now, if we say, well, And now, if we say, well, if logarithmic forms don't depend on a choice of resolution, then left-hand side is equal to right-hand side. So that's kind of the original interest in logarithmic forms. And I guess I have a bit of time to switch and go in a slightly different direction. And so this just is overview of work by other people. But the question is this. So we have a standard construction of Hawkshutt homology for an algebra over a field. So A is a K algebra. And we just, let's assume that it's all empty, so it's needed to direct sum of A bar and then a couple of. A bar and then copy of K. Then there is a standard complex computing causal tomology with nth term given by a tensor, a bar tensor n. And it has differentials lowercase b. Let me just write it for just a simple triple kind of product. So you just use the algebra product in all possible ways without Products in all possible ways without breaking the cyclic structure of these things. So you have A0, A1, and A2, and plus minus A0, A1, A2. And then there will be another term where you say A2, A0 times A1. So the cyclic order is preserved, but you never really swap, for instance. Swap for, for instance, you want to take it. So you keep in mind that maybe the product is non-commutative. And then there is also another differential which has a reasonable formula if you put a bar here and it's what it does is 0 a2. So what you do, you just actually increase number Actually, increase the number of tensor factors and you put one in the first position. So you put one tensor A0, A1, A2. And then you now cycle these factors in all possible ways. You have, I guess, A1 times x80 plus minus. plus minus one tensor into A0. And fluent factors, it's a similar story. And so these differentials satisfy relations b squared equals 0, uppercase b squared is also equal to 0, and they also anticommute. Although it looks like they're asymmetric, in practice one treats them in a slightly asymmetric manner. If one wants to consider a category of complexes with such things, so there is a version called mixed-derived category where you invert quasi-isomorphisms with respect to the lowercase B differential. But you kind of understand as uppercase B is additional structure on that. Is additional structure on that. So this is where you're breaking symmetry between one and the other. Again, notice that this one is decreasing the number of tensor factors, and this one is increasing. And there is one of the versions of HKR theorem that if you can take this complex with the two differentials. With the two differentials, and you can compare it with differential forms. So there will be differential forms on x, which is equal to spec a with a zero lowercase b differential and the Durham differential here. Again, under the assumption we assume that x is smooth. We assume that x is smooth. And well, it's just easier to describe what the map is. So this is a n goes to a0 d a1 r d a n. And so sometimes it will be minus dot here, depending on how you arrange the gradient. So I guess. I guess if we want, so the Ram differential increases a homological degree. So I guess here. Yep, works. So you could state it as formulated as a quasi-isomorphism in the mixed-derived category, in a category of complex with two differentials and this lowercase B quasisomorphism. Lowercase b quasi isomorphism inverted. Right. So basically now we can generalize it to case of say DG categories. Because if we look at these formulas, we can understand these guys. These guys as collections of composable morphisms. And the products will be just compositions of these morphisms. You arrange them in such a way that this composition makes sense. And also, you know, a last one should be composable with the first one. And so this is kind of a standard way of treating a category as an algebra with several objects. And if you're working with derived categories, If you're working with derived categories where you say I'm starting with something that's built out of complexes, then I modeled by acyclic complexes, then you need to imitate this construction on a level of these complexes. So now basically there was a result due to Keller which extends it the ring version to the case when X is a I guess smooth variety and you take your complex you take your category to be a category of perfect complexes. Complexes on X, and you try to play with this game and the actually D V of this. And so the result of Keller is that it generalizes essentially things from rings to schemes or smooth schemes. Or smooth schemes, because actually, there are two slightly different things you could do. You could take this category, and then out of category, you construct such a complex. And so there would be this. And then you say that in the mixed-derived category, what can you do? So you could take R gamma on X of different. On X of differential forms with zero P differential and then the round differential upper PSP. But you need to work a little bit to understand that this makes sense and it does. So you could state this quasi isomorphism in the mixed derived category for global sections, or you can work locally and you can just say, so what happens if I So what happens if I do have uh the usual commutative ring of functions locally on x and I can uh do the usual Hofschult homology complex and then you have a sheaf of mixed complexes. Again, you need to you can say that a commutative HKR theorem, the usual HKR theorem, will just give a quasisomorphism. Give a quasisomorphism between a shiftified version of this and the Durham complex. And so then essentially what a way to rephrase Keller's theorem is to say that you could go through the category or you could localize it in Zenisky topology and after taking global sections there you have quasi-isomorphism between these mixed complexes. Between these mixed complexes. And he has a discussion of more general case of ring spaces. And actually, in our recent work with Victor Ginsburg, we had to generalize it to the case of deformation quantization when functions become non-commutative, but you can still repeat. It looks like it shouldn't take that much in terms of technical conditions. In terms of technical conditions, to prove something of that nature. Again, here we would be writing just the local version of these Hochschule homology complexes. So it seems from work of Vandenberg and Loewen that what you should require for a ring space is that there is a covering on which your sheaf of algebras is acyclic. But again, so that's that is. Again, so that is not really written up anywhere in the literature, but it feels like that should be enough. Okay, so now to the question that would be nice to understand question so Uh so uh so given a pair of Y and the simple normal crossings divisor, so uh can one define one define some sort of logarithmic version of the category, so y log d again, so whatever it is, such that that well, obviously you want Well, obviously, we want the construction to be local and basically such that C of this category of D should be quasi-somorphic to log forms log D. And again, so this brings us back to the original question of Andre, so do you need the Duram differential? That's where in this situation we want to say, okay, both ways should work, with Durand differential or without the Ram differential. Because on this side, we would have, again, two differentials to perform. So that's a question. That's a question. Do you know any examples in which this can be defined? This can avoid. Not really. So there are some constructions which ring the bell, and then there is a result that maybe result of Euphemia that explains that the logarithmic DRAM complex can be obtained from non-logar. Complex can be obtained from non-logarithmic using some game with categories, with DG categories. And so his result doesn't discuss any constructions of this. So what he is proving is the following. So he considers categories in his notation non-commutative morphemes which are geometric. Morphils which are geometric, which are really just DG categories categories that have the type D curve of Y where Y is smooth and I guess proper and then it maps to a category of Additive DG categories of geometric type. So these are DG categories of the type D where Y is just smooth. Right, and so when you When you consider this pair of categories, so first, so I'm just describing objects and amorphism between them based on, so you take two categories, you look at functors between them, understood in bimodal sense, and then you take k-theory of functors. And so basically, now if you consider functors from Functors from the larger category, which lands into mixed complexes over field K. You can compare it with functors from the smaller and geometric. And then again, with values in mixed complexes. So obviously, if you have. So, obviously, if you have a functor with defined on the larger category, you can restrict it. So, this is res which is restriction. But NEFIMO proves that there is a left-adjoint induction functor that satisfies the property. So that uh uh so if in the situation sorry Bologna if you don't mind yeah yes yes please uh what's the category mixed k in sorry it's mixed complexes of vector spaces over k so you're you're in what sense mixed in a sense of looking at complexes Of looking at complexes of vector spaces with two operators, lowercase B, uppercase B, and then inverting quasi-isomorphism with respect to lowercase B. I see. I see, I see. Yes. So if I was considering the situation when we have x, which is y minus d. Well, okay, actually, the whole point will be that we can start with the Will be that we can start with a smooth variety which is not compactified at first, and then we can define its logarithmic complex without appealing to compactification. And the theorem is this. So this logarithmic version of mixed complex solutions is equivalent to induction of restriction. Restriction of the usual non-logarithmic construction and then evaluate it at a category which is equal to a curve of x. So in other words, you have a non-logarithmic functor which takes a category, I guess, from where, yeah. Yeah, it's the non-logarithmic Haushold complex. And then there is a construction of restricting it from smooth to smooth and proper, and then applying the mysterious induction functor. And if you do this round trip, then you start with the usual Hochschule complex and you end up with logarithmic Hochschule complex. And then the situation where, I guess I'm skipping his. And I guess I'm skipping his version of the definition of C log. But now, in the situation where X is compactified, it's Y minus divisor. So in such a situation, you are getting a way of computing this restriction and then induction using this compactification. So it becomes just a method of computing. And he shows that the logarithmic Duram complex now matches exactly. Now matches exactly what you do on whenever you have a compactification Y and simple normal Crossings device there. Right, so this is this is kind of viewed again on the level of functors now but so his intention in this theorem was not to construct this category but just to illustrate that passing from usual forms to logarithmic forms is just has a flavor of Has a flavor of categorical construction. And I guess the now this is the time to give just references to some people that did try to define categories. So one is a paper by Talpon Vistoli. I guess I don't really have the full title, so Really, they have the full title, so it's 14, 10, and then 64. So, there they were trying, they defined actually what is called the root stack. So, if you have a divisor, for instance, maybe divisor is just a reducible small divisor. So, it's given by equation f. And then you try to extract nth root of the local equation, and then send n. And then send n to infinity and work on such an object. So, and then later this category was related by next paper was 171200045. So this is by Sharotke again as Again, Sibila, Sibia, and there is, yes, sorry, yes. That's the wrong number. So this is 161208961. And yes, there was a paper by Wentrop which is 171200045. So, the second paper relates this root stack to another construction where you have your divisor with simple normal crossings and then you try to blow it up with smooth centers which are sitting in intersections of components of your divisor. And you pass your limit over all such blow-ups. So, this is kind of the flavor of what you do when you take your variety and you construct Zariski curve out of it, when you say, I can blow up everything in this. And you say, I can blow up everything in this variety. So, in this case, you put restriction on what you're trying to blow up. And you can try to work with this sort of category, and they prove equivalence with the infinite root stack of Talpan Gistoli. And their proof is a version of a billion Mackay correspondence, as they write in their paper. And in the paper by Weintrop, I think. Weintraub, I think the statement that was claimed that if you apply the standard homological constructions to the root stack, then you will be getting logarithmic forms. But I tried to read and seemed that some details were missing. So I'm not sure if let's prove there in a special case or in a greater generality. Right, so again, what you want from this category. What you want from this category, whether your definition is correct or not, depends on how you want to use it. So for instance, you could at least ask for this. So if you have your divisor, and then you can blow up So, you can blow up some smooth center Z, and if your divisor is a union of some components that I denote by F1 Fp, sorry, D1 DP, and then F1 FQ. Let's impose the condition that Z is sitting inside DI and for all I, and Z is transversal. To Fj, right? So at least you could ask that your logarithmic category doesn't change under this blow-up. So, because then you could try to play with weak vectorization theorem and then say that if you have something that's not a subset that's not a simple normal crossings divisor but can be resolved by one, then the category. Then the category would make sense regardless of the choice of resolution. And so that's the technical step you would need to compare these two versions. And of course, again, in one direction, you could watch this category to understand Hodge theory. And in another direction, you could ask: is this any good for things like Mackay correspondence? If you say, okay, maybe there is no Crapon resolution, but there is. But there is some kind of resolution. Can we compare different resolutions? And without the Krapant condition, yes, you probably have to play some log game. And so maybe the question would be, could you define a version of this category that would be useful for things like K equivalence equals D equivalence? But again, so these are probably, they might turn out to be useful. Probably they might turn out to be useful in this direction or maybe not. So I'm just inviting anyone interested to. Questions? So if you had such a category, how would it help you with the original problem of categorifying um uh the break group action The braid group action? No, no, braid group action is. Oh, no, for braid group action, its category is not really necessary. So I just said that it's sort of two directions that come out of logarithmic forms. So in one direction, so that part, the braid relations are proved just on the level of objects. So if we have this the gradient algebra of differential forms. Gradient algebra of differential forms, if we have this independence of go-up property, then that implies great relationship. But if you had such a category, you wouldn't be able to. So if I understand correctly, what you constructed there were some kind of chain complexes on some hypothetical derived categories that you don't yet have. Yes, yes, right, right. But if you had the actual categories, would you be able to categorify more? To categorify more, maybe you could go one step what equal means. Yes, exactly. Yes, yeah. I'm thinking that, yes, it might be useful in this direction. So if you say that the brain group is acting on some category or sitting inside some category, I say it in a weak sense or in a strong sense. Do you require some coherence? So you might need that. Might need that. But again, so maybe with braid group action, you could conceivably do it by hand, as if you know what you're proving. But in this, so this is a slight, the second motivation is slightly different direction. So can you do something that will be useful towards Mackay correspondence? And so maybe can you realize derived categories? You realize derived categories as derived categories of some sheaves on this on Zariski curve of a variety, such that if you realize it like that, then maybe it would simplify this business of D equivalence and K equivalence. So, with the D equivalence and K equivalence, you assume that Equivalence, you assume that there is, you start with two varieties and a common birational map such that pullbacks are canonical classes. So you ask, is it true that the derived categories are equivalent? And you could, but then you could kind of try to rephrase it. Does it make sense to talk about this? So you have the risky curve of your variety when you blow up everything. And then can you realize derived? Can you realize the derived category of the original variety as some sort of sheaves on the Zariski curve? In such a way that if two varieties are k-equivalent, then they have essentially a common blow-up. And then after this blow-up, you can move upwards to the risky curve. And so maybe if you interpret these derived categories as sitting within the derived category of the risky curve. Curved, then it might become just a tautological statement. But then the whole difficulty would be buried in just making sense of the derived category of the risky curve and embedding the original derived category into that. Sorry, Valodia, I sort of understood your explanation how this might be helpful for sort of K equivalence and D equivalence. But why would that be relevant in Macca correct? Be relevant in Machi correspondence context. I mean, Machai correspondence is sort of an orbit false story. I mean, we have a nice smooth sort of quotient starting other end and some geometric realization on the other end. So how would that, why would this be helpful? Well, I guess I meant Mackay correspondence in a primitive sense that if you had two crepant resolutions, that they would have solved. Yeah. Yeah, that's the equivalence conjecture. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So it's sort of related, but not quite the same. A weaker version, maybe. Can I ask another question while I'm at it? So this is slightly perpendicular to the last sort of 20 minutes of your talk, but so with this sort of logarithmical form outlook, you prove, you sort of reprove result that is recommending operation. You show there is a categorical action of rates. Showed there is a categorical auction of break. Yes. But this categorical auction is a weak categorical auction. The relations improve to hold only a hold up to an isomorphism. In such senses, people are usually interested in studying sort of the structure that exists on those isomorphisms. So this is what sort of categorification, in a sense, is really all about. And an original paper by Hohanov and Thomas, which does AM case, they do look at this. They sort of the they work with haborgiasisms which describe the relationship. Which describe the relationship? Is there any way your technology can be harnessed to sort of study this two-categorical level of the auction which you construct? So we try to look at that and at this point I have hopes, but it's sort of it hinges on being able to apply weight factorization theorem more carefully. Even original. Even originally, say, okay, suppose there are two resolutions to divisor with simple normal crossings. Then you can find a common resolution that maps to them, but you don't know much about the structure of these morphisms. And then you apply weak factorization to that to do the comparison. But now, and it gives you one isomorphism. So again, if you have x1, x2, and they're both resolving x. They're both resolving x, and then there is a common x tilde. So that essentially, the choice of x tilde gives you an isomorphism between logarithmic forms coming from x1 and x2. But what happens when you start changing your x tilde? So this is where I kind of need to look deeper into this. But the whole that, yes, the same weak factorization hopefully can give something. Interesting. Because, yeah, so. Because yeah, so if you you would you would have to play the game where where you kind of build yet another one and then yeah, so so and then you compare isomorphism, but that's something I haven't done yet. We haven't looked at oh thank you thank you other than select this beyond type please I guess uh No, no, I guess what was said in type A, the categorical action has been sort of explained. And in other types, so what I put on the board before, this is just a kind of a truncated version. Things are up to isomorphism. That left-hand side is isomorphic to the right-hand side. So that weaker statement works for any Y group, just because as long as you have this bottom, Because as long as you have these both Samuelson resolutions and they exist for all G and D, then once you have this independence of logarithmic forms, so it works automatically. But then comparing one and the other, so that's something that so how unique this isomorphism, because you you're again you're making choices. So so that part we haven't really uh uh done that, but there's hope that it will work out. There's hope that it will work out. Well, we are good. Note the long break. We're back at 4:30 p.m. local time. So I don't know if this is
