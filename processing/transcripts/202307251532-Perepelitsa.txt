The first one is from Professor Misa Perepelica and he's going to talk about kinematic modeling for motion of visual activity with kinematic life. Thank you very much. Thank you organizers for giving this workshop. At the right time of the year, if you can get off to the north and pull off a little bit. So this is the work with collaboration of Iran McKey from the University of Poulston and I engineer physicists actually from the Rice University. This is actually from the Rice Mentors, Patrick Norke, and Ricky Kosch. So here's the model, biological model would like to model that we'd like to model, right? So this is the mix of bacteria, right? It's the broad-shaped thing. It has engines on both sides, meaning that it pulls out those whiskers or teli from itself. It attaches those telides to the substrate. Then it retracts them, and in this way it pulls forward. Those things are on both sides of the material. Actually, there is another mode of motion when this thing can kind of screw itself through the substrate moving this way. But it's not going to be important, right? Just general facts about this object, right? This is the actual thing, markshort of those things, right? The media, and the object is very interesting, it's very popular in this biologist because get a lot of interest in collective behavior. For example, cells can organize into swarms. They get together and go around looking for prey, looking for food. They can also organize themselves in the wave patterns, stationary waves or Stationary waves or turbulent waves. So here is the image, like dark spots here, and they correspond to the higher density of cells. And also under the starting condition, they go together and form this three-dimensional object protein model. Okay, so there are several uh types of features of uh this function that we're gonna kind of simplify to be used in the mathematical model, right? In the mathematical model, right? So we're going to think of the cell just as the rod of length L, width W, and actually we're going to ignore the width in all the representative. The cell moves in the direction of the linear axis. E of theta will be the orientation vector, E is the speed, right? And the types of motion, right? There are reversals, but then this. Also, the cell goes in one direction, then it switches and goes in the opposite direction. Here we are moving back and forth. So, those are reversals. There is tumbled motion, so this is the second. The second type of motion is tumble motion when the cells they stop and then they start off in completely random direction. There is the kimot axis when the parameters of tumble motion or reversals depend on the chemical that this bacteria can excrete. Excrete. And the first type is dynamic alignment. So, this is the one we're going to talk about today. For the reversals, well, the thing is that for the one to three, for the first three types of motion, we have very good models. We have the equations that everybody knows that those are the equations to study. For the reversal, it's either the Gross time model, if reversal times are exponential, the more general case is was done by ALT, right. Was done by ALT. Tumbled motion can be written down as sort of generalization of the reversals, right? And direction is chosen randomly. It's basically the same model and chemotaxis. For the chemotaxis, you have a Keller-Ziegl model in a certain part of model limit from the kinetic model of the reverse. So those first three things are good, right? And we're going to concentrate on the alignment. Going to concentrate on the alignment. Because cells are aligned. So, for example, we have this cell that moves horizontally, either to the left or to the right, and when it's hit by another cell that goes from below, they both align to each other, they become parallel. So, those blue lines are the new irritations. So, this cell turns uh clockwise, that cell turns uh counterclockwise, right? Coupled clockwise, and they become parallel and move in the same or in the opposite direction. Another type of alignment is asymmetric alignment, when just one cell rearrangement. So, this cell that goes from below, it rearries and starts moving parallel to the cell above. And here's a quantum moon here that shows that this type of asymmetrical element is actually something that is actually uh something that something yes they uh they not quite not quite reached rods right but that's okay that's an approximation we'd like to think yes okay uh symmetric alignment is nice because uh this is a consideration property right so the total angle uh is constructed right uh total angle with all the conditional Total end of all the condition and other conditions you could serve. It's convenient to have this consideration somewhere down the road. Okay, uh so the whole project was started to kind of to get to write out the PDEs, right? Reasonable PDEs for this thematic alignment, right? Reasonable mean the PDEs that will uh you know will uh will you know it's a good match against one. Match against rotation-based models, right? And also, we'll provide a way to solve them. So, today we'll discuss several models, I will compare them, but at the end of the lecture, actually, the conclusion is that at the moment, we don't know exactly what the correct PG model is. And it's very interesting, actually. Not say that this is the system that we should study already. So here's the plan of the talk. So here's the plan of the talk. I'm going to start with the classical and old kinetic liquid crystal model of alignment. There is the variation of this model, which allows for the actually macroscopic, not just kinetic description. There will be three equations, macroscopic equation describing the motion. And then the second part of the talk will be about the collisional models or the personal type models, right? Boltzmann type models, right? So basically, this is the attempt to apply the Boltzmann framework, which we know from the gas dynamics, to this type of alignment. Two things that we'll discuss here. First is the connection between the collisional Boltzmann-type model with the collated crystal model, and then we'll talk more about the S magical analytical model. Alright, and just to give you an idea what comes up very quickly. And just to give you an idea of what comes up, this is the web PDE group. We're going to see back-end system of PDEs most of the time, actually all the time in the stock. And generally, they can be in non-conservative form, which is the interesting feature because it's not clear how to define the weak solutions for these systems. And the regular solutions. And the regular solutions, we know that they blow up, right? Because in finite time, they don't exist for all times. Okay, so let me start with the kinetic liquid crystal model, just to tell you what it is. So here we have a bunch of cells, right? So we're looking at the focal cell I here. We have certain interaction radius, which is used. Interaction radius, which is usually comparable to the size of the cell, is bulk here, right? And then we just look at all cells that are contained inside this interaction values. So each one has orientation theta, right? Like this one has orientation theta j. And then we define what is called the mean local numeric director. So this is the averaging of squares of annotations. Squares of orientations. So you take the orientation vector e to the i theta, you square it, and you average it, right? And it's square because we don't want to distinguish between the orientation and the opposite orientation. They're going to count as well just one way, because it's mneematic. You average this, you'll get This one, right? Yes, yes. Press over escape. Yeah, so you average the schematic orientations, you'll get the pneumatic director, theta bar, and then you say, well, this our focal cell theta i is going to align continuously according to this ODE, right? So the design tools. right so this the sine two theta bar minus theta i gives you these uh signs for the orientation right so if this direction is theta bar then uh your cell is here right it's gonna move move clockwise right if it's there right it's gonna move counterclockwise the matic direction sine to theta right and I see this this function alive and so what does this heuristic model right so So where does this heuristic model, right? So this is like the Bishop type model for the polar alignment. And actually this thing can be kind of mimics the mean field model of alignment in liquid crystals, so-called Meyer-Zalpe theory. And I'll show you this on the next slide how this magic director comes from that. So the picture will be almost identical, and the picture. Almost identical, and the picture is the same, right? But now think of these errors here as liquid crystals, which were electric dipoles. And now there is electric field, right? So the action of dipole J or dipole I is through this interaction potential, it has the form of negative cosine of the difference of the angles. Then you sum up. You sum up over all dipoles around this one eye, and then you postulate the alignment will be along the gradient, negative gradient of this interaction, aggregated interaction potential. So take the gradient here, then we get the summation of the sines to theta j minus theta i, and this is exactly the same law. The same law of alignment that we saw on the previous page with the mean director. So you can rewrite this using the mean director theta theta part. So here's the analogy. So we have cells. If you think of them as dipoles, then you can use this theorem from liquid crystals. Now let's take things, right? Combine Combine everything that we know. We have the change of the position according to the velocity of it. We have the change of the angle for each particle, and then the Fokker-Point equation, right now, the Fokker-Point equations for this system of particles. And it's going to be, can be written in this form. So the transport form, this is pneumatic alignment that we just discussed, this whole thing here. So it's written using this vector. This vector field J, which is called the pneumatic current, but it corresponds exactly to this type of interaction. And there is noise. There's a noise term over here. Okay, so there is a nice mean field PD, right? And what you can get with this is, for example, the system establishes the phase transition phenomena, right? So there is also. So there is always a steady state, constant steady state, f equals constant. So f is the kinetic function in the distribution of the angle. So f constant means that you have all angles with the same distribution, right? You have to get completely heterogeneous state. And then well there is the parameter uh eta, which is the ratio of diffusi diffusivity over the density, and it controls the stability of the steady state. Also, the stability of the steady state. If it's large, the steady state is stable. When it's small, well, it's the critical value, when you're going to get non-constant solutions. So what is S here? S is the order parameter, right? So if F is constant, if everything is heterogeneous, S is zero, right? And then if it's not zero, we know that it's not a constant state, which is stable. And the picture over here on the right, it shows. And the picture over here on the right, it shows the profile, this non-steady profile, this time over which you start at time t equals zero with almost constant state, but then the oscillations that keep growing until they reach this symmetric steady state. Symmetric meaning that we have two peaks, right, and the the difference between two peaks is precisely pi. And so we have The magic limitation. Okay, very good. The next model, as I said, will be the variation of this. It's due to Digon, Meinhardt, and you. So here we're going to have a relaxation parameter. This is 1 over epsilon. This is like the rate of alignment. We're going to take. We're going to take it to be large, the rate of alignment. Alignment is fast. And this is the alignment operator, which looks different from what we saw in the previous slide, but it's, I mean, qualitatively it's the same. So we have this function, which is pneumatic alignment to the mean director, right? And also there is the noise, but here noise is, I mean, it's not. I mean, it's not uniform, right? The diffusion coefficient. And moreover, it depends on the theta bar. So it's non-linear. It's non-linear noise, right? So why is this model? Well, the answer is that for this particular choice of transport in the diffusion, you can solve for the equilibrium solutions. You can get the formulas, right? So that's the only reason why selecting this complicated. Complicated things for the noise and animatic alignment. And this is the formula, right? That's what you get for equilibrium solutions. It's kind of not complicated. Well, actually, it's the one, it's very close to pretty much the same. You can think of it as being the one that you saw here, right? There are two. Uh two peaks and uh uh five units apart. Billy solutions. Okay. Well now how to get the macroscopic model written out of this? So you take epsilon to zero, right? So you expect formally at least that your solution F goes to the equilibrium density and equilibrium profile, right? But then you got new But then you need the conservation quantities. You need something to be conserved to write down the microscopic equations. So the conservation of one conservation quantity is always there. It's the conservation of the number of cells. Cells are the same number of cells, it's always the same, doesn't change. And then there'll be two generalized Carlisian invariants. And this is the concept that was introduced by Digon and Moch in 2008. And what it is. other than 8 and what it is is the following thing. So you have the function psi that depends on the kinetic variable theta. So we want this psi to be orthogonal to the alignment operator. But the restriction is that it's orthogonal not to all f's but only the subspace of some functions. Subspace is a key. Because, well in this example you can choose Well, in this example, you can choose the subspace of functions to be the functions orthogonal to this sine to theta minus theta bar. In gas dynamics, your invariance are 1, v, and v squared. So here it's something that actually depends on the subspace of the functions, right? So if you do it this way, you see that your generalized collision invariant. Generalized collision invariant is going to depend on this parameter theta theta bar, which is the local quantity, right? It depends on x and t. So if you apply this to your equations, you'll get something, right? You'll get the equation for all parameters that you need. Rho bar, rho minus, rho plus, rho minus, theta bar, but the system that you get in. Getting here is not within a conservative system. It's a hyperbolic system, you can check that it's hyperbolic, right? You write down the eigenvalues of the matrix in front of the x derivatives. It's going to be, all eigenvalues will be real, right? But uh the system is not conserved before thi this is kind of very very you know general situation that you get with Situation that you get with s with these uh alignment type systems. Yeah, hyperbolic, but not conserved. Okay, now this is all good. This is now going to switch to the Boltzmann type, original type framework, right? And the one reason that uh we want to look at this is that the liquid crystal model, right, so the way it's kind of introduced is Kind of introduced these using the analogy with liquid crystals, right? But liquid crystals are electric dipoles, right? So, what is the mechanism of interaction between cells? But they cannot interact over distances, right? So, we're not assuming any chemotaxis type of interaction there. So, one idea was to kind of look for, start with the alignment model that actually takes into account the alignments. Into account the alignments that happen when two cells collide. Completely kind of mechanistic way of trying to recover the mean field model from the mechanistic model of collisions. That's one motivation. Another one is to look at the different types of collisions, right? Symmetric and asymmetric. Okay, so here is the slide that's that's we saw We saw pretty much in the previous talk. It's a Boisman equation for verified cases. I'm not going to write down the foremost for all those operators, so we will meet that. But the thing is that it's the following. So the whole right-hand side here, it's the interaction operator, and it's written as expansion in powers of L. So this L is the radius of the interacting of the interacting spheres, right, in Gaussian numbers. So we're going to have the first term, which is the Boltzmann operator. So the classical Boltzmann equation contains only this part, this first operator. The next term has this order parameter, ML cubed over L cubed. So L is the radius, capital L is the macroscopic length, what else there is macroscopic time, right? And in this system, we're going to see. And in this system, we're going to see just the Knutsen number compared to the additional parameter that we saw in the previous talk because we're assuming that the macroscopic speed coincides with the microscopic speed. So we're assuming that V here is given by the ratio of the ratio of L. Okay, and guess the next, if you look at the If you look at the order of these parameters, the first one will be of order 10 to the 7, right? The other one will be 10 to the negative 3. So the classical approach is to ignore all these terms, this, and everything goes after that. And this huge parameter here gives you the ratio of microscopic length. Ratio of microscopic length over the mean three path. So this is plus. This factor in front of the Q narr parameter is going to be plus. And other things that you have to assume, that's what we're going to call the Wolfson framework, is that collisions are binary. Most collisions occur between two cells, not three, not four, just two. Independence of the particle distribution, this is the assumption. Distribution, right? This is the assumption that allows us to close the system, close system regions, and small ratio of size of the cell to the parts of the Poisson framework. Okay, and now of course, and if you let Moosey number two zero, write this parameter to infinity, you recover your Maxivarian distributions, right? And with that, And with that, with the conserved number of particles, momentum, and energy, you'll get your early emissions. Now, let's compare all this with what we'll be getting when we try to apply this to interacting cells. On the right, this is the interaction alignment operator. Again, we can expand. Again, we can expand this into the powers of L, small L over L. The powers now are different because everything in two dimensions. So the first will be, I mean, this first power, second power, one power less compared to 3D gas dynamics. And if you look at the numbers that people use in experiments, the length of the cell, the number of cells, this variant of the number of cells, of the number of cells. Of the number of cells, uh size of the domain, right? Do you see that the range of this one of the Knudsen number rate is from 30 to 30 and the range of this second order next term approximation is between uh you know hundreds to uh to uh To one-tenth, right, for that range. So the ranges are not as extreme as for the gas dynamics, right? So it's kind of perhaps yet you might want to keep the both terms, right? But this is what has been done in the literature. Paper of Bertandro's Gregory. It looks at the pneumatic, actually, it's a polar alignment of so-called cells. So here, cells are. So here cells are not rods, they're circles. And they look at the Poisson type equation when the first order parameter is of select one and they ignore higher order terms. The second result, it's more recent. If my refiner might have schneiser, they stay in Waterloo framework, right? So the first coefficient is large. So the first coefficient is large, everything else is small, and they could not alignment in this case. And the one that we're going to talk, I'll show in this talk is the regime in which we do assume that the first coefficient is large in this approximation, but the second coefficient is of order one. And it will be kind of the point here to. You have to keep this term, right? You have to keep the second of the term to get reasonable approximation with reasonable match, right? With agent-based behavior. Otherwise, it will be something else. Okay, but before we move to that, I'm going to show you a result that is promised before, right? And this is the connection between the Right, and this is the connection between the Boltzmann uh type collisional alignment with the with the mean field. Okay, so here we're going to start with with symmetric alignments, right? This is the picture that we saw before. So we have a cell theta one colliding with theta theta, and then theta one rotates clockwise, right? That one rotates counterclockwise by the same amount of Amount of angle, right? These are the new angles, right? The total angle is conserved, but the key point here is to take the amount of alignment to be small. You're going to see this delta here. So this delta is going to be tiny. So we're going to take it to zero, infinitesimal. So if you do this, if you put this thing into the If you put this thing into the Boltzmann equation, right, and as you assume that the delta parameter is small, these are the usual other microscopic limit assumption, number of small is large. The situation is kind of similar to what is called the grays in collisions in gas dynamics. So, in this limit, you actually can derive, you recover the mean field that we saw before, almost the same. Saw before, almost the same except that it's going to have this extra parameter in the interaction rate, right? The sine difference of the angles, and this extra parameter comes from here, right? So from this geometry. So we're looking at kind of target cell theta, right? And we mark the region of centers of all cells with which this theta can interact during time delta t. And it's going to be this parallelogram. And it's going to be this parallel drone. And it has the area proportional to sine of the difference of the end of site. How many cells it can interact. And this difference, I mean, this goes into the equation, right? So extra parameters for the equation. So compared like, you know, quantitatively compared to the liquid crystal model, this model, the binary collisions, establishes very similar behavior. Very similar behavior, but there's a phase transition again, but it will occur in different points. And the power law is the same in both cases. Yes, you can get your mean field model, right? Just assuming that there are binary collisions, there is small change in the angle of core collision, but the number of collision is large. But the number of collision is larger. In unit of time, we have finite amount of line. So this is the good thing. This is another way to kind of validate the uniform model. Okay. And the next the second result will be a, we'll try to apply this Try to apply this Boltzmann framework, almost Boltzmann framework, to the asymmetric alignment. These are the pictures, snapshots from the movie that we saw on the first slide. It's one kit and another in aligns with that. So those are the pre-collisional arrangements of orientations, post-collisional arrangements. The one thing which is nice is that if you have in the You have a finite set of orientations at time t equals zero, right? Later on, you're going to have either two orientations or orientations with the opposite, the opposite directions. Okay, other assumptions will be binary collisions to particle independence, like the classical Boltzmann framework, and then again, as I mentioned, we're going to keep to the second order. As I mentioned, we're going to keep to the second order in the next term approximation in our equation. That is important to know. Okay, so write an equation is not hard, right? Those expressions for the both operators. Q0 contains its quadratic term F. It contains the products of kinetic functions with different angles, depending on what type of kinetic function. On what type of collision we have, and the next term contains the product of f and the gradient of the gradient of f. There is the asymmetry property, which you can think of kind of the generalized collision invariant in this case, and this will help us to write down the macroscopic equations. Right, and now we're going to look at the set of equilibria, right? Because yes, the set of Because a set of functions which verify this equation, and there are some special cases, right? We don't know the most general expression for that, but you can have a group of cells with orientations within the angle of radius of angle pilot effect. You have all orientations in here, that is the equilibrium. Another case, you can have the orientations either in this wedge or pi over two. You can have anything in this wage and you can have anything, the same thing multiplied by some factor at the wall. And actually, this is the only equilibrium if you have two pneumatic orientations, meaning that if you have only two score orientations, they are shown by a gray. Right shown by red errors, this is the only equilibrium that you can have. Okay, so we're going to get, so we go to the asymptotic limit with small meter number, right, letting formally, right, that gives us, tells us that our density will approach the equilibrium density, which in the case when we have only f. When we have only m initial annotations, right? It's going to look like this. We're going to have all those annotations, only some local masses that depend on x and t. Or we can have the exactly opposite orientation, so basically classify here with the mass proportional to the densities that we have over here. So counting the number of parameters. So counting the number of parameters, we have m we have m densities, rho k, we have the extra parameter lambda, right? So that's m plus one microscopic parameters, and we have exactly m plus one conserved quantity, not conserved quantities, kind of generalized variance, let's put it this way. Total number of cells Total number of cells and M asymmetric conditions that we saw before. Okay, now going down to equations, FPEs. The top is what you have, that you have if you have only two angles, theta one and theta two. Down here if you have two numeric orientations, right? We have two orientations or two opposite orientations that but they are proportional to each other. They are proportional to each other. Hyperbolic systems, right? Both hyperbolic, you can check that, you can check the eigenvalues. They kind of, and they're non-conservative, right? That's one bad thing is that maybe you don't know what to do with them, right? They're non-conservative. But there is yet another special case, right? If your orientations, in the case of the two orientations, suppose that you have two symmetric orientations, like one and those. Like one end of 504, they have one three-quarters of the pipe. Then the system that I just showed you to you reduces to the system. Each equation has this actual conservation of mass. You can think of density rho one, density of the red cells moving with, and there's the velocity that transports that. The velocity that transports that density. And velocity is 1 plus C2 times rho 2. And there's a very explanation, a very easy explanation where this rho 2 comes from. This is the velocity of the cell itself. That's the transfer velocity. But there is an additional term proportional to the other density in the red velocity. And it comes from this picture. So if you have red cells, So if you have red cells interacting with the blue cell, it rotates through its center and becomes the blue cell. So immediately after the interaction, there is the blue cell at a certain distance from the blue cell over here. So there is like a speed up in propagation of row one and row two cells. I'm just switching, right? There's additional switching of. Switching, right? There's additional switching of cells. So that's very nice, right? So we have now we have the system that we can solve, right? For the weak solutions, it's the 2x2 hyperbolic systems. And we check that for a couple of arrangements of cells. This is one-dimensional. This is the picture of two pens, ortho-orthomore rectangular pens. So we have From a rectangular band. So we have blue cells here moving this way, red cells here moving that way, right? They interact, and the numerical solution for this interaction, numerical solution of that, it is going to look like this. And actually you can solve it explicitly, right? You can write down. Two shocks, right, colliding with each other and after that the bands separate. They change, the shape a little bit, they're not the same as before the interaction. So initially there is the refraction wave going this way, there is kind of degenerate shock, which simply transports the cells and then there is an interaction between them. And after that there are two shocks moving to each other. Miracle, numerical solution for this system. And I mean, it's interesting, but it matches the agent-based simulation, right? If you just start with cells, make them interact this way, they put two sort of things, two sort of pictures show you IBM is agent-based simulation versus the PDE simulation. They kind of close enough so that you can distinguish between shock waves and rarefaction waves. Close to that. So it's Gaussian waves and the components and all there are great. Okay, so this is the good part, right? But things actually are not very good, right? Because uh if you run the simulations If you run those simulations for long enough, you're going to see that there is a discrepancy between the PDs and aging-based simulations. Telling us that the system that we derived might be good, but only in some transient region. Eventually, those two things become different. And that happens because there is a clustering of cells. So this picture is showing you Picture is showing you actual cells, right? How they distributed after a certain amount of time. Initially, there was total chaos, right? Everything was distributed randomly and uniformly along the domain. But after the domain, you see clusters, right? Blue cells, red cells together. And it tells you that, well, the assumptions of our Portsmouth framework, well, in particular, the independence hypothesis breaks down. It's not true here. Down. It's not true here, right? So here we also computed the amount of clustering. There is a way to measure this. And there is the breakdown of independence. Those three curves are for different values of kappa. Kappa measures this cell length over the mean free path. Three different regions, but in each region, just different rates, but in all cases. Rates, but in all cases, independence. It's not independence, it was timely and clustering growths. So this was kind of surprising. You didn't expect that. And so what are the things to do here? It's what uh how this how the system can analyze what what a good meaning is. Analyzed what a Wikipedia is. Well, first of all, if you add a cell reversal and noise in annotation, this can restore the identical independence again and can still work inside this framework. The bad approach is that, I mean, I think what should be done here is you have to find different loaders for the public. Find different logarithms for the path of distribution function. So it's not the possible thing. It's not the guess, right? There are clusters. You have to find different closure relation for the automatic function. But you can still work with your Wolfson framework if you get the right model of the cluster, meaning that you allow cells now to stick together and move with one particle. Stick together and move as one particle, right? In this way, you know, it's you know everything is interacts later on. There is the independence between orientations of those things that interact. Because once things interact and they stay together. This is one of the things that the future will try to try to work on this direction. Okay, and the summary of all these things. All these things later. We have two models: the mean field model. The drawback that it's kind of heuristic, alignment mechanism, it's not clear if it's high mechanism or not, but the good things that of course is applicable for high cell densities. You don't have to enforce binary collisions there. You can have lots of cells around one cell, and it does not require molecular chaos or any collisions. With collisional models, they are more realistic, and I think it's just the right direction to go there. It's just you have to be more work to be done. But it's definitely something that we'd like to pursue here. Okay, and I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Any questions? What determines whether a collision will be symmetric or not symmetric? I mean, there is just two completely separate models or can you separate models? Biologists are kind of good with both of them. Like I show you the movie, right? But the thing is that I mean sometimes cells they they they have those whiskers right because they can attach to the other cell with those whiskers and when they pull they kind of both cells they change the rotation. Okay, so this is the mechanism of the is there some proper like intrinsic stubbornness of uh of Awareness of bacteria which makes it less likely to change direction or something like that. I'm not a biologist, I cannot tell you, but I mean they both of these models, I mean they kind of, I mean and justify them, okay, one way. And justify them, okay, one way or another. So you can they you can work with both of them and that's fine. But biologically, I don't know. So do you have a microscopic model for your boards, man? I mean gold rooms. Microscopic modes, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah, so the ones this this one, the PD, right? Um how about PDE? Microscope. Microscope? An AD? No. Just agent-based model. Like hard-scripted dynamics. This is microscopic, right? That's with lenses. There is a kinetic one. This is the kinetic one at the bottom. Not a particle system. I mean, there is a particle system. Agent-based? Yeah, I mean, you just phase as cells move, and then whenever they collide, you are. Whenever they collide, you are reorienting them. Straight lines, except for collision times? Yes. Trajectories are straight lines until they interact, until they collide, right? And then something like classical passage from Newtonian hard spheres to possible hardspheres also. Those are all formal results, so there is no There are no proofs of theorem to go from one to another, but if you look at the paper of I think De Grant for that model that I mentioned this paper that I mentioned here right so there is there is there is a justification of going from here right to to the from the kinetic picture to microscope from particle From particle, I mean like this is the particle domain, please. If there is a result that tells you how to go from here to there. But this is this is V check type. This is which type, yes. What do we know about the composiness of this? Magic transport looks pretty singular. Question to Roman, yeah. Yes, I know. Yes, I am. I haven't seen analytical results. What I put it this way, I haven't seen results. Anything that tells you that something exists, so it's regular breaks down something of this query. Yeah, because all those pictures, I think they are very consolations, and they are full. Spherical simulations and therefore space homogeneous case. Not directly, only kinetic kinetics. Yeah, so space homogeneous Okar plan rate. I mean it does fine. But then Wikinetic transport in classical solution actually helps, right? It introduces solution. But here it's unimodal. It's unimodular. Like kinetic averaging? For example, average levels, right? Would they still be valid here? So there are lots of interesting PDEs you can make if you'd like to share more information with chemical patients. Any other questions? Any other question? I mean with real cells. Yes. Is that something that's from Serb? Just like where you're doing. Yeah, I mean they they do form clusters like the swarms for example the question is no they don't stick together I mean they move close to each other you can take it as you know Take it as, you know, if you like the model, you can as a little bit. But perhaps you can speak. I'm trying to understand, so like let's say two cells collide and then they become more parallel and then they want to move in the same direction and then there's another cell coming in and then there's another collision. So when the second condition happens, is it like Happens, is it like the first, like the cell pair is gonna be colliding into this third cell? That's like a big cell kind of thing? That's how big cells are gonna form, right? So, I mean, if two cells move together and you have something else colliding, it will align. Okay, larger and larger in that way. And I guess, I mean, the point of collision can vary, right? So you can you can uh clusters that You can uh clusters that for example collide here, right? Faster also is going to spread like more but in that case wouldn't the um the the radius of the rock also matter? For there are a lot of things that are simplified here, right? For example, the width of the rod, right, we we we know The width of the rod, right? We ignore it completely, but you can put the width of the rod, right? And also, actually, interesting because the way cells reorient, right, for example, in all these models that I showed you today, the cell variance through its center, right? So through the center of the cell, and then it becomes like this, right? And right, the model will cell variance through its tip, right? So it becomes like this. So it becomes like that. The equations are similar, but there is a parameter that actually controls the type of the equation. You can have hyperbolic equation for one regime and it changes to the elliptic to the other regime. So there is phase transition, kind of phase transition. Very sensitive, but PDEs are very sensitive how you how you. Sensitive how you set up your equations. But yeah. Any other questions? Okay, is it opportunity to speak on it? Is it curious? The next step is going to be online, isn't it? We need to publicize
