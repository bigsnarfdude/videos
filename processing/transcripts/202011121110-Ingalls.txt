Thanking the organizers for the opportunity to participate. I work in systems and synthetic biology, so I'm a bit of an outsider in this group, but I want to show you a project that I think has some nice opportunities for synergy with what's going on here in terms of epidemiology and the genomics. And so I hope you'll agree that that's the case as we go forward. And if not, maybe this is just kind of Go forward, and if not, maybe this is just kind of a curious diversion, and that will work too. Okay, the title is a bit of a mouthful, but let me start just by setting things up. So, to put the talk in context of the workshop, I'm going to present that fits with FE, and genetics is pretty central. So, from that perspective, it's a good fit. From that perspective, it's a good fit. The host population I'm considering is microbial, not the infectious agents, but the hosts themselves. So, that I think makes it stand out a bit. And the other standout point is the infectious agent is engineered. So, that is to introduce an engineered infectious agent, which again, I think hasn't come up in the context of the workshop to this point. So, the other celebrity I'll put on here is less recognizable, but familiar to folks who But familiar to folks who study and work in math and logic. So, DeMorgan's got this cute little poem that is often cited when we're introducing the idea of recursion. And so, in the context of that little idea, here's the idea for the project, which is to engineer little fleas to bite the fleas that are bothering us. So, the fleas are pathogens, and we want to engineer ways to make them less. To make them less problematic. Okay, so this I think is a nice compliment actually to Santiago's talk, in part because I'm going to focus on hotel gene transfer, which was central in the previous talk. And also, I think, a good compliment because what I'm going to show you might look a bit naive, but it's a starting point. And so we've got an idea to start a project and see how far we can take it in terms of investigation. So just to remind everyone, we So, just to remind everyone, we classify horizontal gene transfer in terms of three mechanisms: transformation, which is just take up of DNA directly from the environment, transduction, which is when that DNA is transferred via phage, and then conjugation, where plasmid is inducing production of a mating bridge along which a copy of the plasmid is transmitted. So, the basic idea is to exploit horizontal gene transfer to manipulate populations. Populations. And this is not a new idea by any means. This is something that's done in the lab all the time. This is how we generate new strains in the lab. But in the lab, generally, what you want to do is take advantage of one of these mechanisms, make a modification, and then identify an isolate that has that property, select that isolate, and then move on and do further experiments with that strain. And the question that's being asked here is, can we do the same thing at the population level? thing to the at the population level can we impact the population and then the far more ambitious uh long-term goal here is to do that in in uh in in an environment in situ so from the perspective of of uh resistance the idea would be there's a target population which is uh has some resistance phenotype that we're that we're uh we want um to um deal with we introduce this engineered genetic element into the environment and then via some horizontal gene transfer mechanism it gets into the cells and once it's there It gets into the cells, and once it's there, it will do what we've, again, in theory, what we've designed it to do. So, we might knock out a resistance phenotype, we might selectively kill the resistant cells, something along those lines. And again, this is something that's very standard in the lab from the perspective of impacting individual cells. And the question is whether that can be achieved at the population level to a meaningful extent. Okay, so if you're thinking about implementing this kind of idea, there are a number of design designs. Number of design decisions that would come into reaching towards an implementation. So I've just got a few of those labeled here. So from the perspective of horizontal gene transfer, there are these three mechanisms I mentioned. Transformation is not a very efficient process, and so that's not really being considered, but phase transduction and plasma conjugation are both things that can be designed and can be effective at the population level. Then there's a question of what does this genetic element do once it enters the host? Once it enters the host, and there are a number of mechanisms on the table for how something could be achieved. So, CRISPR-Cass is the current favorite for having a selective activity once these things are delivered. There are other classes of ribo-switches that allow for other kind of behaviors. So, for instance, expression of gene on the introduced genetic element in a transcript-specific manner. Manner. There's another mechanism of vectorial plasmid incompatibility that would allow for diffusion of an undesirable plasmid out of a growing population. And then as I mentioned, along with engineering what the mechanism is going to be, one could engineer what the desired effect is. So that could be selective killing of particular cells that, for instance, are expressing a particular gene, sensitization or loss of particular phenotypes, including loss of virulence or knocking out pathogenicity island. Or knocking up pathogenicity island. And then one question that's relevant to a sort of epidemiological analysis here is whether the engineered element gets into a host directly from a delivery to the environment, or whether once it's in a host, it can then propagate to further hosts. And here there's a trade-off between sort of penetration and effectiveness versus risk and safety considerations that, of course, have to be taken into account. Okay, so yeah, transformation is not being considered. I mentioned that. Okay, so then where would one want to do this sort of thing? Basically, wherever there are resistant populations that are undesirable. So in clinical settings or in ARG hotspots. So this is an idea that a number of groups are looking at. Some original proof of principle experimental results came out about five years ago. There are a couple of companies that are Couple of companies that are exploiting this kind of idea to move forward. The companies are focused on using this idea for selective manipulation of gut microbiomes. I think that gets more VC money than trying to sell abiotic resistance, but anyway, it's the same idea. Okay, so what I want to do with the remaining time is just tell you about one project that we've completed recently, looking at trying to build predictive models of this kind of process. Predictive models of this kind of process to see whether we could move towards model-based design long-term in terms of being able to predict what kind of effect we'd have and implementing an idea like this. And so we're focusing here on plasma conjugation, just that delivery piece to see whether we can, again, arrive at a predictive description of how this works. So the story here is a very simple infection process in a very simplified lab setting, again, just as a first proof of principle. So we have here is an experimental setting where I've got a target population. Where I've got a target population of cells. These are E. coli cells, primarily for convenience. And then I've got a donor population that's introduced, and that donor population has a self-conjugating plasma, this green circle, that will be transferred to the recipients, and then they will be effective donors. So this is self-conjugating, so it can be transferred to another cell downstream. The experiments are relatively straightforward. It's just standard filter meeting. So we put the cells on. Filter meeting. So we put the cells on agar plates on top of a filter. At the time point we're interested in, we take the filter off, we pass the cells to a flow cytometer, and that gives us a fluorescence readout of each cell. And we've set things up so that we have a unique fluorescence signature for each of the subpopulations we're interested in tracking. So we have our recipients have a red fluorescent background. Our donors have their conjugating plasmid, which has a green fluorescent marker on it. And then so these transformations. Lesson marker on it. And then so these transconjugants, which are the infected recipients, have expressing both green and a red. So we can bin those based on our cytometric readouts to get to track the three populations over time. Okay, so from an epidemiological perspective, this is a really very simple story and it was told a long time ago. So Bruce Levin put together a model 40 years ago now that's basically an SI model describing this process. That's basically an SI model describing this process. The one distinction is that we're tracking the infectious population in two subpopulations: those that were originally infectious, which are our donors, and the target cells that have become infectious, and those are our transconjugants. So the standard SI piece is here. This is our infection rate, which is the conjugation rate. So there's some kinetic rate here. And then we have our infectious population and our susceptible population, which is these recipients. And the other factor that they And the other factor that they took into account was that there was growth of these of each of these populations through time. Okay, so we took this very simple model, we ran some simulations, we ran some preliminary experiments and compared them to see how they look. Roughly they match up, but not all that well. So here's the model dynamics, exactly what you would expect. This is on a semi-log scale, so exponential growth of, in this case, the donor population is just a straight line. And then we have the recipient population growing and falling off as they get turned. Growing and falling off as they get turned into transconjugates as the infection process proceeds. We compare that with our data from the experiment, and we see that things don't match all that well. And we certainly aren't going to be able to get predictions that we'll have any confidence in. And so what we did is considered aspects of the process that that simple model isn't capturing. Those are primarily having to do with the growth dynamics on these plates. So these undergo a standard bacterial growth curve. Undergo a standard bacterial growth curve that has a lag and then a transition to stationary phase to cessation of growth and heterogeneity among this strain, which can't be captured by that simple model. So we take all those pieces and we throw them into the model to allow for that flexibility. And we get this very large thing, which I won't bother to go over, which is sort of kitchen sink level model where we've got all these different pieces of the dynamics included. We know that's going to be over parametrized if we try to fit it. It's got too many degrees of freedom. It's got too many degrees of freedom. We compare that with this very simple model that has just two degrees of freedom and can't capture the data. And so, what we need to do is some model comparisons. So, we're going to use it. We used an AIC description here. So, we have a training set that we ran a number of experiments with different initial ratios and inocula. And so we run model variance across against that data to fit a standard sum of square errors. And then we Of square errors, and then we determine an AIC score for each of these models. And as expected, we find that this kitchen sink model is over-parametrized with a high AIC. The very simple model has a very poor fit. And so, again, a high AIC. And there's a nice intermediate in the middle here where we get a model that we see as best supported by the data. So, this is what that model looks like. It doesn't really matter. It fits the data fairly well. And what we want to do, though, is And what we want to do, though, is go beyond just getting something that we are comfortable with describing what's going on to the point where we can get something where we can actually think about making predictions. And again, this is towards model-based design of implementations down the road. And so we do some uncertainty analysis. So this is standard local analysis looking at parametric sensitivities and our measures of confidence in the data that we've collected, so fisher information type analyses. Type analyses and we get some rankings of our estimates. And here, some estimates of 95% confidence intervals. So, these numbers aren't fantastic, but they are, in this game, they're actually, we were pretty satisfied with these. And certainly from a perspective of a sort of first go at collecting data, this seems like a pretty good start. And then the real proof of the pudding is in making predictions. So, what we did is we went back to the lab, we made some predictions. Went back to the lab. We made some predictions in terms of simulating behaviors from scenarios that are slightly different from the training experiments. From the training experiments, the two populations were inoculated at the same time, and we ran scenarios where we staggered the loading of the two populations to give a little bit of a different dynamic between growth and conjugation. And so we run the simulations, then we go back to the lab and run those experiments, and this is what we see. And run those experiments, and this is what we see in terms of fit. And so, there's some discrepancies here, but overall, we were fairly satisfied that as a first step suggests that we have a good enough understanding of what's going on here that we can arrive at a predictive model. Again, in this simple setting, really just as a proof of principle. Okay, and then I just in the last two minutes here, let me just mention there's a couple other extensions that we've added to this. So, one was looking at model-based design of extensions. Was looking at model-based design of experiments to improve the efficiency of our data collection. So, in particular, we were looking at how best to sample the time points here. So, the time points are destructive, and so there's a fair bit of resources going into each time point. And so, we really want to maximize the information we're getting here. So, we put together a de-optimal measure of optimality in terms of design of experiments here. We have a Experiments here. We have a relaxation approach that we had to engineer to put this together, and we arrive at a model-based characterization of optimal time point selection moving forward to collect data from these experiments. And then the thing that we're working on very recently is to move away from a non-spatial representation. So I showed you an ODE model of what was clearly a spatially distributed phenomenon. And so we've recently acquired a fluorescence microscope that allows us to collect time-lapse. Microscope that allows us to collect time lapses like this, where we're able to track the cells over time. And so we've got an agent-based model that we can use to characterize that behavior. And in addition, we're looking at develop, we've developed a partial differential equation-based model, which is standard in its description of cell density and velocity. So we're looking here at microcolony formation. But the other piece that we want to keep track of is orientation. And the reason is that. Orientation. And the reason is that conjugation in this context is dependent to some degree on the amount to which cells are in contact, membranes are in contact. And so we want to be able to keep track of whether cells are well ordered or whether they're loosely ordered. And so that's an additional feature of that partial difference equation model that we've been able to put in place. Okay, I think I'm out of time. So I will end there. Time. So I will end there. Thank you to the students through the work, my support in the lab, and to funders. So thanks very much. Thank you, Brian. We actually do have three more minutes for questions. So Tony has one question here on board. Do your models and experiments account for the increased fitness given by antibiotic resistant genes? Antibiotic-resistant genes? So they can and they will. So at this point, the system, there's no impact of the infection. It's just we're just tracking the infection by the fluorescence marker. And so we have accounted for the fact that that additional plasmid could lead to a change in the growth rate. But the next step would be to put in a resistance, some mechanism that'll knock out a resistance, and then that can also. And then that can all be tracked in the model as well. So that's yeah, so that's work to be done. So do we have other questions? Please just unmute yourself and speak up. So okay. um okay uh we have one more question uh lindy saying which physical processes were needed to fit the data after model selection oh same as next question uh nick had a question earlier okay i i guess i don't need to i jump to lindy first now okay yeah um so i have to thank lindy she's been um she and i have been talking about this project quite a bit of This project, quite a bit recently. So, yeah, so what we ended up including, so let's see, was basically the growth curve. So lag and transition stationary phase, which is this, there's this limiting nutrient, which is which is included. And then certain heterogeneity among the strains, but not all heterogeneity among the strains. And the complexity of the description of the Complexity of the description of the bacterial growth curve was not as, we didn't need to include all the complexity that people typically include. So, for instance, there's this Hill coefficient in how steeply the lag phase ends, and we didn't need to include that sort of thing. But it's basically a little bit of heterogeneity and the bacterial growth curve.
