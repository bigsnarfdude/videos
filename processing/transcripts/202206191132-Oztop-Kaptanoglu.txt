And he'll be talking to us on bilinear operator or sorry, bilinear multipliers in Orlips spaces on locally called backgrounds. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. I thank the organizer for giving me this opportunity, of course. In this talk, we consider the all spaces defined on locally compact abelian groups. We define a bilinear multiplier and investigated some properties of it. Investigated some properties of it. This is a joint work with my former PhD students, Alan Ossange Lo. So let me do a quick reminder, all this spaces. All this spaces is defined on a young function. A young function is a function, is a convex function taking positive real numbers to themselves such that zero to zero and infinity. To zero and infinity to infinity. Here is the definition, of course. And if we have the young function, we can define the complementary young function in this way. And the SPREMUM is taken over this X. So we will call Phi a Young function and for Psi for a complementary Young function. And this pair is called a complementary pair. We have the Young inequality, of course, in this way. The xy is less than or equal to phi of x plus psi of y for non-negative x and y. And after, if we have a young function, of course, we can define the origin space. Let G be a locally compact Aranian group with a thick. Compact Aralian group with a fixed harm measure ds say ds given a young function phi the early spaces alphi of g is defined this integral for this integral is well defined for some alpha positive from g to complex numbers if we have the orange space of course we can define the norm one of them orich norm the other luxembourg norm The other Luxembourg norm. Or each norm is defined this supremum. Here is the we use the complementary young function for defining the origin norm, but the Luxembourg norm is the infimum for the k positive number over the positive number k such that the integral is less than or equal to one. We will use, of course, sometimes original. Use, of course, sometimes Origin's norm and the Muxenbrook norm, but these two norms are equivalent with this inequality. So after that, we can give the some growth condition for a young function. Let me call delta 2 condition. If there exists k positive and x0 non-negative, such that phi of 2x is Of 2x is less than 2 or equal to k times phi of x for all x is greater or equal to x0. This is important for us, for our study. If why it's important, I will let me explain some quick reminder. If phi satisfies Delta 2 condition, then both the step functions and Both the step functions and completely compact supported continuous functions are dense in Oris spaces. And also we can define the dual of Auris spaces. We will denote the L P C of G here. Of course, the P C P psi is a complementary young function of phi, young function phi. On the other hand, if in addition, if psi complementary functions is also satisfied delta 2 condition, then the order space alpha of g is a reflexive Banach space. But we don't need all the time alpha of G is reflexive Banach spaces. Here there is, of course, a Holdarse inequality for all these spaces. For all these spaces, for all f is in L P of G and G is L P Psi of G, which means that P young function and P psi is complementary Young function. We have this equality inequality, of course. The F multiplication G, the norm of L1 is less than or equal to minimum the and the norm of And the norm of F and the G P Psi, and the F norm, the G P Psi. Here, this is the informum and this is the supremum norm. Let me give some example for Young function and the complementary Young function. Of course, it's a basic example. For example, for the P is between one and infinite. is between one and infinity or p is equal one. The young function pi of x is equal to x to the p over pi p. The space alpha of g becomes Lebesgue space L P of G. So we can say that for all this space, this is a generalization or a kind of generalization of standard Lebesgue spaces. Of course the norm of phi is equivalent to the classical norm of equivalent to the classical norm of p norm. If we take p equal one, then the complementary young function pi of x is equal to x. So the complementary young function p psi is y is between 0 and 1. Of course, it can be equal to 0 and 1 or otherwise infinity. If p is between 1 and If p is between 1 and infinity, then the complementary young function, of course, the for pi of x x to q over p and the p psi y, let me say y, p C of y equal to y to the q over the q. Here, the 1 over pi p plus 1 over q is equal to 1, which means that the q is the conjugate of p. Of T. Of course, for the standard example, I will give some example also for the phi of Ksi, but it's just to understand for the spaces, this is a generalization, a kind of generalization of Lorex spaces. For the bilinear multiple bilinear multiplier, this is our motivation, is the pair of functions. is the pair of functions f of g and g defined on real numbers to complex numbers such that the Fourier transform and f and g are compactly supported and for any locally integrable function let's say m defined on r cross r one can consider the mapping this integral this integral is of course the r cross r Of course, the R cross are double integral. So the question is to ask about its boundance on certain function spaces. This is our motivation to study for bilinear multipliers. For these bilinear multipliers, this kind of bilinear multipliers, Oscar Lasco in 2009 gave 2009 gave a definition. Let P1 and P2 are between 1 and infinity. Of course, they can be equal 1 and infinity. And P3 between 0 and infinity. And let the locally integrable function M defined on R cross R. The function M is safe to be dwindling R multiplier. With dwelling air multiplier of type P1, P2, P3. If there exists a positive number C such that this inequality satisfies for any F and G are in Schwarz space or Schwarz class on R. Here, this definition always giving on R, realm. Given on R, real numbers. This is, of course, which means that if B of B M extends to a bounded binary operator from L P1 cross L P2 on R to L P3 on R. Here is the M for M. We will of course say Course, say a symbol for M. Sometimes it's one can call bilinear multiplier with symbol m. After the definition, of course, we can give the space of bilinear multipliers of type q1, q2, q3. We will denote the b m p1 q2 q3. For this space, we can define. For this space, we can define the norm in this way by using his balanar operator norm. On the other hand, we can define the, we will denote by m tilde, t1, q2, p3 on r, the space of measurable functions, let's say m, from r to c complex number, such that the m is a bilinear multiplier. This is the difference of Is the difference of psi and the eta eta if this function belongs to a bilinear multiplier of type p1, p2, p3 on of course, which means that this integral, double integral, Fourier transform of f and g and the m functions, of course, this is the character, the extends to a bounded polynomial map from L P1. From LP1 plus LP2 to LP3. Here also we keep the notation, of course, this bilinear operator norm. After this definition, Oscar Blasko has produced a method to get multipliers, binary multipliers, which means that this space. This space here, and Bm, let's say Bm, from those in M tilde P1, P2, P3, which means that is integral. Why define it is integral. And he investigated some properties of these multiplier spaces. Of course, binaries multipliers acting on other groups, such as the Taurus or Such as the torus or the integer Z in place of R, real numbers, have also been studied. But more recently, several results on binarial multipliers acting on order spaces have been obtained by Oscar Blasco and Alain Ossange-Lowell, 2019. For the they extend the bilinear multipliers on all these spaces. This is the first study for study for all spaces for the on the binary multipliers let me remind the their study let phi1 phi2 and phi3 be young functions and let alphi1 alphi2 and alphi3 be the corresponding order spaces a locally integrable function n defined on r cross r is said to be a bilinear multiplier of type here phi1 phi2 Like here, phi1, phi2, phi3, instead of using p1, p2, p3, if there exists a positive number, let's say c, such that this integral satisfies this integral satisfies this inequality, which means that for any f and g are in Schwarz space. They investigated some properties of this space. Some properties of the space, of course. The similar results hold also on Rn Euclidean spaces. Here, the theory of bilinear multipliers, the Schwarz space is important, play an important role. So, in our study, our goal is to use general locally compact available groups instead of Groups instead of special groups like us, which means that we want to extend this study on locally compact abelian group and use all the spaces, of course, alpha of G on locally compact abelian groups. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, the Schumacher space SR play an important role for binary multiplication. Important role for bilinear multipliers. Here we want to replace the Schwartz space by the Python algebra, let's say C0 of G. And also, our goal is to give some sufficient conditions to define a bilinear multiplier on our space. Of course, this will be the first study on locally compact aberrant group for bilinear multipliers. Here we have some technical notes on locally compact abelian groups. Of course, all of you know very well the locally compact abelian group structure for the, for example, for the characters. For the character, of course, we have this homeomorphism from G to toros. It's called the character of G, the set of the G hats of all continuous characters. Hat of all continuous characters of G is called the dual group of G. And we know that G hat or dual group of G is an abelian group under pointwise multiplication of functions. Under the compact open topology, G hat is a topologic group. Of course, G hat also becomes a locally compact abelian group. After these quick reminders, we know that for, of course, the Fourier transform, The Fourier transform by this definition. So if we have f is in L1, Fourier transform of F is in L1 G hat, the function f can be recalled from Fourier transform of F by the inverse Fourier transform. This is important tool for us. If we have F If we have f and f and f hat are in L1G and L1G hat, we have recover of F, which means that this by using the inverse Fourier transform. For the Fourier transform, we need the following operators, which means that translation by Y is in G we will denote by this way and the modulation. By this way, and the modulation by W is in G hat by this way. Here is the character multiplied by F of X. On the other hand, all of these operators are well-defined, linear, and bounded operators on all spaces. This is an advantage for us, for our study on violence. Our study on biological multipliers. For fighting your algebra, of course, I want to say something about fighting air algebra. We call the properties of fighting air remarkable segregal algebra, really remarkable segal algebra, we can say, we will denote by S0G. Translation invariant tense sub-algebra of L1G under correlation, which Convolation, which of course it is continuously embedded into L1G. The properties of Feitinger algebra S0G is the smallest segal algebra in L1G and the smallest invariant, character invariant segal algebra, of course, S0G. Here, S is denoted by S denotes segal algebra. Denotes single algebra, zero is using by minimality of single algebra. On the other hand, Fourier transform induces an isomorphism for the Feitinger algebra and the smallest steal algebra in the Fourier algebra, of course, which is translation invariant isometrically. And also, Python algebra is dense in Lovex spaces. Lovex spaces, let's say L P of G. The Feitinger algebra is an important tool for our study. We will use Feitinger algebra instead of Schwartz space. The Feitinger algebra satisfies the properties of Schwartz spaces. So we are ready to the bilinear multiply. The multipliers to extend the ORIS spaces on located compact group. Of course, we need the Peitinger algebra in ORIS spaces. How can threats in ORI spaces Fightinger algebra? Can we have the same structure for Feitinger algebra such as the School space structures? Let's Gia locally compact abelian group. Locally compact abelian group for lambda k of G, we will denote F is in L be in L1 G such that the Fourier transform of F, the support of Fourier transform of F is compact. And we know that from the book of writers, lambda k of G is dense subspace of L1G. Here there is a There is an inclusion and the C0G is the smallest segment algebra, and L1G intersection Lphi of G is also segal algebra, invariant segregal algebra. So the minimal t gives us this inclusion. By using this inclusion, we have the following results. If phi satisfies delta 2 condition, Satisfies delta 2 condition, lambda k of g is a dense subspace of order spaces. This is really crucial and important for us. And if we have the lambda k, the density of lambda k of g in all spaces, we can get this theorem. S zero g is a dense subspace of alpha of g all this space, which means that the segregation the free The segular algebra, the free Feitinger algebra is a dense subspace of all spaces. By using this fact, we can, of course, produce the properties of bilinear multitasks on alpha of G. How? For giving our definition, for pre-year functions, let's say phi i, the function m is in l infinity. m is infinity g hat cross g hat is said to be a binarial multiplier of type phi 1, phi 2, phi 3 if there exists a constant c positive c such that this integral or this map satisfies this inequality. Here for any f and g are in Feitinger algebra. So So by using the advantage of fighting the algebra, we can define this integral. For the bilinear multipliers of type φ1, φ2, φ3, of course we will use this same symbol Bn and the norm is defined by the bilinear operator. On the other hand, On the other hand, similarly to the R case, we denote by M tilde the space of locally integrable function M defined on G hat such that this equality is in Bm. We have to note that both spaces are invariant under translation and modulation, which means that Bm and M tilde are invariant under translation and modulation. Invariant under translation and modulation, we will use these basic properties. Here is our first results for while near multiplier. Let phi1, phi2 and phi3 be young functions such that this equality holds. This gives us the struct the multiplication structures of our space. Of all the spaces. If m equals the m hat, this is the, of course, Fourier transform of m, then m is in bilinear multiplier and the norm satisfies this inequality, which means that the the norm is uh less less than uh two norm m or equal to norm two times norm uh m. Two times norm m. Here is our first results of our theorem. Let phi pi or psi be a complementary pair of young functions if m equals m hat here, m g d d d d this is the p p side and eta equals to m hat m hat. equals to m hat p plus c plus eta here m is a mu is a regular regular boreal measure on g then m is in bi narrow multipliers here phi the type phi t psi and one and the norm of bilinear multipliers less than or equal to four times To four times the norm of boreal measures, or this is the norm of L1 norm. For our corollary, we can say for the LK spaces, if 1 over P plus 1 over Q equals 1, for of course, P and Q between 1 and infinity, and M is equal to this Fourier transform of. Fourier transform of measure on G, then M is bilinear multipliers type P, Q and 1. And of course, the norm satisfies this inequality. On the other hand, after this setting, we can get a new bilinear multipliers from a given one. Here is the theorem. Let phi i for i Phi i for i one, two, and three, the young functions. If phi is in L1 and M is a bilinear multiplier type phi1, phi2, phi3, then the convolution phi and m is in a bilinear multiplier space, and there is, of course, inequality for the norms. On the other hand, if phi phi is in L1 and Phi is in L1 and M is a bilinear multiplier, then the Fourier transform phi multiplies m is in Bm space, and this inequality holds. Here, if we get bilinear multipliers, m equals this This definition, this case, if we think this case, we can get this theorem for the phi1, phi2, and phi3 are young functions such that this equality false. This equality gives us the convolution structure on or spaces. If m is in l1 g hat, then m is in m tilde by normal stars. Of course, the the under some course, under some special conditions. We have this also, we have this inequality for the norm. As a corollary of our theorem, we will say for a complementary pair of Young functions, if M is an L1 G hat, then M is an M tilde, and we have this inequality, which means that Which means that the Weilinar multiplier type phi, P ψ and infinity. If we think the Lodex space structure instead of Euler space, we can get for P Q R is in between 1 and infinity such that 1 over P plus 1 over 2 minus 1 over R equals 1. If M is in L1. If M is in L1G hat, then M is in M tilde and the norm satisfies this inequality. For example, if we take phi of X, X ln minus 1 plus X, then we get the psi X cosine suparable with X minus 1. We can give these examples, of course. Here for two. Here, for two young functions, let's say psi and psi two, we use this notation if there is this inequality. So we can produce all the several or various function spaces for order spaces, or we can call or spaces or special order spaces. Or special or spaces. Eud spaces is not just a generalization of Lebesgue spaces. Here we can produce special function spaces. Of course, our theory is satisfying holds for these functions or pair of functions. I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your attention, but I will give some our references here. Our references here: the Oscar Blasco and the, of course, the Blasco and Ossange Lool, the North Zone bilinear multipliers on all spaces. Recently, they get some really nice results. And of course, the remarkable White and Yard's paper on an insigal algebra and the Jap Kobson's papers. Papers. I stop here. Okay, thank you very much again. Thank you. Are there any questions for Surat from the audience? In-person audience? Might have one go. Hi, Sarat. Hi. Hi, Nicole. I'm very well, thank you. How are you? Fine, thank you very much. Now, as you know, of course, I'm an enormous fan of music and fighting for algebra. Use it in Feichinger algebra. And you know, we have the, like, and you're using this sort of as a generalization of Schwartz space, right? And we know that, like, I guess Guntke showed us that Schwartz space lives in, you know, sort of vector space Weitinger. There's also that I've learned at the meeting in Taiwan some years ago, there's notions of Schwartzpace for certain totally disconnected abelian groups. Abelian groups. Is there a Bukenka result there to be sticked nicely in Feiftinger? Are you aware of any of this? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't know. But I look at it. I look. Yeah, it's a bit of an orthogonal question to your talk. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions from people in person? Not then. Any questions from people along Zoom? Questions from people along too. All right, so let's thank Sirap once again. Okay, thank you very much. By the way, one remark for Nico. Nico, your really remarkable results for non-avalian case. Also, it can be say something about bilinear multipliers by using your results. Because Because you also showed that the fighting are segal algebra by using operator space structure, this is the minimal Segal algebra, right? Yeah, yeah. So if we use your remarkable Segal algebra in non-computative case, of course, it can be nice results on bilinear multipliers, non-computative case. This will be the first study and the The first study and the direction will change definitely. Excellent. Okay, thank you very much again. Okay. So this was the final, let's thank Sir Applet. Thank you. So this was the final talk of the conference. Let's give a round of applause for Folker, Keith, and Ryan Bohr. It's a very nice conference.

Thank you for coming to this meeting or attending it via Zoom, even at impossible hours of the day. And so, as you know, this is an installment of a series of conferences, which usually happens every Which usually happens every year. We have not yet settled on any venue for 2023, but we are confident that this will come to pass. And well, and it's very great to see how many Junior people are involved in the subject. So, hope to see you in one year, at another time, another place. In our place. Thank you all. Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you to everybody for participating. This is such a good group of people, and particularly for your warm reception of our younger faculty members. And thanks again, Folker, for all the work that you did in making this possible.
