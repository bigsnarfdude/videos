And also some work in progress with PhD student Araceli Solero Fitial from the University of the Basque Country. So the aim of today's talk will be basically to tell you how we can use a non-commutative space-time structure to build extended theories of gravity and how this can help us make a connection with biometric gravity theories. Gravity theories. So, this is the outline of my talk. First, I will start briefly with some physical motivation for our work, and then I will review the mathematical setup that we will use to build our model, which basically consists of two main ingredients. One is that of twist differential geometry, and the second ingredient is the tether form management for the first order formulation of general relativity. Then I will review. Then I will review the formulation of the non-commutative gravity model formulated first by Aschieri Castellani and discuss the extensions that we explored in our work. Next, and this will be the main focus of this talk, will be to discuss the connections of the non-commutative gravity model thus obtained with biometric gravity theories, and in particular to compare it with the Hassan-Rosen model for bi-gravity. For by gravity. And then I will discuss some applications. In particular, I will comment on the role of self-dual variables in simplifying the dynamics of the full non-commutative theory. And I will also see some applications to cosmological models. And in the final part, we will discuss some directions for future developments. So let's come to the motivation. So we know that general relativity predicts its own That general relativity predicts its own background, its own breakdown as a consequence of the singularity theorems that occur generically in space-time. And also, as a consequence of the perturbative normalizability of GR, the theory is bound to fail at small distance scales when we combine it with quantum mechanics. And the issue with the space-time singularities becomes particularly dramatic in the cosmology of. Particularly dramatic in the cosmology of the very early universe, and also in determining the ultimate fate of gravitational, the end of the end point of gravitational collapse and the ultimate fate of black holes. So the hope, of course, is that singularities can be resolved in a theory of quantum gravity. And for that, in particular, for the applications to black holes, I refer you to previous talks by Professors Lewandowski and Wilson Ewing. And of course, unfortunately. And of course, unfortunately, at the moment, we do not have an ultimate theory of quantum gravity, or at least not yet. So, the idea that I want to explore in this talk is to use a non-commutative space-time structure to incorporate, at least at an effective level, some possible modifications that we expect from quantum gravity. And in particular, this will be implemented by twisting the differential geometry of the space-time. So, and the idea of introducing a non-commutative space-time. The idea of introducing a non-commutative space-time structure is linked to the impossibility of locating events, space-time events, with an spatial accuracy that is smaller than Planckian. So we have seen that there are problems on small scales. Let me comment briefly also on the issues that we encounter on large scales, particularly cosmological scales. So, the Lambda-CDM cosmological model that is based on JAR works by posing Works by postulating two extra components that contribute to the energy budget of the universe, and these go under the names of dark energy and dark matter. However, the physical nature of these extra components is still unknown today. And nonetheless, we really need the NARAC sector in order to have a good agreement between the theory and cosmological observations on a huge range of different scales. Different scales. However, besides this theoretical problem in identifying the nature of the dark sector, sorry, there are also problems in combining observations from late and early universe that led to cosmological tensions. The most important, well, the most well-known of this perhaps is the so-called Hubble tension. So, a possibility that has been explored is to consider modification. Explored is to consider modifications of general relativity as offering a possible alternative explanation for the dark sector. And in some cases, they have been proposed as possibilities to address or at least alleviate the cosmological tensions. However, many such modified gravity theories often do not have a solid motivation that's coming from fundamental physics. So the idea here is to use non-commutative geometry. Use non-commutative geometry as a way to obtain modifications of JAR that are compatible with a deformed space-time structure. And the nice thing about it is that this framework is quite rigid in a way. So this leads to some only certain theories can fit in within this framework. And the nice thing. The nice thing about this framework is that it leads to modified behavior on gravity, not just on small scales, where we expect Planck and effects to be relevant, but also on large scales as a result of the extra fields that will be introduced with this approach. So let us briefly review the formulation of non-committed, well, the so to say, the toolbox of tools of non-commutative geometry that will be used to build these theories. Used to build these theories. So, we want to look for a geometric structure that generalizes the idea of coordinates, non-commutativity, that is basically encoding the idea that we have a minimum accuracy for the localization of space-time events represented here by this theta here. So, we want to work in the framework of twist differential geometry as a way to extend this idea also in the setting of curved space. This idea also in the setting of curved space-times. And this allows us to build action functionals by deforming existing commutative theories. And there's been extensive work in this field. So we want to consider in particular twist deformations of the abelian type. So these are generalization of the standard Moyal star product. The twister is represented by this object S that belongs to the tensor product of U psi. belongs to the tensor product of USI with itself. Uxi is the universal enveloping algebra, the algebra of smooth tensor fields psi on a Manfold M. And in particular, we will consider an Abel and Driftfeld twist that is represented in this way. So here, theta alpha beta is a constant matrix, and the set of vector fields x alpha is chosen to be, well, these vector fields are chosen to be commuting with each other. In this sense, the twist is abelian. This sense the twist is a billion. So, and we want to see what is the deformation that this twist induces on the exterior algebra differential form. Essentially, as shown in the work by Astieri, Castellani, Maria Dimitievich, Lizzi, Vitaleves, and many others, the twist defines a deformed wedge product, so to say, the wedge can be replaced by the wedge star that obeys the following properties. So, first of all, it is associative, then it satisfies a graded cyclicity property. Cyclicity property and also, well, it obeys a relation of compatibility with exterior derivative, so the generalization of the Leibniz rule. So these properties are very important in order to build action functionals and derive the field equations from it. From a pragmatic point of view, if we want, we can also define the deformed wedge product in terms of its asymptotic expansion. terms of its asymptotic expansion for small theta. And of course the higher order terms become more and more relevant the higher are, well, the larger the value of the derivatives of the fields psi and eta on small scales, where the smallness is determined by the value of the entries of theta. Next, let us review the first order Tetrard formulation of general relativity. So we know that in the second order So we know that in the second or well, the usual second order formulation of general relativity has as its basic dynamical variable the metric tensor G Mu Nu. Here in the first order formalism, the basic dynamical variables are the tetrad and the spin connection, E and omega. And the tetrad is, so to say, the square root of the metric in a way. And it also has the spin connection is subject to this compatibility condition with the tetrad. And to it, it can be associated this field strength, as usual. And the action for well, the Palatini action corresponds to the first term here. And the term highlighted here in red is the so-called Holtz term. Now, in the absence of torsion, this does not contribute to the equations of motion because it's just a total divergence as a consequence of the existence of the Nier-Yan. Consequence of the existence of the Nier-Yan invariant that is represented here. And this, as far as the classical theory is concerned, of course, there are important differences in the quantum theory. In fact, the Holsterm is well known to play an important role in the context of quantum gravity, for example. Now, the coupling represented here by beta is known as the Barbero-Mirzi parameter. And when it takes the special values equals to minus or plus the equals to minus or plus the imaginary unit, the action is anti-self dual, self-dual or respectively anti-self dual, which means that the other dual component is projected out. Now, it is possible to rewrite the action in a more compact form by contracting the spin connection with the generators of the Lorentz algebra. In particular, we consider the Dirac Vispin representation of the Lorentz. This spin of representation of the Lorentz group is generated by the gamma ij, which are proportional to the commutator, the commutators of the Dirac gamma matrices. And we do something similar also for the tetrad. We contract the internal index of the tetrad with the Dirac gamma matrices to build an index-free object. I'm omitting here the space-time indices. Of course, the tetrad is of one form. And the action, including the Holstern, can be Including the Holst term, can be written in this way in index-free form, where the asterisk here denotes the internal Hodge dual in the Tetrad basis, and which in this representation just amounts to the charality operator gamma 5, essentially. Now, this action has the usual gauge symmetries of, well, the Palatini formulation. So it is different variant. It is invariant under gauge transformation, a local Lorentz gauge transformation. Local Lorentz gauge transformations. It also has some duality symmetries. In particular, the action is invariant under the mapping of omega into, well, it's dual in the internal space and provided that beta goes into minus one over beta. So far, this is just a reformulation of standard GR. So there is nothing new at this stage. Let's come to the combination of these two ingredients now and consider a twist deformation of classical GR, as was first studied. Classical jar, as was first studied in the work by Asquier and Castellani. So, first of all, let's focus on the kinematics. So, when the space-time structure is twist-deformed, we also need to modify the gauge transformations accordingly. In particular, well, in the standard commutative theory, an infinitesimal gauge transformation of the territor would map the tetrahed into, well, itself plus a contribution that is proportional to the commutator. That is proportional to the commutator of E with an infinitesimal case transformation represented here by epsilon. Now, in the non-commutative setting, we need to replace the commutator by the star commutator. So instead of having E times epsilon minus epsilon times E, we have to represent to replace the product with the star product. So, but when we compute the star commutation, But when we compute the star commutator, we can expand it in this way. So, as a consequence of the non-commutativity of the star product, we also have this extra term that involves the anti-commutators of gamma, the Dirac gamma matrices with the generators of the Lorentz algebra. So, and because the anti-commutator also involves gamma, well, it actually involves gamma, gamma five, there is a new axial term that is generated. Axial term that is generated for theta different from zero by means of an infinitesimal k transformation. So it means that we're not enough just to consider one tetrad, we actually need two tetrads, so we need to promote this, the original tetrad object to a so-called bi-tetrad. So we have two independent tetrads represented by E and E tilde here. And the two components mix and rotate under this deformed gauge. Rotate under these deformed gauge transformations. And because we have two tetrads, of course, we can construct two independent metrics from it. So we see that the twist deformation of tetrad GR naturally leads to a bimetric theory of gravity. And this just follows from the combination of the twist deformation and the insistence on gauge invariance. We have not prescribed any dynamics yet. So, and in particular for the formulation. The formulation for the different formulations of the Assan-Rossen by gravity theory. Refer you to the talks by Fawada-san and Daniel Blicks later. So we can do something similar when we discuss the role of infinitesimal gauge transformations. And in fact, also here, when we take the star commutator of two infinitesimal gauge transformations represented here by epsilon one and epsilon two, we see once On two, we see once again that we can expand this guy here in terms of commutator and anti-commutator. But because the anti-commutators of the algebraic generators gamma i, j also involve the identity matrix and gamma 5, we need to consider a central extension of the Lorentz group from SO31 to GL2C. So we have two extra generators of U1 subgroups. So an infinitesimal GL2C. Infinitesimal GL2C transformation will look like this. So let us review the kinematics that we have so far. We found out that we need to promote the tetrad from sorry, we need to promote the object E from a tetra to a bi-tetrad between dependent components E and D tilde. We also need to extend the gauge symmetry from Lorentz to GL to C. So we have these extra components in the spin connection. And the In the spin connection, and the field strength is defined as usual, only with omega given here. And formally, the behavior of the fields under infinitesimal gauge transformations looks like the usual transformation rules, except that the commutators are replaced by star commutators. Now, let's come to the dynamics. So, if we focus just So if we focus just on the first term, this was first formulated in this paper by Askira and Castellani, and we consider the extension to the extension of this by including the Holst term. There are further terms that we can introduce to the action besides this kinetic term that will be discussed later on in a couple of slides time. So essentially, this is obtained by replacing the wedge product with a wedge star product in the first order jar action and promoting First-order GR action and promoting the tetrad and the spin connection as shown above in the top of the part of the slide. And this has, besides the usual diffeomorphism symmetry, now we also have the GL2C gauge symmetry and we have star diffeomorphisms that follow from the combination of diffeomorphisms with the star product. We also have some dualities, particularly Hodge duality, and that was discussed before. Was discussed before, and another duality that follows from the interchange of E with A tilde, because they're completely symmetric in the way they appear in the action. Now, an important comment is in order. Unlike general relativity, in this theory, there is no background independence, at least in the way it has been formulated. And this is due to the fact that we have introduced some non-dynamical vector fields in the definition of the twist denoted by x alpha. This case. Alpha. This can be cured if one wants to by promoting the X alpha to dynamical quantities by introducing a set of scalar fields, as done in this paper. So what is new in our approach? So previous approach is mostly focused on mapping the non-commutative theory to a commutative one by using the cyberbitter map. And the result is a higher-order theory that contains Theory which contains high derivative interactions, and the first non-commutative corrections, therefore, arise the order theta squared. Now, in our approach, we propose to keep all the extra degrees of freedom that come from non-commutative geometry, since they may play an important role on large scales. Now, I want to comment on the fact that there are two distinct kinds of modifications to JAR that arise in this model. One is One is the obvious one that corresponds to derivative interactions that can be seen to arise from the expansion in the limit of small theta of the wet star product. But these are theta suppressed and only kick in at the Planck scale. So this is a regime that is obviously harder to probe. There is hope, though, to have some deviations from general relativity also on a larger scale. Also, on larger scales. In fact, we have some extra fields represented by the extra components in the bi-tetra and the spin connection, and they play an important role on cosmological scales. And this is where we have the best chances to test the model. Now, let me comment on the connection between non-commutative geometry and by gravity. More specifically. So far, we have only discussed the kinetic term of this theory. term of this theory. But given the way given that the dynamical fields now are both E and E tilde, it is natural to consider some interactions among them. And the simplest interactions that we can consider are polynomial in the biotetron field. And they take this form. Now, what is interesting is that when we take is interesting is that when we take the commutative limit as theta goes to zero of these interaction terms, only the first and the last term represented here survive. Now, the first term in particular has an interesting structure because it's a particular case of the interaction terms that we have in the Hassan-Rosen by gravity theory. And I will comment a little bit more on that later. So let's analyze the commutative link. Let's analyze the commutative limit in a little bit more detail. So, first of all, we notice that the extra components of the spin connection only appear in this particular combination, omega and omega tilde, they only appear in this combination. So we can introduce this quantity A and rewrite the full action in this form. So this is the kinetic term. Oops. So this all comes from the expansion of the kinetic term. So, this all comes from the expansion of the kinetic term, the first line here, whereas this is what survives from the interaction terms in the commutative limit. This matrix, sorry, this tensor within this is in the internal space, IJKL, is what follows from the Palatini plus the Holsterm. So we see that there are essentially three different types. Three different types of interaction terms besides the kinetic term. So the kinetic term kind of follows the structure of the usual Palatini plus host gravity, except that instead of just having EI wedge EJ, we also have the same, but for E tilde. So the term is in blue, as I mentioned at the In blue, as I mentioned, have the same structure of interactions that we expect from ghost-free biometric gravity, and in particular, they follow the same pattern that is obtained in the mass in the, well, in the partially massless candidate that was proposed by Assange, Schmidt, May, and Wonstrauss. The remaining terms are interactions of a new kind. Let me comment a little bit more on that in a second. So, the term in red in particular represents a constraint that is enforced by the Lagrange multiplier A. So, when we've Lagrange multiplier A. So when we vary the action with respect to A, what we get is that the differential of the E by G tilde must be equal to zero. And this implies that E by G tilde must be equal to the differential of an, sorry, must be the differential of an of a one one form. So in by gravity, the symmetricity condition E by G tilde equal to zero is required in order to ensure the existence of the square root matrix. The existence of the square root matrix represented here, and this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence between the metric and the Tetra formulation of the theory. Although this constraint must be usually imposed by hand. So whereas in our case, it's just a particular solution of this constraint. Although in general, the theory is purely tetra that does not necessarily admit a metric formulation. Whereas the term in green here The term in green here, in the second line, is a new kind of interaction that only contributes when the, well, E by G tilde is non-zero. Let us make a closer comparison with the Hassan-Rossen by gravity theory, whose action is represented here. So, in this theory, we see that we have, well, when we compare the two theories, when we notice that there are Theories: when we notice that there are quite a few differences. First of all, in our theory, there is only one spin connection, although there are two tetrads, whereas in standard by gravity, there are also two independent connections. So this is the first difference. And in ordinary by gravity, there is no constraint on EYG tilde, as I was commenting, that comes from the action, must be imposed by... From the action, must be imposed by hand. And in our case, there are also extra interactions when E by G tilde is non-trivial. And this has no metric analog. There is also another difference that comes from the introduction of the Holtz term in the kinetic term, and this becomes important in the presence of torsion sources. Now, for a different approach that connects non-commutative geometry, in particular the spectral triple approach, to bi-gravity theories. Triple approach to bi-gravity theories, refer you to the talk by Arkadyz, Bognet. Also, a similar model to ours with two tetrahers, but just one spin connection, as we proposed independently by Alexandrov and Speziale. And it looks like this. So the kinetic term is pretty similar, except for the Holst term is pretty similar to our model. But in the second model, there is no constraint. Is no constraint on e by g tilde, and the interactions involve five free parameters, whereas in our case, we just have two free parameters. And let me stress this point actually. The fact that there are only two parameters, three parameters here comes from the fact that we are quite constrained in the type of interactions that we can build that are compatible with the non-commutative structure. So, okay. Ah, let me comment also on this. There are also some similar non-standard kinetic terms that have been considered previously in work by Deran, Matas and Toli. And in particular, it has been observed that kinetic terms of this type with only one spin connection usually represent an obstruction to the formulation of the theory in the metric form. Of the theory in the metric formalism. So let us come to consider some applications. First of all, let us explore the role of self-dual variables in the pure gravity theory and without including the interaction terms for now. Let us consider the fully non-commutative case where theta is non-zero and let us decompose the field strength first and let First, and let us notice that this involves a bunch of extra components that are usually that are not there in the commutative limit. So in particular, the first and second terms here are just straightforward generalizations of what we may expect from the community theory. But the terms represented here by the third and fourth bracket vanish when theta goes. Vanish when theta goes to zero. So they purely arise as a result of the non-commutativity. And we see that these components all mix in the fully non-commutative regime. So what is the advantage then of having the host term here? Well, by choosing specific values of the Barbero-Mierzi parameter, we can project out either the self-determination of the term. Either the self-dual or anti-self-dual component of the spin connection in order to achieve some simplifications. And in particular, this will also simplify the structure of the components Fij, R, and R tilde that we written here. And the self-duality condition is represented in a rotation by, well, it's basically an eigenvalue equation for the gamma-5 operator. So, when we look at a self-dual connection, the expression of the field strength are much simpler. And we can also define auxiliary fields U and V in this way. And it turns out that we can write down the self by expanding all quantities in the action, we can write down the self-dual action in the fully non-commutative regime for the non-interacting theory in this way. In this way. And in particular, this guy in bracket here can be interpreted as the field strength of a connection with no metricity. Next, we can write down the equations of motion. Let us define some auxiliary quantities, u and b, represented by the sum and difference of the two tetrads, and also there by b and k, we take the We take the anti-symmetric and symmetric components of UV. The bitetric equation is, well, the generalization of the constraint that we saw before, remember Eyg tilde, differential of Eyg tilde equal to zero, in the fully non-commutative regime takes this form. We also have a We also have a generalization, this generalization of the connection equation and the field equations that are obtained by varying the action with respect to u and v. So, note that there are several simplifications that arise when theta is equal to zero, but the fully non-commutative regime is quite a bit more complicated. And in our paper, we expanded the field equations in the limit of small theta, in particular in the case of conformally related tetrads, showing that space-time non-commutativity can represent a total. Non-commutativity can represent a source of torsion. Next, let us look at cosmological applications of this model. Let us go back to this end to the general action in the theta to zero limit. So this is important when, well, this is the relevant regime to consider when we want to study the dynamics on large scales because the Because the non-commutative expects only kick in on Planckian length are expected to. So this is what the action looks like, as recall. And the metric answers that we want to reproduce are basically given here. So we take the two metrics to be fully homogeneous and isotropic. So the degrees of And isotropic. So the degrees of freedom are represented by the scale factors A and B, and there is a relative lapse represented by C. Eta is conformal time. And the tetrads that reproduce this matrix can be written here. The matrix lambda j is time-dependent and is an element of the Lorentz group. Now, let us look at the consequences of these dynamics with this. Dynamics with these handsats. And we notice that even in this cosmological, in this simple cosmological case, the constraint equation that the differential of E y g tilde equal to zero has some non-trivial consequences. And let us look at some examples. In the particular case where lambda j is a time-dependent rotation matrix, say, for example, around one of the coordinate axes with angle psi eta, we have that this amounts to this condition. That this amounts to this condition. So essentially, the product of A, B, and the sine of this angle ψ needs to be a constant. And this is a constraint that is not there, for example, in the theories that we have compared with before, Japan-Ross and by gravity in this. It follows purely from this extra term here in red. Whereas for boosted tetrads, the constraint is automatically satisfied. The constraint is automatically satisfied. Now, let us look at what happens to the connection. And let us take, therefore, a simpler answer, just for simplicity. So we take, therefore, the tetrads to be pointing along the same directions, only the zeroth component of the tilde tetrad will have, well, Have a relative lapse represented by C. And we also make a cosmological answer for the spin connection. So there is only one independent entry. This is represented by the small H guy here. And the solution of the connection equation in this case gives that this is well, the H guy involves a combination of A and B. So both. A and B. So both metrics enter into play in determining the spin connection as expected. And this is true because, as we have seen in the action, unlike Hassan-Rose and by gravity, here are two independent, there are two independent tetrahedrons, but only one spin connection. Probably Hassan-Rose, we have two. So currently, the analysis of the remaining field equations is work in progress, and we're also And we're also comparing the resulting dynamics with other similar models that we have commented on before. So let us briefly review our main results. So the takeaway message is that a non-commutative twist deformations of general relativity naturally lead to a larger gravitational sector and an enhanced symmetry represented by GL2C, which represents a central extension of the Lorentz group. And this is Rein's group. And this is nice because this approach is rigid in a certain sense. So not anything goes, but only certain interaction terms are allowed that are compatible both with the gauge invariance of the theory and the chosen non-commutative structure. And we have noticed that the model has a similar structure to bigravity, but there are also some important differences. And it is interesting that by choosing a self-dual connection, we can Connection, we can simplify the dynamics of the non-commutative theory, also in the full non-commutative regime. And there are also other features represented by the presence of extra degrees of freedom and interactions that may play a role on large scales. So the modifications from the deviations from GR are not expected just on Planckian length scales, but possibly also on cosmological scales. So, there are some other things I want to comment on. So, we have seen that biometric theories can be obtained in this framework, but actually it's interesting that also in other approaches to non-commutative geometry, such as that of spectral triples, so that is taken into account in the work of Andriy Sitters and Arkadyusz Pokniak, certain bigravity theories can be obtained. Gravity theories can be obtained. And it would be interesting to see if this is a general feature obtained in different approaches to non-commutative geometry. Now, some open questions that remain in our approach, we still need to investigate whether the theory is cost-free, similarly to what happens in Hassan-Rossen by gravity. And in particular, in this approach, given the chiral nature, so to say, of the formulation where we have two techniques. The formulation where we have two tetrads, one paired to gamma five to gamma i and the other paired to gamma i, gamma five, different chiral components of the ferments would are expected to couple to different tetrads. So, and this is our known source of instability in by gravity, and we want to explore whether this remain, this is also true in this setting. Now, an open question that, well, it would be nice to address Nice to address is whether it is possible to embed full asteroids and by gravity with two spin connections, not just one, in a non-commutative theory, but consider other possible non-computative structure, for example, or different symmetry groups. And that's pretty much all I wanted to tell you about. So I would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you, Marco. Any questions from people here? Yes. Hi, Marco. Do you hear me? Hi. Yeah. So, very interesting talk. So, one question I had was: how much of the GL2C actually survived at the end? So at the end, let's see. In the commutative limit, you mean? Say, okay, or even in the non-commutative case? Do you need to fix a part of that? Like, okay, what I'm thinking in the standard, like McDowell-Mansouri type of approaches, you can have a larger gauge group, but then you embed the Lorentz group in that and you kind of break the gauge symbol. You kind of break the gauge symmetry when you construct the model. Does something like that happen here or? So, extensions of the Bengtau-Mansuri action have been considered in this same paper that I was mentioning before by Paolo, Aschieri, and Castellani. But in this case, yeah, I'm not sure. So, let's see. I just want to give you the reference. So, in other words, when you construct the action, do you take the full GL2C curvature or a part of that? No, it's the full GL2C curvature. Yeah. So, yeah, it's given here. So, this is the full GL2C gauge connection, and we take the full curvature, yes. Okay, thanks. That answers my question. Thank you. No, thank you for the question. Fedele has a question. Fedele has a question. Yes, Chiao Marco. Ultimately, all these new terms depend on theta, which has two definite directions in space-time. So is it possible to have consequences of these extra terms in the cosmic microwave background or in anisotropy of the background of gravitational waves, which Gravitational waves, which now are not detected, but in some, or at least theoretically, where there are some consequences on this. Well, in principle, yes, this has been arguing several different approaches to quantum gravity that one can hope that quantum gravity effects here represented by theta, essentially, could be amplified in the early universe and then leave some imprint in the cosmic microwave background. So, the issue that I see here is that typically these effects are only relevant for small multiples. So, they might be hidden by cosmic variants. I don't know if that answered your questions. There is a question from Zoom. Yeah. Hello, Marco. Hello. So, I wonder. So, I wonder, we will probably discuss a lot later, but one thing I learned recently from Pawat is that this partial masslessness can be motivated from the possibility of having a renormalizable theory. Do you know if this action could be renormalizable or do you have any like no-go theory? No go theorem, but or something like that, that you know that it cannot be. So, the honest answer is: I don't know because we only looked at the classical theory. I don't know if in the literature these attempts to quantize this theory have been made, but this is, in a sense, not really the goal of this model. It's just to incorporate some quantum corrections in an effective way, in a sense. In an effective way, in a sense, okay, thank you. Any other question? Yes. Yeah. And your bi-metric one in your project, I'm not very familiar with this, so my question is relatively elementary. But I would have split the metric into the two chiral components. Into the two chiral components. And presumably, it's the mass that's giving. The tetra do you mean? Yeah, the tetra. It looks natural to split it into one plus and minus gamma fi, the two chiral components. The mixing from that between the two must be associated with some mass term. Can you point to me where does that enter in here? So, in a sense, when we studied, well, Well, the CEF dual case. What should I turn off to set the mass to be zero so that both of them are massless? Both metrics are massive. What do you mean by the mass of the metric? Well, if I have a left and right component in the Clifford algebra, the mixing is going to come from a mass-state term. Otherwise, the two chiral components don't interact. Components don't interact. If I made E tilde E equal to E tilde and put a minus sign between them, I would have a projector there. Yeah, so essentially, this is some, we did something similar in when we considered the self-dual. When we consider the self-dual case, so we take these combinations of E. So essentially, the action only depends on some particular combinations of E and E tilde are written here. But even in the self-dual case, well, you still have two independent objects with one index. So there isn't a way just to get rid of one of them. Well, in a way, yeah, you could redefine. Well, in a way, yeah, you could redefine E tilde and map it to I imaginary unit times E tilde, and then you would say U wedge star complex conjugate of U, but then you need to treat both of them independently when you vary the action. I don't know if I'm understanding your question correctly. Paolo, you're welcome. Okay, Paolo, want to say something? Just commenting on the question of Denji, maybe helps. I'm being thinking of a master that Denji is considering as arising out of normalization. Normalization. So, since there is not enough gauge symmetry to protect the massless of both gravitons, when you do a normalization, you expect one of them to break and to, therefore, have mass. So that's why I expect that what he's asking, the NG, will happen dynamically. Then dynamically. But the mass comes from the interaction terms, not from the kinetic terms. Yes, yes, it will come from interaction terms that you have to put there once you do the normalization. Okay. I can't hear. Okay, there was a discussion here, so I don't know if you want to sum I think this fact that once you do normalization Normalization, since there is only one gauge symmetry is slightly extended, but it's one gauge group, you expect one of the two gravitons to remain massless and the other is expected on general grounds to achieve masses because there's no gauge symmetry preserving it remaining massless. That's on very general ground. Very general ground. Okay, I see. So, yeah, the issue we're not yet sure about is precisely how many gravitons we have in this theory, because it's true in, well, in Asandros and by gravity, there are two gravitons, but here in this case, there is just one spin connection. So it is not clear. In fact, in this paper by Alexandro Veneziale, which has a similar structure for the kinetic term, well, actually, in the title, it is by gravity with one graviton. And they argue. With one graviton. And they argue that just because you have one single spin connection, you are essentially using one graviton instead of two to mediate the gravitational force. But it's not still clear where all the gravitational degrees of freedom show up. Because in this paper, for their model, which is slightly different from ours, so the counting proceeds slightly differently. So we're still working on that. So, we're still working on that in our case, but in their case, they actually compared the counting in some specific background for the linearized theory and for the full non-linear theory. And there are some degrees of freedom that not always show up. So, it really depends on the kind of backgrounds and the level of non-linearities that you go to, whether they show up or not. So, I'm not really sure whether I'm not really sure how many degrees of freedom are. Really, sure, how many degrees of freedom are there in general here? At least, not yet. But hopefully, we'll be able to tell you soon. Okay, so thanks, Marco, again, and we move to the next talk. Thank you for the discussion. Let me stop screen sharing by Daniel Blickstone, teleparallel gravity. On teleparallel gravity. So, are you ready to share your screen? Yes, I'm ready. Let me see. Okay, can everybody hear me well and see?
