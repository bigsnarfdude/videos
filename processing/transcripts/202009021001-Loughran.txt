Right now, because I thought it'd be really nice there at the end of August. But anyway, I'm definitely interested if there's a hope of this happening again next year. I'd love to come along. So, yeah, I'm going to talk about House Principle for Farm K3 services. This is joint work with Damien Kwitz, who's in Hanovan, a master here in Akahara. Masahe was my postdoc in Bath, but he recently moved to Washington, where Bianco also is. Okay, so. Okay, so I'm just going to start with some basics reminding you about what the Hasse principle is. They say that a smooth projective variety of a Q fails at the Hasse principle if there's an idyllic point. This is a set of idaic points on my variety. So the product of real points and your peric points all primes p, but if there's no rational point. And this talk is going to be completely concerned with the final explicit family. With the following explicit family of varieties. So, this is an example of a family of K3 surfaces in degree two. So, you don't need to know what a K3 surface is. I'm just saying that to see it's part of some bigger context. And if you look at this equation, okay, it's not homogeneous. So, how do you see this as a projective variety? Well, it's naturally embedded in some weighted space, you should view it as being in some weighted projective space, and this weighted projective space itself then embedded. To projective space itself then embeds in a projective space. And HACE principle, yeah, there's lots of open problems for HACE principle for K3 surfaces. First of all, I want to clarify the HACE principle here. This specific family is interesting because there are examples of members of the family which fail the HASA principle. This example was found by Patrick Korn and Masahiro Nakahara. And they do this by exhibiting a By exhibiting a Brown-Manning obstruction to the Hasse principle. And I'm going to recall through the Brown-Manning obstruction how it works. But before that, the big conjecture is that this Brown-Manning obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle on K3 surfaces. So namely, if the Hasse principle fails, then it must fail because there's a Brown-Manning obstruction. And I'm not going to say anything about this conjecture in the talk. I'm not going to assume it, but we're just going to be only interested in obstruction. Going to be only interested in obstructions to the HACE principle, which are due to brown money obstruction, and conjecturally, these should be all the obstructions to the HACE principle. We don't know that. I'm not assuming the conjecture. But yeah, that's the conjecture. So I'm going to give a one-slide crash course into the Brown-Manning abstraction. So it's defined in terms of the Brau group, so Brau group of variety X. It's the second et al. homology with coefficients in Gm. In GM. And yeah, this definition may be not terribly illustrative, but in general, you can write down the explicit elements. So elements are represented by central simple algebras over the function field of x. So for example, Cortonian algebras. And not every simple algebra, central simple algebra over the function field gives rise to Brau group element, and they have to be like unramified, it's called. Yeah, so there's finally many devices where. Finally, many devices where it could be undefined, and you need to check if it's defined or not at these finitely many devices. So, power class field theory gives an explicit description of the Brauel group of Q. So, it sits in this exact sequence. And the important maps are these local invariant maps. So, you have one for each place of Q. So, place is either the real numbers over a prime p, and the local invariant maps from the Brau group of Qv. The Brau group of Qv onto Q mod Z. And for QP, so p-iadic number, the local convariants and isomorphism with Q mod Z. For the real numbers, it embeds it as Z mod 2. Yeah, so if the Brau group of the real numbers is Z mod 2 Z. And this exact sequence says, yeah, if you take the sum of all local invariants and if you equal to zero, then you must come from an element to the Bragg group of Q. This is an important part of the exactness we'll use. We'll use. So you associate will stay this Brown-Manning set, which is originally defined by Manning. So if you take an idyllic point and a Brau group element alpha, you can evaluate alpha at this idelic point. And you define the Brau Manning set to be those idyllic points such that when I evaluate my Brau group element at it, and I take the local invariance and I take the sum of them all, I get zero. And we set this up this way because of this exact sequence here, which is if you happen to come from a rational point, so if your delic point was a rational point, then when I evaluate my Brauel group element to this rational point, I get an element of the Brauel group of Q. And we know from this exact sequence, if you come from an element of Brauel group of Q, the sum of all local invariants must be zero. This all means to be exact in the middle. So this gives you an intermediate subset between the rational point. Intermediate subset between the rational points and the idyllic points. And this is what you use to give a Brown-Manny obstruction. So you say there's a Brown-Manny obstruction to Hasse principle. This Brown-Manny set is empty, but the idyllic point is non-empty. So this means the Hasse principle failing, because if the Brown-Mannian set is empty, then the rational point must be empty. But the Hasse principle fails, and it's explained by Brownian-Manning obstruction. Okay. Okay, now I'm going to get back to the explicit family we're interested in in this talk. And the question we were interested in our paper is: how often do these surfaces have a brown manning obstruction? So that's the principle. So by how often, I mean we're going to count them. So we're going to order the coefficients AI and look at them in some box of with tied lengths t is going to be our parameter. And we're going to say, as you're looking over them and counting these surfaces. As you're looking over them and counting these services, how often is there brand money in production? So, part of the subtle point here is the brow group behaves quite erratically. So, but when I was preparing my talk, I didn't look at what all the possibilities for the brow group are. There were a lot. The idea is as soon as you start posing various conditions on the coefficients, you can make the brow group, yeah, make lots of different brow groups. So, as you clarify, yeah, for the brow mining obstruction, the important Yeah, for the Brown manual obstruction, the important thing you're interested in is the Brauel group modulo constants. So you look at the Brauel group of your variety of modulo, the constant algebras, because the constant algebras don't play a role in the Brown manual introduction. And I've said here, there's at least nine different possibilities for this. There's a lot more. I just wanted to make sure I said a true statement. And when I was preparing for my talk, those are the nine I found in our paper. Anyway, so if you want to see the Brown Manual obstruction. If you want to see the Brown manium construction, the first question is: well, when is the Brauel group even non-trivial? And this is our first theorem. So I'm looking at choices of coefficients going up to some parameter capital T for which the Brauel group is non-constant. And we get a precise asymptotic formula for this with some constant times t to the 5 over 2. So yeah, so bear in mind we've got three coefficients. So there's t cubed choices for the coefficients. So this says almost always. Coefficients. So this says almost always the Brauel group is constant. Yes, and not just almost always, and we've got explicit asymptotic formula, but almost always the Brauel group is constant. And how a proof works is we show that the most common way for the Brauel group to be non-constant is you need to have minus three times one of the coefficients is a square. So I'm not saying if the Brow group is non-constant, then minus three times a coefficient is a square. I'm not saying that. Three times the coefficient square. I'm not saying that, that's not true. But once you look at all the surfaces together and all the possible possibilities of the Brahou group, you see it's this family which dominates the count. And so in particular, what Skolbogotov's conjecture predicts is that almost all of these surfaces satisfy the Haas principle. So you should expect the Haas principle to hold almost always. And you might ask, okay. And you might ask, okay, what about local solubility? Well, there's a general method for doing these kinds of things via sivavecadal, which, yeah, basically a positive proportion of these services is everywhere locally soluble. So in some respects, you don't have to worry too much about local solubility. So that's a Brow group. Well, half into Brown Manning instruction, this is the next theorem. It says counting those surfaces, coefficients going to parameter. Coefficients going to parameter capital T, those which have a Brown manual construction task principle, we've got correct an order magnitude result. So it's t to the three over two divided by log t to the three eighths. And I will call this notation, it's from analytic number theory. It means the quantity on the left is bounded above and below by some constant multiples times the quantity on the right. And yeah, we've I was quite surprised to see it's log t to some fractional power there. I wasn't quite expecting that. I'll explain. Expecting that. I'll explain in the proof hopefully where we get this factor from. And notice this is t to the 3, 2. In the previous thing, we had t to the 5 over 2. So this means even when the brow groups are non-constant, a brown-manning instruction is still rare. Yes, even if you've got a non-constant Brow group, you shouldn't expect there to be a Brown Manning instruction that has a principle. And our main theorem gives a slightly more final result because it turns out there's two subfamilies which dominate. Two subfamilies which dominate. So I'm going to consider various cases here. So the first case is when the quotient of two coefficients is a cube. The second case, I've already mentioned, will play a role. It's when minus three times the coefficient is a square. And the last case, it just is the general case. I'm not in case one or two. And I'm going to look at the counting function for these. So I'm going to say counting those services with line case i, and this has a grand man instruction task principle and kind of our main theorem. Of our main theorem is order magnitude results for all of these. Well, okay, last case we get the bound. So, this first expression is the one I already had on the previous slide. So, this is the one which dominates the count, t to 3 over 2 over log of t to 3 over 8. The next expression is slightly smaller. Yeah, this is smaller than that one. So, really, this one is the ones dominating, but they're so close. You know, they've both got t to the over 2. They differ by. Both got t to 3 over 2. They differ by small power of log t and log log t. I mean, you're never going to tell the difference between these in a computer experiment if you start running it, you know, for example. I mean, they grow such a similar rate. And again, I think it's pretty cool. We've got this log log t factor here because I haven't seen like these kind of counting problems in arithmetic geometry. You don't normally get log log t's. You normally get log log t's in prime number theory. But I'll try and explain where this log log t factor comes from. And then the last case. One. And then the last case is some l that is saying the coefficients are general. Here it says that Brown Manning obstruction is really rare. So there's any hope of being Brown Manning obstruction. In this case, it happens for most t to the one plus epsilon choices of coefficients. This is for arbitrary epsilon. Yeah, I was going to start explaining a bit about the proofs of those theorems now. I don't know if there's any question about the results of voice star. Sorry, could I ask? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I just wanted to ask: I mean, are all of you, I guess what's quite striking to me is that you haven't mentioned the distinction between algebraic and geometric bar elements. So, somehow you only have to worry about the ones that are killed by passing too few bar for some reason? I'll explain this later. Don't worry, Adam. Oh, yes. We deal. Oh yes. We deal with this, don't worry. Yeah, yeah, we do this. Okay, cool. So I'll start talking about. So we basically, almost always, we deal with some explicit bra group elements. And I'll show you how to start writing them down and why these families are relevant. So this is our equation. So it's kind of a general philosophy. I don't think there's any precise theorems, but a general philosophy of how you write down Brau group elements. If you have an equation and it factorizes, An equation and it factorizes, then you can normally figure out a way of writing down a brow group element corresponding to this factorization. So, here, for example, if this radius shows a cube, so this shows up in one of the cases I considered, then you can factorize the right-hand side. It's more or less, it's more or less a cyclotomic, you know, it's quite close to being a cyclotomic polynomial, the kind of, you know, like x to the n minus one. And in fact, there's standard ways of factorizing these. And this is the factorization you get. These, and this is the factorization you get. And one just plays around and finds this Cortonian algebra work. So, this factor here is one of the factors which occurs when I factorize this. And this is a Cortonian algebra according to B1. And turns out, yeah, this is a well-defined element of the Brau group. And this was if A3 of A2 is a cube, but there's similar algebras B2 and B3 you can define if different ratios of coefficients are cubes. So do there any? So these are the elements we're interested in slightly more difficult, well, they're not quaternional algebra, so they're more difficult to understand. So this condition, if I have minus 3a1 as a square, then this means A1 becomes a square in the third cyclotomic field. And then again, I can factorize my equation. So this part here factorizes by competing square. And one uses the factorization, plays around, and you find this cyclic algebra or the. This cyclic algebra order 3. So, this notation is subscript 3. I don't think it's standard. So, to define this, you need to choose a primitive third root of unity. Anyway, it doesn't matter too much. But it's an algebra order three. It's not a quaternion algebra. But to define this algebra, I had to pass to the third cyclotomic field. But I want an algebra over Q. So what you do is you apply the co-restriction. So it sounds very fancy, but the idea was just like a norm. Fancy, but the idea was just like a norm. So I take my algebra and I take its tensor product with its conjugate. So I just act by the non-trivial element in the Gao group of the third cyclic atomic field. So I multiply with its conjugate and it's now Gao invariant. And you can show this actually descends to the ground field, which is Q. And this is my algebra, A1. I'm calling. This gives me an element over Q. And you may think, why has he done this weird thing? Why has he done this weird thing of passing to the third sixth atomic field and then doing this co-restriction? I mean, if A1 is already a square over Q, I can just factorize the equation here. That's true. You can do that. And you can write down a similar algebra, but this case is not interesting for the Hasse principle because there's a rational point there. So that's why we're looking at this case where minus 31 is a square because in general there won't be a rational point. Great. So these are the two Brau group elements we're interested in. Elements we're interested in, we call it quaternion algebra and the co-restriction of a cyclic algebra. Yeah, and I say if you want to calculate stuff with this co-restriction of cyclic algebra, stuff like local invariance and things like that, it's not too difficult because I've got an element of order three and I'm taking like co-restriction with respect to quadratic extension. And since two and three are co-prime, this helps you a lot. And it just means if you want to calculate the local invariant over Q, I can calculate it over the third cyclic atomic field where it's a six. Over the third cyclic atomic field, where it's a cyclic algebra, and the diff it will differ by a factor of two, possibly. But this factor of two doesn't ultimately really matter because I've got an element of order three. Multiplying by two is an automorphism. Anyway, technical point. So I'll explain a bit how we use these algebras, how we get upper bounds for our main theorems for the counting problems there. So we have a few different criterion. This is an example of the kind of criterion we have. So I'm assuming it's just a large prime, such as a periodic value. It's a large prime, such a p-addic valuation of a1 is odd, but p doesn't divide a2 and a3. Then, this algebra b1, which is a quaternion algebra, gives no Brown-Manning obstruction to the Hasse principle. So how do you prove this? It's a quaternion algebra. You can calculate local invariants using Hilbert symbol. A slight abuse of notation, because really local invariant takes values in Q mod Z, Hilbert symbol takes value plus or minus one. Anyway, I'm identifying Z mod 2 Z with μ. With u2. And you can calculate his Hilbert symbol using the genre symbol because this factor A1 divides odd order, and generically, well, we're going to arrange things so that this is non-zero modular P and you have an explicit formula in terms of the Legendre symbol. Yeah, so this is the formula for local inventor in terms of Legendre symbol. But you know, the numerator in the Legendre symbol only cares about your value modulo squares. So I'll work in the patch given by x. So I'll work in the patch given by x3 is equal to 1, and I'll write the expression in the numerator as something a times the square, y. My local invariant is just as a over p. So we need to understand what happens for different choices of a. So look at my equation. So I've reduced the equation of the surface modular p. So x3 I've taken to be 1. And by assumption p divided a1, so that's gone. And this is the equation I've imposed. And now you can. I've imposed, and now you can substitute the second equation to the first because I can write x2 squared in terms of y squared. And when I plug that in there, you'll see that you get an equation of the shape w squared equals f of y modula p, where f is degree 12. So this is a hyperliptic curve. This curve I should clarify is singular, but it's still, so it doesn't have genus, well, whatever you guess the genus would be, the genus is actually three. You guess the genus would be. The genus is actually three. But you can apply the Hasseve A estimates. And these now apply this curve, providing your prime sufficiently large, and you need to make sure you chose a non-zero to begin with. You can find a smooth FP point on this curve, which then you lift a QP point. So, what does the upshot of this mean? It means providing my prime is sufficiently large, I can make Legendre symbol take both values. Make Le Jeanre symbol take both values because I can find if because this has of estimates is uniform, you know, with respect to A. So I just choose A. So I choose A to be a quadratic residue. And then it says I can find a periodic point on my surface such that, yeah, satisfies this equality. So this means the geometry equal to one. And then I take A to be the quadratic non-residue, and I can make this geometrical equal to minus one. Minus one. So it takes both values, and now there's a standard argument which tells you that there's no Brown Manning obstruction. So what you do is you take an idaic point. So everything product, I mean, I'm writing these multiplicatively rather than additively. So you take an idaic point. If the product of the local convariance is minus one, I can just fudge it at this prime p to make sure the product local variance is actually equal to one. So this means. To one. So this means the idyllic points orthogonal to my given Brau group element is non-empty. So there's no Brown-Manny obstruction in this case. So what's the upshot of this? Well, if you want to understand the case, how often B1 gives a Brown-Manny obstruction to the Hasse principle, this occurs for T to 3 over 2 plus epsilon surfaces, so that's for all epsilon. And how do you go about counting this? How do you go about counting this? So, as A3 over A2 is a cube, there's T choices for A2 and A3. Because basically, yeah, they could have arbitrary common factor, but outside the common factor, any other factor must be a cube. So, once you sum over the non-common factor part, it's going to be convergent. And the previous lemma says A1 is basically a square. If you look at the statement, it says I can't be divisible. I can't be divisible by primes and odd valuations which don't divide a2 and a3. But these are going to be most primes because as soon as I've got a prime which divides two coefficients, this means there's some highest common factor occurring. And this is going to be uncommon. When you count this an uncommon condition, and so the collection of yeah, there's going to be some yeah, there's a collection of small primes which could cause these uncommon primes. Could cause these uncommon primes, which could cause these problems, and this would give you a factor of t to the epsilon. But it's basically a square, so it grows like um t to the half. Yeah. So this t to the two-third is the order of magnitude I had in the main theorem. So this one lemma is enough to get close to the main theorem, but you also need to get the correct powers of logs and whatnot, stuff like that. That and that's the more delicate part. And there, you need further conditions which stipulate that you only allowed special kinds of primes to divide the coefficients. So yeah, so similar method works for barcode A1. So that's how you get kind of rougher for bounds. To give you an idea of where the actual result comes from, I'll give you some examples. I think I've only got. I've only got, yeah. I'll skip this one lower bound here and I'll just go straight to the other ones. This is a more interesting case. This is for the co-restriction of a cyclic algebra of degree three. So how we construct the lower bounds is we just construct an explicit family of counterexamples. So I'm saying this explicit family of surfaces. This explicit family of surfaces, I'm saying this. This algebra cyclic algebra or three gives a round manual instruction to the Hasse principle for these surfaces, and we've got various conditions imposed on them. So we've got variables A, B, and Q. So A occurs there, B and Q both occur at the same time here. First ones, Q is a prime, it's one modulo three, and 17 is not a cube in the Q addict numbers. So this condition can't be expressed by congruences, it's some kind of Chepatov condition. It's some kind of Chepatov condition. The next condition is that A and B are only allowed to be divisible by primes for which 17 is a cube modulo P. And our last condition, we have to impose various congruence conditions, modulo small primes, just to guarantee stuff like local solubility and things at small primes. I mean, I'm not interesting to write it down. And this lemma, well, it's just an explicit calculation. I'm not going to do it now. I've told you the family of surfaces, I've told you a bra group element. You just have to calculate these local invariants in this case. So how do you go about counting? Now I'm explaining how do you go about counting this family of counterexamples? So these are our conditions. So these are the important conditions in our family. And I claiming that there's t to three over two log log t developed. t to 3 over 2 log log t divided by log t to two thirds such surfaces. So this was the expression which appeared in our main theorem. So first thing you need to understand the density of the set of primes p for which 17 is a cube modular p. Now when everyone looks at this especially when I did my first guess was oh there's a third of such prime but this one's two thirds it's because there's two ways to be a cube modulo p. Either your prime could be completely modulo p either your prime could be completely split in the extension q adjoining the cube root of 17 or it could be two modulo three and it's just this funny fact that any prime which is two modulo three everything's a cube so for a i'm counting a so a squared appears here so a is going up to square root of t and um yeah the standard techniques in analytic number theory for counting numbers which are restricted Numbers which have restricted prime divisors. And the formula is the density of the set of primes minus one. So this gives a factor of a third. And B has a similar property, but I've got B times Q occurring. So I have the factor T over Q occurring here. And now when I sum over Q, I'm going to be summing 1 over Q. And it's more or less Merton's theorem tells you this sum of 1 over Q goes like log log T. But it's not quite Merton's because I've got. But it's not quite Merton's because I've got these Chebotov conditions on my prime, but you can have a Merton's version of um yeah, version of Merton's them, Chebotov density theorem. So, this is the kind of yeah, how our asymptotic the order of magnitude stuff arises. I'll quickly, I think I've probably pretty much out of time. I'll very quickly explain how we do the whole brow group to answer Adam's question because he's just going to answer later. Later. So you have this algebraic part of the Braho group, which is stuff diet of the algebraic closure. And you can calculate this in magma. And most of the time, it's Zeml3Z or Zeml2Z generated by these elements. And to calculate the transcendental part of the Brau group, we use a method due to Gewerts and Skorbogatov. And they use this method for diagonal quartic surfaces. And they managed to calculate the transcendental part of the bra group there. Transcendental part of the bra group, there, and we use this method to show that almost always there's no transcendental elements. And I'll just finish by explaining how results answer an open question in literature, namely a few different authors have asked whether you can have a K3 surface with a brown-minded construction entirely explained by an odd-order Brow group element. So, for commercial surfaces, this can't happen. This is the Mu Kreutzen VRI. Now, examples where you can have an order obstruction, but these examples couldn't rule out there was actually an element of even order, which is also giving an obstruction. But what our results definitively give is, yes, there's a K-3 surface over Q with the Brown instruction to Haas principle, and the whole Brauer group, we can calculate the whole Brown-Brauel group is module constants of Z module 3Z. So, the answer to the question is: yes, this can happen. This can happen. And I'll stop there. Great. Thank you.
