Okay, so my interests lie in many areas, but in relation to this conference is the connection of computable analysis and computable topology with defective algebra and computable structures. And this is basically the subject of my talk. Before I begin, I would like to apologize if we're not. Sasha, slow down. Before you begin, there's someone else in the room. Before you begin, there's someone else in the room who didn't get to say hi. So we're in the room. Sorry, I didn't understand that. Sorry. Hi, Peter. Tell everyone hello. Hi, yeah. I'm Peter, Peter Burton. I'm postdoc at Iowa State University. So I'm main interest to be like ergodic theory and quantum information theory. My biggest interest in computability has to do with sort of connections with Connections with, as I say, quantum information theory, especially like R equals Re and that kind of thing. So, yeah, very glad to be here. Thanks for inviting me. Okay, and now I'll hand it over to Elvira, who is chairing the session. Yeah, sure, but you can start. Thanks, Tasha. So, Tasha Lennikov is going to talk about computable duality. Thank you, Sam. Thank you very much. And I apologize in advance for not being there in person. I did try my best. That involved wasting over $200 as non-refundable fees, but unfortunately, I was not able to acquire a visa. And that is because of COVID, I think. Just, anyways, so. Anyways, so I tried my best, I couldn't, but thanks for letting me speak via Zoom. I hope there will be no further technical difficulties, but we'll see. So I'm going to talk about computable dualities. And of course, you know what duality usually means. I'm not going to define what I mean by a duality. I would rather go through several types of dualities which are traditionally called and viewed as dualities and talk about those. Computer's dualities and talk about those. So, in my talk, there will be several computable dualities. All of these results will be new or almost new, but because they were obtained basically during COVID, I didn't really have a chance to speak about these results too often. Maybe once I spoke about this stuff, so not only it's relatively new, but also you probably never heard of these results before. And also, I will. And also, I will talk about consequences of these computable dualities results, some of which I think are quite unexpected. Also, I understand that everybody is already tired. It's afternoon, probably late afternoon, evening there. So, my talk will consist of six somewhat independent parts. So, if for some reason you lost me and you cannot follow me for some time, you can come back, wake up, and maybe you will be able to follow me. Will be able to call it. All right, so let's begin. A very brief introduction, a bit of motivation of why do we care in general and at all. And thanks for Wesley Calvert. I don't have to say too much about computable structures, but just to repeat him a little bit, effective algebra or computable structure theory investigates computable, discrete, and countable. It's computable, discrete, and countable groups, for example, rings, Boolean algebras, and things of this sort. Also, people study computable abstract computable model theory, such as prime model, homogeneous model, things like that. And also, there is something that is not really related to anything directly or wasn't related. It's abstract structure, computable structure theory, such as degree spectra. Theory such as degree spectra, categories now found various applications and connections to other topics. Computable analysis is somewhat similar in computable topology. The subjects include the effective content of real or complex analysis. Traditionally, old results are about computable functions on the real line, differentiability, and things like that. Basically, And things like that, basically calculus. We're talking 50s and 1950s and 60s. And then, of course, computably presented spaces, which are usually separable, such as LP spaces, their subsets, and iterations on them, things of this sort. And of course, there is a general theory, abstract theory of represented spaces, effective topological spaces, abstract computable topology, and so on and so forth. And yes. And yes, objects of study are different. If in effective algebra, we talk about usually countable structures without any topology. These objects are usually at least separable and not countable and topological. But the traditional division between computable analysis and effective algebra is actually, in my opinion, somewhat artificial because the Artificial because the questions that we ask are usually the same. It's just the object we are trying to answer this question for could be a bit different. The two subjects share the same motivation, and the technical challenges are not that different either. I will give you an example of a technical kind of connection. People don't know it, but I recently discovered it as well. There is a notion of a limit-wise monotonic function. Notion of a limit-wise monotonic function. They characterize certain computable groups, and they have been around since the 1980s and rediscovered by Hussein If Nissen-Shor some 17 years later after Hisamiev. But then in 2015, Poserhov and Hertling reinvented this notion to study computably presented compact subsets of RN up to homeomorphism. So you can see that the question is different. One going talking about computable groups, discrete groups, the other is talking about subsets of Rn, but somehow they arrive at the same notion that helps in both cases. And this is quite typical. And in fact, techniques and ideas from effective algebra can be often extended to separable spaces, especially separable spaces. Using computable Spaces using computable dense sequences. So, yes, it's a separable space, but there is like a dense countable structure in some sense inside it. And you can use it to extend some of the techniques and notions. And it really goes back to poor Alan Richards. But then we sort of started looking at it again, me and Ilyazovich. In 2010, we looked at computably categorical Polish spaces and then short. And then, shortly after, there were some works on computably categorical Banach spaces, probably most notably LP spaces, by various authors, including myself, most notably McNickel, probably Stahls and their co-authors. And there are now many more recent results in computable continuous model theory, computable topological groups, even von Neumann algebras, different structures. Different structures which are topological, but many others, and this list is incomplete. So, if you don't see your name, there doesn't mean that I don't know your work, it means that I ran out of space on this slide. And you probably already contributed to this framework, maybe even without knowing it. And in fact, methods of computable topology can sometimes be used in computable structure theory, so there is a connection backwards, sort of so to. Is a connection backwards, sort of so to speak. One example is my work with Montalban from 2015 on computable Polish group actions, where we discovered that many standard results in computable structure theory are in fact special cases of some general results in computable topology and via simpler proofs quite often. And we are talking simpler, maybe five times shorter, if not more. But all of these results so far on this slide, on the previous slide, most of them are sort of technical generalizations. So we know how to do things for discrete structures. Let's try to add epsilons all over the place and see if it still works or not. But what about results that would directly relate the two subjects? What does it mean to directly relate? Let me give you an example. And this And this result is almost forgotten, and it's quite old by Laroche and really goes back to Mitakidis and Neurode. And this is something Russell would probably be familiar with. For a profinite group G, we have the following equivalent. G, which is a topological object, has a precursive profinite presentation. I will discuss what I mean by that. If and only if it can be realized as It can be realized as a Galois group of a computable field F over its computable subgroup. So it is a duality kind of result, isn't it? And in fact, it's a bit more than I stated here. And for instance, as a consequence of this work, Laroche discovered that the free profinite group, something if you don't know, don't worry about it, but people care about these kind of objects. That people care about these kinds of objects can be realized, in fact, computably as the Galois group of the algebraic closure of the rationals over its computable subfield. And in fact, it wasn't even known classically back then. So partial results, we're talking only about finitely generated such profinite groups. So sometimes while doing these kind of things, you discover new techniques. You discover new techniques. And we actually also, we use Greenberg, myself, Nisa and Turetsky, we use this result to study pi zero one subgroups of S infinity as well. So this is a useful result, almost forgotten. And in fact, because of this duality, arguably computable fields in their study are more related to recursive finite groups than to, let's say, computable linear orderings. Computable linear orderings. So, Russell probably knows more about recursive profinite groups than me, even though he probably doesn't realize it because he knows lots about fields. And this is the type of result I am looking for. I want to have a result which connects effectiveness for discrete structures with effective representations of, let's say, separable or topological structures. Let's say separable topological structures in some sense, and also bring some more information maybe on top of that. Another old result, and this is kind of elementary folklore result of the stone, for computable Boolean, for a countable Boolean algebra. It is C presented. I will define it shortly if and only it's homeomorphic to the Pi Zero 1 class. 01 class in the country space. And if you want to see proofs, I said this paper by Audinsov and Silivanov. They prove a lot more, and we will actually use this more general result later. But of course, this observation uses a very restricted notion of computable presentability for stone spaces. And I don't think it can be directly applied in computable topology because the presentation is so restricted. Because the presentation is so restricted. Sorry, Sasha. Be hat here as the dual with me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dual. The dual, the buddhal stone space. Can you still hear me? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, yeah. But we can do better. We can extend this result to actually be helpful. And I personally cannot think of. And I personally cannot think of any other old effective duality result of this sort. Maybe there are, but I can't remember now. That's basically the complete list before 2020. And we seek results of the form something like that for a class K of discrete structures. For any structure A in the class, the following are equivalent. A has an algorithmically effective presentation of some sort if and only if the Some sort if and only if the dual topological structure has an effective presentation in some sense. And we want to use this result and to study classification problems. I will mention how we can do that later on. But the problem is that what do we mean by an algorithmically effective presentation? Well, I will discuss shortly that in computable algebra, we more or less agree what it means. But the standard classical dualities work up to homeomorphism. And this is where the problem is, because in computable topology, it's not necessarily clear what we mean by a computable topologically presented space. Anyways, so the plan of the rest of So, the plan of the rest of the talk is: I will talk about effective presentations of structures and spaces. Then, I will talk about stone dualities, then Pantragian duality, then I will also mention Banach stone duality, and then finally, I will talk about EDLC groups, totally disconnected locally compact groups, and their dual group points. In each case, we will discuss applications. And as I mentioned before, some of these consequences are quite fundamental and unexpected. I think that that's my belief. You can disagree with me. Just before you go on, do you have an effective Gelfand duality? No. But that's possible, I think, but it just hasn't been studied. Okay, thank you. As far as I know. All right. Okay, so that is an introductory part. Okay, so that is an introductory part still. So in case if you missed the previous talks, in case if you're not familiar with computable topology, I need to give you the definitions. That's my responsibility and duty. So this is something that was, I'm sure, described by Wesley in great detail. There's the definition for discrete countable structures, which goes back to Mali. Which goes back to Maltsev and Reibin independently. An algebraic structure is computable if its domain, operations, and relations are Turing computable. A rather general definition. There is another general definition that also pops up quite frequently in the literature, especially in the context of groups by Higman, but also was extended by Maltsev to general structures. By Maltsov to general structures. A structure is CE presented, computably enumerably presented, or sigma 0, 1 presented, some people say positively presented, if it has the form of a factor of the free term algebra by its computably enumerable subalgebra. Or if you are more comfortable with just some sort of land. Language, if you want. It is the same as Maitsev-Rabin's approach, but you just do not assume that equality between elements is computable. It is C. So if two elements represent the same point, you will eventually see it. But if not, you may never be sure. And the great, the standard example that motivates this definition is a recursively quote-unquote presented group. Quote-unquote presented group, as Higman calls them. So it is a group upon countably many generators where you have also countably many relations, but you can list them computably enumerably. So that is your standard example of a C-presented structure. And these two definitions are more or less accepted throughout the literature as the base, effective, the most probably general. Be general presentations that can be viewed as effective algorithmically. Can I ask a question? In the second definition, is it once again only structures in languages with no relation symbols, or can you have relation symbols? Yeah, it's a great question. I was thinking of writing this comment, but I decided to not. Yes, so it can be done for relational as well, but there is a bit of Well, but there is a bit of inconsistency in the literature. What do you mean by that? Right, so there are two conflicting definitions, but we will not really encounter this, so we will not have to worry. But yes, this can be done for relational structures as well in two different ways. Yeah. Thank you. And these notions of a C-presented structure and a computably presented structure is. And the computably presented structures are known and have been known for many, many years to be non-equivalent in general up to isomorphism. And the classical results to be stated here would be the result of Novikov and Boone, almost more than 80 years ago, who constructed famously a finitely presented group with undecidable word problem. And if you think about it for a second or two, you will realize that that will give you. You will realize that that will give you an example of a C-presented group that doesn't have a computable presentation, is not isomorphic to a computably presented group. Then another result from the 70s by Feiner. If you are erration theorist, you will know it. There is a C-presented Boolean algebra with no computable isomorphic copy. And non-trivial fact, so it was way ahead. Fat, so it was way ahead of its time. So, technically, quite challenging, in fact, for the 70s, especially. And now, Kisamiv in the 80s showed like a positive result, which we will use later on. Kisameev showed that every C-presented torsion-free abelian group has a computable copy. So, it does not necessarily work like they do not have to be non-equivalent. In some nice classes, you actually do have. You actually do have that is present as a presentation. And these results are classics. So people have known these sort of things for many, many, many years. Some of these results are old and some are very old. And the question that we will have to answer if we want to do computable dualities: what are the fundamental notions of computable presentability, of computable space in the Presentability of computable space in topology. And one thing that comes historically, one presentation that has been very well studied is presentations where finite simplicial complexes. So it's like a, you probably know what it is. I don't have to say what it is. Basically, your space is given by a friend. And again, it's known that up. Known that up to homeomorphism, these simplified complexes, it's undecidable to tell whether these two things represent the same space. So, the homeomorphism problem is undecidable. But for two surfaces, it's decidable and it's more than 100 years old. Result, and from the work of Perelman, it follows that it's decidable for three manifolds as well, and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. So, these results are well known. The problem with this approach is that not every space has a triangulation, of course, even if you assume it's compact, just like the Cantor space, it doesn't make sense to talk about simplicial complexes at all. And we need to find a more general notion of effective presentability that behaves well up to homeomorphism. And this is where things become complicated. There is a whole zoo of Complicated. There is a whole zoo of notions in the literature. One weak notion that supposedly can be traced back to Maltsev is the notion of a computable topological space. It's given by some indexing of a countable base, so it has to be countably based by natural numbers, and together with a computable function alph, so that it lists. So that it lists the intersection of any pair of the basic balls. So it gives you some way to represent the intersection uniformly in the indices of i and j. That looks so weak, all right. You don't really have direct access to points even. But people have been using this, and believe it or not, it can be very useful, especially to get the most general statements of some basic. Most general statements of some basic results. There's another thing that is also standard throughout the literature. It's the notion of computable Polish space. So it's given by a compatible and for this talk complete metric D. It is given by some indexing of a dense sequence, which can be identified with the natural numbers, and also by an algorithm that will calculate your mat. That will calculate your metric between these points in the dense sequence to arbitrary precision. So, given i, j, and n, I can compute a rational that is within 2 to the minus n to this distance between xi and xj. I like to call these spaces computably metrized because I want to talk about topology, so the metric is usually not fixed. And this definition can be traced back to Chaitin and Maskovakis. Chaitin and Muscovakis. So it has been around for quite a while as well. A much more recent and but very popular notion is the notion of a computably compact space. It's given by, it has to be compact to begin with. But this presentation is given by a computable polished presentation defined previously and also a computably enumerable list of all finite covers by basic open. Finite covers by basic open balls of this space. And maybe Isaac will be interested to know that it's actually equivalent to say that the continuous, full continuous diagram is decidable for this space. So instead of talking about all possible covers, you can just say, oh, I can decide any sentence, any sentence with parameter, formula with parameters from the space, any precision. Same time. It's easy to see. At the same time, it's easy to see. Anyway, there are many other equivalent ways to define this. But also, if it is not the end of the list, I'm not going to define these things, but there is also computable Paulish groups, recursive profinite groups already mentioned, computable Banach spaces that go back to Porrell and Richards, optoisometry, usually, though, and so on and so forth. And in all of these cases, we also have some sort of operation. Will also have some sort of operations on top of your space. So, naturally, you would require these operations to be computable, maybe up to some precision. I'm not going to define it, but these definitions are there. And if you count the number of possible definitions here, just on these two slides, we are talking about a dozen. Because there are also more exotic notions, upper semicomputable spaces, effectively closed presentations, and so on. Effectively clothes, presentations, and so on and so forth. The list goes on. And it's a zoo. So, what are the right definitions? And are some of these definitions actually equivalent? Are they actually equivalent in some classes up to homeomorphism? And just recall these classical results in algebra. Whenever you have some definitions like P, N P, you know, is P equal to N P, you at least have to try to show that they're different. Show that they're different. What about similar results in computable topology? And even though we will be talking about dualities, this is another question that we will have to resolve sort of simultaneously. And here is what was known, at least to me, before 2020, and up to homeomorphism. There is a result of Joe Miller. Yeah, so it says that if you have a pi zero one sphere, n-sphere inner end, then it has to be computable. It's not quite what we need, but it is working in some sense up to homeomorphism. And this is the first application of homology in the literature on computable analysis that I am aware of. So it was novel at the time. Sorry, what do you mean by it being computable? Sorry, what do you mean by it being computable? Yeah, so I didn't want to define it, but it means that you can decide whether an open ball intersects the set or not. So it's yet another notion. It's one of the main. So that's a zoo, right? And also, this result was extended to certain manifolds by Ryazovich and others. Check something. So the Hiller results from 2002. Miller result from 2002. It's. Does it have something to do with like embedding a higher dimensional sphere in our end, or do you mean sort of the n minus one dimensional sphere? N minus one, it's a type, yeah. So m has to be less than n, I suppose. I don't remember exactly. Joe is there to correct me. So then it was extended to certain manifolds. To check in manifolds. And then the result which I already mentioned by Bosserhoff and Hertling in 2015 showed something that is the closest to what we need. You have a pi zero one compact subset of Rn. There is a C such that it's not computable for any F homeomorphism of Rn onto itself. So you just you may. So, you just you make this, you look at all possible homeomorphisms of RN onto itself, and C cannot be turned into a computable subset. And again, I didn't define what I mean by that, but it's something that can be defined, closely related, but still not what we need. And I already mentioned that they to do that, even a restricted result, they needed new ideas that connected them to effective algebra, technically. Effective algebra, technically. And their result is the closest to what we need, but none of these results actually separate the notions in the zoo. So there is some work to be done. And a lot of progress has been done quite recently, beginning with this short manifesto by Selivanov, and independently, our work with Calvin Kangmen, Matthew Harrison Trainer. Matthew Harrison Trainer. And also, there is a preprint by Hairb, Hihara, and Selivanov, also around the same time. And my plan is basically, I will discuss dualities and separate the notions simultaneously. So the answer is yes, you can separate the notions, the most important ones. But I think the most elegant way to do that actually is to use dualities. Dualities, all right. So, part two: effective stone duality. You can wake up if you're asleep. Let's talk about some new stuff. Stone duality. I'm just going to state it. See, if you have a stone of profinite space, then the following are equivalent, S is computably metrizable, and it has a computable. And it has a computably compact copy. So, additionally, you assume you can list the covers. And the Boolean algebra of the space has a computable copy. So, exactly what you would need, right? And the proof, it's not difficult at all, right? But while modulus unknown results, right? It actually were the most interesting implications from an arbitrary compatible metric to the Boolean algebra. It has to be, I mean, it's. In algebra, it has to be, I mean, it's compatible, but it could be strange, right? We use that every low Boolean algebra has a computable copy. It's a classical now, I would say, result in computable algebra due to Downian Joker. And to be more precise, that every delta 2 Boolean algebra with the set of atoms delta 2 has a computable copy. So that's what we actually use. But otherwise, the proof is not difficult. It takes about a page. It takes about a page, assuming this result from effective algebra. Now, the second duality, which I want to state here, that is a bit more subtle. Now, I have to use one of those exotic notions of a very presented space. A right-symmetrized or upper-semi-computable space is given again by a dense sequence, but now we assume that the distance. But now we assume that the distances are not computable between the points, but you can just approximate them from above. So the right cuts of the reals are uniformly computable enumerable. It means that, you know, you can think for a while that the distance is one, but then arbitrarily late, they can actually become equal, these two points, or become the distance can become one half, and you never are never sure. And that is similar to CE presentations in algebra. Presentations in algebra, if you think about it for a second. And this is what exactly we get. For a stone space, we have the right C compatible metric for the stone space is equivalent to the Boolean algebra being C presentable. And again, I wouldn't call this proof hard. It's not, but it uses some old result by Audienceov and Silovanov, which in fact I already mentioned about Pi02 present. About pi zero two presented Boolean algebras this time, which something I don't want to define. An old classical result from effective algebra. All right, so why do we care actually about right-c meterite spaces? How is it even related to the main definitions I stated previously? Well, if you take the basic open balls in the right C space, they form a computable topological space, and this is well known. So, because of the result of So, because of the result of Feiner, which I stated, remember Boolean algebras, which I see presented, are not isomorphic to computable ones, we have for stone spaces that we can separate computable topological presentations straight away to computably metro and computably meterized ones. But computably compact and computably meterized are equivalent up to homeomorphism. So, we are kind of done half of the work now. And as a corollary, we can improve this result by Bosserhof and Hertling, and also actually our own result. There is a pi zero one subset of zero, one not homeomorphic to any computable poly space. So we don't have to restrict ourselves to homeomorphisms of our end onto itself, just any computable poly space. There are other applications that I will probably have time to discuss a bit later. Time to discuss a bit later. But the key questions is: what about separating computably compact and computably metrized? Something we haven't done. It's impossible to do it using stone spaces. And there are several ways to build an example. And all of them require some effort, a lot harder than this. Well, stone duality is kind of cute, but it's not hard, of course. And I will give a connected example using Pontragon duality. Example using Pontragon duality. All right, so we are about to start talking about something a bit more technically challenging. I'm going to talk about Pantragian duality, but for now, it's the simpler case for profinite groups. Oh, actually, question, how much time do I have? I've used some time, but I mean, there are 35. I mean there are thirty-five more minutes. It would be nice to to have some questions at the end, but we are not in a half so. Excellent. I will have probably more slides than I can cover, but I will skip some. Let's talk briefly about contragin duality for sure. If you're not familiar, you take a locally compact topological abelian group G and form it. And form its dual group G hat to be all group homeomorphisms from G to the unit circle under the compact open topology. What's compact open topology? Well, if G is compact, then it's basically topology of uniform convergence. And this is the case we ultimately care about. So think about just uniform convergence. Now, Now, it's well known, done by Pantragin, that for a compact or a discrete abelian G, G is isomorphic to its second dual, just like for stone spaces and Boolean algebras, same deal. And in fact, G is discrete if and only if its dual is compact. G is torsion discrete if and only if it is dual is profinite. This is the case we care about in this part of the talk. In this part of the talk, and for the next part of the talk, it's torsion-free, discrete if and only if jihad is connected compact. All right, now straight away, I want to state the result. Duality for a profinite abelian group, the following are equivalent. A has a computable copy as a Okay, so I think it has to be a hat, right? So I can confuse the head. So the following eye willrsion dual has a computable copy as the discrete group in the usual sense. And then the profinite group is recursively profinite, something I'm going to define shortly. And the profinite group is computably compact with respect to compatible, maybe. With respect to compatible, maybe strange metric, but also assuming the operation is computable. So, what's recursively profinite? So, again, what we have here is imputable groups correspond to imputable topological objects under the duality. What does it mean for a group to be recursively profinite? It's an old definition. So, what you do is basically you assume that it's given by a inverse system. By an invariary system linearly ordered, where everything is decidable. All the finite groups save 0, F1, are fully given to you as finite sets, all at once. All the maps are computably given to you. Everything is effective. So that would be recursive for a finite presentation. What's also I want to mention that this effective duality, it turns computable isomorphisms into computable isomorphisms between the duals. Between the duals. So we can get more than just computable presentability. So it basically is a nice functor as well. And this some notion that I want to state again. We know that a computable structure is computably categorical. If any two computable isomorphic copies of the structure are computably isomorphic, so it's one of these standard notions in computable structure theory. Structure theory and it lies in the core of computable algebra. So, using this duality, because it now turns isomorphisms, computable isomorphisms between torsion groups, to computable isomorphism between the recursive profinite groups, you can now extend some of the results from algebra to recursive profinite groups straight away. And just for the sake of example, we know a complete algebraic. We know a complete algebraic description of computably categorical abelian p groups, which is just a direct sum of cyclic, quasi-cyclic groups, where almost all summons are the same. And a more recent result by myself and Selwyn Kangmeng. The index set of computably categorical abelian groups, Tarsian abelian groups, is pi zero focompi. abelian groups is pi zero four complete, which solves an old problem that can be traced back to Maltsev. So it's a technical result. And as a corollary using the duality, we get a complete description of C profinate groups and also get the for free the index set of computably categorical recursively profile groups is pi 04 complete and of course because of the And of course, because of the technical nature of the second result, proving it directly with recursive profinite groups would be very, very challenging. But because of the duality, we get it for free from the known result. All right, so we found another explicit link between modern results and the old theorems of Smith and Laroche. Smiths and LaRoche for profinite groups, which is great. But the problem is that in our results, computability of the group operation in the profinite group cannot be dropped. You cannot reconstruct it in general. While because any profinite group is homeomorphic to the country space, well, unless it's finite. So topologically, they're not interesting. And therefore, pro-finite groups do not help us to separate effective notions for spaces. Effective notes for spaces. So, as nice and pleasant as they are, not really helping. All right. Part three. Now, connected groups. For connected groups, things become more complicated. And I'm going to just state the results straight away. In fact, it's three results combined into one. Two do I Into one, two dualities for a torsion-free G, which remember connected corresponds to discrete torsion-free under the duality. For a torsion-free abelian G, we have the G is computably presentable if and only if its dual is effectively or computably compact. And G is delta 2 presentable, which means that it has a presentation computable relative. A presentation computable relative to the halting problem if and only if G hat is computably metrizable, which is, I think, is quite unexpected. So here, computable meterizability, the response not to computability or CE presentability, but no, delta 2 or zero prime presentability. I did not see that coming. And this equivalence, the last equivalence, holds under mild restrictions. Restriction on the isomorphism type, which does not really affect much, and I'm pretty sure can be dropped, but it makes the proof a lot easier. And what's important in these dualities is that computability of the group operations in G-hat is not assumed. So, G-hat is represented as a space with no reference to the group structure. Well, on the left-hand side, the discrete object, of course, is a group. Inside the discrete object, of course, is a group in the usual sense, imputable group. How is that possible? Well, I want to talk a bit more about the techniques of this effective pentragon dualities. What we use is a new constructive version of Czech homology, something I will probably say a few more words about. And our new constructive and computable or computable version of Czecho homology, a way to calculate checker homology for a compact space, extends the classical computability theoretic results about simplicial homologies and cohomologies that can be found in the classical text of algebraic topology by Mancres. You are probably familiar with this author. And this is one of the standard textbooks. There is an entire chapter about computer. Is an entire chapter about computability of homologies with simplificial complexes. So, our results extend those. We also use Hisemiyev's result, which I stated at the very beginning of my talk. C presented torsion 3 abelian groups have computable presentations. Somewhere inside the proof, it's used in a non-trivial way, right? Essential way, I would say. And also, one of the implications uses another classical result from. Uses another classical result from computable abelian group theory due to Dobrica about bases. So, this is a non-trivial proof and it uses non-trivial results from the literature. And of course, the main combinatorial tool is the priority machinery. Does it have to be some sort of priority? I don't know. It looks like it does have to be. I don't know. It looks like it does have to be used. And so the question is: how can we get away without even using the group operations? Well, that's because of the Czech homology. So it is known that the dual of a compact connected group is isomorphic to the first check cohomology of the space of G. And to calculate the cohomology, you don't need to have any use deterioration of the G itself, and this is why it's possible in general. So, this seems to be a popular result in algebraic topology or some sort of homological algebra kind of thing. I don't know who was the first. Sorry, now is G a topological object? Now, G is a topological connected compact abelian group. Connected compact abelian group, its first check of homology, which is something I'm going to elaborate a bit more about, is isomorphic. It's a discrete object now, is isomorphic to the torsion-free dual of this group. Okay, thanks. Yeah. So that is a remarkable result. And that is actually not hard to see why. Once you know that it is true, it's an exercise. It's an exercise. Once you know it's true, it's an exercise. It follows from some results about pantraging duals and so on and so forth. But once you know this stuff, it's not hard to see at all. What is the check of homology of a given space? Now, G, let's say it's just a compact space, doesn't have to be a group. It's the direct limit induced by the inverse limit of the first co-homologies of. The first cohomologies of the simplicial complexes. Now, going back to the beginning of the talk, obtained from the finite open covers of the space. So you have all these nested covers nested under refinement. And each of them can be viewed as a simplification complex in a standard way. You just look at which ones intersect, and so on and so forth. Intersect and so on and so forth. And then you do some calculation. The problem is that the standard definition is non-effective and it's far from being effective. In fact, it's sigma 02 presentation, so C relative to 0 prime. At best, as it looks like, at least, if you just follow the standard definition, you can construct a counterexample. We improved it to see presented groups for any computably compact space. It doesn't have to be a group, just any space which is computably compact. And that requires some work. But what the good news for us in our case now, because we know that the dual is torsion-free, is that in the torsion-free case, we actually obtain a computable copy. So this is where Isamir's result is used. Is used. It's quite a bit of techniques used to prove these dualities. Of course, I'm not going to talk about it any further. But now, the good news is that now we can pretty much translate results from effective algebra, and a lot is known about computable abelian groups. We can directly translate them into results about spaces, not groups, just connected spaces. And for instance, there is this old result due to Maitsev in 1958 that you can translate into just saying that there is a computably meterized connected space, not homeomorphic to any computable compact one. And this is diagram which we were looking for. We can now, in one compact polyu spaces, separate the main, the three sort of the three main notions. Sort of the three main notions, I think, in the literature up to homeomorphism, computably compact, computably metrized, and computably topological presented spaces. All right. Let's talk about a few applications and maybe that's it. I don't think I have enough time to talk about TDLC groups. We'll see. A few applications. A few applications, as promised. So now we have these effective dualities that sort of open the gates between computable topology and effective algebra directly. It's not a technical generalization anymore. It is a result which directly relates things. For example, you can immediately conclude that the homeomorphism problem for connected compact polished spaces. Compact Polish spaces is sigma 1, 1 complete that sort of extends results stated of Markov from the 50s for simplicial complexes. And of course, the upper bound is a lot higher than just sigma 0, 1, it's sigma 1, 1, but it is still complete. And how you so what is it, what does it mean for a homeomorphism? What I mean by homeomorphism problem is the collection of pairs. Is the collection of pairs of homeomorphic of indices of homeomorphic presentations and the sum effective enumeration of all possible presentations that are given to us by the universal Turing machine? And that is something that Wesley Calvert talked about, index set approach. So, if you look at this set, its complexity, according to the naive definition, is there is an homeomorphism which is sigma. Which is sigma one one, in fact, in the compact case. And it is complete, meaning that you cannot do better than just basically check the brute force definition. And it follows from the work of Downey and Montalban on the isomorphism problem for computable torsion-free abelian groups. And it follows from our effective duality with the connected. Effective duality with the connected spaces. Sorry, can you say one more time? So, what is ME bar? How are you? So, you fix it, you fix the universal Turing machine, and using it, you can list all potential computable dense sets and ways to compute the distance metric between these points and the sets. And then you have this list, and you ask, oh, what is the complexity of those pairs of indices? Pairs of indices so that this corresponds to connected compact spaces and the pair corresponds to homeomorphic ones. Okay, so if you don't care about homeomorphism, just what's the set, what's the complexity of the set of indices for which the completion is connected compact? Like, is that also Pi zero three? It's a lot lower. It's Pi zero three complete, in fact. Is it either pi zero three or sigma? It's one of those. It's really low down. Sigma is one of those. It's really low down. So, the second part of the, you know, in the brackets, it doesn't contribute anything. Okay, thank you. That was my question. So, that really does reflect the homeomorphism complexity. And it's fully relativizable as well. So, if you say, oh, I don't really care about computable, I want to be relative to X, where X knows everything about the universe, or it's random in some sense. It still works. The complexity will remain sigma 1, 1 relative to X. Sigma one one relative to x. Okay. So I have what 10 minutes or something, maybe? Five minutes? Yeah, you can have 10 is fine. Even if it's yeah, 10, 15, it's fine. Yeah, I am going to finish soon enough. Just another example for those who are familiar with degree spectra. There is a connected topological space whose degree spectra. Topological space whose degree spectrum up to homeomorphism is precisely the non-low two degrees. So there is a space which has an X computable, is homeomorphic to an X computable space if and only if X is non-low two. It improves some earlier result, non-low three. And the question here, can you have the Wenner-Sleyman spectrum up to homeomorphic? Spectrum up to homeomorphism. And we have exactly the non-computable degrees as degrees of presentations of some space. And the presentation, if you can do for computably metric, I will be happy. You maybe see any sort of presentation that you can give me. I will be happy enough. But originally, I mean metric is computable. That's an open question. That's an open question. Well, in the compact case, I think it's impossible, but in general, we don't know. Now, the last thing I want to state here is how is it all related to computable Binance spaces? And if you are familiar with the classical computable analysis and the famous or well-known, what is the right word, textbook by Paul Ellen Richards. They talk about computable Banach spaces and applications to undecidability in physics. To undecidability in physics. A computable Banach space is basically a computable Polish space in which the operations, the Banach space operations, are computable as well. And the following question was in personal communication stated by McNickel. If you have a compact Polish K, are the following equivalent. Equivalent. The space of continuous functions on domain k to the real line is linearly isometric, isometric, has a computable Banach representation. And K is homeomorphic to a computable Pauli space, which is basically the same as to say, does Banach stone duality hold computably? And we know that, you know, C. You know, CKR is homeomorphic, it's linearly isometric to some other space of this form, if and only if the domains are homeomorphic. This is the duality. And the question is still open in general, as far as I know. But working with Bajanov and Harrison Trainer, we were able to show that for stone or profinite spaces, the duality is effective. And that is also from the previous equivalent to the Boolean algebra having computable fragmentation. And to finish the talk, McNicol's question is still open in general, but for stone spaces it works. And for instance, we get a strange corollary. If you have a space of this sort, the domain is a stone profinite space, and it has a lot. Space and it has a low flow presentation, then it has to be linearly isometric to a computable Banach space. A big question, how would you even try to do it directly with the space? I wouldn't know what to do, but once you establish this sort of duality, actually sequence of dualities, you can just reduce it to the known result by night and stop from 2000 about Boolean algebras. This is the power of dualities. This is the power of dualities. I think I don't have enough time to talk about computable TDLC groups. There is another duality. I will not talk about it. There is a duality between certain groups and their group points, which are countable objects. And establishing this duality helped us to solve a problem by Willis, who is an expert in computable, in ingest, you know, abstract TDLC groups. I'm going to skip that part and just go straight to thanks. Thank you very much. So, maybe questions in the Sikha dockets? So, I had asked earlier, I think it's a very good question. I had asked earlier about an effective Gelfand duality. Do you think that's going to be as hard as Tim's question about effective Bonach stone duality, or do you expect it to be easier? It's hard to say. I mean, in fact, let's say the elementary stone duality turned out to be more subtle than expected, even that. So you never know. I have no intuition, to be honest. I don't know. Intuition, to be honest. I don't know. It could be anything. Yeah. Asking about like arbitrary C-star algebras or what hypothesis? Well, it has to be separable. Everything has to be separable. Otherwise, it's not clear what to do at all. Because there are definitions that work for non-separable structures, but you know, it's not quite as well established, I would say. So, like, arbitrary, if you have an arbitrary separable. If you have an arbitrary separable C-star algebra, and it has like some computable separate presentation, I guess is that sort of the range of the question you'd be asking about? No, so what I'm saying, so I'm saying, suppose you have an abelian, let's say a unital, abelian C-serial algebra, unital to make life easier, right? So you know by Gelfand duality, it's the continuous functions on a compact space, namely the spectrum. A compact space, namely the spectrum of the C-star algebra. And the question is: for example, does the abelian C-Ster algebra have a computable presentation precisely when the spectrum as a compact space, let's say, is maybe computably compact. I don't know which of your notions. So basically, the question is: do we get any extra information from the C-star operations, right? On top of just the Banx Places. Yeah, it's more, yeah, it's an algebraic. Yeah, it's an algebraic. I mean, you would expect it to help, right? But I don't know. Yeah. Not clear to me. That's a good question, though. I think we have a chance to at least have some partial solutions that would improve the somewhat disappointing case of stone spaces as domains. Right. Yeah. I mean, Right. Yeah. I mean, Gelfand duality is literally an extension of stone duality. Exactly. Yeah. So, but now you have, yeah, you have much more algebraic information to keep track of. I think it would, and my guess is if it worked, I would bet it would relativize too. Yeah, yeah. I would hope that you will have more chances if you have more operations to play with, of course. But, you know. But you know, who knows? Yeah. Sorry, while I'm at it, you could also say the same thing for like abelian von Eumann algebras and probability spaces. Same thing. Is there, right? The abelian. So there are so many dualities. There is also dualities which connect like the stone spaces with the pirate. The stone spaces with iterators, and these are important in non-standard logics. There's so many dualities, and some of them will probably be effective. But also, the question is, it's nice to have a potential application of why do you need the duality. And for me, the driving force has always been like classification problems, like index sets and things like that. But also, I mean, yeah, you never know. Yeah, you know, wouldn't the non-separability of one Neumann algebra and the norm topology be a bit of an issue to talk about? No, it definitely wouldn't be the norm topology. It'd be the two-norm topology. Yeah. You usually want the things to be separable. And as I mentioned earlier, there are approaches to non-separable structures and the effective presentations not quite as well established. Not quite as well established and probably not quite as well behaved. I guess my motivation for asking this is just in general, we don't know very much about which C-Star algebras or von Neumann algebras have computable presentations or even... Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So that would be probably the best way to obtain such. Usually such dualities work nice if you go from like discrete or separable to the space of nodes. Separable to the space of functions on this thing. So, this implication is usually a lot easier. So, just obtaining examples is probably a lot easier than given like the sister algebra reconstructing the domain. That implication usually requires more work in such dualities as far as I understand. So, but yeah. That would give a characterization to a stronger result, not just a sequence of examples. Okay, thank you very much. I think we thanked the speaker again.
