Thank you. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizing committee, especially Mateo. My talk will consist of two parts. One will be presented by file that you see right now on the screen. Another one will be better organized. It was prepared. It was prepared by my collaborator Oslavo Rabetz with my own modifications, so it will be in BIMER. I will speak about two classes of groups. One is a branch group, a special type of groups acting on rooted trees. So, in principle, part of what I will Part of what I will speak about: consense groups acting on rooted trees, more general type of groups. And this is exactly the class of groups that we know as residually finite groups, approximated by finite groups. And second class is class that Yaroslav or Pets and me we call ample groups, and a more known term in topological full. Determine topological full groups is a particular case of ample groups. There is some interaction between two classes. So some groups of branch type are subgroups, say, of topological full groups, but not vice versa because the latter are not rigidly defined. And the main applications of the first class. Of the first class in general to algebra and group and mathematics in general are such topics as intermediate growth, non-elementary amenability, holomorphic dynamics. And this can be continued and continued. And the main application of the second class of ample groups, topological full groups, are they are first of all invariant of minimal count. Invariant of minimal counter systems. I will explain what it means. They are a rich source of simple groups, infinite non-commutative infinite simple groups. They also produce a kind of new plus new series of examples of non-elementary amino groups and have other interesting properties and applications. Interesting properties and applications. Now, like in two columns, I show a little bit more about what relates to the first class. So, first of all, branch groups or weekly branch groups, then groups of parasite type, infinite finally generated torsion groups, then the class of groups that we call self-similar. Groups that we call self-similar are groups generated by finite aptometer, groups of intermediate growth, non-elementary amenability, finitely constrained, iterated monodromic groups, just infinite groups, and so on and so on. So, a lot of interesting terminology associated with the first class. Well, for second class, For second class, so as I already mentioned, there are algebraic invariants of dynamical systems up to so-called three conjugacy. I will explain. Their commutators are simple groups. Again, they are examples, a rich source of examples of non-elementary amenable group. They are highly complicated by a have a factorization into a product of two locally finite. Of two locally finite groups, the so-called factorization probe. And right now, in my talk, we are interested in subgroup structure of this group. And first of all, in information about maximal subgroups, then less known weakly maximal and finitely generated groups. Finally generated subgroups. So three kinds of So, three topics. We will be in the first part of the talk, while the second will concentrate exclusively about this maximum subject. Now, this program, this meeting studies groups of acting on a counter set. And let me, because there are, I hope, many, several young people in. Several young people in the room and maybe online. So, what is a counter set? Counter set has many phases. First of all, the counter set classical construction obtained from interval 0, 1 by dilution of sub-intervals. Now, if you have X finite alphabet consisting of two or more. Of two or more letters, then you can consider space x to the power natural numbers or x to the power integers. So infinite sequences, one-sided infinite sequence in this case, or two-sided infinite sequences, put a discrete topology on X, consider product topology on any of this space. You will get one more. One more space space homeomorphic to a campus. Now, if you consider the group acting on a rooted regular tree or more generally spherically homogeneous rooted tree, then so here I try to draw a binary rooted tree and binary boundary is presented by these dots like. Presented by these dots, like at infinity. So, geometrically, a boundary is a space of the set of infinite paths, a geodesic path starting at root and going to infinity. But for binary, for instance, left zero, right, one, zero, zero, one, and so on. So, it's clear that this boundary has a natural identification with previous space, phase of one-sided infinity sequences. Infinite sequences and again, natural topology converges into counter set. So, in one, in the first part of the talk, counter sets exactly will be a boundary of the tree. Root will act on trees, on rooted trees, and this will induce action on the boundary, action on the counter safe. Space of ends of safety is like in a range. Of Safe is lacking racial skipper just when it was two days ago. So there are many, many ways to find the counter set in mechanics. Now, I will recall you a construction that sometimes is called the mother construction. So this is based on the consideration I came with in 1980, a long time ago, when most of you were not born yet. So let now stem counter set, let us consider the interval 0, 1. But for simplicity, let us delete the diet creation of points. And let us agree that when we write letter P over any sub-interval, then it Any sub-interval, then it means a permutation of two halves, the interval. So left half half goes on the place of right and vice verse. So it's a kind of involution. If you repeat P after P, you get identity map. So P square is identity, but I call this permutation. And if we have a letter I over interval, it means identity transformation. Each point is fixed. So let A be just a transformation given by permutation. While F is defined more complicated, we divide split interval into equal parts, then split the right part in two equal parts by point three over four, then by point seven over eight, and we continue this process of division to the right. And we write sequence. P infinity many times repeated. So this sequence plays a role of genetic code over the DNA. And if you consider F is also element of order two, transformation of order two, if you compose F in this F, you get identity map. And if you consider group generated by these two transformations, it's easy exercise to check that you will get in. To change that, you will get infinite not very inch. Now, let us make the construction a little bit more complicated. Let us additionally to A now build two more transformations B and C following the same division process, but now writing periodic sequence Pi periodically repeated. Periodically repeated and IP periodically repeated. So now we have a genetic code given by these two periodic sequences. And by the way, if you look at this definition, you see that B acts on the left part of the interval as A, acts on the whole interval, and on the right part, it acts as C because you see now sequence I. You see now sequence IP periodic periodicity, and similar for C, if you restrict on the left part, you see identity transformation on the right part, you see B, P I, P I. So. So B elect equals A, C, C equals one, B. We call this risk recursions and this reflects the self-similarity of this model. So this is kind of a So, this is kind of an approach to cell semirellarity by exam. So, loop, which I will denote G0, is a loop generated by this A B C, B and C underlined, because there will be some other B C. If we take a product of this B C, we get P underline given by sequence P P, so it is transformation. Transformation F from previous example and it shows that inside this group J0 we have a group a subgroup generated by A and D, infinite dihedral group. So a group is not torched. But in fact, this is a pretty famous group which was studied in the details not only by me but also And not only by me, but also Anna Erswika's article in Annals of Mathematics 2005. I will mention why. Now we change genetic words. Now we consider again four additionally to A, we consider four transformations by given by these three periodic sequences of period three in this type with a denote G plus group gene. The note G plus a group generated by 4. Now D is not anymore product of B and C as was in previous example. But what? But if you take product of all of them, you will get again F, our transformation F. So again, the group generated by these four transformations contains infinite. contains infinite rayetal rule and so is not a toxic is not toxon we call it over as also maybe it will be later denoted in this way g italic and a final example from this in this series now again we have an ABCD but D again is product of B and C D again is product of B and C. And now instead IIP, we consider P P I, periodic sequence, then PIP IPP. And now we get what I denote this talk in this way. And this is called the first group associated with my name. Sorry, but we have to specify about which group we will talk. Group with talk and it is torsion group, it is now infinite torsion group. So, at that time, I was looking for infinite finite degenerated torsion groups, and this was not really the best, but the most elegant example I found at that time. All of them have these features of self-similarity. And by the way, generator status from previous example: if you multiply B and D. If you multiply B and D tilde, you will get B from this example. And similarly, you can get all other generators of this first group. So it means that the first group is inside over group. And on the base of the first group, I constructed uncountably many groups, geo omega, omega, infinite ternary. Infinite ternary sequences and also uncountably many overgroups also give what we call or oracle oracle sequence that determines the group omega. And as I already told, the last example is happened to be example of an infinite torsion to group, so group of precise type. There was a very famous open There was a very famous open site problem. It was solved by Olot in 1964. A stronger, more stronger, more complicated version was solved in Norgo and Janin, 1967. Now we have several constructions of supercite type. This is among existing. So in this construction, we hide at least two ideas. One idea of self-similarity. Of self-similarity, which I explained, another idea of contracting, which led to the proving or that group intermediate growth. I see that time is running weekly. I will skip discussion of this, as well as discussion of the second example in my note of 1980. Another group now generated acting on the square generated by Generated by two elements of order four, again, infinite to group. And if we go to the model this division in interval, it can be the same group can be obtained dividing four equal pieces, and A is just a cyclic permutation of all of them, while B is given by recursion A. A at this coordinate i here, a again here, b go back to b itself. So, this recursion for b is this one. And now, if we divide not by four, but by p, p prime number, and again, make a cyclic permutation of p equal pieces, while b given by brief recursion p equals a a inverse. B equals A, A, and W, then once if there is a place for them, and at the end, B, we get what is known as a bookta-CTP group. So now two generated infinite torsion pig. And all these examples are particular case of what is called now a GGS groups. A terminology was suggested by Barnes Black. Suggested by Barnesblock. So Gregor Chukuktasivi type groups. A general definition is like that. A is always a cyclic permutation. B is given by risk recursion. A to the power epsilon one, a to the power epsilon two, and so on. The last, we go back to b these exponents are elements. are elements between zero and p minus one. They must be not equal to zero. And the sum of them should be zero mod p. This gives you torsion, torsion GGS group. Without this absorption, you get GGS mod torsion. And GGS groups were studied by many mathematicians. In the past, In the past, my collaborators, colleagues Bartojin, Nikrasiewicz, Sunic, Chikirini Silverstein, Tatiana Meim, Niebed, Sartyuk, Kermova Pontarenko, and the younger generation, Dominique Van Core, Paul Henry Lehmann, Alejandro Tarido, Rachel Skipper, Gustavo Fernandez Alcabar, and so on. So this is pretty popular class of books. Popular class of groups. Some results from the past. So, intermediate growth. Given a finitely generated group, you can consider a function gamma of n, a function of natural argument, counting number, counting the number of elements in the group of lengths. Of elements in the group of length not greater than n length with respect to generating self, and people are interested in growth of this function and growth goes to infinity. And it so happens that if growth is not faster than polynomial, then the group is virtually important. This is a very, very famous and great uh theorem of chroma. Great theorem of growing. Then there was a question of Milner if there are groups of intermediate growth between polynomial and exponential. Free group for free group growth is exponential and every finite generated group is a quotient of free group, so growth cannot be super exponential. So I gave an answer to this question in 1984, yes. four yes namely the first group has intermediate growth my first upper and lower bound were very far from to be optimal but now we know that basically growth with this group is as exponent n to the power alpha where alpha is this number so lesser than one and by the way so far this part Far, despite many, many examples of groups of intermediate growth were created. Still, there is no example that will be this one. In the sense, the growth will be smaller than growth of this group, but super polynomial, not polynomial. So, this is one of the challenging problems in the theory of cross-functions on groups. While for the group G0, the Well, for the group G0 that we studied, we earlier showed that the lower bound is this one, upper bound is this one for every epsilon. So this group G0 grows much faster, much faster than the first group. And recall, it was mentioned that Fez group is a subgroup and overgroup, so overgroup has a gross stuff. Faster than the first group, and in fact, much faster. So, we have here three examples of groups of intermediate groups. And this was kind of beginning, beginning of the theory of groups of intermediate groups. Now, the groups, yeah, I define groups acting on interval 0, 1, but you can easily translate. But you can easily translate these actions into actions on binary rooted tree. Just this division to the right and to the left, you can mimic on the binary rooted tree and realize them as a group acting by automorphisms on binary rooted tree. And so, as I mentioned, this construction gave birth to several classes of groups. And classes of groups, branch groups, alsemil groups, and so on. And these groups have numerous relations to dynamical systems, spectral theory of graphs and groups, random thread and current operator, and so on. For instance, group G0 that we started again has relation to the Morse system. It's embeds in topological full group generated by subshift, which arises from Which arises from Morse substitution. While other two examples are related to this substitution, which is called, which the corresponding subshift is called periodic doubling system. Morse system covers period doubling system two to one everywhere. So there are many, many interesting connections, but now let's go to the main The main form. Accidentally, these three groups happen to belong to the class of branch groups. So what are branch groups? A group G is branch if it has a phaseful level transitive action by automorphism on a spherical homogeneous rooted tree. T depending on m bar, where m bar is sequence of natural numbers greater or equal to a branch index. So this sequence shows how it gives a branch index for vertices of levels. First level, zero level M1, past level M2, and so on. All vertices of the same level have the same branch number. So this is why. Branch number. So, this is why it's called spherically homogeneous rooted tree. So, root must act on such tree phase with altomorphism, root a fixed point. So, permutation happens only on levels. Veticis of levels are permuted. But that's not all, not all story. And additionally, for each M for each M For each n. Index of rigid stabilizer of level n inside g must be fine. So risk n is a rigid stabilizer of level n. Now what is that? What is that? It is explained here. First of all, we have to understand what is a rigid stabilizer of vertex. Now Of vertex. Now, instead n-level number, we put u vertex. So in our tree, we take a vertex u. We consider a sub-tree tu be the root at this vertex. And we consider subgroup of G consisting of those elements that act trivially outside the tree. So only non-triviality is allowed below u. This is the Low view. This is a rigid stabilizer of vertex u. It can be in general, it can be trivial. But okay, but now by rigid stabilizer of level n, we mean group, subgroup generated by rigid stabilizers of vertices belonging to level n. Absolute value of u means level, level n. And because all these vertices belong to the same level, These vertices belong to the same level, it is easy to understand that they commute because support of actions are disjoint. And so, here we deal just with internal direct product of subgroups inside group. And because we assume in our definitions that the group has a level transitive, all these rigid stabilizers of fatises of the same level, they are pairwise conjugate. The conjugate. So here we have a direct product of focus of the same. Okay, such definition. And yeah, maybe I forget to add a slide that we call group weekly branch. If again, level transitive action, but we only Action, but we only declare that the rigid stabilizers are non-trivial and hence infinite. It's easy to understand. And that non-triviality implies that they are infinite. So not necessarily a finite index. And one more definition. We say that G is a regular branch over subgroup K. If it acts on a diregular, first of all, it must act. First of all, it must act on a diracular rooted tree. So, this branch index sequence of MN should be constant. So, binary tree, ternary tree, or whatever. Here is picture of binary tree. There must be a subgroup K of finite index in G with the property that K kind of geometrically contains direct product of D copies of K. So D. So, D equal to like it means that we can consider group K cross K, so Kx here, Kx on the whole tree. But because a regular tree is a very similar object, left sub-tree or right sub-tree is canonically isomorphic to the whole tree, so we can transfer action of K on the whole tree to action on left part. Two actions on the left part on the right part, we can arrange a direct product of such two actions. This direct product not necessarily will be a group, it will be some group of automorphisms of the tree, but not necessarily subgroup of G. And moreover, and even and of course it could be not subgroup of K, but we insist, we insist that we have subgroup K of finite. Have subgroup k of finite index in g that contains this product k cross k and then we can alternate we can repeat this this factor contains k cross k this contains so we can now direct product of four quotes of k of eight corpus this is a regular branch structure and the first group that has this structure okay in this case K in this case is a normal closure in the group in the first group of element AB or commutator AB, which is the same as AB squared because all generators are integrations. Brange groups are particularly important because they constitute one of three classes on which splits the class of just infinite groups. Groups is just infinite. Groups groups is just infinite if it is infinite, but every proper quotient is finite. So, infinite cyclic group, infinite dahedral group, just infinite SL3Z is just infinite, but many branch groups are just infinite. And the following theorem, which I proved in 2000, but I use I use the result of John Wilson. So, basically, this is our joint theorem that tells us that the class of just infinite groups splits naturally into three subclasses. One is the branch, just infinite groups, and the fact is that not every branch group is just infinite, but in a sense, it is always just infinite, every proper closure. Independent, every proper portion of branch group is venturically a b and the above examples of groups, including Kasirk groups, most of GGS group, they are just infinite. Well, another option is that the group contains subgroup H of finite index, which is direct product of finitely many copies of certain group L. This L is either infinite simple or hereditary just infinite. all hereditary just infinity like z d infinity s of pre z and hereditary just infinite just means that group is residually finite and not only the whole group but every subgroup of finite index is just infinite so the property to be hereditary just in unit is hereditary property when passing to subgroups of finite index now on subgroups of arrangements Okay, arrangements as I told we are interested in maximal, weekly maximum, and finitely generated subgroups. And maximal subgroups is a big story in group theory and in finite group theory for classification of finite simple groups, study of maximal subgroups. Study of maximal subgroups was extremely important topic, and there is a beautiful theorem of Ponan Squad, which gives complete description of maximal subgroups of a symmetric group Sn on finite set. But we are interested in this maximal subgroups in infinite groups, and there were a few. And there were a few works by Margulis and Seupere who showed that there are uncountably many maximal subgroups of infinite index in a free group of finite array. Of course, there could be a maximum subgroup of finite index, but we mostly are interested in the case of infinite groups, maximal subgroups of infinite index, and they have. Index and they show that there are many of them in the three groups. People like here last and his collaborators, they extended this result for Dinia groups. Dimitros of Chuk found very interesting examples of Maximus appropriate in the Richard famous Richard Thompson groups and this was continued this study was continued by Mark. This study was continued by Mark Zapier and his collaborators. Okay, in around 1990, I met Brian Hartley on Baikal Lake and we were in the same room, Brian Hartley, famous theory specialist, unfortunately, passed away around 95. So he asked me: are there maximal subgroups of infinite index? Subgroups of infinite index in this first group. And he didn't tell me, but later I understood that this question is motivated by Kaplanski conjecture regarding the groups for which the Jacobson radical of the group algebra of finite elements coincide with the augmentation ideal. I was not able to answer the question, but the Juncker at that time. But the younger at that time, basically PhD student, Ekaterina Kervova, found a beautiful argument to answer no. So every subgroup of finite index is every maximal subgroup in this case is a finite index of index two. Okay, and there are seven subgroups of index two. They are maximal. No maximal subgroups of infinite index. Then Bundarenko, and as I told And as I told Face group and the G0, Auger group, they are examples of branch groups. So now we discuss maximal subgroup of infinite index in branch group. And Bandarenko showed that there are branch groups. He was student in Texas in M and he showed that there are branch groups with maximum subgroups of infinite index. Really recently Dominique Frankel Dominique Francalore and Alejandro Harrido showed that some of the groups of this uncountable family G omega that I have mentioned only now I change G notation for G, sorry for that have maximal subgroup of infinite index in particular the group G0 that we studied has such subgroups. So you see a very interesting unusual situation of very close groups and both of intermediate growth Of intermediate growth, one torsion, another not one has no maximum suburb, infinite index, another has. So it shows that the class is interesting, rich. And what is interesting, yeah, and the Mik and Alejandra, they, in cases they study, they explicitly describe all maximum. All maximum sub-mini index and showed there are only categorically many of them. So, a general phenomenon so far is that we know in all known examples, if I'm not mistaken, we have only countably many subgroup, maximum subgroup of independent india in studied branch groups. Okay, so will be a Will be good if somebody will present examples in this uncountable way. Now, a weekly maximum subgroup. A subgroup H in G in infinite loop is weekly maximum if index of this subgroup is infinity, but every larger subgroup K containing H but not concited has finite input. So H. A finite index. So H is of any index, but its maximal subgroup with respect to this property. Now, standard application of Tsormelema shows that in finitely generated group, every subgroup is contained in maximal in every infinite, finitely generated group, every subgroup of infinite index is contained in the weekly maximal subgroup. In the weekly maximal subgroup, and if G is an infinite finitely generated group, then G can be mapped onto just an infinite group. So these are three easy properties, but important properties. And now let G be branch acting on spherically homogeneous rooted tree, X be boundary of the tree. We take a point of the boundary and we consider. A point of the boundary, and we consider the stabilizer of this point in a group G, which we denote H here. And it was observed in 2000 by Laurent Parton and Me that for every point of the boundary and for every not only branch group, but even weekly branch group, this stabilizer is weakly maximal sum. And moreover, for different points, different points have. points different points have different rigid stabilizers sorry different points of the boundary have different stabilizers it means that the action of a group on its boundary is what is absolutely non-tree different points have different stabilizers i will use this remark later but surprisingly again pervova constructed the best example of binary generated weakly maximum subroutine Victim maximum subgroup, the first group. I forget to mention that all these stabilizers are infinitely generated. So here we have infinitely generated Victim maximum subgroup, but in fact, the first group has also finitely generated subgroups. And Bora Bolly Green and Tiananmen in 2016 showed Showed presented new constructions of weakly maximal subgroups in branch groups. While one of the recent results from Dominique shows that in case of branch group, stabilizers of different points are isomorphic. So they are distinct as subjects. They do not assign, but they are. But they are isomorphic. So, again, despite the reconstructions of uncountably many weakly maximal subgroups, up to isomorphism at the moment, there is no statement telling that there are uncountably many pairwise not isomorphic, not isomorphic, bigly maximal subs in page. And now about finally. And now about finitely generated groups. In 2002, with John Wilson, we proved that every infinite finitely generated subgroup, the first group, is abstractly commensurable with the whole group. So two groups are abstractly commensurable if they have subgroups of finite index that are isomorphic. Moreover, the group is a subgroup separable. Subgroup separable, it means that it is close in profinite topology, or what is the same, it is intersection of subgroup of finite index, and generalized wet problem is algorithmically solved. So, the group is called a subgroup separable if every finitely generic subgroup is closed in profinite topology, and this property is known as property learning. Not many groups have this. Not many groups have this problem. Now, in 2008, we developed the idea from this article from Wilson with Tatiana and Nibede. We showed that every finitely generated subgroup in PES group has block subgroup of finite index. And so, what is a block subgroup? We assume that we have a group G, which is a regular branch of a subgroup A. Of the subgroup A and we call B a block subgroup of G if first of all B abstractly is isomorphic to direct product of finitely many copies of K. But these factors, they can come in the following way. Either we consider a set of independent vertices, meaning none of them is below another, and put Is below another and put the independent factors K inside using the fact that group is a regular branch. K. We discuss this. But there could be also copies isomorphic to K, which are diagonal type. So we have K here, K here, K here, but we arrange kind of diagonal subgroup in the product of three copies of K. So this block group consists of product of this independent case and Independent case and dional type case. And recently, with Franco, Dieman, and Magnipeta, we extended this result to torsion GGS groups. So every finite degenerate subgroup has a block subgroup of finite index. And we believe that the result could be used to prove learn property, membership. And so on. One interesting ingredient of this study is the so-called primitivity. And I will switch now to the second part of my talk where primitivity will be mentioned. But let me finish this part of the talk by the open question. Okay, take first group or G0 overgroup. G0 overgroup so we know that there are subgroups separable. Every finitely generated subgroup is close in profinite topology. Now, let us take several such groups and product with them. Will be this product close in profinite topology? Not now. Okay, now I have to switch to another. Another file. And now, a second part of my talk. Maximum subgroups of ample topological functions. And it is based on joint work with Zeros Law programmes, I conduct in Texas. Let X be a counter set. Be a counter set. You know that the topology counter set is generated by clopen subsets. Klopen means both closed and open. Homeo X will denote group of homeomorphism. We say that homeomorphism F is piecewise an element of a group G. If there exist co-pensets V1. Copen sets V1, Vn, forming a partition of X, and elements Hy and Hn of the group G, such that restriction of this F on each piece of partition is the same as restriction of corresponding element HI on this piece. So it means that our F locally acts as elements and some element of. And some element of the group. We denote F of G as the set of all homomorphisms of this sort, and this happened to be also a group. And we call this group the amplification of G. So with each group acting by homeomorphism on the counter set, we associate another group, a larger group, its general larger group, amplification. Group amplification, but if it so happens that this f of g coincides with g, then we call g ample ample or fully amplified. And the term ample group was introduced by Krieger in 1978. Now, some elements in this group, just to imagine what are the elements you can have in chief. Suppose we have f element in again, the group of one of G, and U, a clopen subset, such that its image F of U is disjoint from U. So we have U, F of U is dejoint. Then we can define a generalized two side or transposition of sets. So a map. So, a map which sends you by F to this to write by F in West and the trivia outside. We denote this data UF. This is in volution element of order two. And this element belongs to the Mp2 example of element of order two, which source examples. Sorry. Sorry, so yeah. Yeah. Now if we apply previous definition of I mean amplification to the cyclic group. So if you have T, just a simple homeomorphism, it generates a cyclic group. Its powers, positive and negative iterations, can be viewed as action of cyclic group. Can be viewed as action of cyclic group. And then we can apply previous definition, and this time to get amplification of this cyclic group, which is called topological full groups, usually denoted in this way, double bracket of T. And the fact is that it consists of homomorphism, a counter set of the form that S applied to point X is. To point x is some power integer power nu of t. This nu depends on x, and this function nu from x to z is a continuous function. And because we deal with a counter set, a continuous function takes only finitely many values. So this function is given by partition of country, so on and finitely. By partition of country zone, and finally, many pieces on each of them, this cycle nu takes a constant value. The topological full group is always countable as there are only countably many clock n subsets. And obviously, if we use T or T in best, we get the same logical. Now Jordana, Putnam and Skau, who initiated study of this topological pool group, they showed that they are complete algebraic invariants of dynamical systems of the type Tx, so X counterset T homomorphism, this pair is called dynamical system. Pair is called dynamical system or topological dynamical system up to flip conjugacy. Two transformations T1 and T2 acting on spaces X1, X2 are said to be conjugate if there is a homeomorphism F between them, which conjugates this transformation. Now, flip conjugacy means that T1 is a topologically conjugate. Topologically contribute either to t2 or inversion. So very important part is that because this wonderful invariant of lip conjugacy in the abstract counterpoint group, topological group associated with preservation. Now, important Important groups that we can involve in study: stabilizer of the point. This already appears. The set stabilizer of a subset. So group of elements which preserve Y as a set. One can consider also a point-wise stabilizer, but for my talk, I will not use point-wise stabilizer, just set stabilizer. And finally, And finally if you have excuse me if you have a partition of a counter set in clop M subsets, then a stabilizer of this partition consists of those elements of the group that permute map elements of the partition onto another and not so permute permute. permute permute atoms acting as additionally inside inside maybe I will skip discussion I already mentioned that weekly branch group act on the boundary of the rooted tree in an absolutely non-clear way meaning different points have different stabilizers and using this and a map which associates to a point the stabilizer Is to a point the stabilizer, you get a map from a control set to the space of subroots. An invariant measure on a control set now becomes an invariant random sub, a popular topic of the study, and the ramatification of absolute non-cleanness, total non-freeness, extreme non-cleanness, absolute non-cleanness, perfect non-cleanness, and so on. This notion where I used to do until And this notion were used to do uncountably many erodic irasis on branching with the branch groups by this mathematician and construct uncountably many of the compounds of characters by R temple and this peak work in progress. But now let's go to another definition, rigid stabilizer. We already had a rigid stabilizer, but now we have a subset Y in X, and by rigid stabilizer we mean Apply they mean the subgroup consisting of those elements that fix every point outside Y. In case when group G is ample, the rigid stabilizer of a clock set U will be denoted G U and called the local sub of G. Okay, so we have rigid stabilizers denoted in this way open subsets elements that act. set elements that act trivially outside of pen set. Now, okay, we know what is maximal subgroups. Theorem of non-squat was mentioned. And in this theorem, partition of subgroups of symmetric group into three subclasses, intransitive, imprimitive, and primitive, play essential role. And now I will state, and this will be the end of my talks, a few theorems. And there will be some analogy in our results with this theorem of Nam Squat, but we don't have complete classification. Okay, so transitivity will be replaced by minimality. Minimality group acts minimally if each orbit is a Each orbit is dense, or equivalently, there is no invariant close subset different from an empty set and the whole space. No invariant closed subset. And now, first theorem, let G be an ample group that acts minimally on comparison. Suppose H is a maximal subgroup of G. Then H must be is a stabilizer of some subset Y, of some closed subset Y, not empty, not X. And moreover, the induced action of this stabilizer on Y is minimum. Okay. And the conditions of the stabilizer of closed set X minimal event. Closed set x minimally when restricted to i implies that y belongs to one of three classes: finite set contained in a single orbit of g, infinite set nowhere dense in x, and Lopez set. So, three options for y in theorem one. Theorem two states the following: now we have ample root that has no finite orbits. Finite orbits. Suppose Y is a finite non-empty subset of X. Then the stabilizer of this Y is a maximal subgroup of G if and only if Y is contained in a single orbit of G. And this condition no finite organs obviously hold for topological full groups associated with minimum counter systems. And now to treat stabilizers of infinite To treat stabilizers of infinite closest, we need another assumption, namely, G ample group has to act minimally on X and to possess another property that we call property E. For any Lopez sets U1, U2, that overlap the local subgroup corresponding to a union must be generated by a union of local subgroups. And theorem tells us that if G is ample group acting minimally and having property E, suppose Y is an infinite closed set that is nowhere dense in X, then the stabilizer of Y is a maximal subgroup of G if and only if it acts minimally when restricted to Y. And we can build uncomfortable. And we can build uncountably many examples of this sort of pure and poor states. Now, about partition. One more theorem. G ample group act minimally has property E suppose U is a clopen set different from empty set and X then stabilizer of partition now we have partition into Of partition now, we have partition into subset u and complement u is a maximal subgroup of g if u cannot be mapped onto complement by element of amplitude, then stabilize of u is the same as stabilizer of partition. Otherwise, stabilizer of u is a subgroup of index 2, so is not matching. And finally, now we consider the case when Uh, we consider the case when a counter space is partitioned in arbitrary number of loopen subsets, then the stabilizer of the partition is a max signal subgroup if and only if it induces action on this, if its induced action of the set is transitive. And here again, we require minimality and property and the fact is that topological full. And the fact is that the topological full group of minimal counter system has property here. This follows from the results of Giordano, Moscow, and Matui. I have enough time to talk about this. Thank you for your attention. I'm done. Thank you very much, Lama, for your talk. I don't know if you heard the clap. We clapped here, but thank you. Are there any questions here in the audience? Here in the audience? Yes, one second. Thank you for the talk. I have a question. What happens if one considers the topological full group of some of the classical branch groups in the sense that the group is defined that in for each element of the counter set there is a neighborhood on which the element acts as one of the elements of, let's say, your first group. Yeah, this is a definition. Is the definition that I started in the second part of the talk? You have a group of homeomorphism and you amplify and you get ample group or topological full group generated by given action. For my group, so what interests you about this topological full group generated by the fastest group? What I just speaking is you want to know what. You want to know what is known? What is known about this group? For example, is it finally generated? For example, honestly, I had a complete understanding of this group 15 years ago. Now I forgot a little bit, but basically enough is interesting. So, as far as I remember, it is not finitely generated. And the group, this amplification. This amplification doesn't get any new interesting property. Still, it is amenable, not elementary amenable in this case. We don't have such a theorem in general situation. But in this case, particular case, this amplification can be completely described, and the structure is clear, only I don't remember exactly what is the structure then. So, this will not give rise to other examples of finitely generated aminable simple groups? No, is this case? Yeah. And for topological full groups of minimal subshifts, do you know whether they can be embedded into the group of asynchronous automata? Very interesting, nice question. No. Yeah, there are many, many open questions around. Many, many open questions around that, and you formulated one of them. So, there is this group of rational homeomorphisms of a comfort set invented in paper by Sochansk in the Krasovic and Me in 2000, a kind of survey on automata group. You can see the synchronous automata and shows that the group of invertible synchronous asynchronous automata doesn't depend on the alphabet and call it. On the alphabet and call it a group of regional memories of the counter set. And now the Colin Bleak and others, they proved several wonderful results about impendability of various groups, hyperbolic. I don't remember exactly in this group, but for topological full group at the moment, I'm not aware of any result. Aware of any result, and if somebody will be able to push something in this direction, it will be very interesting. Okay. Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions here in the audience? Yes? One second. Thank you for the talk. You mentioned that there are branch groups which have maximal subgroups of infinite index. Is one of these examples a Is one of these examples a torsion group? Yeah, unfortunately, I'm not ready to answer this question. One has to look at paper by Francau and Harito. But most probably answer is no. Most probably an answer is no. Okay, thank you. Okay, so maybe if there are other questions here, I can ask another question. So you mentioned this maximal that the stabilizers of partitions in the homeomorphisms group, these are maximal subgroups. Do you know if this give some interesting examples of groups? The stabilizers of partitions. The stabilizers of partitions that you mentioned, the last, the very last theorems that you mentioned. Yeah, yeah. Because this reminds me somehow of the you know, like primitive subgroups inside that the non-unscot theorem. So this is about different nature than the other ones that you mentioned. So maybe this actually can give rise to interesting groups. In fact, you see so in this So there are three classes intransitive, in primitive, and primitive. And intransitive is replaced by minimality. In the statement, in primitivity, petitions. But for primitive, nothing was said, except that in the first part, I That in the first part, I end the first part by the claim that there is an interesting property called tree primitivity that play important role in this last theorem of the first part by Frankauer and Lehmann. Action of a group on a rooted tree is tree primitive if the only invariant partition of the boundary in clopet set. The boundary in clopet sets is the partition coming from partition corresponding to level n of the tree. If you which level, you can consider partition into cylinder sets, parts of the boundary below vertices of given a level, standard sequence of partition. So if there is no other partitions of the boundary in Clappens subset which is invariant. Subset which is invariant with respect to group action. So we call this tree primitivity and it plays an important role in the last proofing of the last theorem of the first part. For this, for maximality, we don't have results which correspond to the primitive case in the onanous theory. If a group stated in the last theory, In the last theorem, six maximal group will be interesting. I don't know, but I have to emphasize that Schreier graphs associated with the weakly maximal subgroups in branch groups, like first-free groups that we studied. They are very interesting graphs. They have a linear structure, and a careful study of them led to many, many discoveries, the connection to random. Discoveries, the connection to random Schroeden operator and so on. While maximum subgroup formed by South Juk in the Richard Thompson group, navy stabilizer of the middle point of the interval, maximum subgroup of infinite index, and its scale graph drawn by Sochu, which is a pre-like. It's contributed by wonderful studies around the Thomson group, in particular. Around the Thomson group, in particular, proving that it has non-new property by Kamanovich and so on. So, who knows? Maybe these maximal subroofs that appear in last theorems, they also lead to interesting Shreya graphs and interesting groups. We just started with the Yaroslav study, and everybody welcome to join us and so on. Yeah, but right now I can. Right now, I cannot claim that this stabilizes a wonderful group and important by some properties. Okay, but it sounds interesting to study, absolutely. Okay, so if there are no other questions, I propose to thank Zlava again for the nice talk. Thank you for your attention. Sorry, it was too much, but it was okay. It was good. You were able to get started. Great stuff. Okay, thank you so much, then. Yes, see you later. Bye. Bye.
