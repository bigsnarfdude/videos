Hello everyone, if you haven't chatted already, I'm Paneeb. I'm a PhD student working with Matt Osman at the University of Toronto. We talked about one of her PhD projects, which ties in very nicely with Yellow's talk about these sort of adoptive strategies and stuff. But before, quickly, the work that I did was at University of Toronto, which operates at that. That has traditionally been home of the Buran Venda. Home of the Buran vendor, the Senaka, and the Mrs. Service of the Credit. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to help work on that. Coming to the talk, I was trying to sort of see how to motivate and sort of tie up the things that I'm going to talk about. And very often, I keep going back to this idea of price equation that was introduced in 1970 by George R. Price, which everyone mostly is familiar with, who I quickly sort of says that. Quickly, sort of, says that a change in the average frequency of any sort of character, whether it be phenotypic characters or sort of gene frequency, can be given by these, can be determined by this covariance between relative fitness and the average character of the individual's offsprings, which is sort of the selection term and then sort of the transmission bias, which in classic cases corresponds to sort of mutations and so on. Of mutations and so on and so forth. Around the 1980s, 1990s, people started looking at the, in conjunction with relative fitness, what happens to the absolute fitness. And at this intersection of relative and absolute fitness lies the field of evolutionary rescue that Lindy already alluded to in her talk, but briefly, it's the ability of a population to escape extinction through. Escape extinction through adaptation, provided that these adaptive mutants can escape stochastic extinction just due to chance events. And continuing the rich culture of branching processes, people have used those to compute the probability that a population can be rescued. Key things there end up being the standard genetic variation, so how many mutants are already there in the population, and how many are generated during these. Generated during these after the harsh change in its environment. So, this depends on the frequency of the mutants in the standard genetic variation, and the de novo mutation splits down into two important factors, which is how much of the wild type that's detrimental in the new environment is there, and at what rate is it declining. And together, this sort of gives the pole from which mutations can be generated for this change. At the same time, sort of switching a bit very early on in. Switching a bit very early on in my undergrad, one of the first theory papers that I actually read in evolutionary theory was by Troy De and Russell Pondrinsky, which proposes this unified way of incorporating these genetic and non-genetic inheritance components. And so they extend this price equation kind of a model to sort of incorporate a genetic and a non-genetic component that is coupled because of the fitness acting on the sort of the joint thing. And one of the things that stuck with me with this was that these sort of non-genetic components can have transient effects that don't, sort of, the equilibrium is the same, but have some sort of initial effects that are different. And at the same time, can have long-term effects that affects both sort of phenotypic and affects genetic variation as well as phenotypic variation. These transient effects and long-term effects become important when looking at abuse study rescue because these Looking at evolutionary rescue because these transient effects are sort of adaptation is happening at these rapid scales immediately after change. And so these transient effects can lead to more extinction. And once the population is extinct, there's not much that can be done. And these long-term effects are important for determining what the standing genetic variation looks like. And while trying to sort of look at how to incorporate these two aspects, I came across this series of sort of very nice I came across this series of sort of very nice population epigenetic models from Hamas Spencer's lab that was work done by Jemma Geogegan. And sort of just to sort of give the complexity of these sort of simple models of population epigenetics, it's sort of how many equilibria are there and there's sort of some characteristic of the epigenetic phenomena. And sort of you can see there's a lot of variation through it. As well as people have looked at sort of adaptive random works with these epigenetic type of mechanisms. And so I was interested. And so I was interested, a lot of this work in these non-genetic inheritance looks at the sort of relative fitness contribution kind of things. And I was interested in sort of combining these two aspects and to sort of see what's the effect of these components. And I took this transgenerational epigenetics as a starting point. And so just a quick overview of the I started with a very I didn't start with this, but I'm going to expect a talk with this as with a very sort of simple With a very sort of simple setup of these, just a genetically capital A, and you have an epigenetically modified version of it that's capital B. These modifications occurred at rate M and sort of during vertical transmission, these epigenetic modifications can be lost. And so that's sort of this rate T. And so this is very similar to just a two-allele model. And the key difference is that these epimutations and these reset during vertical. And these reset during vertical transmissions happen at very high rates. So, of the orders of, it's mathematically of the order of one. And so, that's like the key effect, and I wanted to kind of understand what that does. And also, epigenetics is this very fascinating mechanism, and so they have a lot of weird things happening in them. And so, that's sort of sometimes a bit too spicy. I'm going to talk about one of those things as well. And I, for this talk, And for this talk, at least, I'm sticking to the weak selection regime. That's very just to be clear. Weak selection, you need as small correct one or as small compared to other as compared to one. And so yeah, and so simp model before change, we look at a sort of a Wright-Fisher model with relative fitness. Fisher model with relative fitness, where you have 1 and 1 minus s as their relative fitnesses. And then post-change, you have the absolute model through branching processes with absolute fitness. The population is declining at right R. And these epigenetic de-modified allele has an advantage given by S-POST. And those are sort of the simple parameters. Turns out that even though there are M and T, and you can run a bunch of them, the effective run a bunch of them. The effective effect on rescue depends on this rate m over m plus t. And I'll talk a bit about how that comes up. So I plotted the rescue probability around this. And interestingly, found this very sharp point of transition where it goes from sort of almost complete extinction to almost 100% chance of survival. And just to get up what's happening, in the standing genetic variation, because we're assuming sort of selection is weak, the leading organization. The leading order term is m over m plus t, which is at the rate at which things are being generated, and the selection is sort of a perturbation term in a strategy multiplier. Post-change, because of this high influx and sort of back and forth between these things, the growth rates become quite blended. And so both of them end up sort of declining on average at the same rate, which is given by those averages weighted by their sort of frequencies. And so you see this minus R plus this weighting term. minus R plus this weighting term on the selection coefficient. And this is different from the genetic rescue case where the genetic neutrons would have had this sort of S minus R thing whereas the others would have sort of different thing. And so you can then compute the probability, then compute this sort of critical transition point is when this sort of goes from less than one to greater than one. You can also compute the probabilities of rescue and you see those match up over here. But and usually, this is also the case for the genetic case, but you don't see such a sharp transition. And the reason for that is this M over M plus T, one, increases the initial amount of standing epigenetic variation that is, and it also affects the rate at which those can spread in the population simultaneously. And so, this is this two-fold effect of it, which leads to this extra sharp transition point. And so the other thing I was curious about was about these sort of points which were there. And now I'll come to what the size of the circle means. And so I picked one of those points and looked at the simulation. See some of the classical things of you declining and the population being recovering from that decline due to an increase in this epigenetic variant. But continuing to run that, the population sort of reaches, recovers, but because you Recovers, but because you still have this high forward and backward mutations, B never reaches fixation, and so there's a lot of fluctuation happening at B. And so these fluctuations keep continuing, and if by chance it goes extinct, it goes extinct after that. And so you can imagine that a higher value of M and T, even if those ratios are slow, would lead to more fluctuations over here, and therefore more and more of these extinctions post-recovery of the population. Recovery of the population, and that's what these values are. So the size of the circle is m plus t is representative of it, and you can see that low, higher the value of m plus t, the higher is the chance that the population went extinct even post-recovery. And so keeping this sort of intuition in mind of these different things that are happening, I wanted to look at a model where there is both an epigenetic and a genetic sort of thing. So you have two different Sort of things. So you have two different ways to adapt to this new population. And so before, similar-ish model, so before change, you have relative fitnesses, but now you have two potential variants, one epigenetic, one genetic. The A's and B's should be flipped. But basically, the genetic variant has this fitness 1 minus S, the epigenetic variants has 1 minus R. Epigenetic variants has 1 minus alpha times S. And this is because a lot of the times the epigenetic variants don't exactly have the exact same phenotype as the genetic variants. And so this is what I call as the imperfection coefficient. And so when, so here now you have two strategies. So the intuition is that as long as more of these rescue phenotypes can be generated, you should have more of rescue. And if you plot that over M over M plus T, when When, say, the epigenetic way is indeed perfect, so both A and B have exactly similar things, you do end up seeing that. And so, these are the dots of the simulated values, and this is sort of the analytical values for those rescue probabilities, and you see sort of that increase and more of those rescue happening because of that, sort of two sort of strategies. However, when this alpha is not exactly one, Is not exactly one, so when there is imperfection, you sort of see the opposite effect. And that even though these bees, though they're not as good as the rescue mutant, they're still much better than the wild type, but they still are having a detrimental effect on the rescue probabilities. In fact, it's worse than when there was no epigenetic variant in that model. And so here there are a bunch of different things that happen because of these imperfections. Because of these imperfections. One is when this alpha is not one, in the wild type population, B does slightly better than A. So it reduces the genetic stable variance in the population. And so that's the rescue bystanding genetic variation is decreased. On the other hand, you have that they also sort of reduce the amount of wild type compared to the genetic variant because of this high M value going into B. And so that's another thing by which these rescue by denote. Another thing by which these rescue by de novo mutations is reduced. However, it does decrease the rate at which the wild types are declining. So you can then produce more variants because of this lower growth decline. And so this is a competition between these three things going on. And as it becomes more and more imperfect, this increase is insufficient to compensate for the decreases in the other cases. Coming to the last couple of minutes, I want to talk about that sort of spike. Minutes, I want to talk about that sort of spicy kind of epigenetic models that are there. And so it's a lot of fascinating things happen, and one sort of phenomena is shifting to a diploid kind of model is a scenario where epigenetic modifications only happen when they're present in an heterozygote. So when you have sort of a heterozygote in the population, the green sort of phenotype can induce a pyramid. Epigenetic modification on the other allele, and this is what's known as paramutation. And so, this is sort of a frequency-dependent kind of a thing. And that sort of converts this A to this epigenetically modified allele. And so, ideally, the gamete pool would just have looked like A and B, but because of this instability of epigenetic modifications, you see that there is imperfect, so there is sort of some kind. Effect, so there is sort of some capital S again in the gene pool or in the gamete pool. And therefore, pyramutation is somewhat of a gene, there was no reset, it's very much like a gene drive. And so, pyramutation theoretically is sort of like an imperfect gene drive kind of a phenomena. And this is actually where I started this project because these have been indicted in a lot of sort of plant pathogens as well as antibiotic-resistant genes and a lot of the. Antibiotic-resistant genes in a lot of the plant populations, and so very relevant for evolutionary rescue sort of scenarios. And so, this is where the project started. Yeah, sort of similar roundabout, but still in a linear way. And so, I look at the case where the wild type in the population has this advantage of being able to paramutate the other one. And so, you keep converting the mutants back into this. And so, first, I just wanted to. Back into this, and the first I just wanted to look at the standing genetic variation. And you see that even though this paramutation is consuming the genetic mutants, the genetic mutants still manage to stay at the same rate that they would have in the absence of paramutation. And this is because the strength of paramutation isn't strong enough to overpower the effect that selection and genetic mutations have. And after that threshold, it starts to decline. But even in this But even in this regime 0 to 10, where these long-term effects of pair mutations don't seem to have any sort of major effect, you see that even just in that regime of 0 to 10 of this M over T, there's a sharp decline in rescue probabilities post-change. And that's because this is, as you increase from 0 to 10, it's taking longer and longer to reach that equilibrium. But post-change, you need to sort of vary extinction. Of very extinction can happen very early on. So, if you take too long to get there, you can go extinct during that process. And so, that's why you see this sort of sharp decline in rescue populations. Now, I looked at the case where the rescue mutant has this advantage. So, the rescue mutant can convert the wild types on. And the expectation was that this would always increase the probabilities of rescue. And in a lot of scenarios, it did. But in certain range of the parameter space, basically, where there was some sort of shift in. Basically, where there was some sort of shift in dominance patterns, you see this sort of decline in rescue probability initially, even though there are more and more of sort of rescue phenotypes being generated. And so looking at the standing genetic variation, you do expect, you see that the rescue phenotype does increase as you increase this MOVT. But when you split it down into the epigenetic component, the genetic component, you see that the epigenetic is increasing at a cost to the genetic rescue mutant. And so, And so the increase, but epigenetics in the long term is unstable, and so this increase is insufficient to compensate for the stable rescue that genetic mutants would have provided in the population. And so it's just not enough to sort of compensate for those detrimental effects that you see because of this titania. So with that, just to sort of summarize the broad picture, is that when survival is contingent on epigenetics, When survival is contingent on epigenetic variations, populations can go extinct even post-recovery, similar to sort of things that you have shown, another sort of different mechanism of similar ideas. The transient effects of epigenetics, even if it doesn't have a long-term effect, can become very important and can reduce the survival probabilities by quite a bit. And this has consequences for evolutionary rescue. Long-term effects, because they affect the standing genetic variation, can also. Effect the standing genetic variation can also have a lot of effects, especially when the beneficial epigenetic variant competes with the more stable standing genetic variation. This can happen due to imperfections or due to paramutations. And then sort of finally, just feature directions. One thing, the other way for interaction between an epigenetic and a genetic component is through linkage. Instead of sort of competing for the same wild type, there could be different alleles. Extending Extending Troy's and Russell's models of sort of this coupled price equation to incorporate absolute fitness directly and sort of computing the lag for those scenario and sort of building mechanistically a quantitative epigenetic model starting from the first principles. A lot of epigenetic mechanisms, I didn't sort of talk about those, but have similar flavors as plasticity. I'm just curious to sort of explore those. I'm curious to sort of explore those things, or at least lead to sort of non-linear functions of plasticity that haven't been explored. Thank you. Questions? So I might have missed this. Did you have a path from the epigenetically modified mutant to the genetic mutant? Genetic not directly. So it was only via the wild type that it could convert into it. And that's sort of mechanistically, a lot of epigenetic variants are like that. There might be a separate, so if the epigenetic modification happened on the genetic mutant, that would lead to a different sort of a phenotype and not the same sort of epigenetic variant. And so that's sort of a separate model that one can consider. So would that you think that would change these results? Because we could get there quickly in some way. You could get there quickly in some sense. Without competing with competing for these things, and so the way I was trying to do it was to separate the loci at which the epigenetic variant and the genetic variant has, but that's another way. If you sort of decouple those, then there's a different kind of competition that's not because of the fuel, but because of their fitness directly. And that will lead to some other kinds of effects. And I think there's a couple of resistance genes that do have sort of two varieties of genes. Two varieties of things that can happen. Those parameters M and T, I think obviously critical to what's going on. Do we have a better handle on what sort of values those? Yeah, so I was looking at looked at sort of this, and so here they've seen sort of different ranges. So it's from 10%. Different ranges. It's from 10%, 40%, 100%, and so on. And sort of it varies anywhere between 5% to 80%, 90%. And so that's kind of the range that I M and T for chiral mutations. IP mutation, that's way much more data, but I haven't looked at sort of, I don't have a handle on that yet. So come to break next and So come to break next and we'll try to come back around 10.30 to go back tomorrow. Just one quick announcement. I'm told that for people
