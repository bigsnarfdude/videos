So, what I'm going to start with is in a 1995 seminar Bourbaki, Kraft listed several challenging problems. And I'm not going to try to list all of them, but I'll list two that are relevant for my talk today. And the first one is the characterization problem. Problem. So, translating a bit from Kraft's original formulation, what this asks is to characterize polynomial rings without using generators and relations. And the second one is the cancellation problem. So, stated in terms of algebras, this asks: if you take a polynomial extension of two algebras and you have an isomorphism, does that imply that the base rings are isomorphic? There's a lot of question marks there. So, I'm not going to do this for polynomial rings, but I want to talk about one strategy that one might use in the setting of what I'll call skew polynomial rings, which have already been discussed this afternoon. And just to be annoying, I'm going to use a different term and different notation for these, but they're exactly the same thing. So So, my notation for these will be S. P here is this matrix from earlier. So, this is on end generators where XJ XI is just pij xi xj and these satisfy the same conditions as before pii is one pij pji inverse and i'll recall just as before that these are always as regular no theory and domain No theory and domains with global and Gelfand-Kirlov dimension N. And then particularly important is I don't want to consider the generic ones. So the SPRPI. And equivalently, here, this also means module finite over the center if and only if the pij are all roots of unity. And the motivating question here satisfying a polynomial identity? Yeah. In general, for an algebra, these are definitely not equivalent. Module finite implies PI, but for these, they are equivalent. In fact, most of the time, I really only care about the fact that they're module finite. Really, they only care about the fact that they're module finite over their centers. So the initial goal and the subject of our first paper, which has already been published, is if we have one of these Q polynomial rings that's Pi, how can we describe its center? And specifically, can we give some characterization in terms of the Pij as to when the center is. As to when the center is, say, regular, when is it Gorenstein? So if P is PI, when is its center Warrenstein or regular so doing this. So, doing this just directly from the relations is difficult because the center can have a lot. It can have a lot of generators to it. So, here's our strategy for it: to define some automorphisms. Are you participating part of the yeah, so so given this this set of parameters, this matrix P to describe what properties the center might have in order to be TI, they have to all be roots of unity, but the exact presentation of Exact presentation of the center is not clear. For instance, if you just hand me some roots of unity, it's not immediately clear if the center is a polynomial ring or not. For example, they can have wildly different behaviors. It's going to be commutative, but what properties beyond that? So I'm going to define these phi sub i just as conjugation by the elements i. By the elements of i, x of i. Now, this is a bit of an abuse of notation because the xi are not formally invertible in the ring, but the x of i are normal elements. So they commute with f by some automorphism, specifically this automorphism, and it kind of pops out the other side and keeps. And it kind of pops out the other side and cancels out. So it's well defined, even if the notation is abused a bit. And in fact, then it's not hard to see that this is actually a graded automorphism of SP. And then I'm going to define the group O to just be the subgroup of the automorphism group generated by all of these. Okay, so now we think: what does it mean to be in the center? Well, to be in the center, it's both necessary and sufficient to commute with the x of i, which means that it's both necessary and sufficient to be fixed by each of the phi sub i. So some observations. First of all, because these are all essentially diagonal automorphisms, at least acting on the degree one piece, O is abelian. This takes a little more work to see, but the rank, I'm sorry, the order of O is the rank of Of SP over its center. The center of SP is the fixed ring by O. And we could also define O to be the Z algebra automorphisms of S P. So the automorphism. Of SP. So the automorphisms of SP that fix the center pointwise. So what really this point means is that we can use tools from non-commutative invariant theory in order to study this center. And so a couple examples of results we have here. First of all, First of all, this is sort of trivial when n is 2. When n is 2, so now you really only have one parameter, p12. So p12 needs to be some, say, lth root of unity. And in this case, The fixed ring, which is also the center, is just x1 to the L, X2 to the L, and O is just ZL cross ZL. So this might lull you into a sense of complacency in thinking that the centers are all very nice, very regular, and very easy to describe. Describe. But even in the n equals 3 case, the story is a lot more complicated. So now, as I said, using some tools from non-commuted invariant theory, if n is 3, z is our center, then z is regular. Then Z is regular if and only if our three parameters, P12, P13, and P23 have orders that are pairwise co-prime. And the second result requires just a little bit of setup. So, this is essentially the matrix, the exponential matrix from earlier, but I'm going to call it B. So we can take all the Pij, we can find some root of unity. Such that Pij is C to the Bij and then B is just a matrix of these Bij, and this matrix is honestly skew symmetric, as opposed to what we might call multiplicatively skew symmetric with P over there. I'm assuming everything is generated in degree one. So, yeah, I'm not doing the weighted version. Yeah, I should probably say that. Oh, yeah, yeah. So in this case, so in the first case, OZ is regular. Oh, it's just a, oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's a polynomial, right? Yes, yeah, right. I'm sorry, what are the orders of the PIJ? Oh, just the parameters coming from here. Yeah. And I should have said, because I'm basically assuming throughout this talk that sp is PI. Then Z is Gorenstein. Gorenstein in this one? Yes. Yeah. It's going to be the yeah, I mean, they may not necessarily all be the same power because, for example, one, one of the generators could be commutative. You know, one of the generators themselves could be central, and then you're basically. Be central, and then you're basically just describing that one. But yeah, in this case, they will all be powers of the xi. Yeah, so it's Gorenstein if and only if. So I'll use the bar. This is just B taken mod L times, get this order right, B two three, B one three, B one two is zero. Is zero where those may be the same, but Bij is just the GCD. Bij prime is the GCD of the Bij and L. So this is for the Pij, we can find some common root of unity, such as these are all powers. I'm really bad at making this Greek letter. I should start choosing something else. So we find some common root of unity. So the Bij are all just powers of that. And the Bij are their exponent. So this matrix B is an honest skew symmetric matrix. Oh, the bar is reduction mod L. Yeah, so this is B mod L. Okay, so we have results for n equals 4, but it would probably take me most of the rest of the talk to just write those down. And it wouldn't be as illuminating. So I mentioned the thing I'm actively erasing, that I'm interested in this characterization problem. So now I want. Characterization problem. So now I want to say to what extent can we use some of these ideas to talk about general PIAS regular algebras? And then how can we translate some of those ideas into the Poisson setting? Yes, this is this vector transpose. Yeah. B is just some three by three matrix. Three by three matrix. I just want a column there. So let me try to make a general definition. Let A be an algebra and C some subject. And see some sub-algebra of its center. Probably the most controversial term I'll use today. So the Galois group of A over C is just the Just the automorphisms of A that fix C pointwise. And then from this, we can define when C is honestly just the center, we call. We call our notation is OZA. So this is the Galois group of A over its center, the ozone group of A. And if you wanted, you could also go through and Also, go through and define all this in the graded setting. So the graded Galois group. Let me see if I put Gurrs in all the right places. Gurr, Gurr, Gurr. Okay. All right. Now I feel like whenever I give this talk, I guess I started numbering things and then I just forgot about it. Whenever I give this talk, Whenever I give this talk, I feel obligated to say something about the name because it took me far too long to realize this. And I'm pretty sure James was testing us to see if we'd figure this out, and we never did until he told us. So the reason for it is over Z, it is one. Incredibly clever. Incredibly clever. So, okay. Over Z, so Z being the center, it's the automorphism just one over the center. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay, a couple observations about this. So, first of all, and this will be important for sort of the second part of my talk. For sort of the second part of my talk, that so let's see, let A be a Z n graded domain, which is prime. And here I honestly need that it's a finite module over its center. So, the first point is that here we defined O as just conjugation by the generators that were all normal. And O is the ozone group here. But it turns out that if you go the other way, which is just to define it as the group of automorphisms that fix the center, you obtain. You obtain that it's given by conjugation by some normal element. It's sort of easy to see that if you're a normal element and you conjugate by that, that you're in the ozone group. But in fact, the other direction is true as well. So then phi is just conjugation by, in fact, a homogeneous. In fact, a homogeneous normal element. And then a direct consequence of that is that the graded ozone group is just the ozone group. Finally, generate as a module. Finally generate as a module over the center. Yeah. Yeah. Finally generated as a module over the center. Okay. They can be. So in fact, I mean, sort of the point is that this ozone group is very big. Group is very big when you're a skew polynomial ring, and it's smaller otherwise. So, in fact, you can have a trivial ozone group. This is a totally reasonable thing. So, a theorem, which is really just a compilation of observations from here and results from others. Results from others. So if A is PI, AS regular, I'm going to list four conditions. I don't mean these are all equivalent. So the first is that the first item is that the ozone group is trivial. Two is that every normal element of A. Of A is central. Three is that A is collabial. And four is that the center is Gorenstein. So then one is equivalent to two is fairly easy to see by the lemma. Easy to see by the lemma. Because if you have a central or a normal element and you commute by it and it's just the automorph, it's just the identity, then that means you're central and the converse holds as well. On the other hand, I guess I'll just say one implies three is because the Nakiyamatam. Is because the Nakiam automorphism belongs to the ozone group. And this is a result, this isn't Rs, this is due to Stafford and Vandenberg from 2008. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that was the other one. I got the year right. I got the year right. This is Brown and Zhang. Three implies four is Stafford Vandenberg. But it turns out I couldn't get the year wrong because that's also 2008. It was a big year for this theorem. Okay. Theorem. Okay. No, no, no, no. This is in general a PIAS regular. Okay, so the hope might be to do something similar to describe centers of PIAS regular algebras by using this ozone group. And it turns out there are ways, but Ways, but maybe they're not as straightforward as what we did before. And in fact, the hope of trying to get the center as the fixed ring by the ozone group is it's not going to happen, basically. All right. So maybe I'll just put here as a note that under the same hypotheses as the theorem, the order. The order of the ozone group divides the rank of A over its center. So that means that the order of the ozone group is anywhere between Just being trivial and being the actual rank itself. I won't write it down, but I'll just mention that when n equals 3 and a is quadratic, we have a characterization of when this happens. It only happens for, I'll say, most elliptic Sclianon algebras. Here being Pi is equivalent to this. Here, being pi is equivalent to this defining automorphism on the elliptic curve being finite order. So, most elliptic sclianon algebras have a trivial ozone group. Also, the AS regular algebras corresponding to a nodal cubic have trivial ozone. Okay, so then we have a theorem. And before whether I wrote it or not, Whether I wrote it or not. So, K, I think I was just assuming characteristic zero. So, here I actually want it algebraically closed. I also want APIA as regular, but also generated in degree one. And so the following are equivalent. One is that the ozone group is abelian, plus, the order of the ozone group is this rank of A over its center. The second one is the same. The ozone group is abelian, but the fixed ring by the ozone group. By the ozone group is the center. Three is that A is generated by normal elements. And the last one is just that A is a skew polynomial ring for some parameter set. So this property. So, this property, really, I'll just focus on this one: that the order of the ozone group is the rank, characterizes the skew polynomial rings, at least amongst PIAS regular algebras. Now, I threw in this hypothesis there that the ozone group is abelian. So, growing up in the 90s, I was scared to death that there was this hole in the ozone layer, and I was going to get sucked out of it. And I was going to get sucked out of it at some point. The hole in our ozone group theory is that we expect under these hypotheses that the ozone group is always abelian, but we can't prove it. Every example we have managed to compute, which is a lot in, I'll say, dimension three, they're all abelian. And in fact, every finite abelian group is realizable as the ozone group of some. Realizable as the ozone group of some PIAS regular algebra. But we still don't know how to prove that all the ozone groups are abelian. Okay. So now let me make a not particularly graceful transition to talking about Poisson algebras. So the idea is that we'd like to extend some of these ideas to To studying, at least initially, semi-classical limits of these skew polynomial rings. So let me make a definition. Let's see. So for the moment, k is just a field. Is just a field be honestly skew symmetric. So Pc will be as an associative algebra, the polynomial ring, and then I'll give it Poisson structure. At least I'd serve the As I said, sort of the semi-classical limits of the algebras I talked about before. Let's just say i less than j. So Jing Ting once gave a talk on some of our work about Poisson algebras. And what he did was he first wrote down a whole bunch of theorems that were true in the associative setting. And then he went back through and he just put the word Poisson. And he just put the word Poisson in some appropriate places and said, There's our theorems. I wish I could do that, but I don't really know how. But the goal is to get something similar. Can we characterize these in terms of some ozone thing? Can we find appropriate definition so that we can get something similar to that theorem that characterizes these? But there's a few in. But there's a few issues, I'll say, initially. The first is that if I still work in characteristic zero, the centers here tend to be very small. I mean, of course, they always contain the field, and there might be some other central elements, but almost never, and I'm only putting in the word almost because I'm not 100% sure, but like I'm pretty sure, it won't be module finite over its center. Be module finite over its center. So, we, if we want to mimic the PIAS regular setting, we need to work in characteristic p. So, for the rest of this talk, I'll assume that the characteristic is p, and so that I don't get into trouble, I'll assume that p is not equal to two or three. The second issue, which isn't necessarily an issue, but it's worth noting. But it's worth noting is that in the associative setting for the skew polynomial rings, the normal elements commute by automorphism. But of course, here they function as derivations. So my ozone things should be derivations, in fact, Poisson derivations and not automorphisms. And the last thing is that here, Is that here we define the ozone things, the ozone automorphisms in this case, to be automorphisms that fix the center? So the analog here for derivations would be derivations that kill the center. But in fact, there's too many of those because any Hamiltonian derivation will kill the center. And so I'm not going to pick up, even in this case, just the ones generated by the exon. The ones generated by the XI. So I want something else. So let me tell you what that something else is. And the basic idea is to use this observation. So in the associative setting, we have this alternative characterization of ozone automorphisms as just conjugation by normal elements. So that's how I'm going to make my definition. So given a Poisson normal element u, and just as a reminder, because I guess Oh, maybe I should say, because I don't just want this setting. So let's in a Poisson algebra A. So just as a reminder, because it of Poisson normal, yes. So because it hasn't come up yet in this conference, I don't think is that bracketing with you. Bracketing with U lands you back in the principal ideal generated by U. When A is a domain, which will basically be the only setting I care about today, that's equivalent to this being a Poisson derivation. So, given this, the log Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian derivation determined by u or associated to u is, I'll use pi sub u, which is just u inverse. Just so I don't mess up, I actually put u in the second coordinate. Not that it matters, but I guess it matters up to a sign. And then. And then the log ozone group of A or a lozone group. There's been a suggestion by a member of the audience that we need to come up with a suitable definition. With a suitable definition of this for Benius algebras, just so we can define the Frozone group. That's future work. So this is just the set of log Hamiltonian derivations. You might say, wait a minute, you called it a group. You called it a group, and then you defined it as a set. Yeah, so if A is the domain, then in fact, this is an additive subgroup. Of the group of, I really mean Poisson derivations here. And it's as simple as pi f plus pi g is just pi fg. And in fact, it's a Z P vector space. Because pi of f t is just zero. No, because of this. It doesn't need to. For the same reason that when I define these for the skew polynomial rings, the x i. The xi aren't formally invertible. It's the normality that allows us to abuse notation and make this definition. Yeah. And so then the theorem, without all the buildup of the last one, because you probably saw this one coming, is if the order of the lozone group The low zone group. Oh, maybe I should say that I should use this board because I need a couple, well, one major extra requirement, which is I'm realizing very late in my talk. I'm realizing very late in my talk that I think I, as I often do, I failed to state my collaborators and I've since erased the board that I did remember to write them down. So this is Kenneth Chan, Robert Wan, and James Zhang. At one point in time, we're the Seattle group, which really only meant that three-quarters of us were not in Seattle, and I was the odd one out, but now it's like. The odd one out, but now it's like the half Seattle group. So let A, so this will be, so this is a polynomial Poisson algebra with a graded bracket. So by that, I just mean that I put these in So, by that, I just mean that I put these in degree one, and the bracket of two degree one things is a degree two thing. So, like P C over there. So, under these hypotheses, if the order of the low zone group is the rank of A, now this is the Poisson center. Then A is isomorphic to some PC. Okay, so in the associative case, we could connect this to the collabiale setting. The collabial setting. And as we've already seen, there's a close connection between the collabial property for AS regular algebras and the unimodular setting for polynomial Poisson algebras. So let me say something about that and kind of circle back to this idea of what can we say about the centers of the Of these skew symmetric Poisson algebras, yes. In this case, I believe it should be. Yeah. Yeah. So let me do sort of the same example I did before, but in the Poisson setting. So suppose n equals 2. And again, remember, I'm assuming that p is not 2. Then this is just. This is just x1 to the p, x2 to the p. So again, it's polynomial. So this is regular. And I'll also note that PC is unimodular if and only if, so this is just a two by two matrix, so if and only if C12 is zero. This last condition is also equivalent to the enveloping algebra being collabial. This is due to a result of Liu, Wang, and Zhuang. There results in characteristic zero, but it adapts to the characteristic p case. Now let me say something about n equals three. So, in this case, if C is this matrix, then the center is regular. Which is not hard to see because you have one generator that's Poisson central, and so then you basically revert to the n equals two case. What's more interesting is that the center is Gorenstein if and only if Only if this guy is unimodular, or it's not actually unimodular in this case, so this is the one exception. C is as above. So if your C12, C13, C23 are all non-zero. 3, C2, 3 are all non-zero, then you have a slightly cleaner statement that the center is Gornstein if and only if PC is unimodular. Okay, so can we say a little bit about general unimodular Poisson algebras. Poisson algebras in dimension three. So in this case, they all have the form that they're given by a potential. So if A is unimodular there is a potential Such that so x1 x2 is just omega partial derivative with respect to x3, and then you just cycle through. So I mentioned before that in the associative setting, we can completely characterize in the quadratic AS regular dimension 3. AS regular dimension 3Ks when we have trivial ozone group. So the question is: can we do something similar here? And we can. So A is the same. And this will, again, have a graded bracket. And the theorem says that. Says that the Lozone group is trivial if and only if A is unimodular and either this is so X one cubed or Or omega is irreducible. Yes, still, yeah. Everything I'm doing for the Poisson case is positive characteristic. Yeah, and Yeah, and not two or three. Again, just so I don't get in trouble. Okay, so a proof, basically a sketch of a sketch. So the first point is just to show if A is not unimodular. Then this is non-trivial. And so the point here is that you just have to produce some normal element. And it turns out there's an obvious one laying around in a sense that so if A is not unimodular, then there is some Poisson. Poisson derivation, or possibly what's called a Poisson semi-derivation, delta such that one can twist the bracket. This is unimodular. So, this twist appears in the work of Tang Wei. In the work of Tang, Wang, and Zheng. And I believe all three of them are here. So if you have a question about that, please ask one of them. But you can do this. And now B is unimodular. So there's some potential omega. And now you can show that omega from B is actually normal. Is actually normal in A Poisson normal No, no, they're the same dimension. In fact, they're the same associative algebra. Algebra. You're just twisting the bracket. Yeah. And then the last case is: so now you can assume A is unimodular. And this splits up into, well, the case x cubed, which you could just, this is the case where the Poisson center is actually regular. So that's essentially up to maybe a change of. Essentially, up to maybe a change of variable, that's the case over there, or omega irreducible, which we have a general argument for. If omega is reducible, it's not hard to find a normal element. In fact, it turns out to just be one of the factors of omega. And we have a somewhat more general argument, but there's only the Only the cases for this have all been classified, they've all been written down, so you could, without much effort, sort of go case by case and produce that. And that's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much.
