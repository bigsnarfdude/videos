Yes, thank you very much, Bill, for the introduction. And also, I would like to thank the kind also Barbara for their kind invitation of me to this nice conference in Banff. So, I really wanted to join you face to face because everybody says Banff is so beautiful place to go. Unfortunately, it's Place to go. But unfortunately, due to the pandemic situations, it cannot be. So, yeah, so also it's really nice to see my colleagues, old friends, and new friends here on this workshop. Okay, so Bill mentioned that you were sharing me some beautiful pictures of Banff. Yes, I really, really appreciate it. But so, yeah, so how to say, so as I respond, I'll. How to say. So, as a response, I would like to share my window screen. So, can you hear? Can you see my it's yeah, it's yeah, I'm in my office. This is the scene of Masapolo, so I can see the mountain. It's currently warmer than here, isn't it? What temperature? It's about 15 degrees Celsius. And also you can see Cherry Darson here, and also some snow on the mountain. Snows, snow on the mountain. So, yeah, yeah. So, I really wish that you can also visit me in Sapporo in Japan. Yeah, you're really welcome. Okay, so now let me start my talk. Yeah, so yeah, I will talk about really, I can say, a breakthrough surprising result on the uniqueness for the determination of parameter orders, okay. Orders and parameters. So, the key point should never. So, the key point should definitely be the inexact data. So, the first message I want to share with you is that no matter for forward or inverse problems, if we have the coinciding data, the data coincide with each other, so we can have uniqueness. So, if there's some noise or there's some difference between datum, then mostly, then almost for the old situation, we can only have stability. But surprisingly, Have stability. But surprisingly, for this inverse problem, just by some inexact data, this means we have some noisy data, but we can still have the uniqueness for the determination. So it sounds like some magic. But let me explain the mechanism for that. So, okay, so first I will introduce the background for the problem and the formulation. Okay, so yesterday, two or three talks ago. So two or three talks ago, so Bounty explained well some motivation, the background for the time fractional derivatives. So I just want to say something extra about that, just some comment about that. So except for the time derivatives, so we can just more generalize fractional calculus or say non-local models. No non-local models, so which are very popular in recent years. So, for example, it's very well-known fractional Laplacian, minus Laplace, for example, for minus Laplacian to the power of S, which was well characterized by Caferalian Syriza 15 years ago by a Diricherry to normal map. So, after that, there are theoretical and numerical research on that point. And also, more recently, so More recently, so there's so-called non-local vector calculus invented by Chandu and Max Gunsberg's group. So they invent this for the most, I remember, it should be the conservation of the volume, so volume constraint optimization problems. So my concerns about the fraction derivative in time, of course. So my motivation is very simple. So everybody knows well about the three very fundamental PDEs, elliptic. PDs, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. So, if we, of course, they have the time derivative zero and one and two. So, it's very natural to ask what happened here and here. What happened between these natural numbers? Yeah, there has been a lot of derivation of the time fraction of PDEs. For example, Banti explained the continuous. example bounty explained the continuous time random work which was well not well known as a generalization of the brand and emotion i will skip that and also i know some uh some background fun probability so for example uh barron parkins and also some japanese uh researchers uh considered the diffusion on fractal fractals yeah and then uh after that because uh because the of the self uh self-similarity and uh and and anyway, so the measure zero, then it more or less describes some slow diffusion on the fractal. And then they can derive some heat kernel, generalized heat kernel on fractal. And then it turns out that the order of the diffusion is related to some fraction dimensions. uh fraction dimensions okay and here here these two models had only one single single fraction parameter alpha but in in some earth science research especially for the geothermics so there's some heat in the earth so some researchers develop some models related to the linear combination of several time fraction derivatives like this so this so this talk i will mainly So this talk, I will mainly talk about this kind of generalization. So these three are only for alpha from zero to one, mostly describe the diffusion process. And for alpha between one to two, this so-called fractional wave equation. So it comes recently I just came to know that it comes from the so-called viscoelasticity model called Spring Pot model, like this. Yes, so this so this so originally there's a elasticity model and then after some relaxation uh there's some relaxation tensor here so that so that in some special situation there appears the fractional order from one to two. And basically the the idea is that the alpha there are many equations of between zero, one and two, and especially this conference and also this. This conference and also this talk will come most mostly concentrate on this interval from zero to one. So the time fraction diffusion equation models the anomalous diffusion. And also there are something here happens between one and two describing the viscous elasticity. So let me first come to the definition of the capital theory. Maybe something overlapped with Bounty's talk, but yeah. Bounty's talk, but uh, yeah, I will go through it quickly. So, the motivation of the capital derivative is uh comes is very simple, extraordinary simple undergraduate level. So, we define we define the integral operator j, just the integral of the function f from zero to t. So this is the integral operator. So, if we repeatedly perform j n times to f, then just by exchange the order the order of the by exchange the order the order of the calculator the integer then there there should appear this kind of integer kernel in this kind of kernel here like like this so there's a factorial here but if you if you look look at this regard this factorial as a gamma function so you you'll figure out that the gamma uh the n should should not necessarily be the natural number we can generalize it to the to this kind of kernel it just is just some uh Just some very natural generalization from integer to all positive real number beta. So, this is by this kind of with this kind of weakly kernel, so we can define the Lehman-Leuwe integral operator of beta, of order beta. So, here beta is greater than one, sorry, greater than zero. And especially for beta from zero to one, there's a single, there's some weakly single weak. There's some weak singular kernel, weakly singular kernel here, here at this point. So then the traditional definition of the Caputo derivative is just the composition, the composition of the usual integer order derivative with the Lehman-Leuvre integer operator with order from 0 to 1. So this order is always. To one. So this order is always between zero and one. So this means we will always have some weakly singular, weak, weak, weak singularity here. Okay, for example, so here I concentrate on the alpha between the order between zero and one. So I just write down, simply write down the definition of capital derivative like this. So again, so first I take the first I take the first derivative of f and then Derivative of f and then turn back turn so roughly speaking integrate integrated for one and one minus alpha time and then I get this kind this kind of weekly single kernel here the story looks fine here fine until now but there's some there's some small gap for example for example if I just want to take half derivative and and the function if is not And the function f is not smooth enough. It is only half differentiable. It is not first order differentiable. Then there's some difficulty because the definition of Kafka derivative access the first order, first derivative of f, which may not exist. So this is some small gap in the definition of the traditional definition of capital. The traditional definition of capital diarrhea. So in many researches, I think this problem is not taken seriously, but several years ago, some researchers find some alternative definition of capital derivative in some suitable. In some suitable or subrift spaces. So the idea is extraordinarily simple. So we have the alpha's order integral, integration, J alpha. So why not just define capital derivative as the inverse of this operator? So this is a very rough idea. But to do this, we have to characterize the domain, characterize the domain of partial T alpha, which should be the range. Which should be the range of J alpha? We have to give some characterization of this range. So the setting is in L2. The settings in L2. We define J alpha in the domain L20T. And then we prepare the H super alpha, which is the usual fractional subway spaces. And then Lutska. And Gorenfo Luchko Hamoto several years ago successfully characterized the range of J alpha. So the result looks simple. It's just a fractional sub-life space H sub alpha, which is not H super alpha like this. Also, the definitions are followed. So it's a closure in H super alpha space of the C1 function which vanishes at the C one function which vanishes at the at the origin. So this is the definition of h sub alpha. And then furthermore, they characterize this function space further according to the value of alpha, which where there's a borderline at one half, like this. So yeah, so this is the this is the This is the definition of H subalpha. And also, the good news is that the J alpha operator is a bijection from L2 to H sub alpha. So basically, it's easily understood because although here is an integral, weakly single kernel, so it integrate the integration is taken from zero to t. So basically for some, yeah, yeah, basically, so Yeah, yeah, basically, so after taking this J beta, if we take t equals zero, then it should be zero for weakly singular function. So this is the point. So this is why the origin should be zero. And then by this way, we can simply define the Caputo derivative J partial T alpha as the inverse of J alpha and the domain or And the domain automatically becomes H sub alpha. H sub alpha. But according to the value of alpha, so the definition of H sub alpha is slightly different. For example, if alpha is smaller than one half, then H sub alpha is nothing but equals to H super alpha. However, if alpha is greater than one half, so we have the initial value here. So this can be seen from the solvent embedding. So H super alpha. within embedding so each super alpha if alpha is strictly larger than one half so it's embedded in continuous function then we can uh so so so the initial value so it's defined point wisely so we can uh we can subscribe uh we can specify the initial value here so this means this means if alpha is greater than one half we cannot perform this caputo derivative to any f whose initial value is not Whose initial value is not there? Is not there? This is the point. So, after this research, the writing, the interpretation of the initial value become a little bit advanced. So, if you want to perform this capital derivative to some function which is not necessary vanish at time equals zero. So we have to minus, we have to subtract the initial value. We have to subtract the initial value here so that in this bracket, the initial value should be can be zero. So, this is the new message, new message on the redefinition of the capital derivative. Okay, with this understanding, so I can formulate the problem in this talk. So, as I said, I will talk about multi-turn time fraction diffusion equation. So, there's a linear combination of M. linear combination of M capital derivatives with different order alpha j alpha j and here u minus r u minus a is in the bracket so this means a is the initial value is the initial value of u and for simplicity i uh i impose the homogeneous duration boundary data and here of course m is a natural number alpha j and q j are positive j and q j are positive constants and I order alpha j in decreasing order like this. So L L here is a second order elliptic operator you use of course defined like this. But unlike most previous results I can I can allow some non-symmetric term bx the vector bx here. The a is simple as The A is simple as a uniformly positive definite on the closed domain omega bar. And C is a potential, scalar potential. The B is a vector. For simplicity, I assume C is not negative. But if you think it's too complicated, of course, it's not so necessary. But simply, you can. But simply, you can just consider L, L equals minus Laplacian. It does not matter. The key point is here. It's here. There's some remarks. As I said, so if alpha, the largest order, alpha one is greater than one half, so we can interpret the initial value like this. Usually we write it at this, but by the redefinition in the previous slide, so I prefer to write it in this form. And also, in this form and also also about this kind of about this kind of equation there are many works especially maybe several by myself and my colleagues here so about seven years ago we have we have this theoretical paper and this numerical paper about about this about this initial boundary value problem so so I so so i i i remember these two works uh originally during my first the first visit to uh to college stations and also uh on this occasion i would appreciate very much they these are these two are the most highly cited paper of myself so i really appreciate it okay so until now we until now we know we have already known much about know much about the uh single uh single term time fraction Single time fractional diffusion equation. So in this table, I just simply collect some known results about these equations in comparison with the usual heat or diffusion equation of alpha equals to one. So they share many similarities in positivity principle and time analysis. They're almost the same. And in others in other quantitative aspects, so this for example smoothing effect and vanishing property, so the fractional diffusion equation become slightly small, slightly weaker. The result becomes slightly weaker than the case of alpha equals to one. But quantitatively, they are similar or equal. So each of these properties can be applied to inverse problems. Apply it to inverse problems, like this kind of inverse problem. I will skip it here. But what is the most remarkable difference between these two types of equations? It turns out to be the asymptotic behavior. So this is the original purpose of this fractional order diffusion. So they have to describe the slow diffusion as we can observe in field experiments. So if alpha equals to one, everybody knows that the solution decays exponentially fast. But for alpha smaller than one, so it decays of the speed of the rate of t to the minus power of minus alpha. So this is the most remarkable difference between these two. And so here appears the order alpha. So from this aspect, we know that the determination of alpha in some real applications, In some real applications and also in theories, are really important for fractional diffusion equations. So, this is so this is why I would like to talk about this parameter inverse problem in this talk. So, the problem is formulated as follows. So I use a single point observation, x0, and tau is positive, but can be extremely smaller, arbitrary smaller. So I take the observation of the solution, of the solution u at a single point x from zero to tau. And by this kind of data, I would like to determine constants m, alpha, j, and qj simultaneously. And the point, the point here is that, okay, so as Bounty said, uh, said uh, said, so anyway, we have. So anyway, we have the unknown, the unknown finite number of constants. So in some special case, in some special, for example, for the single turn fractional diffusion equation, there are some works about by just use a single scatter, single scatter of the observation ux0 t0 to determine single alpha. So it's possible. But here I use. So it's possible. But here I use a function. Already tau can be arbitrary small, a function. But the point is that here, the initial value a can be unknown, can be unknown, which is slightly different from most literatures. Okay, so talking about literature, so I review some references, which mostly mentioned also by Banti. Yeah, so in this work, almost 10 years ago. very the almost 10 years ago so they provide the inversion formula inversion formula that's why because so we can inversion formula use the long time or short time asymptotic behavior of the solution so why why we can do this because of the asymptotic behavior so alpha appears at the uh power here so then we can have a chance to to to recover alpha by a thing by this kind of formula so Formula. So after that, there are many works about the, for example, for the multitone case, in this paper, they had the uniqueness of the multiple constants here. And also in this survey paper, so we three years ago collect the results as far as we know until three years ago on this kind of problems. This kind of problems. And also, Banti also talked about this paper yesterday. So they can uniquely determine the order alpha with unknown medium. So unknown medium is important. So they can allow the operator L, more precisely, some coefficients in alpha, sorry, in L are unknown. And even though they can still Even though they can still uniquely determine alpha. However, so all this existing literature, I observed that I figure out that they only consider uniqueness with given initial data and exact data. Exact data means so every paper here are talking about the uniqueness of alpha. So they use the data coinciding with each other. data coincide with each other coincide with each other so so you but usually uh in real applications there must be some noise so uh due to the due to the lack of the mathematical tools so until now so it's really extremely difficult to get any stability results for inverse problem concerning uh time fraction diffusion equation so in this research i would like to ask how can we get I would like to ask how we can get some stability results or even more about this kind of problem. Okay, so maybe I should go faster to share with you the main results of this research. Okay, so okay, so talking about noet talking about uniqueness or stability, let me have to introduce an auxiliary function to compare with the original problem. So here is a problem. So here is a problem of the solution of V, which is equipped with different parameters, N prime, Rj, N prime, Rj, and beta J here. And also, because we assume the initial value is also unknown. So here, instead of A, the initial value of V is B. I assume it is B, not necessarily equal to A. To A. And all other settings are the same. All other settings are the same. And here is the first main results in this talk. I will explain what is the exact data. So, okay, so U and V satisfy the corresponding equation star U and star V, where the initial value AB has some regularity, necessary regularity, so that this regularity is necessary for the following assumption. The following assumption. So, L is the L is the second-order elliptic operator. So, I assume LA and LB do not vanish at X0. So, this means LA and LB should have a pointwise definition. So, that's why I assume this Sobrev order, beta, is greater than this power so that this number, so that they can. that they can by the soliff embedding these two these two functions are pointwisely defined okay here is the the inexact data inexact data so i assume that there is exists a small uh there exists exists a constant nu which is greater than minimum of alpha one beta one which are which are the greatest power in respective equations so equations. So with this power nu, the in-exact data means that the difference of the observation data u minus v is smaller than the constant times t to the power of nu in from zero to tau. So this is so-called in-exec data. I refer found quite as noisy data because it is not it looks not like usual noisy. So here, for example, if T is example if t is t10 to zero so this means the the difference between these two observation data should coincide with each other so uh so i i i do not say this is noisy data but the inexact data so i can allow some allow some gap between each other uh the gap is related to the power t to the power nu this is the point so if we i have this kind of data i can conclude the coincidence I can conclude the coincidence of the largest order, alpha one and beta one. And also the constant, the parameter, q1 and r1, the ratio of them equals to kappa. What is kappa? Kappa is the ratio of LA and LB. So this is the point. This is the first result. Until now, I can uniquely determine the largest order. But if I have here some technical Here are some technical assumptions. If I even I have even higher regularity of the initial value and the inexact data holds with even larger nu, twice as before, twice as before, then I can conclude all the unknown constants are equal to each other. So including the number of including the number of terms m equals m prime and all alpha and beta coincides and all parameters the ratio of all parameters equals to this single uh single constant kappa so this is the first main result so as i said before as i said before so this is the inexact data so this means i can this this is not like the noisy data so if i take if i take t equals zero here so i can so you can see if t equals zero then So you can see if t equals zero, then so this this and these uh these terms becomes the initial value. So because the respective initial value are a and b respectively, so this means nothing but ax0 equals bx0. So so by this inexact data, I have this hidden assumption. So the initial value, I don't assume they are equal to each other, but they should equal to each other at least. equal to each other at least at this single point x0 so this is the this is the first hidden data but this this is all i assume for the initial value so let me compare this result with all existing results so in existing results the initial value so so they concentrate on the uniqueness of alpha not a but so usually they assume the initial value a equals to b but here in our theorem one so i only 0 and 1 so I only assume they coincide they coincide at a single point x 0 and the L A and L B are not zero at this point X zero. So these are the only assumptions I need for initial value. Okay. And also the most considerable surprising one is this data. So all existing results with using this coinciding data. But here I can allow the But here, I can allow the difference is of order t to the power of nu. So this is the remarkable advantage of our result. And also, of course, the conclusion are the same. The number of terms and the orders coincide with each other. But unfortunately, we can at most conclude the parameter q. Parameter q, qj are equal up to some parameter, up to some multiplier. That looks like some drawback. But the question is, can we further conclude these constants are also equal to each other? So the result is negative. So I can construct this simple counterexample. So one-dimensional case, single term, already our term, already alpha one equals to beta one, but q1 and r1 are different. And I select carefully the initial value a and b like this, like this. And by some calculation using a metag-leffler function, we can see that u and v are different functions. However, they coincide with each other at the opposition point. So this is the result. So we can see the result so we can see we can see that the ratio of q1 r1 is four which is equal to the sick second derivative the ratio of second derivative a and b here so this is it this is also interesting so i will i will turn turn back to this point why why they equal to each other okay so this is the result for the uh for the in-exact data so you can you can say that well uh at at most we have finite number of unknowns but we have Finite number of unknowns, but we have a function. Although the range of time can be arbitrary small from zero to tau, but we have infinite number of information here. But so you can say that this is an over-determined problem. Yes, I agree. But next, I will show that if we have exact data, we can do. data we can do something more we can do something more so for example for simplicity i just i just assume l l is a self adjoint so so i remove i remove the non non-symmetric term here so so in this way you can have the eigen system uh and the eigenvalues and eigen projection here so this is the convenient for us to uh write down the solution okay so in this second theorem i characterize the uh i give the The uh, I give the characterization of the exact data. So, in which so, in which situation can we get the coinciding data? So, this is the point. Okay, so because we have the eigenvalues, so I can define this kind of set sigma, which is the ratio of all combination of eigenvalues here. So, of course, this is a countable set. And also, as before, u and v are solutions to corresponding initial boundaries. Corresponding initial boundary value problems. So the following, so because this is a characterization, the following two things are equivalent to each other. The first one says that the data coincides, so coincide with each other. And then the second one is that, okay, so this should be, so the number of terms should be coincide, alpha and beta should coincide, and the ratio should be. Uh, should be a constant here. Okay, until now, the result is all identically the same as serum one, but after that, it's a point. So, this ratio should be kappa, should be in the set of sigma. Sigma is the defined here. This ratio should be in this set. So it cannot be some arbitrary positive number. So, it should only be in the. it should only be in the set set sigma, which is really restrictive. Moreover, we can further say the following thing. So we can find two subsets, M kappa prime of natural number, which depends on the number kappa. Kappa is in sigma here. So they satisfy this one. So there are subsets, these subsets. These subsets of the spectrum of L coincide with each other with here with kappa, here with kappa. So this means that the kappa times lambda n coincides with other elements in the spectrum. So of course, this is a very restrictive situation. So of course, situation so of course of course uh of course the number the number of the this uh the element the number of elements in this set uh are equal to either each other so so we can construct the bijection theta k from m k theta kappa from mk to m k prime such that we can even have the following so if m is not in in the subset in the set m kappa so the food component the Fourier component, the Fourier component, so Pn is a eigen projection. Basically, it's a Fourier mode of A at X0 should vanish at X0. And also it's also L A, also the Fourier mode of L A also vanish. And similarly for B, it's also the similar result. So the interesting thing is if M is in the set M kappa, so the corresponding So the corresponding Fourier mode of A and B should coincide at X0 with corresponding index n and theta kappa n. And also for L A and L B the corresponding relations also similar, but here we time here it should be time time to kappa here, multiply kappa here. So this is the characterization of the result. So you see that out. So you see that we can allow the difference of the sum parameter, but the parameter should be very restrictive. Or otherwise, we cannot guarantee the uniqueness of the observation data. Okay, so let me talk about it in some further detail. So because of the definition of sigmas like this, like this, so one this so one uh the number one should be in it's a trivial to see number one is in the set sigma so if kappa equals to one so let me see the previous slide so uh so the corresponding so the corresponding one uh are equal to each other up to L A and L B this is the result from before and more importantly these two subsets of natural numbers should be natural number itself Number should be natural number itself, and the bijection should be the identity here. So this means all the Fourier mode of A and B, including L A and L B, coincide with each other at the point x0. It's almost like the uniqueness of the initial value, but I will talk about this later as a colouring. Okay? Yeah, on the other side, on the other hand, so if On the other hand, so if kappa is not in this set sigma, so as I said before, the previous theorem too is a characterization. So this means we can never have the coincidence of the observation data. Okay, so the most interesting situation is that kappa is in sigma, but is not one. So this means the very special relation between special relation between A and B. So, okay, okay, I have no enough time, so I will go quicker later. So in this example, I constructed this situation. So again, one-dimensional case minus Laplacian. So we can have the eigenvalue here. So eigenvalue is n square, of course. So by the definition of sigma, so because sigma is the ratio of gamma. ratio of gamma lambda n over lambda n prime so so this one should be n prime n over n prime squared so so it is so here this is nothing but the square the square of the all ratio number except zero right so uh i of course i can also write the eigen eigenfunction here and then by the uh uh by the previous by the above result we take kappa out we take kappa equals force and what happens so we can we can know that the set n4 is the all even number or even number and the bijection is just the pullback from the even number to all natural number okay by the theorem by by this theorem too we can we can know that the the two n Fourier mode of of a coincide with the n Fourier mode of B and the even Fourier And the even fully mode of A should vanish, should vanish. So especially if the observation data, observation point x0 is not in any pi times ratio number, then the initial value A must take the form of this one. So B can be arbitrary, but A is very special. It's very special like this. Okay. So So, yeah, okay, so especially for the case of kappa equals to one, so I said it's almost like the uniqueness for the initial value. But we can do this with some extra assumption. For example, so x0 is not the zero of all eigenfunctions here. And then we can further characterize the relation between A and B. This color is just a rigorous color. Rigorous, rigorous verification of the previous example. This example is just for the kappa equals four case. And yeah, yeah, especially if kappa equals to one, so we can we can finally conclude the a equals to b in omega. This is to say, not only we can have the uniqueness of the parameters and orders, but also we can uniquely determine the initial value. So this is more surprising. So remember, we always have So remember, we always have freedom one observation data. So it's a function of t. However, no matter of the spatial dimension, in this special case, although it's a special case, we can even uniquely determine the initial value. The dimension is D. So this is possible, and I feel it's very interesting. Oh, by the way, in this special case, I just assume that the observation just assume that the observation point x0 is not that any zero of eigenvalue eigenvalues but more more generally speaking this this condition is a special case of the rank condition rank condition so which is related to the observability so i i also smelled the flavor of this problem uh related to the of this observability of uh fractional order diffusion equation okay so as a bipartisan Okay, so as a byproduct, we also can change the formulation to some inhomogeneous equations. So the source term take form of this. So the separation of order, sorry, separation of time and the space functions in the source. Rho T is given, and F and G can be unknown. And then in this situation, we can also parallel the unique spider-in-exact data, but with some extra. Data, but with some extra assumption on the given function rho t. So, because remember, in exact data, we are looking at the asymptotic behavior near zero. So, we have to be very careful about this rho t between t and between near t equals to zero. So, I assume the behavior of rho t, it behaves also like t to the power of nu here. And similarly, I assume f and g does not vanish at x. f and g does not vanish at x0 and then all this all the results are the following results are the same we can uniquely determine uh the largest order uh with this kind of nu if we if we we increase the value of nu so we can get all the all the coincidence of parameters here yeah this is the same so okay so i consume most of time let's say say about our our main results so let me let me skip some Uh, let me let me skip some, yeah. So, for this in-homogeneous problem, so all the so we can also get the characterization and the uniqueness of the source term similarly as before. So, that I skip. Sorry, maybe I will use the last five minutes to give you the flavor of the proof of this theorem. So, it sounds like surprising, but if you listen to the proof of it, it's not so mystery. solve mystery okay for for okay for simplicity i will just consider single term case single term alpha and beta and for uh for some uh for some generality so i put q and r constant q and r here okay okay what should we do so we of course we start from the inexact data so we let me recall the inexact data looks like this however we can we also know the asymptotic behavior of both of both of both solutions, u and v, as t tend to infinity. So they should decay, right? And then by these two facts, we can know that the in-exit data, this inequality holds for all positive t, all positive t. Of course, the right-hand side diverge blow up. Diverges, sorry, not blow up. So, but anyway, this. So, but anyway, this inequality holds for all t. Yeah. After that, we just take Laplace transform, take Laplace transform on both sides. And then it's very simple to calculate the Laplace transform of just T to the power of nu. It's just p to the power of minus nu minus one in the in the Laplace in the frequency domain. So all the initial all the observation data now transform to the frequency domain. And of course, we are. Frequency domain. And of course, we will take Laplace transform in these two equations. And then, of course, by this well-known formula of the Caputo derivative, we can transform this fractional time fraction diffusion equation to this elliptic equation, to this elliptic equation. And then we take inverse on both sides, so we can write down the solution u hat, right? Okay, so we can do this by the eigen system, a spectrum of this one. eigen system a spectrum of this one so the the sol the solution looks like this the p to p times yeah i prefer to write uh write p times uh u hat so it equals to this one yeah so maybe i skipped too much so so here here appears this term and this is this is nothing but l plus q p alpha minus l so so that uh so that we we can have a itself here and then here's a l And then here's an L times this inverse here. So this Y here comes this term. Okay. Yeah, we can also do the same thing for V. For V, then V appears B minus blah, blah, blah. So then take minus of these two equations, and then we arrive at this. Asymptotic behavior as p turn to infinity. So here is on the right hand side is order p to the power of minus nu, which comes from this equation, this inequality, this inequality. Okay, from this one, we can almost get the result. So we can conclude alpha equals beta by the contradiction argument. So if alpha is smaller than beta, we multiply the both sides of it by p to the power of alpha. p to the power of alpha and then obviously that the obviously we can see that the second term tends to zero and this term also tends to zero this why because we assume nu is greater than minimum alpha and beta this why and the only this term does not vanish so does not vanish to zero but it it extends to la blah blah blah but we assume this is not zero so this is a contradiction So this is a contradiction. And also by the similarity, we can conclude the opposite inequality is also impossible. Then the only positivity is alpha equals to beta. If alpha is equal to beta, this term vanishes. And if I take p, I take p tend to infinity again, so this term will now. Now converges to this term. So this means these two should be equal to each other. So this is the result, why q the ratio of q and r equals to kappa. This is a rough idea of the of the proof. Also, we can do the same thing for the inhomogeneous part, and I will skip the details here. Sorry. Sorry, I skip, skip. Yeah, for the characterization. So I really wanted to show I really want wanted to share with you some rough idea, but maybe I can only have two or three more minutes for some. Maybe I will remain some time for discussion. So I reposted the main result here. And also again, here we consider only the single-term case. And here, why we need the coincidence of the observation data? That's why, because we want to use the time analyticity to We want to use the time analyticity to extend this coincidence to all positive numbers so that we can use the Laplace transform to conclude the coincidence of their Laplace transform. And then everything turns to some complex analysis, complex analysis. So the previous asymptotic behavior become equalities here. And then we can have this. uh we can we can have the uh this kind of unique continuation uh to uh so that these two equations uh uh are satisfied uh except for any pose any pose on the complex domain so after that we can uh we can repeatedly apply the quotient integral for formula quotient integral formula to conclude uh kappa is in in the sigma should be in the sigma and the and the coincidence of each Fourier modes just by repeatedly applying Cauchy's integral formula, as I said. Okay, so I hasten to conclude my talk here. So between the alpha equals 0, 1, and 2, there are many fractional equations here. And in this talk, I mainly concentrated on the anomalous diffusion part, say from alpha equal to 0 between 0 and 1. between zero and one okay so i redefine we redefined the uh the capital derivative as an inverse inverse operator of lymanuer integral operator in some suitable uh soblish fractional solvent spaces and then we consider the inverse problem of find the find the fractional multiple fractional orders as well as their uh parameters uh no matter the initial uh no matter with the Initial with the non-zero initial value or non or inhomogeneous problem. The highlights of this research is that we only use the short time in exact data near time equals zero. And also the initial value A or the source time F are unknown. These are very important points and highlights of this research. And the results mean achievements are the follows. So if we assume if the error of the observation data is Of the observation data is dominated by some order t to the power of nu, so we can uniquely determine the number m at the order alpha and the ratio of alpha j over L A. So this ratio should be very special just by some careful analyze of the exact data. And in some special case, we can even get the uniqueness of A and F. So the data is very. So the data is very, we use very small amount of data to get a lot of things in this research. So of course there are some future topics here. So here I just use a single point observation. So maybe for the numerical applications, we can consider the multiple point observation, which satisfy the rank condition, so that we can uniquely determine not only this orders and parameters. Count this the orders and parameters, but also the initial value or source time. So, this is the end of my talk. Yeah, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Kitan. The floor is open for questions, both the local floor and the floor, wherever the people may be on the floor. Floor. May I ask? Thank you very much for your nice talk. So can you comment a bit on how you get uniqueness for the f of x as well? If x. Okay, so yeah, let me go. Let me go back. Let me go back. Sorry. Oh, sorry. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, this is so this is the re so this is the result. This is the result. So the data coincide and the f and g are equal to each other only at a single point. And then we can get the unique of them. And then we can get the unique of them. And if you're asking the proof, sorry, I don't provide the proof for f and g, but I only provide the proof for a and b, the initial value, but they are almost the same. Yeah. So so okay. Okay, these are these are the relation of their Fourier mode, Fourier mode at X0. So So I just write right down right down the spectrum of this of these terms here. So because they're discrete, so we can take integral on this small circles and then because it excludes all other eigenvalues. So if I take the integral here, and then it will become nothing but the p n times ax0. And also on the right-hand side, it will be p n times bx0. Yeah, so at this point, we can conclude the coincidence of Pn A and P and B at X zero. But in zero. But in the but sorry, in the yeah in the next in the next results result I'm let me see in the next sorry sorry in the neck in the next one ah I also assume the observation data X0 is not the pole sorry not the zero of them so p So p p n a x zero is basically we can write right down as like this, like this, right? So if if this term is not zero, but and then a and a x this these two these two Fourier modes are equal to each other for all n so that we can conclude a equal to b. So this is the rough idea. I see. Idea. I see. And so, for this purpose, you need that the eigenvalues are single, isn't it? So, yes, yes, single. The single coefficient corresponds to just one eigenvalue. Yeah, that's right, exactly. Yeah. So it was not completely clear this Cauchy argues, but it's basically you could also do this by looking at the residues. Well, maybe that's what you're doing. I did not. That's what you're doing. I did not looking at the residues. Yeah, yeah. Poles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see. Thank you. Thank you. But you need the eigenvalues, the eigenvalues to be simple, I think. Yes, yes. Because so, in order to separate the it's really just a 1D result. Yes, or to impose that linear independence condition. Yeah, yeah. So you kind of So, you kind of asked me this question. I'm sure you've thought about it. You don't have to tell me anything like the details. But I don't want to give you initial conditions. I want it to be zero. But I'm willing to put values in one of the boundaries to drive it. Ah, okay. Could you do a mapping between the two so that somewhere along the line you can tell me what the boundary condition? You can tell me what the boundary condition should be in order to get the same result. It's similar, there should be a way to do that. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, cutting off the inhomogeneous data on the boundary, throwing it into like a neutral condition sort of thing. And somehow, I would think you might manage to do the same. Have you tried this? Ah, yes, thank you. Thank you for this question. Bill, thank you. Thank you for this question. It's very, very good. So, yeah, actually, I have not yet considered this problem yet. But I guess maybe if the boundary value also take the form of separate variable, so we can have a chance. We can have a chance. So if we have the same similar situation, we have the same similar situation as the. similar situation as the inhomogeneous term and then uh the yeah like this if the time component of the of the boundary value is given and the the spatial component for the of the boundary value is unknown so i think uh i have to check but i think we have we have a chance to do so okay yeah any further questions I have a question, may I ask? Of course. Yeah, and yeah, Dr. Yof Disney about the possibility of your extension of your result to non-symmetric L. Oh, yeah, we already proved the proved the result for non-stimulation. But the solar 2, so okay, okay. Servant 2, yeah. Yeah, serve too, yeah. I think maybe difficult, yeah, yeah. So we we need we need more structure is complicated, yeah, yeah, yeah. We need more careful analyzes of the generalized eigenfunction, yeah, here, written here, yeah. Yeah, yes, thank you. So maybe it's the next step. The next step, yeah, yeah, thank you. Next step, yeah, yeah, thank you. Uh, also, may I uh yeah, may I give uh one minor comment, please, yeah, and yeah, and could you please return to page item number four? Page four, yeah, page four. Uh, this is not concerned with the inbus problem, but just unified the second item: diffusion on the fractal. Yes, yes, yeah, then the Yes, yes. Yeah, then the of course this looks similar to the time fractional diffusion, but not because the fundamental solution by Barrow and Pakis or Tumangai has a completely different structure from the structure of the fundamental solution in time fractional case. You mean Cauchy problem? Cauchy problem, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cauchy problem. Yeah, because once I saw that diffusion on the fractal can Of the fractal can might or could simulate time fractional diffusion, but this is not correct because the structure of the fundamental solutions are completely different. Yeah, thank you very much. I don't remember clearly, but more or less I think it looks similar to Fox H function. Yeah, but the yes, but the Yes, but there's a result by Eiderma and Cauchy Bay. Yeah, yeah. The fundamental solution for the Cauchy problem over the time fractional diffusion equation. The fundamental solution still has singularity in X direction. But the bipartisan case, the different order of the exponential part in time t, but the no singularity in X. The no singularity in X is contained there, yeah. Once I could expect basically essentially similar, but it seems completely different as long as the concept is concerned. Oh, yes, thank you. So, yeah, but that is a minor remark about yeah, yeah, but but I but I think uh, for example, Kumada is also working intensively on the time fraction of the diffusion query, so they want. The diffusion quite so they want to find sound, yeah, yeah, and he's a very good specialist for the fractal, yeah. And I feel interesting that alpha is related to Hausdorff dimension, so yeah, so it maybe may give us some hint for the determination of but yeah, alpha also appears as a power or singularity of x of the fundamental solution. Yeah, yeah, so we grab the dimensional. But that dimension is not concerned with such singularity. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, right. Therefore, I think I guess that essentially different. Thank you. Thank you for a comment. That is a comment, but not also in the main part.
