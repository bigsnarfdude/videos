I think, and we're going to hear about classifying quantum cellular automata, a topic that will come back tomorrow, by the way. So, John Wan, please. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction and thanks for having me here. So, I'm going to talk about, well, the topic is mainly focused on QCA, but I want to move your interest into... Your interest into an algebra, a sub-algebra in the lattice. And it's a helpful perspective because it allows us to classify things. So here's my plan. So I know I have like 45 minutes, but I will start with the reviewing what QCA is. And then I will introduce the invertible sub-algebras. Algebras. And I will talk about the locally generated maximal community of sub-algebra inside that given invertible algebra. And then I will conclude with the application of these ideas into the classification of QCAs. So what's a QCA? I will not de-abbreviate what QCA is on purpose because I think Because I think Kwame Seller Automata is somewhat misleading name, but I stick with the history, so I continue to call it QCA. So, what is a QCA? QCA is just an automorphism of operated algebra that preserves taking daggers. So, well, automorphism auto-means that it is invertible, and morphism means that it. Invertible and morphism means that it preserves all the addition and multiplication. Like if I have addition, then you know like that. And if I have dagger, then I should have dagger outside. And if I have multiplication, then this should be multiplication as well. So that's a morphism and increase of star and everything. The example of star automorphism is the conjugation by unitary. Conjugation by unitary. If you give me an alpha x, and if I had a unitary acting on the whole space, then conjugating x by the unitary u is an automorphism. We know that it preserves addition, multiplication, and everything. The unitary can be here, anything, but the most important example physically and mathematical physically speaking is Hamiltonian evolution, probably. Evolution, probably like for some time evolution for a given local Hamiltonian. And a discrete version of this Hamiltonian evolution is one by the small depth quantum circuit. You have some arrangement of qubits with the distance defined. So you're working with the discrete points of qubits on some metric space, and you have some. Space and you have some small unitary acting only on two or three or five, some constant number of qubits at a time, and you lay them like that. So you apply as much as possible in parallel, and you do that for some small number of layers. That's a discrete picture of the Hamiltonian evolution. And well, by the influence from the quantum information, we just call it. Quantum information, we just call it as a quantum circuit. If the circuit depth is deep enough, then you can implement any unitary. That's the basis of quantum computing. But we're not talking about that deep circuits. We will only focus on shallow circuits. So the most important property of the shallow circuit is that, yeah, it is an automorphism on the operator algebra, but at the same time, it has a light column. So if you conjugate. So, if you conjugate some operator, say here, with the inverse of the same circuit, then there will be some light cone beyond which no gate is affecting the result. You only need a gate inside your light cone defined by the geometry of your quantum circuit, such that after the mapping, the overall operator is now contained in some small. Is now contained in some small neighborhood where the L is independent of the size of this input operator, but fixed by the quantum circuit. So your support of operator is enlarged by a small amount. That's the most important feature of the quantum circuit. And in practice, we only use that, not so much what the gates are inside. Now, the difference, well, I gave you. Well, I gave you the quantum circuit as an example of QCA, which is true, but the point of discussing QCA is that quantum circuit is not everything. There could be, in principle, there could be, that's the question. That's the question. Does there exist a star automorphism that locality preserving Meaning that the support of the image of some operator is contained in some small neighborhood L ball around the support of the input operator that self. Such that it is alpha is not a quantum circuit. Quantum circuit. What else do we have? That's the question. That's the question in the study of QCA. And some results are known. So first, very abstract notion, the group structure of QCA is that if you mod out the group of all QCA, well, the QCA is by definition automorphism, so they compose and they get inverse. So they compose and they got inversed. So obviously they have a group structure. But you can, and the small depth quantum circuits themselves form another subgroup inside that group for an obvious reason. So you can mod that out. And this quotient group turns out to be abelian. And of course, since we are talking about many other About many body physics, you can always stabilize it. Meaning that if you are given some system where your given automorphism is acting, then at the same time you bring another system of qubits where you act by identity. And this seemingly mundane trick to add in an auxiliary system allows you to, well, allows you to wiggle up. Well, also to wiggle a little bit more. It gives you more freedom to think about. And in this stabilized setting, we can still show that it is abelian. You can think about how to remove and so on. And that's usually the rule of the game in the study of QCAs. Jong-wen, can I ask a question? Yes. So are you imagining a situation where like L is fixed and so you consider like QCAs with L equals five or and so for example when you modify And so, for example, when you modify a circuit, you consider circuits with like cone size five or, you know? Right, good question. So, right. So, I said that they form a group. And if you have a quantum circuit that enlarges your, enlarges the port of an operator by L, then if you compose it 100 times, then your enlargement will be 100 times L, which in principle goes to a very large number. So, it does not make sense to talk. So, it does not make sense to talk about the group structure so much in the closed finite system. For a fixed finite system, well, group exists, of course, but locality-preserving property is not really well defined. So, there are two ways to resolve this question. Well, to resolve this conceptual issue in terms of the definition. First one, obvious one, go to the infinity. Then, you know, 100 L or 1000 L, they're all fine. L or 2000 L, they're all finite numbers, so you're fine. Second method, you stick with the finite systems, but you consider a sequence of those. And then you come up with a certain coherence among those in that sequence. When you cannot collect something out of nowhere and something other, some other object and plug into the sequence and make a completely unrelated sequence. That's not what we want to study. You have to define some notion of coherence. Notion of coherence, and there is one which I will not have any time to talk about, but yeah, that's a good question, conceptual at the foundational level. Thanks. So let me briefly tell you the, well, yeah, coming back to Davis' question again. Well, in this game, I say group, but you should really think about some small number of compositions conceptually. Conceptually, so that the locality of blow-up is not so much big, or you think about infinity directly. So known results. The 1D situation is pretty much done in the sense that you could enforce of strict locality. So, as I just wrote here, your support is strictly contained in the finite ball around the initial support. In that strict locality setting, the one-dimensional QC is fully classified, and there is only one element, well, basically one kind of element outside the circuit, and that is shift. Shift, meaning that you have a one-dimensional qubit here. And if you give me an operator here, then I map it to an operator. Here, then I map it to an operator there. You don't change anything, you just shift your location. That's shift. And tomorrow we will hear more about what happens if we disallow, if we relax the strict locality condition and make it approximate. Still, the same result will hold. We will hear. In two dimensions, still the same. Still, the same result is true. UCA is always shift plus circuit in the strict category. In the approximate setting, things are fuzzy. We're not fully sure yet. Situation is more interesting in three dimensions. interesting in three dimensions. There is a candidate. There is a candidate QCA, actually an infinite family. There is an infinite family of QCA that is believed not to be described by any element in the shift plus circuit category. I say candidate because the proof is not unconditional. So the status is that this So, the status is that this candidate QC is of Clifford type, meaning if you give me a Pauli operator, say sigma Z, then this QCA maps to a product of poly operators. Something like that. And so, and it is the non-triviality that it is not a quantum circuit is. That it is not a quantum circuit is proven against quifer circuits. And it is not proven fully yet against general circuits. So, but there's a very strong evidence that it should not be That it should not be a quantum circuit against the general circuit. Even if you allow arbitrary elements in the inner circuit, this candidate QC is not going to be a quantum circuit. And there are potentially infinitely many ones. Yeah, that's the situation. Let me give you a little bit of physical context. The QCA was actually found and We found, and while we disentangle a certain invertible state, invertible state is a notion in the manybody in physics where the definition is the following. If you give me a state that is invertible, then by definition, there should exist another state such that when you combine them two, That when you combine them two, then there is some unitary circuit that maps it, the joint state into some product state. That's the definition. This is auxiliary, and this is input. And whenever such an auxiliary state exists, together with the quantum circuit that disentangles it, we call this input state as invertible. This definition applies for. This definition applies for all the SPT studies in the presence of symmetry. But you don't necessarily require the group symmetry here. And the role of QCA in this business is that there is some many body state that is invertible. If you bring in another state, then there exists a quantum circuit that disentangles it. Entangles it, but it alone doesn't seem to be. Uh, well, we don't have any circuit that explicitly does the job. We don't know yet. But there is a QCA that disentangles this alone. Some alpha of the invertible state is going to be the crack state. So it slightly strengthens the notion what it means to disentangle. In temple. And another physical realization of QCA is that it may appear as sometimes anomalous or non-marvelous symmetry action on the boundary of some SPT, you know. You know, by definition, SB symmetry protected topological state comes with some group action. And the property of the state is that it remains invariant under that group action. But you can always localize, well, you can usually localize the symmetry action to the boundary of the state if you open up, if you are given a spatial boundary to it. And you can characterize the action on the boundary. Characterize the action on the boundary, and usually this action at the boundary, even if the initial action on the bulk was on-site and product, the induced action on the boundary may be non-trivial. And it may be non-trivial in the sense that it may be a non-trivial QCA. It's not even a quantum circuit. That's another appearance of QCA. So that's my brief review into QCA. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And next concept is the invertible state. I'm sorry, invertible sub-algebra. So let me give you the definition directly. I consider the quasi-local algebra on the on your lattice. It's just in finite terms, you have a bunch of qubits laid out. Of qubits laid out in some lattice with a geometry, and you consider all matrix operators acting on it. When n is infinity, then you have to worry about how to complete it, but let's not worry about that aspect here. And A is just a solved algebra in that, and subject to the following condition: if you give me an operator X in that matrix algebra, then Then there must exist the following decomposition, AJ and BJ, where Aj are all elements of a given sub-algebra A, and B should belong to the computant of that sub-algebra. Computant is, of course, taken in this mother matrix algebra. Well, Well, so far the definition does not say anything. We started with a sub-algebra, so how can not having this decomposition is not constraining at all. But the interesting thing about the invertible algebra is that these operators must be close to x. So if I take a union of the support of every aj, then Then this diameter, which is a set of qubits, must be smaller than some constant plus the original diameter. And same for P. So you are required to decompose arbitrary operator in your lattice into Your lattice into some of products. But in this decomposition, you should only use those within some distance from X. That's it. Some facts. A is always central. You may not. You may not have any central elements in the S of algebra. And obviously, A is invertible if and only if the commutant is invertible. The definition is not discriminating between the algebra and the commutant. And most interesting thing that connects with the discussion of QCA, A is always the boundary algebra of UCA in one dimension higher. Could it remind us what central means? Sorry? Remind us what. Sorry? Remind us what central is, please. Central means that the center, you know, the set of elements containing, well, of A such that it commutes with everything. This is This is just complex times identity. Okay. Thank you. It's the same notion as in the group. You consider the center of the group and you require that the center should be in trivial. I have not discussed what the boundary algebra is, but it is something, well. Well, let me quickly delve into that because that's a conceptually important thing. I'm sure we will hear more about the boundary algebra tomorrow too. So think about a subsystem. By subsystem, I mean some set of qubits in your lattice. And there, this subsystem supports its own matrix algebra. Say, S, this is my subsystem. My this is my subsystem S. Then, if you map it by a given QCA, say alpha, then it will map into some algebra supported on slightly larger region. So, this is my original system S, and this is my smeared out boundary region. But if you consider an operator deep in the bulk, then since alpha is invertible, you can map it back to the original algebra. And because of the locality-preserving property, deep inside the bulk, every operator should have a pre-image inside my system S. So this image contains a matrix algebra deep in the bulk. In the deep in the bulk. And you are left with something on the along the boundary, and something that along the boundary is what I call the boundary algebra. So, yeah. And it is easy to construct UCA from invertible algebra. How can I do that? How can I do that? So, I want to define a QCA on a one-dimension higher. So, this is my extra dimension. You give me an operator. I have to define its image. I want to construct a QCA. And you gave me an operator on a full system. Well, it belongs to one sheet here. One sheet here, that is coordination one. So, by the definition of invertible algebra, I should be able to decompose this arbitrary operator in terms of two pieces, where A is belonging to my invertible algebra A that resides in this sheet, and B is in the comment tent. And my definition of QCA is that I leave the Is that I leave this A piece here, but kick the B part by one unit. So the image under alpha is that you have J here, but your B will reside there. So A operate X operator is mapped. Operator X operator is mapped to a slightly larger operator. So this defines a map and you can work out to show that, okay, it is invertible, it preserves everything. So it is a QCA. And note that I started with the sub-algebra living on one sheet, and now my QCA lives on one dimension higher. Dimension higher. And if you apply the definition of boundary algebra to map subsystem, you look at the small, you erase the subsystem in the image, then what you're left with will be exactly a piece or its content. So studying, basically, what I'm saying is studying invertible algebra, which is a steady object, is exactly the same as the study of the auto. The study of the automorphism in one-dimensional height. I didn't show the equivalence precisely, but that's the fact. Okay, so now the third object. It's a bit of a mouthful thing. Let me know if there's already a known notion. Locally generated, maximal commutative. Sub-algebra. Maybe I should call it Lagrangian sub-algebra, but that sounds like something in the tensor category, so let me not use that. So I literally mean that thing. So I started with some algebra A, which may or may not be the full matrix algebra on your lattice. A could be your invertible cell algebra. And I further considered a subset of that that is locally generated. So there should be a generating. So there should be a generating set that sits inside this algebra, and each of which must have uniformly bounded support signs. And maximal are subject to the following condition. I require that this subset is commutative. And maximal in the sense that if I were to plug in another element into this sub-algebra, say z, then this Z, then this operator is already generated by the elements in my subset. That's what I mean by maximum. Okay, well, let me give you an example, the trivial example. Take A to be the full matrix algebra. Then I take the set to be, the generating set to be the single qubit Z acting on each qubit. No problem with that. No problem with that. Well, it is obviously commutative. It's all diagonal and it's maximal. Why? Well, if you give me an arbitrary operator P from this matrix algebra, then I should always be able to write it down as a linear combination of Pauli matrices, say Qj. And I required everything, the Z and P together must be commutative. Together must be commutative. So, in particular, QJ must commute with every single Z at every site. But what are they? They must be diagonal, and the only choice is that this must be some product of Z's. Well, I just showed that P is in the algebra generated by these Z's. And Z are single qubit operators, so they are locally generated. So, I want to say that whatever Whatever locally generated maximal commutative sub-algebra, there is an associated commuting Hamiltonian, just a sum of the generators. John Juan, could I ask a quick question? Can you give an example of something which is not locally generated? Oh, you could consider a sequence of operators that with increasing support. Something like maybe. But if I think of a quantum spin chain, all of them, somehow by definition, in this quantum spin chain, the algebra is generated by local things. So that's why I'm a bit confused. Oh, the uniformity is important. Yourself algebra may contain, say, I'm sorry, I don't have a very good example. Well, let me let me well, let's think about this way. So, I give you an arbitrary algebra. I don't know, not arbitrary. So, this is actually the problem. So, suppose you have a two-dimensional system, two-dimensional quantum spins, and you have defined your Hamiltonian terms in the bulk. Now, you wonder about what Hamiltonian can. What Hamiltonian can I write at the boundary? What would you do? Well, I want to stick with the commuting Hamiltonians. So every term in the Hamiltonian in the bulk is commuting with each other. Now I want to find the boundary Hamiltonian terms that is commuting with those. So naturally, you are considering the commutant of the Hamiltonian terms restricted to the boundary. Now, you get that algebra defined by being the commutant of bulk terms. Bulk terms, then the boundary Hamiltonian is something like: oh, if some operator is commuting with everything, then I include that in the linear Hamiltonian. And you hope that you have exhausted all possibilities. You hope that you have found the maximal sub-algebra. But you're not guaranteed yet. You may have to look at slightly larger support to find another element in the comment. And again, you hope that, oh, have I exhausted? Have I exhausted? And so on. Will this process end as you increase the support size? That's a non-trivial question. So I presume, although without any good example, there is a non-locally generated maximal template self-algebra. Thanks. Yeah. Sorry, can I just ask one question related to that? Are you saying that there, does this mean that there are That there does this mean that there exists a commuting projector Hamiltonian for which when you define it in some finite region, you can't find commuting projectors at the boundaries that give you a unique gap ground state. No, actually, that is. I found it similar to what you're saying, but I wasn't. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I said, well, the only purpose of that elaboration here is that this problem is non-trivial. This problem is non-trivial. That's all I want to say. Okay. The very question that you asked, if that's true, then that solves a lot of my problems. If it doesn't exist, you can. I actually conjecture that for every committee Hamiltonian, you should be able to introduce a boundary term such that everything is kept, but I don't have a proof. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so non-trivial example of locally generated maximal computative sub-algebra, or at the same time, non-trivial example of invertible algebra. So take two Tori codes. So we all know. So we all know that it consists, it has an anions of two bosons and one fermion, and I want to have them two, two copies. Oops. So E1, M1, and F1, and another copy, E2, M2, F2. Famously, this fusion rule and all the top possible And all the top possible data can be written as a different way, namely F1, F2, E1, F2, M1, 1, F2, F1, E2, F1, M2. So I have written a weird generator, well, not so weird, but another set of generators for the fusion rule in such a way that we can use the For the fusion rule, in such a way that every element that is non-vacuum is a fermion. And two copies do not see each other by the neutral braiding. So this is two copies of the three-fermion theory. Just a very well-known fact. But what I wanted to draw your attention to is you consider the hopping operator for those fermions. For that, for those fermions, say F1. So these are a small local operator, which in the exact resolving model, you can explicitly calculate, and they are actually Paldy operators. So you can explicitly work it out. And well, by definition, Hoppy operator annihilates a fermion here and creates another, or equivalently, equals. Another, or equivalently, it creates two fermions at the ends. So the hop-hopping operators generate some algebra and they are capable of transporting fermions wherever you want. I claim, well, now you collect all the Hawking operators for, say, this is my capital. Say this, let me call it F1 and this F2. And this F2 for F1. You collect everything and you generate an algebra out of that, but only with respect to the one copy, not the other. Then this algebra of a hopping operator turns out to be invertible. Well, simply because you have another copy. And if you combine them all, then you generate everything, all copy operator of the initial two copies. Of the initial two copies of Tori code. And we know that, you know, in your favorite representation of Tori code, the one that transports electric charge is the Z type, well, X type, and the one that transports magnetic type is the type. So you generate everything. And hopping operators by definition are local. And you can show that they don't have any central elements and so on. So it satisfies the invertibility. This algebra is interesting because of the following reason. There exists the locally generated maximal commutative sub-algebra inside this one copy of algebra, with which if you write down the Hamiltonian, associate Hamiltonian, the sum of generators, then this Hamiltonian only realizes the three. Realizes the free fermion theory. Not two copies, just one copy. Which may not be too surprising because we started with the Hawking operators for the one copy of three fermion theory. But if you think about the general wisdom or conjecture that commuting Hamiltonians does not realize chiral phase, this is somewhat, you know, it's a good example to keep in mind. It's a good example to keep in mind. I have a local operator algebra, locally generated operator algebra, in which I can write a Hamiltonian, a commuting Hamiltonian, that realizes my three-ferm theory. And all the data to describe this three-fermi theory in terms of elementary operators are all in this locally generated algebra. In other words, if the conjecture that completing Hamiltonians does not realize Commuting Hamiltonian does not realize chiral phases, then you should always assume something about your algebra. It simply doesn't work for any algebra. And here's an example. Okay, so now the final piece, the classification. So, suppose there are always some locally generated maximal commutative sub-algebra in any invertible algebra. This is my assumption. I have no idea how to prove it, but I will for a particular class. Class. Then we can construct one Hamiltonian in one dimension higher using a singular trick. So what I do is I consider A and A prime, A and A prime, A prime is the component of it, A and A prime, and so on. So each piece lives on one sheet. Leaves on one sheet of your codimension one system. And now I have added one extra dimension. And you choose the Hamiltonian associated with this LG MCS, locally generated maximum conditions of algebra, the sum of generators of it. And you consider the trivial Hamiltonian in this pairing, the A prime and The A prime and A, but A now is in the other layer. Since we know that this algebra together is the full matrix algebra, we know the trivial Hamiltonian, the sum of all Z's inside. So I define a Hamiltonian in one dimension higher to be the sum of generators for A, I mean the generator for the maximum commutative sub-algebra, and the trivial Hamiltonian in the middle. Hamiltonian in the middle, and I will be left with something about a prime, but a prime is also invertible. So, according to my assumption, there should be an associated Hamiltonian at the end. So, in the bulk, everything is trivial. We're just projecting onto the trivial spin. And at the boundary, something interesting is happening because of my construction. And the actual size of my extract dimension. actual size of my extract dimension is is up to me it can be five or 100 or infinite whatever it's up to me um so i want to restrict to the case of when these algebras are all pauli simplest possible case i guess then and that and then i tune the extra dimension The extra dimension to be small of order one, say 100, a fixed number. I have 100 layers of those and nothing else. And the 100 is chosen such that the size of the local generator is smaller than 100. That's it. Then, overall, system, although I have added that it's extra dimension, this is some finite value. So I would end up with the with I would end up with the one-dimensional actually lower system. And we know much about the Pauli-Hamiltonian in that case. So, in particular, for two-dimensional invertible algebras, according to this construction, I must end up with some toric code state, because that's the only possibility. Now, what can I do with this Tori code? Well, so this is Well, so this is maximally gapped out. There's no local degrees of freedom that remains because my algebra was maximal. So there must be some topological charge associated with those flipped terms at the boundary subsystem. So let's draw that like this. And my first question is: Is there any string operator that connects? Is there any string operator that connects to these two extinctions, one at the bottom boundary and the other at the top boundary? So this now is my extra dimension. And this is extended direction. Whatever string operator there is, the requirement is that it only violates the Hamiltonian terms at the end. Hamiltonian terms at the end. In the middle, everything must commute with the Hamiltonian, but what's my Hamiltonian there? It's all z trivial ones. It commits with a trivial ones, so we must be able to erase that. And these excitations then must not be topological. I mean, it must be locally created. That's my definition of topological charge. So there does not exist any non-trivial. So, there does not exist any non-trivial string operator that connects the bottom patch and the upper patch. So, any topological excitation should move around within one patch, and the bottom side is its own, it's independent. Then we resort to the we can consider the quadratic forms. That describes the topological spin in that two-dimensional of Hamiltonian topological order. Well, in general, this is very hard object to speak about. If you give me arbitrary two-dimensional Hamiltonian, then how can I define the quasi-particle? That's the first question. And beyond that, how can I define the spin? And then you talk about quadratic form. And there are a lot of steps to be done. But in this particular case, To be done, but in this particular case of Pauli, commuting Hamiltonian, everything can be done, and there is a well-defined quadratic form that is non-degenerate. And due to the fact that what I just showed, that there does not exist any string operator that connects the bottom and upper sheets, this quadratic form must be in a direct sum of up and down. Where is this valued? Well, I was. Is this valued? Well, I was considering only the Pauli operator, so everything is valued in Z2. But quadratic form over Z2 is well known. They are classified, well, there are exactly two classes. One class is trivial class, one that is described by just XY on the two-dimensional vector space over F2. And the other is To and the other is non-trivial quadratic form living in the same space. This corresponds to the self and mutual statistics of the toric code. This corresponds to the topological spin of the three fermion model. So that's the only possibility. So from the assumption that From the assumption that there exists a basically gapped Hamiltonian for the boundary, I deduced that each piece, each invertible algebra can only support either the torico, the trivial case, or the three-ferminal case. So that gives me a classification of the embarkable. Holy convertible sub algebra come in two classes and because of the relation between the invertible outside invertible subalgebra and QCA, there exists only C2. Two different UCA and three Yes, this part is not written yet, but I expect to finish writing soon. So I will stop here. Will stop here. Yeah, thank you. All right, thank you very much, Jeremy.
