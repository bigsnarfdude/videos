To introduce Robert McCohan from Northeastern University. The title of his talk is Gilbert-Serian Equation and Lipsis Regularity. Thank you, Igor. And I'd like to thank the organizers for putting together a very interesting conference. And when I expressed interest in participating, I was anxious to learn more about malinear potential theory because I hadn't worked in this area. Because I hadn't worked in this area. And then, when I got the invitation to speak, I had to decide what to talk about. But Vladimir and I had just obtained a very modest but very interesting result just a couple of months ago. And it seemed to me that it would be of interest to the members of this conference. And it seems it does have some points of tangency. So I'll try to point those out. And I would like to recognize Vladimir Moscow. Would like to recognize Vladimir Mazia, who has logged on and is watching. And it's an honor to work with him. He's, of course, been mentioned in several of the previous talks. So I want to, let's see, how do I get this to advance? There we go. So here's the outline of this talk. So first we'll just go as an introduction statement of the problem and of the objectives. Of the objectives, and then some background, a little historical background. It will probably be pretty repetitive from what we've already seen. And some recent results that are relevant for this study. And then our general theory, both results from about 11 years ago and things that we developed a couple months ago. And then the application to these Gilberg-Sarin equations. They're things that were introduced. They're things that were introduced in 1955. I'll say more about them when we get to it, but they provide some very interesting examples that illustrate certain behaviors, and they're easy to work with for us. So here's the equation that we're looking at. So a very simple, uniformly elliptic equation in divergence form. It's embarrassingly simple compared to all of the nonlinear equations we've been looking at here in divergence form. Been looking at here in divergence form. But here we're not even going to consider lower order terms or right-hand side because we're really interested just in how the regularity of the coefficients Aij affects the regularity of the solution u. So we'll assume that the Aij are symmetric, bounded, and measurable in an open set omega in dimension n bigger than or equal to 2. We'll assume that zero is in the open set and we'll denote the ball radius centered at zero. Radius centered at zero by B rho, and we'll always assume that B rho's closure is contained in omega, and usually rho is small. So here's the objective. We want to see conditions on the Aijs that imply that every weak solution of the equation is either Lipschitz at zero. So of course that affects just the difference of u of x and u of zero, which should be bounded by a constant. zero should be bounded by a constant times absolute x for x in the ball radius rho or Lipschitz near x equals zero so here of course we have u of x minus u of y an absolute value bounded by a constant times the absolute value of x minus y in other words the gradient will be bounded on the ball a differentiable just at x equals zero in other words the gradient of u exists at zero or c1 near x equals zero so So the gradient is continuous in the ball. So background again, obviously you've heard these names and results before, but again, it provides a nice back kind of sets the stage for what we're going to be looking at. So when the constants are just bounded, then the solution will be in C alpha for some alpha. It's the results of DeGeorgi, Nash, and Moser. Moser. When the coefficients are constant, then the gradient will be in L P loc for P between one and infinity, consequence of the classic results of Eggman, Doklis, and Nirenberg. And when the Aijs are VMO, then the same result applies. Again, P between one and infinity. The results of Chirenza, Frasca, and Longo in the non-divergence case and define. Nondivergence case and the Fasio in the divergence case. But when the coefficient is just constant, we're not going to be able to get p equals infinity. So there's some examples in the paper by Jin Mazia and von Schaftingen in 2009 that illustrate this. On the other hand, if the Aij have more regularity than continuity, namely Dini continuity, then the gradient will be in L infinity and in fact will be C1. In L infinity, and in fact, will be C1. And as far as I know, the earliest result in this was Hartmann and Wintner in 1955, but there could be something earlier. I don't know. So more on the Dini condition, first of all, modulus of continuity. So I think we all know what the modulus of continuity is, and we'll be assuming that the modulus of continuity is a continuous non-decreasing function on zero infinity with omega of zero is equal to zero. And then we say the coefficients are DNA. And then we say the coefficients are Dini continuous if this modulus of continuity satisfies the Dini condition, namely omega of r divided by r is integrable at zero. We'll just be integrating zero up to half because a lot of our functions will involve logarithms, so we want to stay away from one. But of course, it'd be integral zero up to epsilon just as easily. And so examples, well, the obvious classical one is omega bar is equal to r to the alpha, which equal to r to the alpha, which corresponds to holder continuity, but we'll more often be looking at omega of r is equal to absolute log r to the minus gamma for gamma bigger than one. So when gamma is bigger than one, this omega is satisfies the Dini condition. But if gamma is less than or equal to one, then it's not Dini. A generalization of this would be square Dini continuous. So Deni continuous. So the coefficients are square Deni continuous if the modulus of continuity satisfies that its square satisfies the Dini condition. In other words, omega squared divided by r is integrable at zero. And so looking at our example, omega of r is absolute log r to the minus gamma. If gamma is bigger than one half, then it's squared in e continuous. Of course, not for gamma less than a half. And in 2010, Vladimir and I published a paper that looked at the divergence form, and we assumed that the Aij were square Deni continuous at x equals zero and showed that Lipschitz continuity and differentiability at the point x equals zero reduced to stability properties of a dynamical system derived from the coefficients. And I'll be giving more detail about this later. Now, another condition that has gotten quite a bit of attention in the last decade or so is D Ni mean oscillation. So an integrable function has D Ni mean oscillation, abbreviated DMO, in omega if the following function, omega sub A of R satisfies the D Ni condition. So omega sub A of R is just the supremum over balls of radius r in omega of the oscillator. Omega of the oscillation over the ball. So the mean integral of over Br of the absolute value of A of y minus the mean of A over that ball. So as an example, if we look at A of x being absolute value of log absolute x quantity to the minus gamma in say omega being the ball of radius one half, then we half, then we can show that the function omega sub a is asymptotic to a constant times absolute log r to the minus gamma minus one. So by taking the oscillation here, we've increased the vanishing of A at zero. So we have minus gamma minus one instead of just minus gamma. And so A of x has D Ni mean oscillation for gamma bigger than zero, but a square D Ni only for But a square D only for gamma bigger than one half and D Ni only for gamma bigger than one. So D Ni mean oscillation wins this contest. So some results using D Ni mean oscillation. So a generalized in the sense of a nonlinear version of Deani mean oscillation was used by C and Ningione in their 2012 paper on a unified linear, nonlinear potential theory. Linear potential theory to obtain gradient bounds for weak solutions of quasi-linear elliptic equations. And the Dean-Mean oscillation condition was used by Dong and Kim in 2017 to show weak solutions of linear elliptic equations in divergence form are C1 and in non-divergence form are C2. And this has led to a series of applications to various linear elliptic and parabolic equations. As useful as Deny mean oscillation is, however, we'll see that there are equations of this simple form with coefficients that do not have DNA mean oscillation, but weak solutions can still be shown to be Lipschitz and C1 by other methods. So, let me describe our dynamical systems method to Systems method to studying regularity at a point. So the simplest case is when the point in question is zero and the coefficients, Aij of zero, is just delta ij. And of course, this can be achieved by a change of coordinates because the coefficients are symmetric. And in this case, we say that the Aij are squared in a continuous at x equals zero. continuous at x equals zero, if the supremum over absolute x equals r of a sub ij of x minus delta ij, an absolute value is less than omega r, where omega satisfies the Dini, square Dini condition. So instead of having Aij of X minus Aij of Y, we have just Aij at 0, which is delta ij. So that's why this condition is only assumed at x equals 0. Assumed at x equals zero. Now, the idea in the dynamical systems method is to write the solution in the following way. So we'll have three terms. We have u0 of absolute value of x plus a vector v of absolute value of x dotted with x plus the remainder term of u of x. And u naught of r is just the spherical mean of u over the sphere of. mean of u over the sphere of radius r and the vector function v is given by vk of r is equal to n divided by r times the spherical mean of u of r theta times theta k plus d theta, where theta is just x divided by r. And the behaviors of v of r and r v prime of r control by the prime of r controlled by the asymptotics of a dynamical system. Dynamical system is d phi dt plus r of e to the minus t phi is equal to zero for t is equal to minus log r going to infinity. And r is the n by n matrix given by the mean over the sphere of A of r theta, where capital A here is just the matrix Aij, minus A Aij minus n times that matrix, sorry, not times the matrix, times the outer product of the vectors A, theta, and theta. And this is an n by n matrix. It's not symmetric, but it controls the behavior of the solution. Now, the two stability properties. Now, the two stability properties that we want to use of this dynamical system, and therefore we'll be assuming of the dynamical system. One is uniform stability. So that is the statement that for any epsilon bigger than zero, there's a delta bigger than zero such that if the solution phi at t1 is less than delta, then phi of t is less than epsilon for all t bigger than t1. And this not only This not only implies that v and rv prime are bounded as r goes to zero, but after some analysis can be used to show that the difference between u0 of r and u0 of zero and of w, there are both going to be of order r omega of r as r goes to zero. And therefore, in our expansion, we can rewrite it as u of x is equal to u0 of r plus v of r dot. Of r dot x plus big O of r omega r. And in particular, then u is Lipschitz at x equals zero. The second property that we need for differentiability is that all solutions should be asymptotically constant. In other words, as t goes to infinity, the solution approaches a constant vector. And in that case, we have that v of r is going to be v of zero. That v of r is going to be v of zero, the limit as r goes to zero, plus little o of one. So, in fact, it has that limit v of zero. And so, this will show that u is differentiable at x equals zero. And these two conditions are independent of each other. And so we actually give an example of this in our 2010 paper, but it's kind of well known in Bandel systems. Of well known in Bandel systems. All right, so here's a statement of what we'll call theorem one from our 2010 paper. So we suppose that the Aij are squared uni continuous at x equals zero, and the dynamical system six is uniformly stable. Then every weak solution of our system of our equation is Lipschitz continuous at x equals zero. And in particular, we have the following bounds. have the following bounds. So the absolute value of u of x minus u of 0 is bounded by constant times the absolute x divided by rho times the L2 mean over the ball of radius rho for absolute x less than rho over 2. In addition to uniform stability, if we assume that every solution of the dynamical system is asymptotically constant, then you is Then u is differentiable at x equals zero. And we have a formula for the partial derivatives. And note that similar asymptotic results for elliptic equations and systems with coefficients with square DNI continuous, sorry, coefficients that are square Deni continuous at a point have been obtained by many authors, collaborators. Collaborators of Vladimir's, including Kozlov. They have a long series of papers and a book in 1999. So, this condition has been well used. So, again, this theorem one concerns regularity of point. And now we want conditions under which this extends to a neighborhood of x equals zero. So, this is theorem two. So, this is theorem two. So, we suppose that the Aij are squared uni continuous at x equals zero. The dynamical system six is uniformly stable. And we make the following hypothesis on the coefficients. We assume they're differentiable, and the derivative at x is bounded by a constant divided by the magnitude of x for x between zero and some number two rho. Then, every weak solution of one will be Lipschitz's continuity. Of one will be Lipschitz continuous in the ball of radius ρ, and we have a gradient estimate in terms of the L2 mean of U, and it's divided by rho for almost every x in the ball of radius rho. I don't know if I said mean, L2 mean over the ball of radius 2 rho. Moreover, we actually get that u is c1 in the whole ball. Ball and therefore 11 also holds for x in the whole ball. Now, just comments on the proof. So we're going to, what we use, I'm not going to go through the details, but it's just standard LP estimates for p greater than n involves away from x equals zero. And then we use the result from eight that allows us to go to x equals zero, and we obtain the And we obtain the estimate, the gradient estimate 11. And then to get the C1 character, we can modify the coefficients and get smooth coefficients, which have smooth solutions, UH, and then this gradient bound applies to them and shows that we have convergence to U in C1, and therefore U is in C1. So some remarks. So, some remarks. First of all, the assumption 10 that the gradient of the Aij is bounded by a constant divided by absolute X is stronger than necessary for gradient bounds. We could assume something involving a Dini modulus. For example, Aij of X minus Aij of Y and absolute values bounded by omega of absolute X minus Y divided by absolute X for X minus Y. Absolute x or x minus y less than absolute x divided by 2. And also, a recent paper by de Filippus and Mingione, will appear in the archive rational mechanic analysis, obtained gradient bounds, of course, for more general equations than this one, assuming the gradient of the coefficients belonged to a Lorentz space instead of satisfying the pointwise estimate that we used. All right, now we're going to turn to Gilbarg-Sarin equations. So, again, they introduced these coefficients in 1995 and used them both for divergence and non-divergence form operators. So, the Aij at R theta are given by delta ij plus g of r times theta i theta j, where theta i is again xi divided by r. It's a little remnants. It's a little reminiscent of the Meyer example. I hadn't heard of that, but certainly the theta i theta j is the same as was in that case. Of course, they were constant coefficients. Notice that g of r has got to be bigger than minus 1 plus epsilon in order to have uniform ellipticity. And if the g is continuous on 0 to infinity with g of 0 being 0, then the Aij will be continuous on our n. On our end. And we'll generally assume that g prime exists for r bigger than zero, but not for r equals zero. So that's where we're going to be introducing some sort of singularity that will affect the regularity of the solutions. So we want conditions on G that guarantee that any weak solution of U of 1 is again Lipschitz at. Is again Lipschitz at x equals zero, Lipschitz near x equals zero, differentiable at x equals zero, or c1 near x equals zero. So the nice thing about these Gilbarg-Sarin coefficients for us is this dynamical system reduces to a simple scalar ODE. d phi dt is equal to n minus 1 over n g of t times phi. So this, of course, So, this, of course, is easy to integrate. And so, we integrate it to find that it is uniformly stable if and only if the integral over G of the integral of G of tau d tau from S to T is bounded by a constant, which is finite, is bounded away from infinity for s and t going to infinity, bigger than some number, capital T. And all solutions. And all solutions are asymptotically constant if and only if the integral from t to infinity, g of tau d tau, converges to an extended real which is less than infinity. In other words, it could be a real number or minus infinity. And so using this, we realize that we have just shown the following proposition. So let G of R be squared uni continuous at zero and satisfy this condition. And satisfy this condition that was equivalent to uniform stability. But now, in terms of the r variable, it looks like integral r1 to r2, g of r over r dr, is bounded by a constant which is less than infinity for r1 and r2 possibly going to zero. Then every weak solution is Lipschitz at x equals zero. If in addition we have the condition that the solutions are asymptotic. That the solutions are asymptotically constant, when I mean the integral from 0 to 1 of g of r over r dr converges to an extended real number less than infinity, then u is differentiable at x equals 0. On the other hand, if we just assume 14 and that g is differentiable for r positive with the derivative satisfying r times g prime of r is less than constant, then u is going to be in c. Then U is going to be in C1. So, here, of course, we're using. Well, I think I say a little bit more about this. Let's see, do I forget? Sorry, no, I don't. All right, so this the last statement we were using the theorem, theorem two. So let's look at an example. So we'll look at g of r being negative absolute log r to the minus gamma for r between, say, 0 and e to the minus 1, where gamma is positive. is positive. Now we can show that the Aijs have Dini mean oscillation only for gamma bigger than one. So this factor of theta i theta j in the Aij has a big effect on the oscillation. And whereas without that, it was Deani mean oscillation for gamma bigger than zero. Now it's only for gamma bigger than one, which is the same as Deaning. It's no better than Deanie for this example. This example. So for gamma bigger than one, half g is squaredini, and it satisfies condition 14 for k equals 0 because g is negative. And it satisfies r times g prime of r is bounded by a constant. And so u is in c1 for gamma bigger than a half. So we have beat Dini mean oscillation in this case, but This case. But it naturally raises the question: what about gamma between zero and a half? We can't go below a half when we're dealing with square Dini. So we need a different method. So the other method we're going to use is a comparison principle. And we begin by noticing that with these coefficients, the equation one can be written in spherical coordinates in this form. So 1 over r to the n minus 1, partial. over r to the n minus one partial with respect to r of the quantity r to the n minus one times one plus g of r times partial u with respect to r plus one over r squared times the Laplacian of U, that is the Veltromi Laplace operator on the sphere. And we want to compare weak solutions of 16 with a positive finite energy solution of the ODE, 1 over r to the n minus 1 ddr. n minus 1 d dr applied to quantity r to the n minus 1 1 plus g of r dz dr minus n minus 1 over r squared z for r between 0 and 1 and so the lemma the comparison lemma that we get is we suppose that u is a weak solution of 16 the p to e 16 satisfying the extra condition that the integral over spheres is zero Is zero for r between the radius of the sphere zero and one. Then the comparison is that we have the L2 mean of U over spheres of radius R is bounded by a ratio, Z of R divided by Z of one times the L2 mean of U over the unit sphere. And And oh, I say comment on the proof, it uses a variational argument. So just to kind of point out that if you look at 16, you have that Veltrami-Laplace operator. Of course, the smallest positive eigenvalue is n minus 1. And we've achieved that because we've assumed that our solution is orthogonal to the constants. So that's the connection. Constants. So that's the connection between 16 and 17, and the rest is just a variational argument. This enables us to obtain proposition two. So if z of r satisfies z is positive, but bounded above by a constant times r as r goes to zero, then every weak solution of r Of our original equation one is Lipschitz continuous at x equals zero because of the comparison with z. In addition, if r times g prime of r is bounded by constant for r between zero and two r, then u is c1 in the ball and satisfies the gradient estimate that we had before. So, just something about the proof here. Just something about the proof here. So, we simply use the previous lemma, the comparison lemma, and the DeGeorgi estimate that the soup of u over ball radius delta is bounded by the L2 norm of u over the ball radius 2 delta. To conclude that u is Lipschitz at x equals zero, and then the remaining conclusions follow from theorem two. All right, so let's. All right, so let's go back to our example one and see what this does for us. So g of r, remember, was minus absolute log r to the minus gamma, where gamma is bigger than zero. So we can apply asymptotic analysis to the ODE17 that Z satisfies to show that the finite energy solution satisfies Z of R is less than or equal to a constant times R. And so this proposition 2 says that U is going to be C1 for all gamma bigger than 0. bigger than zero. Whereas recall that the Aijs in this case have Diny mean oscillation only for gamma bigger than one. Now what about a condition for a non-Lipschitz function? So now suppose that the G of R, the G of R is squared eni continuous at zero and satisfies that the Limbs soup as R goes to zero of the integral from R up to one half G of rho over rho d rho. One half g of rho over rho d rho is plus infinity. And also assume that g of r has finite variation, i.e., the integral from zero to half of absolute g prime of r, dr is finite. Then there exists a weak solution in d rho that is not Lipschitz at x equals zero. Also, if we have g of r positive for r less than infinity, then we do not. For r less than infinity, then we do not require g of r to be square Deni continuous for the conclusion to hold. So, this finite variation enables us to use classical asymptotic analysis. The square Dini condition simply sharpens that analysis. But if G is positive, then we don't need that sharper analysis in order to conclude the solution is not Lipschitz. So, just to explain what we have in mind, of course, u of x will simply be z of r times the first eigenfunction for the Beltrami-Laplace operator on the sphere. And z is that finite energy solution of 17. And by asymptotic analysis, this condition 20 implies that there is the sequence Rj going to zero such that Rj. Going to zero such that rj to the minus one z of r j goes to infinity. So u is not Lipschitz at x equals zero. So let's go back to our example, except we're going to change the sign. So we'll call it one prime. So g of r is now positive log r to the minus gamma for r between zero and minus one and gamma greater than zero. So for gamma bigger than the gamma, zero. So for gamma bigger than one, this is dini, so all solutions are c1. But for gamma between zero and one inclusive, we have g of r positive, and condition 20 holds, and we have finite variation. So we conclude there is a weak solution that is not Lipschitz continuous at x equals zero. So the example one was all The example one was all monotonic. So let's look at an oscillatory example. So the following g of r oscillates as r goes to zero. We have sine of absolute log r divided by log r to the beta, where beta is positive. So this satisfies the condition that r times g prime of r is bounded by a constant as r goes to zero. And if we integrate from zero up to e to the minus one, g of r divided by r. minus one g of r divided by r d r we translate that to our t variable we can write it as the integral from one to infinity of sine tau over tau to the beta d tau and this will converge to a real number because the numerator here is periodic and the denominator is enough that the quotient is going to zero. Quotient is going to zero. So, like an alternating series. For beta bigger than one-half, g of r is squaredini, so we can use proposition one. But for all beta greater than zero, we can use asymptotic analysis to find that z of r is bounded by constant times r, so we can use proposition two and to conclude that all weak solutions are C1. And note that it can be shown that the AIJs with this geo. The Aijs with this G of R satisfy D Ni mean oscillation only for beta greater than one, so we beat D Ni mean oscillation again. So in conclusion, let me just make two summary remarks. First of all, there are uniformly elliptic equations in divergence form for which the coefficients do not have any mean oscillation, yet we can show by other means that all weak solutions are C1. And the second is that the model, the equations of Gilbarg and Sarin that we use also provide examples with continuous coefficients for which there are weak solutions that are not Lipschitz continuous. Thanks for your attention. Thank you very much for your extremely interesting talk. Any questions? Any questions or comments? Questions. So is there any hope for a general theory that covers your example one in full? You mean all of by a general theory, you mean for not. By a general theory, you mean for not that specific example? Yeah, some class of conditions. Well, we have that theorem too. But like I said, it's not, you know, we're assuming more than we need and assuming the gradient of the AIJs satisfy that decay condition. But we formulate it that way rather than some more general one because for the application to the Gilbarg-Sarin examples, it's natural to just assume something. examples it's natural to just assume something about g prime um and uh so i mean that it will have that condition satisfied g prime uh is bounded by one over r so um probably there's you know it can be uh made more um made more general than it is yeah okay thank you any other questions well if not let us thank the speaker Let us thank the speaker again for the talk, and okay, so let me stop the recording and
