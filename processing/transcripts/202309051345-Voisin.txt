Yes, I thank the organizers for inviting me to this conference and to this beautiful place. As mentioned by Kizan yesterday, I am going to discuss, in fact, a very special case of the so-called Bobil-Bozin conjecture, which is the following conjecture on the towering of hypercale, protective hypercaleborgh manifold. So let's be reproductive ultra killer manifold and the cycle on X which is in the algebra generated. Which is in the algebra generated by divisor classes and the churn classes of X or the polynomial in divisor classes and in the churn classes of X or here it belongs to okay here I mentioned only the even degree churn classes because the odd degree churn classes vanish because the Coton Lamben. Because the Cotangland bundle is isomorphic to the tangent bundle. And then the conjecture says the following meaning: that if the cycle class of Z, the homological cycle class of Z is a zero. Then already here the cycle then is Vanishes in charge. So, in other words, all the topological relations between cycles are already satisfied at the level of char groups. So, there are a few instances where the conjecture is known. And, of course, the first case is a case of getrices, which was at the Which was at the origin of this development. And so the case of Katrina services. So this was done by Alboville and myself around 2002. And the statement is exactly saying the following that for any deep In the divisor class on a gatory surface, there is the following relation that the d square is the degree of d square times c2 of x over 24 in c zero of x. Well, it's the results. Schiller and so there is no torsion. So, um, well, the numerical equality is obvious, and the statement is this equality, and of course, it's non-trivial because that group is very big, it is much bigger than the corresponding topological counterpart, which is just given by the debris. Okay, so this is the first known case, and then over the years, there have been. Yes, there have been several particular instances. So I did the case of one thing, it's the case of the fernobarity of line of lines of a cubic for fall. A smooth cubic foul fall. So, this is a final variety of land. So, by your Bovine and Donaghi, we know that this is a hypercolor forfall. And I proved that this statement holds for it. And then more further results were. The further results were obtained by Yefu. That was a case of hypercolor manifolds of generalized commercial data. And still more recently, by Mulik and Neguta. This is a case of sorry, it's not of generalized commercial type, it's an important point. Generalized Kumar type means that the generalized commerce, including their deformation, but here it's just for the generalized commercial and efforts. And similarly, Mollik and Negut lead the case of. Leads a case of a projective train. So there is another thing that I want to mention that in this conjecture, if you remove the term classes, you just get a conjecture about the sub-algebra or the... Sub-algebra or the jaw ring which is generated by divisor classes, and in that case, what the conjecture is called is due to Bovil. So So the conjecture is the so-called Bovil weak splitting conductor. It is a weak splitting in the sense that the mobile has a splitting conductor which is for the whole motive and the including a multi-plicativity conductor. Multiplicativity conjecture exactly as explained by Kiseng yesterday. And if you apply it to computing your child groups, then you get this formulation, which is more modest and geometrical. And there is an interesting result on this Boville weak spitting conjecture, which is due to Which is which is due to Laurie So she she studied the the Beauville Wick spitting conductor for Lagrange. For Lagrangian fiber, the hypercolor manifold. So, and she put the following when I say we are hyperkelomanifold, I always mean a productive manifold. Phyrmaniform then if x satisfies maybe is x plus its deformation the SYZ conjecture X satisfied the above. The above weak splitting conjecture. So, the SYZ conjecture is about the existence of Lagrangian vibrations associated with line bundles of so-called isotropic line bundles or any isotropic line bundle. Line bundle, which is in the boundary of the so-called birational Kerkun induce the Lagrangian vibration rational Lagrangian vibration. So, this is this statement curious because the x already comes equipped with the Lagrangian fibrous fun. But the point is that suppose that the Peter number is two, then there is a submonde isotropic class. And for her proof, she also needs the existence of a Lagrangian fibration associated with the other isotropic class. That's why. Class. That's why finally she needs this SYD conjecture while she already has a Lagrangian fibrosis. Okay, so I think it's more or less all that is known or what I know about this result, but so what I want to say on the general conjecture. So today I am going to To as in the risk case, I have to study the Boville-Bausan conjecture for Lagrangian fibered fibration. And I am going to study only very specific relations in this tautological towering, which So, the relationships that I'm going to study, I will call them the real beautiful, I will call them the Weibrischi relations. They are very interesting. They are very interesting because they are general. They exist for any particular manifold, so you don't have to specify a certain geometric tape. So And this is the following: let X be a hypercolor of dimension 2A and let the so for any alpha in H2 of X, I do not specify for sufficiency to prove it for alpha in a R. Alpha in the martial comology such that u of alpha is equal to zero. The following relations, if you consider alpha to the n minus k plus one in the In the economy of Xi top of X belongs to H4I of XQ is a polynomial, let's say monomial in a degree to I In the grade two iron in the topological channel faces of X round the Y is greater than it works okay. So, of course it's a facility. It's a facy it's efficient to to do the case where uh I can't okay so these relations are very beautiful so let me explain where they come from so I I I call them the vibration Fermiski relations because if you do not have the do not put the term classes here Put the channel classes here. So, yeah, then you will get only the powers of the grade two comedy classes. These are the parameters correlations which generate the ideal of relations in SIM H2 to the common of X. And the name of Weibris comes from the fact that From the fact that he when studying the Riemann-Rohr polynomial of a line bundle on a hypercalor manifold, of course, by the general Riemann-Rohr formula, you get to compute such numbers and you want to give a formula, and that's That's the way he went to this. So, maybe let's explain. So, the reason for this explanation. For this vanishing, this is simply that by now you consider the case where alpha is a complex coefficient and it is so it's almost a definition of the Boville-Bogobanov form that appears here. The form that appears here and so it defines quadratic Q equals rho inside as H2 of X C and what we know by the deformation theory of Of hypercalorial manifolds. That's an open set, an open set, of course, an analytic open set of Q consists of classes sigma X T generating. Generating the space H20 of XT, where XT is a deformation, a small deformation of X. And now on X still, of course, the topological channels are still so CI. Ci Xt is a class, of course, this is a Hodger class, so it is a of Hodger table to I to I now so well sigma Xt to the N minus K plus one is of type two n minus two k plus two zero. And so finally, the vanishing intelligence from the venue from a tape rather than a category. And you see that you get the vanishing even at the level of forms on the deformation of X. And as it is true for this alpha in an analytic open set, that will be true for any alpha in the Q. Okay, so the Okay, so these are the relations that I want to study in the context of the Google Boza conjecture. So So now I consider the general fiber. Hyperkelo manifold, protective, and Lagrangian line model that will be by definition associated to this hybrid that will be a pull pullback of uh off a line bundle on uh bit. Line bundle on a bit, which I will assume to be arbitrarily ample. Well, in fact, I will consider them in the CH1 of X, and I will assume this H anti-linear in Poland. So, and of course, we know that Q of if you do L. So, there's a topological channel class of L it is isotopic both by the isotopic formula and the fact that That we have a list because L is pulled back from B. So I have these isotropic classes that are divisor classes and the Bubil-Bosin conjecture combined with this vanishing. Predict the following that as I said, the L will consider it as an element of CH1 of X, that we have L to the N minus K plus 1 C I. Ci of X is equal to zero in the tower group of X times of Q for R greater than or equal to K and Ci of X a monomial. So that will be n So that will be in much of the material. In the chat reflect of hand. Okay. So so this is uh this was uh formulated yesterday by um by Kizai too. Like design too. Again, it shows that you can do the case, you can restrict to the case where i equal to k. The reason why I formulate it like this is that I want to do an induction assumption. So an induction argument. Okay, so this is the conjecture. So now let me state a few results. I am not really happy about these results because. Happy about this result because, in fact, what I did is very small results showing that showing it's also easy. The conjecture is very easy if instead of considering monomials in the channel classes, you put the channel classes themselves. It's a one-line argument. But when you put monomials already for C2 squared, which is Already for C2 square, which is the smallest monomial that you can imagine. I cannot do it. I could not do it in full generality. So I think it's related to that question of multiplicativity that has been mentioned yesterday by Kizeng. So let me state my results. So the first one is that this holds for the channel classes themselves. So namely L minus Q plus P1. n minus q plus one c2i of x is equal to the rho in ch of x if i should need to be the channels here themselves and for the the ramb that will be one particular case of the conjecture for situation square so the the For example, L, so you have one case. So what is predicted in general is vanishing Ln minus one C2 square. And I can prove this for in that case, n is equal to five. For example, when X is a is a Lazan sequer Bosin manifold. So they have three dimensional Michel manifolds, which are the deformations of Ogardi manifolds associated with the Getri surfaces. And they are obtained by the Lagrangian fibered over P5 dual, and they are associated with the cubic forephone. And they are obtained by the compactive filling, the intermediate Jacobian vibration, which over a point here. A point here associates the intermediate fibers, the intermediate Jacobian of the cubicle 34 defined by a hydraptic in P5. So now, why these LSV manifolds? I mean, the statement will just be very particular. Particular. There is a itself. This is a particular case of a statement that is not unconditional. That will concern. So this is a more general version, but which needs assumption. Again, I will be in this context of Lagrangian fiber projective hyperkela manifold, and I consider this. And you can prove this under a number of conditions, which are as follows. So well, I mean, the first assumptions are just generic assumptions, or not generic, at least not too restrictive. So there is no singular fibers in co-dimension one and B. The second assumption is that, well, so maybe let me introduce right now annotation that will be used. So in general, I will denote by xl. So this is also x equals l or x compared. X equals L or X greater than or equal to L or L. Okay, so this is a La Sign where F has rank L and here's the locus where the rank of F is uh none greater than L. Is non-greater than l so this is closed and this is only a locally closed okay and so the critical locus is exactly xn minus one what I what I want is that if I consider the xn minus one yes let me also deny The image may be of well, BL will be the image of XL and B smaller than equal to L will be the image of. Okay, so what I want is that the general fiber is irreducible. It will be very clear. It will be very clear that it is an abelian variety of dimension n minus one. And here I have an assumption which is again, I can hope that is not too restrictive. It is a transversality assumption. For the variation of all geostructure that you have, in this family, so it's this family of abelian varieties of dimension n minus one over the discriminant hypersurface assumption is slightly stronger than the fact that. Stronger than the fact that this family of abelian varieties has a maximal modulus. The map from b n minus one to the modular space of abelian varieties of dimension n minus one rather generically maximal r so it is slightly stronger but then for example if n minus one is a four it is equivalent and the last assumption which is the the one which is absolutely not um not um Not which is, I think, very restrictive, is the fact that Bn minus one that is a discriminant hypersurface is rationally connected. Of course, it is singular, but I take a dissing of that when I want that it is not. Want that it is this simulation is connected and rationally connected, so they can see a small quality model and then under this assumption that I get this so I want to just to explain why this assumption is very restrictive and why it holds in my case. It holds in my case. It's very simple because in the case of the LSV manifold, the discriminant hypersurface, it is the locus of singular hyperplane sections of the cubic fourfold. These are the singular hyperplane sections. They form exactly the dual hypersurface to the cubic hypersurface. So it So it has for normalization, the cubic itself, so it is rationally connected. So that's why this assumption, which is absolutely not generic, is satisfied in that case. And that's why the other assumptions are quite easy to check are just assumptions of as I said, it's not very restrictive. Absolutely. So that's the point. So that's the point I want to make. For the Hilb and Ketri, the conjecture is known already, but if you want to do it for the Bovil McKay system, that is you take a Ketri surface with a polarization of genus G, and basically that will be the family of Jacobians of the G-dimensional linear system, of course, of genus G. In that case, the discriminant In that case, the discriminant hyper surface, it will be also the dual hyper surface to the Ketry surface embedded by its linear system of dimensional energy. But the dual hyper surface, it is not rationally connected, it has for the base, it has the K3 surface itself. And so if I wanted to apply this strategy in that case, I will presumably, maybe that could work by. Could work by using again the Boville, the original Boville Bois relation for the K3 surface. So I wanted to make that point to show that I need it's not really a formality, I need some more geometric input on the child works of this of this restricted vibration Xn minus one. x n minus 1 over the b n minus 1. Okay, so so these are the results. So I'm going to explain the proof. Not that I know, and that's the best picture of the situation. So I want to prove this relationship and I wish about your induction. I do it by your introduction on I so for example well it's clear that if I equal to zero it's exactly the relation that I already mentioned because L is pulled back from B also for ideal for For I in general, if I do I equal one, well and here chant places of higher degree, it's very easy because the L L to the L, it is in the throes, it is a union of fibers of the Lagrangian vibration. The fibers are abelian variants. On abelian varieties, the tangent bundle is trivial. The normal bundle is also trivial because Because there are fibers. And so finally, the channels is of the total space restricted to the fibers. It is real. So the case where i equals one is also obvious. So now I do the following. So I choose sigma one to sigma n minus i plus one to be the general sections of n. Of L, and as L is generated by section by Bertini this section, we define X sigma delta, which is smooth smooth of goodimension and the colour. dimension n minus i plus one and so I have this this complete intersection so the normal bundle in that sequence is very simple namely I get O x sigma dot of minus minus L which injects into major differential into the differential into omega x respective to x this x sigma dot and of course so this the class of this x x sigma dot is is l minus i plus one that means that i just have to to restrict my tangent bundle to this x sigma and see what what happens so i have this uh injection So, I have this injection of vector bundles. And this vector bundle, of course, it has this autoduality given by the non-degenerate two-form on X. And so I have the dual. So this is L f upper star. I don't know what you want to say. The differential, in fact, and of course, using this like I Using this, I can dualize this map. So I will have also this d sigma dot dual, which maps to, so here there is a problem, which maps to Ox sigma dot of L to the N minus I plus one. And this one now is a surjective map. So here I have an injective map, here I have a surjective map, and in the middle. In the middle, I will have some comology. Yes, so the Lagrangian condition. It says exactly that if you combine, if you compose both, this is the room, and so. And so finally, you can introduce a vector bundle, which is the K Sigma joule or Em Desigma. And this vector bundle has rank so if each vector bundle on x. is a vector bundle on x sigma dot and the rank of a is uh two i minus two and so you get that this is zero this is a vanishing on x sigma dot And now this is finished because you see how the A is across the panel, it is a homology of a sequence which involves this vector bundle, this vector bundle, our bread back from B, and the omega x. So it's quite easy to see that you have a formula like Okay, and you will have something like a sigma of alpha g delta maybe. And finally, this is finished because I know that this is zero, and this one will be zero in charge of x. In a chair of X and I push forward to X by induction. And finally, I conclude that I have this vanishing not in X sigma, but when I pull back, it will be zero in CHX. But when I push forward, this is the CHX. This is exactly C2i of X ln minus i plus 1 that I get. So this is a proof and you see, but here formal in factories, essentially no geometry. And now I want to discuss the C2 and the The C2 and C2 square, and especially this term, Ln minus 1, C2 square. So, first of all, exactly before, the Ln minus 1, it is the restrict obtained by considering the restriction of the vibration F over a curve in B. So, maybe I am going to move. So, can we get rid of this? Like this complete intersection curve in B. So the point that I want to make is that we don't know that B is smooth, but we know that B is normal. Is normal. So that means that that implies that the singular locus has two dimensions which is two. And so the C is contained in the regular locus of the vibration. So from now on, I am going to discuss To discuss the restriction of the Lagrangian vibration over the regular locus of G. Now, over this smooth locus, I have something I have the differential map here. It's a part of the differential map. So on X ray, there is a there is a differential differential morphism of f my assumption that is here um well the lagrangian assumption says that generically this has a rank n and the image is is totally isotropic in omega x the assumption that is uh that is uh here That is here. It implies the following. So, I have this bundle morphism, and I have, exactly as before, I have its dual. So, I have F lower star here, which is like this. So, the Lagrangian condition says that L flower star composed with L flower star is equal to zero. Equal to zero. This has the generic run n, and this is the generic crank n. This is generically injective, of course, because f is dominant. So certainly something like that. And the co-kernel here will be torsion supported on xn minus one. Now, the point is that this assumption here is needed to show that this sequence is exact in the middle. The only place to prove where you have to say something is to prove the exact. Is uh to prove the exactness in the middle. Here it's my definition of G, et cetera. And for this, I need it's not true. So now I have my one and I have this exact sequence, and I can use the Whitney formula. And thanks to the Whitney formula. There are no singularities in condemnation one and B. That is sorry. It's not just a term. Another way to say it is that the x the locus x n minus one has co-dimension two. So you can imagine one year this is a useful Imagine one this is the use in the exactness, proving the exactness here. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, so thanks to this assumption, I have this exact sequence, and associated with this exact sequence, I have a Witney formula. Which will say that C2, sorry, yes, C2 of X will be a certain coefficient time L square plus C two of G or maybe it's plus or minus point and this G is it is supported on X n minus one in fact sort of a generic line bundle of this X n minus one sort of generic line bundle of this x and minus one so in fact it is the same as again there is a plus or minus the class of x and minus one okay so now i want to to to keep this class with ln minus one so this is true on uh So, this is true on a binary rega on X rega. But as I said, when I am going to cap with Ln minus one, I care only about this X reg and when I cap with this Ln minus one, this term disappears. And I conclude that C two of X Ln minus one, it is the same as the class of Xn minus one. The class of xn minus one intersected with this xn minus one, which as I said is represented by this x c. And now for the same reason, I will conclude that c2 of x square ln minus one it is the That will be the I just say that x n minus one restricted to itself, it is a normal bundle of x n minus one in x. So it is represented by n x n the normal bundle of x n minus one in x, which is a wrong two vector bundle intersected with x and c. Excellency in CH so you have this this thing to to so not yeah so I first intersect X C with X N minus one and then I have to And then I have to intersect again with xn minus one, which produces this. Okay, maybe I should write it in the form of a restriction. Now, the situation is like this. So, you have I have my bn minus one, and I have my curve. This is my discrete. Have my curve, this is my discriminant hypersurface. I have my curve C, it will intersect infinitely many parts. I will have over this, I will have the Xn minus one. So when I intersect, I get a sum over all these intersection points. Over all these intersection points where the curve meets the discriminant Hyper surface of the C2 of this normal bundle restricted to the fibers XN minus 1 D. And this is this class that I want to compute inside X. And what is And what is very nice is that individually each of these contributions, so the X and minus 1B, as I show in a minute, they are abelian varieties. These classes, they are in general absolutely non-zero. We know that they are topologically trivial, but non-zero. And I have to show that the sum of this contribution. To show that the sum of this contribution is trivial. So, okay, and so now you said we should stop. And now I want to state results which concern concerns It's a general structure result, which is maybe obvious in the case of Xn minus one, more interesting in the general case of the Loci XL. So that is the following. The dimension of B L B L is smaller than or equal to L. So it's completely triggered because B L is the image of X L along X L F has wrong at most L by F has wrong at most L so F restricted to X L has wrong none greater than L. So the image is just because the wrong Now, what is more interesting that the dimension of x equal l over is at least n and the third parameter is the following. Assume On the equality in one and two, then the general fiber of X of this fibrous line is a Is a finite union, the finite disjoint union of L-dimensional abelian varieties XLV and furthermore if you consider the If you consider the normal bundle of XL over X, so now the X L will have a dimension 2L. This normal bundle restricted to these abelian varieties. This is homogeneous. This is the homogeneous vector bundle. Homogeneous, or XLB, it's a finite union of abelian guarantees, so it has a group structure that acts on itself by translation. And I am saying that the normal bundle is a homogeneous vector bundle that is isomorphic to itself when you translate it. So I'm not sure I have much time to explain this. Maybe it's better than that. Well, I wanted to explain more how I conclude the proof here. So let me conclude the proof. Now, so I apply this to L equals N minus one. So what I am interested precisely in this normal bundle restricted to the fibers. The fibers, they are abelian varieties of dimension n minus one. And this is here, a wrong two vector bundle, which I know is a homogeneous. Homogeneous, that means that homogeneous. Homogeneous on the Debelian varieties, that means that either it is an extension of two torsion line bundles by itself, and in that case, the C2 so Okay, so there are two sorts of homogeneous vector bundles: the non-tradial extensions or simply the direction like this, where L will be in peak zero. So that means that, so in this case, the C2 will be M square, so it's. So C2 will be M square, so it is a distortion, so it is a zero in Chao. In this square, it is absolutely non-zero. In this case, this contribution here will be L square. So I have to sum, to understand the sum of these contributions that are individually non-trivial in minus in CH2 of X and minus one day. So So, I have to explain why how the proof works at the end. Thanks to this transversality assumption, so there is a plan due to Yves Andre, as part of the sound that has been approved by you. I conclude that the locus of point in BA minus one where the line model L is of torsion is dense, topologically dense in B. So there are plenty. So, there are plenty of points where it is obstruction. And also, one point is that this VN is rationally connected. And that implies that all these contributions here, they are the same in CH of X. So they are the same. And for some points, they are the O because points for the land of this obstruction. And finally, that's the way. I need a way, but you see, I need all the all these assumptions, in particular, this unwanted assumption.
