Set within that space, look at compact sets that contain an irrational number. So look at all compact subsets that contain an irrational number. That's an analytic set that is not Borel. This is a theorem of Furebich from the 30s. So there are things of this sort. Instead of differentiable functions and 0, 1 is also co-analytic, right? The set of differentiable functions is co-analytic, yes, but continuously differentiable is not co-analytic. Okay, yes, correct. Yeah, yes, the set of differentiable functions is co-analytic, not Borel. But if you, yes, this funny thing is if it's differentiable with continuous derivative, it's Borel and it is pi zero three in that hierarchy that I mentioned. So there's many, essentially, if you write something Something there's this thing where you write something with an existential quantifier that is not countable. So you write a definition, and the definition involves saying something, there is something, a real number or an element of a Banach space that something holds. And there is no structural reasons for a different definition that would eliminate that quantifier. It's very likely this set is analytic and is not boreal. And it's not boring. So it's actually many sets like that. I mean, it's net resulting. Oh, yes, sure. I mean, but this will be, so there are these equivalence relations, right? On so equivalence relations of measure preserving transformations. So the equivalence of isomorphism of measured preserving transformations. So these maths and Measure preserving transfer. So this is Matt's and Benji's result, even ergodic ones. This is an analysis. So this is now a subset of measured preserving transformation product. So you have measured preserving transformations of the interval 0, 1, Lebesgue measure. You can make it into a Polish space. You consider transformations up to measure 0. So that's a Polish space. And then you take the product, measure preserving transformations. And then you take the product, measure preserving transformations, cross-measure-preserving transformations. This is a product of two Polish spaces. And inside of it, you consider the set of pairs of, so this is in the product of measure-preserving transformations that are isomorphic to each other. So conjugate by another measure-preserving transformation. That's a set, and this set is analytic and it's not Borel. So that's an example like that. So there's many. Like that, so there's many other consider similar examples of conjugacy. Consider conjugacy, we'll say what the conjugacy conjugacy of finite dimensional matrix certain type of existential definition could say there, but another matrix that only right, okay? So like it appears as analytic, however. Uses analytic. However, it is Borel because Jordan canonical form gives you an algorithm algorithm. That if you want to compute the Jordan canonical form of the two matrices, then the matrices are conjugate if and only if the Jordan canonical forms are equal. So this gives you a Borel algorithm to determine conjugacy. So it says the Borel, even though you define it initially, the existing quantifier. But you know, you use linear algebra. So, yeah. So, yeah, but you know, systems, that is what we are about. Just yeah, the definition is the best. For people interested in dynamics, there's a Borel side and a unit square, and there's a continuous transformation of the unit square and the unit square. So the set of what they call special apolynic points, that's an analytic set that's not Borel. So you can, so a natural dynamical thing associated to it that can be a non-Borel. thing associated to it that can be a not Borel set. There's a Borel set on the unit square and there's a continuous map on the unit square in the unit square. Now there's a dynamical system on the unit square in R2 such that when you compute this, there's a natural thing called the special alpha limit set associated to a dynamical system. You can construct it that comes out analytic complete. So it's not correlated. So in other words, you can very simple dynamical system where the continuous Very simple dynamical system, a continuous function on this unit squared. But the morphisms are removed, mean around substituted by entropy. Their entropy is equal by an yeah, but it's only for a small subset of the profession in general. And where does we should miss my stream and done time or no? Yes. Another question. Measurable, non-analytic setup. Yeah, Slavic, there's a question in the chat for examples of measurable but non-analytic sets. Oh, well, there's okay, so you know, you cannot get a so. So there would be, for example, co-analytic sets. All co-analytic sets are measurable because they are complements of analytic sets. And they are not. So take an analytic set that is not Borel. Its complement is going to be a co-analytic set. Cannot be Borel. Therefore, it will not be analytic, right? Because it's co-analytic. If it were analytic, it would be Borel. So it is not analytic, this complement. So, it is not analytic, this complement, but it will be measurable because analytic sets are measurable, so their complements are measurable. So, take any analytic subset of the interval 0, 1 that's not Borel, its complement is going to be measurable. But there is a huge difference, right? And just in cardinality, take any subset of measure of the interval 0, 1 of measure 0 that is uncountable. For example, the one-third counter set. All subsets of that. All subsets of that, this one-third counterset, all subsets of it are measurable. They have measure zero. But there is many more of them than analytic sets. There is two to the continuum of subsets of the counter set. So you can cook up some really strange subset of the counter set. It's going to have measure zero, but it will be just very far from being analytic. So you can produce them like that too. They're only continuum many analytics. Yes. Okay, so I guess we'll end the Q ‚Åá A session here. And I think Steve's talking next. So we maybe need a minute or two to transition. Maybe we can do the federal ecosystem later. What? Now, do we have a question? Now do a question session for Federico maybe later. Yeah, let's schedule it. Maybe on Friday Friday morning, maybe. Oh, you leave it off. Yes. I mean, it's 15 minutes, so I think we have 40 minutes. Well, I want to ask you something. I want to ask him more than 15 minutes. I guess we started the recording crop.
