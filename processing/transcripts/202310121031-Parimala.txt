Thank you so much for the beautiful bold discussions. And I also would like to be back here, to meet with several friends whom I haven't seen for a few years. And I would like to thank the organizers for giving me this opportunity to be back here. Thank you so much. Okay, so the topic deals with the Hasse principle for projective homogeneous spaces. Of projective homogeneous spaces, basically, but for certain classes of fields which already had an interruption in all your lectures, the so-called semi-global fields. So, let me set up the background. So, for any field F, G is a connected linear algebraic group and Z is a projective homogeneous space. Homogeneous space homogeneous space on it. So, and Philip wants to answer what we mean by this. He would rather call it a twisted power, I think, because the condition is that the stabilizer of a geometric The stabilizer of a geometric point is parabolic, this needs to be smooth. This is a standard assumption. Okay, so this is the situation, and we are going to look at some classes where there is Sasek principle or local global principle with respect to set of discrete valuations. So this phase. Just to remind us of the case of number phase, so we have two basic theorems here on Haze principle. I will start with projective homogeneous varieties. Projective homogeneous varieties. So, this is the king of order. Suppose F is a number plate. Then Husse principle holds for projective homogeneous spaces under any connected linear algebraic group. Linear algebraic group. Okay, this is one basic motivation. And this is before this, this is viewed, the so-called Haase principle theorem, which is due to Knaser for classical groups and Ada for certain classes of extraction groups, and Chelusso for the case of P8. So it seems that if with further So it says that if with further conditions on G semi-simple, simply connected, connected. Then, Hase principle, and K is a number field again. Then Hase principle calls for principal homogeneous basis. Homogeneous basis. I will rarely touch upon this, but I just wanted to say that these are the Say that these are the two basic Hazek constituencies, very classical in the case of number fields. And so we just move on to a more general class. For instance, a typical example for the projective homogeneous phases is the case of quadratics, where it is a consequence of the classical Hussing and Kauspic theorem that the quadratic form locally has a point, it has a point. And things like examples. Things like example in theorem, the principle motion is case. Typical example is we take a division algebra and then you take an element of the field, it is a radius norm, even only if it is a local radius norm. That is a kind of relaxed follow from this theorem. So we are going to look at f is function field of a curve, k is a complete discrete value of p, discrete value of k. Discrete value A. Maybe I will set up a few details though I do not need these things for defining things. So XOK, I will fix that smooth projective geometrically interval curve, geometrically interval curve or and f is the function field and I also have this notation but Have this notation that t is the valuation ring district valuation ring and okay so maybe t is a parameter and k is the residue field. We need these things later on. So in this situation basically all that is it f is function field of transit as degree 1 for a complete discrete value. Okay that is the situation. Here we would like to look Here, we would like to look at questions of Hasey principle, very analogous to the case of number fields. So, but whereas for number fields we have a set of places to complete which come naturally. Here there is one possibility here is to look at all discrete variations of this field, but that is pretty huge. And in most of the theorems we have come across, we can restrict ourselves to this class. Restrict ourselves to this class of visor discrete variations. Visorial discrete variations. So what are these? So you take various regular proper models over T for your curve x over k and then you take co-dimension 1 points of the proper model, these give rise to validation. These give rise to valuations on F. If such valuations as you vary the models and so on for all possible models, that will be denoted divisorial value. It comes from coordination on point of some radio proper models. Okay, so this seems to be a good restriction of the straight violations that we look at, and then you ask for Hase principle, etc., etc., in the setting, and okay. And okay, so you would like to see what kind of statements could we reduce, contrast with classical arithmetic situation. So the first theorem I'd like to quote is one with Kolya Tanim assuration, I said. So we proved exactly Hase principle for For quartets. Of course, there is some assumption hanging around which I may not mention. We have some good characteristic assumption. In this case, the residue field characteristic is not. This is probably not necessary, but we work in this framework. And for other groups, I am going to consider we will have several, some conditions on the characteristics, which we call the good characteristic case. Good characteristic case. So, in this case, we prove Haase principle for quadratics for F with reference to all these Devisorial discrete values. This was essentially one of the first results in this direction for the Devisorial discrete valuations. Of course, this kind of results started emerging because of certain patching techniques which were postulated by heart beta-hart contraction. I need the setting of patching, which I will come to. Okay, so it has this result for already. Okay, so we have this result for quadratics and we also had some results for semi-simple simply connected groups and principal momentaries pieces as in the spirit of number phase. But there we had a theorem with for quasi-split groups. The semi-simple simply connected groups. Causes split, that is always as a principle. And therefore, we went and I mean of course in this Causes split case we put Case we prove the Hasse principle when, under the assumption that A is a P and P, some arithmetic comes into the picture, some homological ingredients. So with this restriction, we could prove the statement for principle homogeneous basis. So we went ahead and made some conjectures in this direction only for function phase of p-adic curves. The conjectures are easy, the same statements as this that you. Statements as this: that if you take a semi-dual field, I mean function fields of pi-i curves and you take projectly homogeneous spaces, they satisfy Hafaser principle. And the second conjecture was you take semi-sample simply connected and you take principal homogeneous spaces, they satisfy Haas principle. These were the conjectures we postulated in the same paper, we had this sample results. And I am happy we had this assumption of pietic function phase of p-adic curves in that because eventually. Curves in that because eventually we now have examples due to Harbor, Hartmann, crash in I mean there should be some other order but we finally pinned down to examples where for semi-simple simply connected tools for arbitrary symmetries there is no Hausaqual simple possible even for SL1D. So this fails. So we are happy to have this assumption. However, I wanted to say However, I wanted to say that for projective homogeneous spaces, the theorem is completely general. We never use K is a P IP for any general complete discrete value of P. It's pretty general. And there were a few cases where this question for projective homogeneous cases and Hasat Principal was resolved by some students of Suresh and Suresh and Suresh himself read Suresh was the very first result. This settles the concept principle for projecting homogeneous spaces under any connected linear or a general semi-global field without any assumption on the base field. They prove Hazard principle. This is the very first result. So in view of these results, there is a feeling that when you look at projecting homogeneous case, When you look at projecting homogeneous cases, probably you don't need the base field to be a p-adic field, the complete discrete value to be p-adic. Maybe a general theorem is true for a general complete, general semi-plobile field. This was the guess and I started talking about it to Philip and finally we have a complete theorem for projective homogeneous uses. Homogeneous uses. I will stay now. This is motivated by this conjecture by CTBS. So theoretical. So F is a semi-global field. Global field. That means we have this K, X, etcetera and omega F there is a real dispute conditions. Dispute functions and G is a reductive group and Z is a projective homogeneous case, homogeneous space under G, then it satisfies Hausi principle. If G of F V is not empty. of F V is not empty, is the completion for every V in omega F, then Z F is not empty. This is the result which I want to explain and this is complete general much more than what is in the conjecture to CTPS. We prove completely local global principle for projective home various basis and a semi-global fees with respect to that. There is all the speed valuations. Of course, there is There is a good characteristic assumption. Condition, I will not go into details for case subgroups like spinning or symplectic, it is just 2 is different from the characteristic of the little field, the residual field little k of the complete disk value. So, this will always be floating around. And so, maybe the rest of the talk will be just an indication of how we improve this result. How we improve this result. Okay, so as I said, I need to, I'm surprised that there is nobody before me who spoke about the patching setting, the patching fields in this conference. So I just need to introduce this. So these are all arbitrary hardware caching. Pacheon setting. Question setting. So we are in the case of a semi-global field and we have this valuation ring and parameter, etc. In this situation, let us take a model over T. I mean all this is not necessary, but I will take a regular proper model. For future discussions, I will fix such a model. Not only that's fix such a model not only that suppose x0 is special we do special fiber special fiber of x of x and then we will always assume just this resolution of similarities method that this is a union of regular curves with normal cross regular curves with normal cross I will just assume this is not needed for stating the general fashion case, but I will just assume this. So you have this x over t and you have a bunch of special fiber components and you can even have a loop and okay, so these are the so-called nodal points P3, P4 and these are the components of the special fiber. With reference to this model, I will To this model, I will define what is a patching data. So, if you are given VP, so P is a finite set of closed points, closed points of X0, which contains, I mean, the only condition is that it contains all the loading. Condition is that it contains all the nodal points outside which I want the components to be regular, containing all nodal points. And also after removing these points, I want the components to be affine. So at least one point and at least one point on each component. So this is the P and so U is set of irreducible components. U is set of irreducible components of the complement of the reduced special fiber complemented by the spinite set of points. It is just the open curves, affine curves you get by removing this bunch of points from the special fiber components. And then, with reference to this, this is called a patch. This P, you is called a patch, and for each P in P. For each P in P, we are going to define an overfield, which is like a completion at a discrete value, but in the special setting F P. What is this field, F P associated to this? You just take the two local ring at this point, the regular two-dimensional local ring, you complete it at the maximal ideal and you take the field of fractions Ox P hat. So, in the case of weak characteristic, you can predict this is like You can pretend this is like the power series will fill in two variables. So you can fix your notation in case of p1 over fq double parenthesis t. And so for each u in u, we would like to have this overfit. This is slightly more complicated, it's not a discrete value of a completion. So this is you just take r u contained in this rational functions on x. These are the set of regular functions which are Set of regular functions which are a set of rational functions which are regular on this open subset U of the special fiber and then T is here. Then you can complete U with respect to this the addict ideal and you take the field of functions R U at t. So these are the two sets of overfields and also I would like to have some kind of branch fields where you can come Branch fields where you can compare data. So if you have a point P which is P in P and suppose it is in the closure of L. We have removed some points P is from those components. Suppose P is on this component. Then you just take this F P. So this component divides gives a valuation. Gives a valuation or this P eta, whatever, becomes great point of this U bar. You take the discrete valuation associated to this at the point F P in the two direction completion, you just complete it with respect to this discrete variation. This is a genuine discrete value P. This is defined for every P in U closure. So, if you take this open component, and for each one of these points, you have a branch defined associated to this. Defined associated with this. This is a branch field. This is called FP where P denotes P stands for the pair P, U, where P is in. So these are the branch fields. So we have this setting of F P, F U, F branch. This is an inclusion of fields. And so this one are the main theorems which are better harmonic. So maybe I should write the remains full one. So maybe I should write their names full once and then update them. Did I write okay? Okay. So we have so one of the main results they flew is that so g is a connected linear algebra group defined over f and if you are given a patch x u t and then sharp of f g Of Fg with respect to the patch you okay. You have you fixed a patch on a model. This makes obvious sense because you are looking at principal homogeneous spaces and the G over the field F, the principal homogeneous spaces. SHA means it admits the rational point for each one of these fields F P, P in P and F U, U in U. For all these fields in this patching setting, the principal homogeneous space acquires a The principal homotinous case acquires a rational point. So, though that is the set psi fg, they describe, they give a description of this in terms of double cosets. This is product of G of the branch is for all branches and double coset byproduct of G of F P points in the P and product of G F u. product of GFU u in the u in u and being p and p and all. So you take this product of GFP and take the double coset under these under these subgroups and the double cosets characterize exactly the shares. This is all the basic results but using this they prove that first so you just define that g is factorable. This is all related to this patch. If this double code If this double coset is a point, if the double, that is every element in the product, you can write it as a product from here and a product from here. The multiplication is along the branch where P and P lies on your bar. That's where they just interact. So, if the double coset is trivial, then you call it factorable. I'll use the new word factorable for self-several subgroups of G, but Subgroups of G, but right now this is factorable. And one of the main results they prove is G is a rational group, that's function P is purely transcendental, then SHA F F G is trivial with respect to the patch. So if you have a rational group, whatever patch you choose, the double coset is trivial. So you have this kind of hacetti score that you can be used. Okay, this is a when they prove prove this also they prove the theorem that it is not too hard to get from here that if the Shaw set if this factorable group then there is also Haas principle for projective homogeneous spaces under G over F. So that's what they prove and so these are the these are the results from hardware hotline fashion. So it is the theorem, but we know what we are going to where we are going towards. So okay, so it is very hard to get factorization in general for groups, non-rational and all kinds of difficulties. There is a whole difficulty in proving classical sponge, even in the pattern set. Okay, the groups may not be rational. So, what you do is that. So, what you do is for projecting hope, there are two steps in the proof. First step is has a principle goals for projective homogeneous basis homogeneous spaces and a redaction. Or F with reference to a patch. If you take a regular proper model and a patch and patch on that, first you will prove that there is Fasse principle for predictive homogeneous spaces in this set. So, this is the first step and this is and the second step is Hase principle for pi. A Haas principle for patches in the same Hasse principle for the rest of the conditions, projective homogeneous spaces and the connected linear algebraic close implies Haze principle for omega, divisible USP functions. This is the second step. So, what does it mean? Given G and Z and the G and And the given semi-global field, what you do is you choose a regular proper model and a patch on that such that, given the condition that it is trivial at all discrete completions at discrete valuations, you obtain a model and a patch such that this projective homogeneous space occurs as a point. So that use and F this. And then you are done using step one. Okay. Using the patching step. These are the two steps first. Maybe I am. Two steps first. Maybe I'll just start with the first step. I just said the key word is factorization. So we look for factorization for certain subgroups of the group chain. Okay, so what is it? Step one. So R equals. So so you just take a regular proper model and uh patch you come up with no conditions. I think even normal models make it very difficult. Models make it very general. So, okay, so now the first is the R equivalence. So, you take this, this is over any field N, you can take any field, so R G of N. So, these are the R trivial elements in G. These are the elements of G of L, which is connectable to the identity via a rational mark from P1. These are the mark from P mark. These are the R2L elements. So this is a normal subgroup of G and the R equivalence classes is an extremely well studied object in literature. And in fact G L is equal to Rgl if G is rational. So therefore rational groups everything is all So, therefore, rational groups, everything is R-trivial. And so, we will try to produce some kind of factorization for this subgroup Rg. I mean, it is not a. In the sense you take the FP points of this R equivalence classes and then we try to produce a factorization for this subgroup. That is how we say that Rg is factorable given X U B. Rg is factorable. If Rg of Fp this product is product Rg, Fu and product Rg. So we just tried to do the factorization for pieces of the group of this Rg of Fp, okay, some pieces. Rg of Fp, some pieces. So, this is the first thing you try to achieve, and this is achieved under some conditions. So, the starting point here is this result which collithalino is collithaline. If you look at this, suppose you have the idea to factorize R equivalence classes. So, you plant it Zellos T is a torus. Okay, then there is always Okay, then there is always factorization for Rt. R equivalence classes in T for the branch you can always factorize because of this following remark. So you have this flask, take a flask resolution, Q2, P21, Flask. This is a quasi-trivial torus, quasi-trivial torus. This is flask and we have this resolution, flask resolution of T and And this polyopin Sansuk Sansuk, they prove that if you take Q of L and take the image in P of L, S of Q of L is just R T of L. The image of the L points of Q under this map, this characterizes the R T. This characterizes the RPW LS. This is wonderful for us because Q is a rational group. So, by HHK, you know factorization for Q for any patch. So, factorization goes for the FP points for Q. So, it also goes, you can take an element and for anything in the image, you can lift factorize and come back. So, on the image, you have factorization. It's just obvious using HHK. Using HHK, and therefore you have factorization for S of Q of S of Q inside P and therefore there is factorization for R of this precisely the proof for fluori and this is just the starting point of the whole thing. Okay, so now what do we do for a general connected reductive group? So I will just for simplicity assume that. Assume that your x is p1t and your patch is just a1k and the p is just one point p and the branch is just this pair p, so you are just having this affine the affine line situation and one branch just easier to explain and it's not much harder to go into the more general situation. Order to go into the more general setting. So, what do you mean? Suppose you are given G, your connected reductive group, you choose a maximal to maximal toggle in G and you take a flash resolution of T. Okay, and then using this inclusion, okay, so the one trick which is used. One trick which is usually called the Rebel Martin trick or something. So you have this Lie algebra of G is stand by. So there exists x1, x2, xr in G of whatever field, g of f. You have a finite bunch of elements such that Lie algebra of G is spanned by x1 dt plus x2 dt plus xr dt. XR length. The Lie algebra is spanned by a Lie algebra T through this action of these elements and I draw. Okay, you use these excites to produce a map from QR to TR. This is just induced with a map S which gives the selection and then to G by taking Y1, Y2, YR and take it to SY1SYR. And take it to Sy1 Syr and then you take it to conjugation XRY XYR. Yes. You take this map from QR to G. This map. And what is special? This Q. Note that this is a completely rational scheme. Q is a quasi-tribulator. It is like affine space. And then by this choice of x i's, you call it h. You call it H, then the differential area. I don't know. It is subjective. And the corresponding algebra is a subjective one. At the Li algebra level, this is a subjection. So you use this, suppose there is some amount of non-trivial, subtle things going on in the business that you can construct from here. That is very simplistic, but it's the hard part of the story. There exists a neighborhood of There exists a neighborhood of identity in G of F. So, neighborhood of identity such that this neighborhood is obtained via this map, looking at some open subsets here and taking this image, such that this neighborhood is factorable, contained in G of Fu times G of F P or sorry, Rg Fu times Rgfp or the R equivalent. Fp or the R equivalent the product of RgFu times Rgfp which is contained in Rg of Fp so this is a periodical for the periodic the valuation valuation okay so what did I state a theorem that RG no I didn't state any results of all so what is the the statement of parallelization let me just Of factorization. Let me just get first here. This G as before reductive and XU as before. The theorem is suppose we have an assumption that G of F P is R G of F p is densing Rg of F. Rg of F branch. You remember this branch field is this completion of the field Fp two-dimensional field at a discrete value, it's a discrete valuation completion. So this Fp is dense here, but we are going to assume that the Rg of this is dense in Rg of this. This is the assumption. Suppose you assume this, then Rg of that this admits a hypothesis. This admits a factorization. Rg is factor. The case with one branch, one UP, in general, Rg is factoring. This is more general, Rg is factor. So this is, we assume this is dense for every P and every branch. That this, there is density for this. Then you have factorization for Rj. So if you use that, you have a Have a open dense subset, and here open subset, and this is dense. RgFP is dense here, it's simple to logical direction, right? Then Rgfu, Rgf, Z quip Rg. So we get a factorization for Rg, but we have this assumption of density as well. Okay, so the next step is any any questions? Any any questions? Dance means in analytic topology. The pietic topology. Okay, the next step, the next is another group which also is a widely discussed group in literature. This is the Kneiser TX group. We will see why this enters the picture. So, the Kneiser TX group, so G is any connected. So, G is any connected reduction loop. For L, G L plus, of course, you need the G is strictly isotropic, reductive and strictly isotropic. Strictly isotropic, it may have components, but all the components are isotropic. All the components of the adjoint groups are isotropic. Then a GL plus you define to be you take a strict parabolic parabolic and its opposite parabolic and then you take the unipotent and you take the subgroup span by these unipotent elements, unipotent electron P and P minus. Then you get a subgroup of this, this is called the so-called nasal. This is called the so-called Schnezer Titz group, and this is independent of P, dependent of the choice of P or the choice of the parabolic choice. So, this P is different from the points on your scale. So, these are the parabolics for the moment. Okay, so this in fact there is a lot of analysis of this quotient group, the so-called Tanaka, I think probably G mod Gl plus, and so on. So, what we will And so on. So, what we will use here is that if G is semi-simple, simply connected, then we have this simply connected. Okay, here we have this nice property which was probably known, was known for several groups, but I don't take MG's paper. So it says that Rg of NAL is GL plus. G n plus these two groups coincide if G is strictly isotropic. Take isotropic groups, then the R equivalence classes are the same as the laser-tip groups. This is very helpful. So, we can just now convert our factorization to have a factorization. factorization for for I will write G plus factorization for G plus means it is G of branch plus factored into the two factors okay there is so we are looking at factorization for G plus if so G is semi simple simply connected now simply connected and strictly isotropic So, in this case, so we don't have to do any further work because RGFP, because it's well okay, G is strictly, so we are in the sense of the patching. See what is the assumption? So, you have a projective homogeneous case which has a rational form of FU and FP. So the condition is like So the condition is that strictly isotropic over F u's and F P's every U n. So this is given to us but because we are going to look at particular homogeneous cases which are good points over F u's and F P's. So you have this data given to you. Then Rg of F u is the same as Rg of as G F u plus and so on for F P, for the branch everything. For Fp, for the branch, everything, the Rg groups are the same. There's just one condition to be verified. We needed Rg, Fp. This is to be dense in Rg of the branch in order to have actualization for R equivalence classes. But so this group is going to be the same as G of P plus and this is the branch. These are major trace groups. This is given to us the density. This is given to us the density. The meset, if you have a, the field is dense, the knasettics are a group or dense thing. This is given to us, density is given. Hence, you get factorization for G plus. So, instead of G, we have obtained factorization for G plus, but this is good enough for us to get Haas principle for relative homogeneous spaces. So, it is exactly. So it is exactly on the strip. So proof of RC principle in the matching setting. Okay, so you are given this Z, ZFU is not empty. So you choose a point of this ZFU and to this stabilizer you get a parabolic ORFU for this Q, the stabilizer. A stabilizer and ZFP is not empty. So we have XP ZFP and you have a parabolic which is the stabilizer of this point and over the branch because it is a projective homogeneous space, so you have a transitive action, you have a GP which translates this point to Xu. Now, this GP in G G branch, but if you if you look at this, oh the G branch, this is nothing but G F P plus times the parabolic, I mean this is a this is this dual decomposition, the F P points of G is the same as product of G F P plus times any parabolic we have started with. The parabolic loop I am going to choose to be Q P of. choose to be Qp of it. So this is the important fact is that the volume of G is G plus times the values of the rational points of its parabolic. So when you plug in G plus using this decomposition, this factor is irrelevant because it stabilizes the point X P, right? Qp is the stabilizer of X Power thing. So you can just modify it and you can assume that Gp actually belongs. That GP actually belongs to G of F P plus just because of this remark, and this is in the stabilizer of the point. You can as well assume this is in G plus. Once it is in G plus, we know it is factorable. So, G P can be written as GP. So, when you look at this equation, you have G P X P is Gu inverse Xu. This is for all U and P. U and P. So we have a bunch of points on the projected homogeneous space over F P's and F U's which literally agree on the branches. In this case from the patching, the so-called intersection property and so on, this bunch of points give a point X in Z over which matches these points along the class. So this is basically the proof. The proof mainly depends on factorization for G plus, which is equivalent factor. Which is equivalent factorization for Rg, which is the main part of the work, where the main part of the work consists of. Okay, so this is the proof for the patching setting. Maybe I have still five minutes, so I have some time to explain because this part of reduction to patches is again something pretty interesting because it is basically due to some work of Philip Sheel, and it brings in a lot of theory from the motivation. Theory from the motivation coming from loop tosses and so on. This is going into this direction of loop tosses, and these loop tosses are so widely studied by many people in this room. So Rahjil and Chandraso and so many people. So it was the countenance of inputs from several directions which motivated this part. Reduction to factors. So here this basically is from a theorem of Z. So what do you have? So you have G and a Z. So as far as points for homogeneous space, we can always assume that we are having a G reductive. In this case, we can always reduce to G semi-simple simplicity by all this argument. So we may assume that G is semi-simple, simplicate. Simple, simply connect. It's not a restriction, but there is a reduction. Okay, and this Z admits a rational point or all A. So, this data, it gives rise to first of all. Suppose G0 is the Chevalier scheme associated with Z and B naught, P0 and delta naught, the usual delta associated with this Braylee total time diagram. And so this G is defined by a cosy. Defined by a cocycle from the gamma group to automorphism. Okay, so but then you have a parabolic of a certain type. So basically the Z is a twisted form of, so there exists an I, a subset of delta naught, invariant under star action. Through this cosycle total, Through this co-cycle to Rg0 and Rg0 are acting on automophiles of delta naught, okay, okay tanking that induced by theta, induced by theta. So you have this starring radio section such that this factors through odd ig0 to odd g0. This factors through a cosycle with values in odd ig0, where i is the standard value and your And your uh a projective homogeneous space is a twist of the parabolics of time i engine out twisted through these theta i's. So this is what you get. So you can fix this datum and then so this is this real and so there is this paper of Chenna so she And ice time. So in this situation, they say the G is reductive. So you have a further factorization. You have this, let me have this situation, gamma F o od J naught and so you have this odd I J naught theta I. So you have further and find A finite sub-scheme, which is defined over Z for this scheme, and in fact, in our situation, it is going to be ethyl finite and the co-cycles theta0 with values in S0. It factors through a finite sub-scheme. This is part of the theory of these people. So, finally, eventually, the co-cycles which govern the group and the carbolic subgroups come down from a co-cycle with values in a finite ethyl group scheme. So, this co-cycle gives rise. So, this possible gives rise to a tosser. T is a tosser and a t0 and an S naught over your semiclobal. This is gamma f to x0. So, you have a tosser. So, how you maybe I won't have that much time. So, you take a model x over t, the critical thing is such that x admits a normal crossing divisor. such which contains all the special fiber components special fiber components such that this tosser E0 lifts to this x minus t. So below this normal crossing divisor which contains also special fiber components, then this tosser leads to x minus t. And this is the model we are going to stick to when you do this. Model we are going to stick to when you do this. This not only this tosser E over S naught lifts, G lifts to scheme over X minus D, and your parabolic this thing Z lifts to this and everything is over the scheme. This is like what these people have studied, the loop people, it's all tailor-made for this basically. This thing when you look at a point key, special for your component, and you're removing some normal. And you are removing some normal crossing deriver where things are bad. So, this looks like K power series xy x and plus. It could be this, or just if one component is defined, it could be like k x y x and s. These are the restriction of this device, this x minus d to this point. And here, there's the tosses, the loop tosses, etcetera. They are all so well. Courses, etc. They are all so well studied. So you have business, but still, the following have to be proved. Maybe can I have two more minutes to conclude? Of course. So in fact, this is the punchline. So if you, so what I wanted to say is reduction to, so you take this model, first of all, there is a standard way that g of f eta is z of f e. Is z of f eta is not empty. If any variety, both these completions are not empty, eta corresponds to a special type of component. This is a standard art in approximation arguments to say that you can choose an open subset of this component yi. See, these are the open ones we choose. We are going to choose, shift this so that whenever it has a point along the completion of the generic point, G of F U is not, some UI is not. FU is not. Some UI is not there. G of F UI is not there. This is the general approximation arguments. From the generic, the completion along this, you can always come down to FUI for some open search, some branch, one of the patching things. So these UIs can be easily arranged. But the difficulty is, so this described as your I as your U, but then you get a bunch of points, exponent minus, you need a UI. X0 minus union of ui. Okay, then at the points here you have to conclude the g of f z of f is not in. This is the only thing left to reduce to the latest situation because by shrinking getting a suitable open subset you will always get by generality on any derivative a rational point. So this is the point but what are we given? We are given look at this one particular valuation VP which is the valuation of f. This is the valuation of F at the exceptional curve, the co-dimension one point corresponding exceptional curve for the blow-up of x at n. So you just blow up this smooth point at once. So you have an exception utilizer and you take the valuation associated with that. And that to the extent And that extends to a valuation of your p 0 of your p that we extended to this. This is the main point of the whole thing. At this one particular blow-up valuation, if the ZFP completed along this as the rational point, then already ZFP is not it. This is brilliant actually. This is G. So, well, and so since we know that Z of F That V of F completed along Vp is not empty. Already we are given equalizoid discrete functions, you know, here, and therefore you will have points at Fp's, and this concludes the profile. Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments from? And the rationality of the homogeneous space, particularly space, when there's a rational point, but if you take a particular homogenous space of a group with this particular space that has a rational point, then it is rational. G is not rational for the projective function space. Yes. But almost because we don't have much. P is that G, but B we can point in. For G plus, which is that decomposition. Right. But G may not be rational, but G plus G plus is coexistent in the space with it is rational, but it's not Any complex case quality again and thank you.
