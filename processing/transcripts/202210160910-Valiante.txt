The kinds of things that allow or the changes that occur in epilepsy that allow systems to tip into pathological dynamics. I don't have any disclosures that are specifically related to this talk. I do want to acknowledge the fact that I alone cannot give this talk in its completion. I need my colleagues to do that. So I'm very grateful for the collaborative work that's being done with Scott as well as Jeremy Lefebvre on the computational. Me Lafebra on the computational side of things. There's also some work which I'll present from Sri Joy Tripathi, who's a computational genomicist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health. So I think we've just been talking about this anyway, but we all intuitively understand epilepsy as a condition in which there is an excessive amount of neural activity, and that an excessive amount of neural activity is asynchronous. Is asynchronous. And, you know, it's, you don't have to be an electroencephalographer to look at a trace like this from a clinical recording and see sort of wide areas of the brain that appear to be synchronous, at least by eye. A more contemporary view on this is some of the beautiful work done by Andrew Trevelyan and Catherine Chevon with microelectrode recordings from HUMIN showing that as the That as the ictyl core forms, then the spiking of individual neurons aligns to the local field potential oscillations. And again, a testament to our intuitive understanding of epilepsy being a state of excessive amounts of synchronization. In that context, then we think about the things that are healthy in the brain. Things that are healthy in the brain that allow the brain to not necessarily be in these hypersynchronous states. And this is something I'm sure many of you are familiar with, which is really a seminal paper, a modeling paper by Renart, explaining why the cortex may be able to maintain this relatively asynchronous state. And this is something as an idea, EI balance has dominated the epilepsy. EI balance has dominated the epilepsy literature for 40 or 50 decades with the simple idea that an imbalance, whether too much excitation or too little inhibition, will ultimately lead to the Caesar state. And this is but one potential mechanism or route to that where when you have this imbalance, then you lose the decorrelating power of neural circuits, and that may lead you down this pathway of hypersynchronous state and. Hypersynchronous state and seizure or seizure-like activity. I want to give you a little bit of a different perspective on that. And it's really, I'll refer to this paper, sort of like the first paper for me, or the paper for me that, you know, brought about the idea that maybe in epilepsy, in the seizure state, or our brain that's prone to developing seizures, there may be other things. There may be other things that allow or disallow systems and neural networks to decorrelate activity, allowing the brain then to slip into the seizure-like state. And this is a paper, actually, this original paper was in 2010. It's from the retina, and this is a very interesting circuit. And in this circuit, you have these glomeruli, which are this basically accumulations. Accumulations of the input from various olfactory sensory neurons. And each and the axons from the olfactory sensory neurons that enter into these individual glomeruli, each one of these is similarly sensitive to a specific odorant. So they have the similar genetic profile. And they send highly correlated activity to these glomeruli. And the mitral cells, where there's about 20 to 50 of them, have their dendrites, which accumulate. Which accumulate within these glomeruli, and these mitral cells receive highly correlated activity, very similar inputs to these mitral cells. The interesting thing, though, is that when you, if you're to patch these mitral cells and you put in a step depolarization, and that's from this paper here, they fire quite differently. And so, this mitral cell fires with atonic output, this mitral cell fires with some bursting. Mitral cell fires with some bursting. And then, experimentally, if you inject frozen white noise into different mitral cells that you've passed, you'll see that they have different patterns of firing. These are the rasters of their firing. And a simple kind of dimensionality reduction approach on their, under spike trains, you'll see that these neurons don't overlap very much with each other, and each one has a unique pattern of firing. And so, in fact, the title of this paper kind of says it all, which is that the intrinsic Kind of says it all, which is that the intrinsic biophysical diversity decorrelates neural firing while increasing information content. And so we've sort of seen EI balance as a mechanism for decorrelation. And in this paper, the demonstration that intrinsic biophysical properties can allow neurons that are receiving very similar inputs to have very different outputs. Oh, my um I think my my my PowerPoint is frozen. Go back. Let me I just have to restart PowerPoint, I think. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Yeah, that doesn't look more, so I'm gonna have to just give me one second.   Okay, can you guys see that? Sorry. So So, yeah, so now we have this other potential mechanism for decorrelating through intrinsic biophysical diversity. So this led to this relatively simple exercise, which is to start to think about epilepsy in a different way, which is traditionally we've thought about EI balance. We've thought about EI balance, but maybe in part, and we don't want to talk about this as something supplanting the EI balance concept, but something that may in part also contribute to the synchronization that one sees during epilepsy, which is that there is this kind of balance between a diversity or heterogeneity of cells, which affords the decorrelation of signals, and the loss of that. Loss of that diversity, which could lead to pathological states. And so you can start to think of the various kinds of pathologies that we see in epilepsy, where we see loss or gain of interneurons as a potential route to homogenization of neural populations. These concepts of hub interneurons, up and down regulation of voltage-gated ion channels, classic examples are genetic epilepsies and even synaptic. And even synaptic sprouting, where you can have a you can imagine this idea of homogenizing inputs to neural populations. And in that context, then when we look at some of the really beautiful work that is emerging out of the work at the Allen Institute in regards to cell typing, it's been a traditional neuroscience endeavor is to classify. Science endeavor is to classify things, and you know, the beautiful work of Kahl, of course, of classification of different neurons. That's been an ongoing endeavor in neuroscience, now sort of taken up by the transcriptomic field. And indeed, you know, there are cell types. And so, you know, we all are familiar with VIP and PV neurons. But within those cell types, and here's an example, for example, here's an example from this paper that just came out from. From this paper that just came out from Andres Talaias' lab, where although within a cell type which has this genetic marker of VIP, the electrophysiological properties are extremely varied, just as in SST interneurons, as is the physical location of different production neurons, as is the morphology of various types of PV interneurons. Into neurons. And so, although we'd like to think about these specific categories of neurons, what really is appearing is that within each cell type, there's an incredible amount of diversity in physical properties, electrophysiological properties, and transcriptomic properties. And this is a quote which I took from Mark Zambrowski's review, who's actually now a scientist, a PI in UBC, where he says that graded within cell type heterogeneity may be a wide Within cell type heterogeneity, may be a widespread phenomenon across brain regions and cell types, and may thus be a foundational property of mature cell identity in the brain. The question is: what role does this type of diversity in neurons play? And this is something that we saw ourselves when we characterize human cortical neurons, where once we've kind of analyzed all their biophysical properties, we really couldn't ascribe a specific property to a specific. A specific property to a specific cell type in a specific layer. It's really this continuum of properties across even cells that we believe are of the same cell type. And so this really is the norm in neural circuits. And so we started with this very simple hypothesis then from all that I proceeded to mention, which is that in control tissue, In control tissue, we would expect that there should be healthy amounts of neural diversity as measured from their biophysical properties. And in epileptogenic cortex, we may observe a loss of this biophysical diversity. And so I'm just going to take you quickly through. And I know I've already consumed a lot of time with the introduction, but maybe that's sufficient because Jeremy will also go into sort of an extension of the kind of work that or things that I'll talk about here, which I'll take you through quickly. Which I'll take you through quickly through the cell reports paper on what we found. So being a neurosurgeon, having access to human tissue has, you know, of course, a privilege and provides us the opportunity to study human disease. And so we wanted to study both epileptogenic cortex and non-epileptogenic cortex. So we had three different sources of tissue, two frontal sources, one from non-epileptogenic frontal. One from non-apileptogenic frontal lobe and one from epileptogenic lobe and non-epileptogenic temporal lobe, which is really where most of the world gets its temporal lobe tissue and considers it seemingly normal for characterization of human neurons. And so to ensure that we're getting tissue from the amphaloptogenic region, this is why this study took so long to collect the tissue, we actually did intraoperative. We actually did intraoperative electrocorticography. We resected, or the tissue that we deemed electroeptogenic, was from those regions of the brain that were actually generating abnormal electrophysiological activity during the surgery. That tissue was then excised, taken to the lab where we did wholesale patch clamp recordings, and a big shout out to Homera, who's really has been the technical and physiological support for this work. And basically, Work and basically, you know, as we did in that previous paper, we characterized their biophysical properties and asked a simple question: Is that which biophysical properties were less variable or what was the variability across these different types of tissue? And so we used a specific, there was one derived metric measure of excitation. Measure of excitability in this neurons that demonstrated a difference between tissue that was in the epileptogenic zone versus tissue that was not in the epileptogenic zone. And here on this slide here, this is the epileptogenic cortex, which demonstrates a coefficient of variation of 20%. And these are what we would consider control tissues, all having higher levels of the coefficient of variation. This is just the similar. Variation. This is just the similar data plotted as Gaussians. And the other interesting feature that we noticed as well was that the FI curves were different between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic cortex. Interestingly and seemingly paradoxically, that in the epileptogenic cortex, the FI curves were actually shifted down or I guess maybe in qualitative terms. I guess maybe in qualitative terms, the neurons appear to be less excitable than in the epileptogenic, epilegenic. And I'll discuss that or mention how this comes around from the results that we found in this work. So overall, this derived measure of distance to threshold, which would be the distance from the resting membrane potential to when the neuron fires a spike, was more homogeneous. Was more homogenous in the epileptogenic cortex. This is just a plot of all the other features we surveyed, and really it was only the resting membrane potential and threshold that demonstrated these differences in variability. And that's very relevant to the types of plasticity mechanisms that underlie learning, where these are typically the targets of regulation. Of regulation of expression levels of channels that govern cellular excitability. So one of the issues with the work, particularly as we went through the review process, was the fact that we don't get a lot of neurons from the same patient. We don't get a lot of neurons from the same patient. And so we are measuring variability across patients. But this was a really Across patients. But this was a really cool paper that came out of a group in Germany where they used a multi-patch system where they could patch up to eight neurons at a time. And I think really, really the cool finding from this paper, and we had the opportunity to discuss this with them, but what they found was that in fact, the inter-subject variability in the various biophysical parameters was less than the intrasubject. Less than the intra-subject variability. So there's more heterogeneity or explained variance arising from the neurons themselves than that they came from different patients. And we did our best to demonstrate that similarly, given the limitations of the way we record, because we do individual patch clamp recordings from individual patients, our yields are much lower for each and every patient, whereas they can sometimes patch up to 50 or 60 neurons per patient. But overall, Patient. But overall, we also found that our intra-subject, intra-subject variability was actually quite low, similar to what they showed. And we assumed from that that the variability that we were observing was arising from the genuine biophysical variability in the neurons that we were patching. And so to then explore this finding, we turn to computational models because we don't really have any other way to test out this hypothesis. Really, we have any other way to test out this hypothesis. Now, we have experimental data demonstrating that neurons from apookogenic cortex are less heterogeneous. And so we want to understand could this be functionally significant? And this is really the work of Scott and Jeremy Lefebvre. So I don't claim any specific insight or specific understanding or ability to do this. So if you have any questions regarding this, definitely direct them. Questions regarding this, definitely direct them to Scott and Jeremy. But essentially, this was a spiking Poisson model, a typical 80-20 split between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. And what was included uniquely in this model was this H term, which was really the heterogeneity in threshold. What we had measured experimentally with distance to threshold here, the term Rhiobase is. The term Rhiobase is something familiar to most experimentalists. So, we built in this heterogeneity into this network, both in excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. And so, when we explored the various types of heterogeneity, which was excitatory, inhibitory heterogeneity, in fact, it kind of confirmed our initial. Of confirmed our initial hypothesis, and in this plot here, you'll see this kind of schematic. My gosh, the schematic where we've kind of pictorially represented the amount of heterogeneity within either the excitatory population or the inhibitory population. In this example, there is a good amount of heterogeneity in the excitatory population. And as well as the sort of baseline amount of inhibitory heterogeneity. And when we observe the activity as a function of increasing drive to the system, we measure or we plot here firing rate and a synchronization measure. What you'll see is basically this linear rise in synchronization with increasing drive. With increasing drive. Whereas in a population that demonstrates both low pyramidal cell or excitatory cell heterogeneities and low inhibitory heterogeneities, you see this sudden step in synchrony demonstrating this sudden transition to a synchronous type state, which, of course, we did not model epilepsy here, sorry, seizures or seizures. Sorry, seizures or seizure-like activity, we really model this transition to a synchronous state. So we're not modeling seizures per se, but clearly, this configuration of decreased heterogeneity in these neural populations is permissive to the sudden transitions in synchrony in this model. And so then Scott went further to sort of demonstrate this, you know, basically a parameter. This did a basic parameter search along different amounts of excitatory heterogeneity, and demonstrates that in these low heterogeneity regions, you basically see what we saw in those individual plots, which is that you have these sudden steps in behavior, and it's those regions where you have And it's those regions where you have a greatest amount of synchrony. So, we did some sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that our findings are not specific to various parameters of the model. So, this is the amount of connectivity in the model. So, we see similar findings across different amounts of connectivity. Same with synaptic strength and bias. So, this is the gray bars where our results were demonstrated in the paper, but we sort of explored across. The paper, but we sort of explored across all these wide range of parameters, demonstrating that our results are qualitatively similar, regardless of different amounts of synaptic strength and bias. And then I'll leave actually this slide to Jeremy. If Jeremy, you want to unmute your mic and sort of explain the mathy part of this paper. Part of this paper? Yeah, I can briefly summarize it for sure. I'll be talking a bit about some of that a bit later, but the idea here that I don't know what your next slide is. I cannot like do a big surprise. I don't know what your next slide is. Okay, well, that's good. Thanks. But what this is showing basically that we take those equations, we perform what we call mean-field analysis to extract the fundamental stability ingredients or machinery behind that model. And what it's basically showing is that. And what it's basically showing is that this biophysical diversity or within cell type variation, either exciter cells, basically destroys all the bifurcation structure that you would expect in a homogeneous network, meaning that if all the cells are similar to one another, you observe these highly nonlinear behavior that give rise to these sharp transitions towards synchrony. But everything is gone when you start varying the intrinsic properties of those cells. Intrinsic properties of those cells. And this is something we could demonstrate with stability analysis. So here we're having these synchrony measures. So how sharp would be the transition to synchrony at the top row? And underneath, you have eigenvalues, which I'll talk a bit more later. So the real imaginary part, which specifies a type of bifurcations or transitions you observe in that type of system from seizing to not seizing, or I would say from asynchronous to synchronous behavior. And the only real way you can get these sharp transitions. Only real way you can get these sharp transitions is without this diversity, basically. Great, thanks, Jeremy. And then the last slide is a little bit of an interesting result that we found both experimentally, but also from the modeling work. And the one curious thing in the clinical space is that we often use metabolic measures of metabolic measures. Of metabolic measures to identify the epileptogenic zone. So, for example, we use PET scans and we look for hypometabolism as a sign of the epileptogenic zone. And it's kind of curious that, you know, in our work, we found that the FI curves were, in fact, demonstrating that the neurons were high, or at least the populations of neurons together were hyperexcitable. And this is actually well explained by our modeling work where in Our modeling work where, in fact, as you decrease the variance of the activation curves of the individual neurons, you start to shift from this blue line to this red line. And so the red is the average of the activation curves. And so, in fact, if you zoom in down here, you start to sort of get a sense that this is actually quite similar to our experimental data here. And Scott basically fits. Data here, and Scott basically fit the experimental data with this sigmoid function. And the cool thing is that, in fact, as you decrease the population variance in these ranges near closer to the resting membrane potential, you in fact have a population that is less excitable. And so it's interesting to speculate with this where in the interim. In the interrectal states, where you're not only have hypometabolism, but you also have signatures of hypersynchrony, which are things like HFOs, that maybe in part, and again, you know, we don't want to present this in lieu of EI balance, but in part, that maybe that this loss of heterogeneity can explain the co-occurrence of decreased excitability but excessive amounts of But excessive amounts of synchrony, given the dynamical changes that occur in the network, due to the loss of variability in the neural excitability. So I'm going to leave it at that. I'm going to actually just put this one slide because Jeremy will start here with his talk essentially. But I think that this work and through Jeremy's explorations in the literature. In the literature, in literatures that are actually quite mature in this, we start to think more deeply about this concept of resilience. And I think this is where Jeremy will continue on. So I'll leave it at that.
