The title, and this is not a review title, a review talk, but at least the plan is that I will start with some background, namely tell you what is meant by full local conformal field theory as opposed to chiral conformal field theory. And I will mention a few results. Few results that will be relevant. And then I come to the main part, namely the proposal for a formula for bulk fields in what I call rigid finite CFT. We will see what that means and then support this proposal by several consistency checks. All of this is about the bulk, but in the title, you have also boundary, so I will have to tell you. Also, boundary. So, I will have to tell you a bit about boundary fields also and how you get from the bulk from the boundary, and then there will be further consistency checks. And if time permits, I will finish with some outlook. And all what I will tell you about in this main part is based on work with Christopher Schweikert in these two papers here. So, what I So, what do I mean by full CFT? Well, let me first mention that to most of you, there is a familiar framework for conformal field theory where we start from some vertex operator algebra with suitable properties. And then there is a braided monoidal category of modules over this algebra. And I write. Algebra, and I write C here, but I forgot to rename it to D, which I will use in a minute. And then there's a system of conformal blocks. And suitably nice in particular means that there should be certain finiteness conditions obeyed. And for the present talk, I will assume that this category, which I call D, should be a modular finite. Should be a modular finite tensor category and conformal field series based on such categories, I will call rigid finite conformal field series. And as a special subclass, this includes the case that the finite tensor category is semi-simple, so it's a fusion category. So we deal with a model of fusion category, and that's the situation we have in rational conformal field theory. Conformal field theory. Now, the system of conform blocks give us vector bundles with projectively flat connections over model spaces, which of complex curves with insertion points, where the insertion points are labeled by objects of this category D. And concretely, we get them as solutions to certain. To certain linear differential equations, which in physics are often called Keiger-Ward identities, which implement the symmetries that are given by the vertex operator algebra on tensor products of objects of this representation category. And if we do it like that, we will get these vector bundles as. Vector bundles in the form of multivalued functions. And I will refer to this setting here as chiral conformal field theory. And this word chiral refers to the fact that we get, for example, these multivariate functions as solutions to quantities we call chiral watt identities. The origin of the terminology. The origin of the terminology comes from the description of three bosons, but I will not go into that. Now, what I call chiral conformal field theory is essentially what was just called conformal field theory in several previous talks that we have heard, except to some extent in Kolya's talk just now. He was also talking about correlation functions. Which we want to be single-valued functions. So, in terms of these bundles of conforming blocks, we need global sections. And now in short comparison, we could say in chiral conformal field theory, we have a system of conformal blocks. There are solutions to this what identity. Solutions to these watt identities. They carry action of mapping class groups. And correspondingly, in full conformal field theory, we have these correlation functions, which are particular solutions, which are not in particular invariant under these action of mapping class groups. Also, it turns out that the conformed blocks come with, if we look at different wordsheets. Different word sheets, they come with certain linear sewing maps, and the correlators are compatible, have to be compatible with that sewing. So, a correlation function is a specific element in the space of conformed blocks which satisfies additional conditions. And just as a side remark about these sewing maps, I just want to say that if you have a virtual A world sheet on which your conformal field series is living, then you can chop this into smaller pieces. And then you have these linear maps which relate the conformal blocks on the chop version to the conformal blocks of the zone version. And then the requirement is that if you have the correlators for the individual pieces, then under these maps, these. Under these maps, this has to go to the correlator for the original worksheet. Now, a basic task in conformal field theory is then, given a chiral conformal field theory, is it possible to find full conformal field theories based on that chiral conformal field theory and give all of them? All of them, and in general, there is simply no solution for that. But there is a very well-known way out: namely, we do not work with one copy of our vertex algebra, but with two copies in such a way that the category that is relevant is really the linear product of two copies of the category of a single copy. Single copy, and we take one of the copies with reverse braiding. And as a side remark, this is a very natural thing to do also from the point of view of the definition of a modeler tensor category, namely for finite tensor categories modeler if and only if this delinear product is rated equivalent. linear product is rated equivalent to the Trinfeld center of C. And this is actually one possible definition of the term modeler. Now some statements about full conformal field theory. Well, one can combine left and right movers, these two copies already at the level of vertex operator algebras. Algebras. This gives rise to what are called full field algebras of Wang and Kong. And this works as long as we are at genus zero. Now, it's, I think, fair to say that vertex operator algebras are not the easiest structures to deal with. And the same is then true for full field algebra. So, if we want to generalize the treatment to account also for high achievements, And to account also for higher genus, then maybe one should use some different approach. And I will work in an approach based on the directly on the category D. And this will also allow to account for world sheets which have boundaries and in addition defect lines. And in rational conformal field theory, all of this is very well understood. In particular, one knows that there is a bijection. That there is a bijection of the following type. The full rational conformal field theories based on combining left and right movers for a model of fusion category C are in bijection to Morita classes of certain symmetric Trobanius ultra plus A internal to the category C. And you can also formulate this in a This is in a more invariant way, namely, there is a bit bijection between these rational conformal fields, full conformal field series and indecomposable semi-simple pivotal module categories over C. Actually, in the rational case, these objectives here are a little bit redundant, but I chose to formulate it in this way because if you just remove the immisimple, then Then there is some hope that this will generalize beyond the rational case. Now, one particular aspect of the situation in full CFT is that we would like to describe what I call the bulb fields. This is an object in the druid field center, which I can decompose into a simple The simple object of the Trendweld center, where here in writing the simple objects in this way, I use this equivalence to the linear product of these two copies of C. And the coefficients that I given here can be expressed in terms of the Forbes algebra A that labels a full conformal field theory. A full conformal field theory in this way. So these are bimodule morphisms where this tensor plus and tensor minus tells how this object UI, tensor A, tensor UJ, is to be treated as a bimodule. And then you can ask what are concretely solutions of this type. Solutions of this type. So, can you give actually such symmetric Frobenius ultra parts, which give you a full conformal field theory? And there is one generic example present for any category C. Name we just take the monoidal unit. In this case, by this calculation here, the bulk fields will be given just by the direct. Will be given just by the direct sum over all these simple objects, these particular simple objects in the center. And there are many other examples known, like in the case of SL2 at suitable levels of K, you know that there are the D and E cases. Then, if you have simple currents, then any subgroup. Any subgroup of simple currents which satisfies certain homological constraint gives you the object underlying an algebra which you can use and there are other known general types. Now it's important to realize that not That not every model invariant is given by such matrices set ij such that the corresponding combination of characters is model invariant actually comes from such an algebra. And if it doesn't come from such an algebra or from Morita class of such algebras, then actually Class of such algebra, then actually there is no full conformal field theory which has that model invariant as its torus partition function. I mention this because this is somewhat less known, even though over time many nice types of examples for this phenomenon have been found. Okay, so that was a short A short list of results that have been obtained previously. Now, let's try to give a formula for bulk fields in the form of a certain coand concretely, which can hold beyond rational conform field theory. And we start by recalling that in this one type of This one type of bulk field object that we have for any rational for any model of fusion category has this form. And a traditional way of explaining this is that one says, well, one simply combines every left-moving degree of freedom with the corresponding right-moving one. Now, this is not the best way to put it, because, first of all, we only Because, first of all, we only restrict to simple objects in each of the two copies, and then in each isomorphism class, we take only one member. And there is a proper mathematical term for that, namely we deal with a coand. And I rewrite this expression here in the form of a coant. And one important aspect is. One important aspect is that we know coens are defined by a universal property and therefore they are unique up to unique isomorphism, which is not so obvious maybe from this form here. And nowadays, the following proposal, I write conjecture because this is supposed to be a mathematics conference. So we conjecture that if C is a model of If C is a model of finite tensor category, not necessarily semi-simple, then there is a full conformal field theory such that the bulk field object is still given by this coen here. And actually, there are a few cases, namely where the category C is the representation category of a pseudo. Of a suitable Hoff algebra, where one can show that that actually works. But in full generality, this is not yet shown. In any case, this is a very special bulk object. In the rational case, you should ask what happens in more generality. Remember, the one here means it comes from the Frobenius ultra. A Frobenius algebra equal to the monoidal unit, or in more invariant terms, the relevant module category is C as a module over itself. And how can we generalize this to other module categories? Well, we rewrite this expression that we had just in terms of this formula here. This formula here, which uses a simple property of the Hamfunctor. And you can show you can rewrite this also in this form here, where we now have morphisms in the category of right-exact module functors, endo module endo functors of C. And it turns out. It turns out that this functor category is a module category over the center of the category C. And I will say more about this a bit later on. So, but in any case, once we have this, then there is a natural way to generalize things, namely by saying, well, instead of Of taking C as a module over itself, take an arbitrary module. We require that it's in decomposable empty bottle. I will tell you what that means. And then we get a corresponding formula here. And this would be a formula. So the conjecture is that for any suitable module category M over C, we have Over C, we have a full conformal field series where the bulk fields are given by this formula. Now, here the identity functor of M appears, and you can ask what happens if we replace now these identity functors by more general module functors. And here, in order to guess what that could be, you should remember that actually such module functors can be used. Such module functors can be shown, or in the rational form field theory, at least they are known to describe the types of possible defect lines on the word sheet. And now look at if you look at the natural transformations between two such module functors, then we We see that this string type diagram that we have for them is Poincaré dual to a picture that, or we can think of it as a Poincaré dual of a picture that we would draw for field insertions on a defect line, changing the type of defect line from G to G prime. And therefore, it's a natural conjecture that. A natural conjecture that actually, when we now in our co-end replace the identity functors by these general module functors G, then what we get are the objects of defect fields, namely those defect fields which change the type of defect line from G to G prime. I will not say much more about defect fields now. About defect fields now, but rather mention what is meant by this restriction to p-bottle C module categories. For this, first, we have to remember that a finite module category is finite as a linear Beeling category, and the action functor is required to be exact. And then we call some. And then we call such a finite category exact if for any projective object in C, when we act with it on an arbitrary object of M, we get a projective of the module category. And in this context, we need another standard definition, namely often internal hom. This is the right adjoint of the action functor. So for any pair mm prime of objects. Mm prime of object of the module category, we have a natural family of isomorphisms. Well, we have an isomorphism of this type and this is natural. And such internal homes need not exist, but when C and M are finite, therefore this quantification here is important, they exist. And if C is semi-simple and rich, we can actually. A semi-simple and rich, we can actually describe it explicitly in terms of the tensor product. If we realize the modular category as a category of A modules as a tensor product over A. And now we can introduce this definition here, namely we say exact C module category has a pivotal structure if this is given by isomorphisms between the object the do. Between the object, the dual of the internal home object for Mm' and the internal home object of M prime m. If such isomorphisms exist, they are unique up to a scalar. And importantly, one can show that if M is pivotal in this sense, then the internal end object, so the internal home from M to M, which always naturally is M, which always naturally comes with an algebra structure, has in fact the natural structure of a digitally symmetric formulaous algebra. And then we have another important notion, namely the one of a relative self-functor on a finite C module. This is an endo functor such that Is an endofunct such that we have isomorphisms of this type. So going to the dual here amounts to interchanging n prime and acting with in addition with this enter functor. And if you have such a relative staff functor, then M is actually exact. So this is a nice way to check whether Module category is actually exact. And also, this is not a module functor, but it's almost a module functor, it's twisted by a double dual. Now, with this concept, we can reformulate by saying that By saying that M is a pivotal module category if it emits a relative surface, which can be trivialized and, in fact, trivialized as twisted module functor. So we can put an identity here. And then the important theorem, which is relevant for what I will do with the conformal field series now, is that actually this That actually, this category of right exact module endo functors is an exact module category over the Drainfeld center, and also we can give its relative SERF functor explicitly in terms of data for the category C and for the module categories M and N. And if, in addition, C is unimodular, that means that this object here, the distinguished invertible object, is. Convertible object is just a tensor unit and M and N are P bottle, and also this category is P bottle. So we can use this results about P bottle module categories for this particular module category. Now let's see what we can do with this. Well, the first observation is Well, the first observation is that the internal home object can be rewritten by just using essentially Yoneda lemma and then the junction of the defining junction for the internal home in this form here. And when we now apply this to the particular case that the relevant module category is this functor category over the drin function Over the Drinfeld Center. And then for our proposal for these defect fields, we get that we can write the formula, rewrite the defect fields as an internal home in this functor category. Now, the homs in the functor category are a natural transformation, so it's natural to So, it's natural to call this structure here an internal natural transformation. So, the conjecture that I made about the defect fields and then a special case about the bulk fields can be phrased as saying that we can write them as internal natural transformations in this sense. You can check that in the rational case, this gives what you expect: namely, realize the module categories m and n as categories of modules, and then the functors here as tensor product with suitable by modules. Then you can show that the contents of simple objects in this object. In this object here in the center can be written in this way. So, and this is precisely what is known in the rational case for the expression for defect fields, well, the decomposition of defect fields in terms of simple objects. So, this is the first check. Another check is that you can show that just like for That just like for ordinary natural transformations, there are horizontal and vertical compositions of internal natural transformations, and you can use them to describe horizontal and vertical operator products for defect fields. So for the vertical case, you compose two defect fields that are on a defect line to a single one. And for the horizontal one, you have two defect fields. You have two defect fields on parallel defect lines, which you fuse, and when fusing the defect lines, you can fuse the corresponding defect fields. And it can be shown that if you realize them in terms of these internal natural transformations, then this is you get a very precise. You get a very precise prescription for these operator products. And when you do that, you can check that your representation in the case of vertical operator products, that's the case that has been considered in conformal field theory before in quite some detail, you reproduce those formulas that have been obtained in the rational case. Then another check. Another check, important check, is the following. Under these conditions, by the results that I mentioned, we know that these objects of defect fields, when we do not change the type of defect line, that this is a symmetric Frobenius algebra. And you can also show that in the particular case of bulk fields, it's a commutative symmetric. Fields, it's a commutative symmetric for Venus algebra. And the consequence of that is that actually you can show that the sewing constraints that you have for pure Baldfield correlators are satisfied. Name the Baltville correlators you get by taking the pair of pants as a building blocks and putting them together. And then you know that the sewing constraints that you have. Sobing constraints that you have boil down to the crossing symmetry for the correlator of four bulk fields on the sphere. So, if you have a four-bulk field correlator, there are three ways to chop this into two pairs of pants and the resulting correlators should be the same. And a similar thing using the arbitrary defect fields show. Arbitrary defect fields show that you can treat also correlators for defect fields. So, on the bound field side, this is nice, but I now should come to include also boundary fields. After all, I want to tell you about how you get the bulk from the boundary. So, we have to say a bit more about full conformal field theory. You can have physical boundaries not to be mixed up. Boundaries, not to be mixed up with gluing boundaries. So these are boundaries which are labeled by, which have a label which we call a boundary condition. And there are boundary fields which can change the type of boundary condition. Now, these in rational conform field theory are again well understood. Namely, one knows that if a boundary segment is adjacent to a bulk region, Adjacent to bulk region that is labeled by the full conformal field theory corresponding to some module category M. Then the possible boundary conditions are just the objects of that module category. And also the boundary fields changing the type of boundary condition can be expressed in this form here. And now this you can easily recognize via the internal homo junction. internal home junction to be nothing but an internal home, namely from m and m prime. This is very not only known in rational conform field theory, but it's generally expected to be valid beyond a rational conform field theory. And there are this has been actually used in various approaches. In various approaches already quite some time ago. So it's very natural to assume that concretely now, if M is a p-bottle module category or p-bottle finite tensor category, we still have this expression for boundary fields as internal homes. And once Once you accept this, then you can use the following result, which takes some time to prove, but it's maybe not too surprising. Remember, that you can express natural transformations as an end over HOMS, and analogously you can show that this internal natural transformation set. Natural transformation satisfy this formula here. So, this is an end over the module category of the internal homs between for g of m and g prime of m, where g and g prime are these module functors. And in particular, if you take g and g prime to be the identity functor of a module category, then this gives you an expression for the bulk fields as For the bulk fields as an end. And maybe that's the main message of this talk, which explains the title. If you know the boundary fields, then look at those which do not change the boundary condition, take the end over them, and what you get is the bulk fields. And this is maybe the one for. This is maybe the one formula that you should remember from this talk, or maybe you should remember a little bit more: namely, that these boundary fields are actually internal homes. There should be no prime here. I remove that. And this is known and expected beyond rational conform field theory already since long. But for the bulk fields here, there is another locus expression as. There is an analogous expression as or a similar expression as internal natural transformations. So I have 12 minutes left or something like that. So let me mention first very quickly the following check of this aspect. And in the boundary fields, these internal homs Internal homes have a natural algebra structure. So, this gives you a candidate for the operator product of boundary fields. And indeed, by the same results that I mentioned before, the boundary fields which do not change the boundary condition realize a symmetric Frobenius algebra. And this for arbitrary boundary fields, this generalizes to a kind of algebraic. Algebraic version. And the consequence of that is that if you look at now correlation functions involving only boundary fields, then again, you satisfy the sewing constraints. So the building block is now a three-boundary field correlator on the disk. And there are, of course, now several possibilities because you can have different boundary conditions. Have different boundary conditions. But again, this boils down, the sewing constraint boils down to crossing symmetry for four boundary field correlator. And you can check that this indeed works out. Let me also mention that the treatment of boundary fields and the treatment of defect fields that we have had before is actually very similar. We simply We simply go from boundary case to the defect case by instead of C considering the Rinfeld center and then instead of a module category over C look at this functor category which is a module over set of C now once we have both the bulk and the boundary Both the bulk and the boundary. We would like, of course, to bring them also together and look at correlators which involve both bulk fields and boundary fields. And then if we do so, then we need one further building block. And this is often called the bulk boundary operator product. And accordingly, there will be further sewing conditions. I should mention that these sewing conditions for the For the bulk and boundary case, have been worked out in detail by Congley and Unkel, but in the way I present them, they were already known much longer from a work by Lavelle in 92, which essentially amounts to not being detailed about Detailed about whether these fields are incoming or outgoing. So that aspect is suppressed when I just say there is one additional building block. Now, what does this building block correspond to? Well, heuristically, one says we move a bulk field close to the boundary and then This way we excite some boundary fields. In more precise terms, we mean that there is a morphism. Well, not from F, because F is in the Drinfeld center. So we apply the forgetful functor from the Drinfeld center to C to it. And then from U of F, there should be a morphism. This is a morphism from U of F to B M M which Which why the homo the internal homo junction we could also write in this form. And then a natural candidate for this is simply the m component of the denatural structures morphism of m f as an end. So here it's important that we can realize the bulk fields as an end. And I will assume that this is the right description and then can again Again, check well, make various checks that this works out. First of all, one can show, one can look at the compatibility with the internal homo junction for these two situations, boundary fields and bulk fields. Bulk fields and together with the natural product or ultravio structure on internal ends. There are also coming also evaluation morphisms of this type. So we can act with With this object, this particular object of C on M and analogously with this particular object of the Drinfeld center on the identity functor. And by the definition of these morphisms, one can show that the M component of this natural transformation here can be expressed in. Transformation here can be expressed in terms of this morphism in this way, which involves precisely this M component of the denatural structure morphism of the end F. And by our assumption, this gives us this bulk boundary operator product. Once we have this, we see that this gives a relation between That this gives the relation between the bulk boundary operator product and the operator products in the bulk and in the boundary. And you can write this out in the case of rational conformal field series and see that various results that have been obtained in that case are reproduced. So, for example, in the simplest case where A simple case where the Frobenius algebra A is given by the monoidal unit, one knows that what are called the structure constants of the bulb boundary operate product are just six Shay symbols. And in the general case, there are certain generalizations of those. And this follows very naturally here. Another check is the following. This is one of these sewing constraints, namely compatibility. Namely, compatibility between the operator product in the bulk and on the boundary. In a picture with these building blocks that we have, it's this picture here. So it simply says that if we look at a disk with one boundary and two bulk insertions, then first moving the bulk insertions to the boundary and then taking a program. And then taking a product on the boundary is the same as first taking the operator product in the bulk and then moving to the boundary, or in categorical terms, that this structure morphism IFM is actually a morphism of algebras or in formula the product that we have on the boundary. That we have on the boundary here composed with two copies of this morphism is the same as morphism composed with the product in the bulk. Now, there is actually nothing to be shown here because this is nothing but the description of the canonical product on an end over algebras in terms of the denatural family. The denatural family. So, this follows almost automatically. There is one other sewing constraint combining a bulk and boundary that we can check, namely the compatibility of moving a bulk field to different regions of a disk, which has also two boundary field insertions. Insertions. In terms of building blocks, this looks like this picture here. And in mathematical terms, this amounts to the equality of two morphisms. Well, one way to write it equality is equality of two morphisms in U of F tends B and M to B n M. And these two morphisms are. These two morphisms are described in terms of string diagrams in this way here. And one of them simply involves these denatural structures morphisms for N, the other one, the one for M, but in addition, has half braiding here. And I made a canonical half braiding of F as an object in the Drinfeld center and the component, well, the inverse of that, the inverse of the component. Of the inverse of the component for this object of C. Now you can check that this is indeed satisfied and I don't want to go too much into details, but just mention that the half braiding on the object F, actually, I haven't, I just have told you so far that F as defined by the co and is. And is actually an object in the Drinfeld center, not just in C itself. Now, you can actually describe the half-grading directly with the help of the end structure of F. And if you use that, you easily can show that half-brading satisfies an equal. Halfbraiding satisfies an equality of this type here, which I have written as a formula. Again, also, you can apply denaturality to these evaluation morphisms that I have already used. And this gives you an identity of this form here for arbitrary objects in C and specializing then to this object being the boundary object being. Object BNM gives you expressions which, in one case, involve the co-product of the Frobenius algebra, and in the other case, the product. And then you use the Frobenius property to show that this equality that you have here is actually satisfied. Satisfied. So to summarize, what I have been doing is I have given you a proposal for the field contents of a full conformal field theory. And the proposal is that this holds for whenever the underlying category C is a Category C is a model of finite tensor category. This is what I call Richard finite conform field theory. It's based on the old, already old idea that the boundary field should be internal homs for the module category that describes the full conformal field theory together with expressions for the bulk and. For the bulk and also defect fields as internal natural transformations. And these consistency checks, among the consistency checks that I have shown to you, are in particular all those, all the sewing relations for genus zero. Now, the arguments that are used in making these checks are largely categorical. Largely categorical, and as a consequence of that, there is a good chance that at least some of them will even survive beyond rigid full conformal field theories, rigid finite theories. But of course, there is one important restriction. We have checked here the genus zero sewing relations. Sewing relations. There are also two relations at genus one: namely, modular invariance of a torus with one bulk field insertion and the so-called Cardiac condition for an annulus with two boundary insertions. These are more complicated, and at the moment, I don't have anything to say about those. Another thing one should certainly do, or at least try to do, is Try to do is that you give a prescription of a consistent set of correlators on arbitrary world sheets. And the problem here is that various methods that work if you only have bulk fields are no longer sufficiently developed. So, in particular, Developed, so in particular, there is no open-closed nice version of the LIGO Teischmüller game, as far as I know. Then, one could also try to treat more channel defect fields where one has junctions at which three or more defect lines meet. That actually should not be so complicated. Another thing is to combine with a new approach to CFD correlators. To CFD correlators with the help of the string net construction, which is due to Christopher Schweiger and Jang Young. So far, this is only available in the case of rational CFT, but the methods are such that there is some potential that they might generalize beyond rationality. And as a final remark, let me mention that in all I have been doing rigidity. Been doing rigidity plays a very important role, even though this is not always very visible. But duels have been around at many places. So certainly the ideas so far have to be general. We will not directly We will not directly generalize to the situation that we have heard in Simeon Wood's talk on Monday, where we only have, for example, only Koden Dikbertier structure instead of a rigid structure. But in any case, this is something one should try to do. Okay, I'm more or less. More or less, I'm more or less finished in time. So thank you for listening. Thank you very much for the nice talk, Jürgen. Good, we have time for questions. Please unmute yourself or raise your hand if you have a question. If nobody, then maybe I start. Jürgen, I'm quite interested in generalizations beyond finite. So what would be niceness conditions that you would need in order for non-finite categories for your story to generalize? Well, this is a hard question. This is a hard question. We use various results which we know are valid for finite tensor categories. So the only thing I can directly say is that one would like to be as close as possible. Be as close as possible to those when generalizing, but I do not have a concrete proposal. Maybe if I may say something. Sure. Yeah, I think for the moment, it's very difficult to circumvent rigidity. So if it's rigid, then you need to ensure that certain coens you want to have exist. Would want to have exist at least in a as int objects or some more general objects of the category. So it would be very interesting, Thomas, to investigate int objects in these categories you're interested in. Yeah, and the categories I am interested in are actually usually rigid, locally finite, but not finite, and maybe also have some nice non-degeneracy property. Nice non-degeneracy property. So, so really, I think the main thing that I would like to drop is just the word finite, but keep almost all other conditions. So, as Christoph said, it would be nice if in a suitable sense the coens exist, and then of course another ingredient are the internal homs. So, they should it would be nice if they exist in your categories. They exist in your categories. But there's something nice. There's something nice to test Thomas' categories. It's to see whether they have a nice Trinfeld center. Right? Because typically these big categories tend, the naive objects you have tend to be too small to admit a half braiding. And you need to go to bigger objects to have a half braiding. So if you know anything about the Drinfeld centers of this category, Trinfeld centers of these categories, this would be a useful first step. Okay, I will think about it. And then you can start to see whether the central monad in terms of co-ends or ends generalizes in some way. Yeah, I didn't mention the central monad at all in the talk, but Monod at all in the talk, but various of the formulas can be expressed nicely in terms of the central monad. So this is another structure that would be nice to have under control in the general case. Yeah. So I think for the co-ends, they will probably. Co-ends they will probably be in some completion of the category, but uh but that shouldn't be a problem. Well, it certainly various of the results have not been do not directly apply to that, but one can at least imagine that one can prove analogous well.
