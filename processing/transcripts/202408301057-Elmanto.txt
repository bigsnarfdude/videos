Maybe if you, you know, if you're being a conscious hat on, okay, yeah, that's good. You should do that since I'm being conscious. 4-3rd. Okay, can you have anything? Have a nice junk. See you in August then. I'll leave this for next turn so this works. Thanks a lot, I believe. He could meet you. I had a good time. I think they're out front. Yeah, Mark, I saw them. Maybe I can try and summon those. Okay, I guess what the but that's supposed to serve everything exactly. It's a quick toast to have used the data. Okay, yeah, see I think it's uh changed on its way. But she's not this way. I thought you wouldn't be here. I'm here. Okay, well, for the finale of the workshop here, the last talk, we have Eldon Namato from Toronto, I guess, now, who's going to talk to us about intersection theory on Intersection theory on schemes. Yeah, so I think we should start off by thanking all the organizers for this wonderful conference. Yeah, the opportunity to bring together two kind of like separate goals into one. And all the wonderful talk that's going on and all the amazing hike there we've got. Yeah, so I wanna also thank the organizers for letting me speak about things which are neither like A1 in various nor universities, I guess, but maybe somewhat relevant. But maybe it's somewhat relevant. I say, I want to talk about intersection theory and schemes, and everything I say is joined with methods. Well, okay, we'll see, we'll see. Because as far as I understand, numerative people use Borlmore homology, whereas I don't say something about cohomology. And yeah, an alternate title for this is the Mark Levine Tribute Batch. Yeah, you'll see why. So it is a question which was asked by various people. By various people, maybe in SGA6. Mark has definitely asked this question. Srinivas later will see his more refined formulation of the question. So the question is, does there exist a charing, so an intersection theory, on possibly singular steels? Okay. So what I mean is something which is functorial for all maps between schemes over a field, let's say, and has a product at the very least. Sorry, is this joint with Akil-Matthew? Matthew-Morrow. Double T is the, yeah. Akiel-Matthew is only one T. Alright. So this is a question that is very natural to us. So we know from SJA6 or Fulton's work on intersection theory that there's such a thing on skews which is. There's such a thing on schemes which are smooth over a field. But you want to ask for an extension of this for general schemes, possibly non-reduced, possibly really singular, possibly not even quasi-projective, and just one general theory of something like this. So here's a conjecture that was posed by Srinivas in his ICM address in 2010. So he proposed the following win. The following win condition for this question. So it says there should be this thing called child star. You want the existence of the following functor from child star schemes k. So k here are the prime fields of Fp of Q up are QCQS up into graded rings. So this is just a category of So, this is just a category of weeded rings, what you think it is, such that the following conditions hold. At the very least, child star extends usual child homology on smooth scales, over king. So, child star is an entry-defined. Cast stars and to be defunct to it. There's a double, there's a column there that we don't see. There's a what? Ah, sorry, yes. Can you just say again with the superscript on schemes? Causi-compact, causes separated. Okay. And finally, college. You said rings, you wrote college. Is it collage over some? Great commutative rings, yeah. So this is just my notation for a few rings. No, no, just creative rings. Just things like, you know, this graded commutativity condition. Right. So it extends the usual Chao Commodian. So, it extends the usual Child Homologian smooth scheme square field. That's the thing that you want. That's one. Two, we know what Chao 1 should be. Cha1 of X should just simply be the Picard group of X, which is an invariant known and defined for all schemes since the dawn of mankind. So, two, three. So, we also want to know. So we also want to know, we also know the values rationally. So this is like a person? So it's existed from the Azone of Park. He probably was, yeah, before Adam or Eve. Okay, so three. So we have K0 of X. So this is really the Grotenic group of, say, if you Of, say, if you want to be super general, really perfect complexes. But if you have an ample line bundle, then it's just vector bundles. So this is where some, where the kicker, one of the kickers really is. It's like, I really want to look at vector bundles, not coherent tree. So if I take this bulkmaked ring and I rationalize it, I want to get the rational version of this child theory via some kind of true character isomorphism. Character as morphism plus compatible with atoms operations. So we really know what happens rationally and we really want an integral structure or an integral extension of this child theory. So one of the things that you should appreciate with this kind of isomorphism is that the product structure on child groups can be difficult to define because it means some moving lemma or that which should normal code. Loving lemma or that which novel code. Whereas in this thing, you know how to tensor product divide the lambdas. So this is like one of the things. So that's three. Okay, so for you want a projected bundle formula or a theory of trend classes. Okay, so Gruthni taught us that if you know what chow star of P R of X looks like in terms of X, namely that this is isomorphic to chow star of X generated by an element called C1, modulo C1 to the R plus 1, which is usually how the projective space, projective bundle over X looks like. If you're able to compute this, then you can produce a whole To compute this, then you can produce a whole theory of trend classes for this co-model. Oh, sure, for all vector bundles, but let's say, yeah, you need it for all vector bundles, but let's say I just want this. Okay. Yeah, so this is like a projected bundle formula, and this is one of the things that you asked for. Very good. Or five. Okay. So this turns out to be the trickiest eventually. So Sudi Baz asked for the following condition. So suppose Z. So, suppose Z is a sub-variety inside X. So, X is my QCQS scheme. And suppose it lands inside the smooth locus of X. So it's a close, irreducible sub-variety of X, but it lands inside the smooth locus. It's like contained in the smooth locus. So Z can be horrible, it can be horrendous, but it must be hidden, tucked away in the smooth locus. Then you should be able. Then you should be able to create functorial classes. So, Z, I say this is codimension R or codimension C. So, you should be able to functorally associate the class of Z like the child groups at degree C of also. So, this is the cycle here. So, he has some relevance to algebraic cycles. And uh yeah. So six, there should be realizations. There should be a way so cycles are notoriously very difficult. You know, you don't want to think about cycles really. You want to understand them by its realizations. So for example, there should be a transformation from chow star of x to h2 star of xz. xz if x is over c, let's say, if let's say 1 over L is in Ox, so L is invertible in set X, then there should be a map to H2 star a tau homology of X with Z L star coefficients. And if a characteristic of the thing is P, then there should be a map to the crystalline homologue. These are all ring homomorphisms. Correct, yeah. They should be ring homomorphisms. And so this is 6 and 7 compatible with yesterday, if you use some standard models. Correct, yeah. All the expected properties that you can imagine. So I'm not going to write 7, I'm going to put star and extra structure. On this child star. So, for example, there's this hypothetical Bayless and block filtration that you can put on chow star, and you want like a singular analog of that. So, maybe I'll just write some names, or block Balinson. And then you want the standard results on algebraic cycles to hold, like Reichmann's theorem, Reichmann Forschen theorem, and various other things, which he did not really make precise. But I would consider one to six if you. But I would consider one to six. If you look at his ICM address, you can find this conjecture in that paper. So any questions so far? What is the meaning of the notation X over L? Sorry? It's a Christian homology of X over the width vectors of F P, P and Z P. Okay. So yeah, so the theorem joined with Matthew. Join with Matthew is that we have this. This is true. Or rather, we propose a candidate which verifies all these properties. Okay. So that's nice, but I want to tell you kind of the story or history or difficulties behind this problem, and then in the final maybe twenty minutes or so. In the final, maybe 20 minutes or so, explain to you the construction. But yeah, I want to kind of tell you a little campfire story since we are in an environment where there are bears and campfires and things like that. Okay. Yeah, that's not good. But is it true that such a functor exists? Yes, such a functor exists. I can tell you what it is, but unfortunately, you have to go maybe. Unfortunately, you have to go maybe. But anyway, yeah. So, number one, I want to make a comment about A1 invariance. So, one of the demands is that chow 1 should be picked. So, if R is, let's say, K X Y modulo X squared minus Y cube, in other words, the cospital curve, then pick of R. Pick up R. Does anyone know of the top? What this is? Do you know what this is? Of the top? Extension by a GA of C. That's the answer if we put a Picard stack, but so just the Picard group is just K. Yes. What? Sure. Ah. Sorry. No, never mind. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. No. But Kristen is absolutely right. No, but Kristen is absolutely right. He could put the proj. Yeah? So this is kind of strange. It's a GA. So the Picard stack is actually GA. And GA is not even invariant because pic of R adjoint T is isomorphic to KT plus. So in fact, it's known in the old Italian days. In the old Italian days, like traversal, that pic is A1 invariant and then affine if and only if it's semi-normal. And this is the simplest example of a reduced but not semi-normal scheme. If you've done a nodal, it was the same thing. Correct. Okay, that one's easier for me to understand why pick is part of a normal thing is. Yeah. Normal thing is that's just pickled in this. Yeah, that's right. That's just because KT star is a complicated k. Yes, it would be K cross. And then on the whole family. It should be KT cross, but KT cross is the same as K cross. Correct, exactly. It should be KT cross, and KT cross is A1 invariant. I mean, cross is A1 invariant, but plus is not A1 invariable. Plus. Right. Because the editor remotely is BK star in that. Exactly. Yes. Ah. So maybe that's what's saying that pick of notes. Peg of node is equals to peg of node times A1 because they're k cross. So this means this is bad because so therefore this child star, unlike what happens to your the theory you might be familiar with from if you open a photon, it's not even invariant. Fulton, it's not E1 invariant. Not the E1 invariant. And in fact, we already know this, K0 even rationalized, is not in one invariant, so the criterion that rationally must be K0 just doesn't work out. So you cannot appeal, cannot use so-called conventional. Thank you. Motivo-motivated theory. So, maybe we already said this on the second day or something, that like multi-motopy theory is tightly related to child groups and motivic homology and so on. And this object will not belong to conventional motivational theory because of the failure that we don't know. That's one error. One. So, two, I'll write other candidates for this child theory that was talked about before. So, in Chinese talk, we have Bao, Phil, and McPherson. And then there is also by Anderson and Payne for some K-theory version of this. And more recently, Tony Anala. And let me tell you why this doesn't quite work. So, because we want rationally our theory to be k0, which is the criterion group of vector bundles, the Fulton theory doesn't work because rationally the Fulton theory, so this is just algebraic cycles modular rational equivalence, if I rationalize this, this is isomorphic to G-theory, which is a Grotenay group of coherent sheaves inside of the vector bond. Coherent sheaves instead of the factor on it. Which one? The one where you open up the book, then you read. Oh, algebraic cycles, module, or rational equipment. I see. So it's like a bora morphology, right? Maybe. Yeah, often you distinguish that by putting the star at the bottom. Maybe that's better. But what in your wish list? In your wish list, was there a reason you wanted K instead of G there? K instead of G, there? G is not a, it's not a ring, for example. So this is a, so, right, so let me say, let me say more, let me say something better. So this is a Borelbo homology theory. So it has like proper push forwards and you know flat pullbacks, but not all pullbacks. So in K-theory, one of the things that's like functionality is different. You have flat Like functionality is different. You have all pullbacks. And the kind of theory that I want, or 3D bus wants, is theory that's compatible for all pullbacks. I'm going to say that. So as a fix, BFM proposed this thing called operational chow theory, which has kind of made an appearance in a Charoni style. So operational chow star takes in something like a Boral-Moore theory. Something like a Boral-Mohr theory. So if you make sense of a Boral-Moh theory, you can produce something called op chow star F. Okay, so this is like well, okay, fine. Okay, I'll say what it is. So this is a bivarian theory. So there's like it combines together both push and combines together the homological functionality and the homological functorality in a formal way. And then for other. Okay. Uh and then for out of this you can extract some kind of child star output. This is a possible candidate. However, this is A1 invariant. And it has like this very strange property, which has to do with this hyper-envelopes thing that's been mentioned. So if x tilde to x is a blow-up, then this operational child star, right, so you might be very happy because this is, of course, not a flat. You might be very happy because this is, of course, not a flat map, but it has functority for flat maps. This injects into op chow star of x tilde. And this is something that is not true on the level of K theory. So operational child theory is something that, you know, only really built from the world of homology theory and forces you to produce a homology theory. So this doesn't quite work. So Anderson, in fact, produced Of k. So they produce this operational k0, but this is not isomorphic to it. You can take a mobile curve and just blow up the singular point and jet it. Yeah. That, yeah, agree. So op k0 is not isomorphic to k0. So there are operational theories derived different from k0, so you don't get the right value. But Ananha fixed this. But now I'll fix this. So let's call. So what Tony does is some derived extension of this notion of bivariate theories. So there's operational algebraic cobaltism, which is what Tony, operational derived algebraicism that Tony defined. And out of this, you can produce some kind of op k0 anala, which is equivalent to k0. So this Equivalent to k0, so this problem goes away. But nice. But and furthermore, you can show the following. So op child star anala rationalized is isomorphic to k0 rationalized. So we are kind of happy with this. So for some time, this was like, I thought, well, the better candidates for this problem, but cha1 is too big. Or rather, he's not able to prove that this is pick, and the suspicion now is that this is a sum and of pic. Or yeah, this is some n of pick. Or too small. So this also doesn't quite work, even though it's kind of somewhat promising at the outset. Can you really also do something that doesn't have a function? Yes. So yeah. So Tony's construction. So yeah, so Tony's construction only produces for you a fun like a a billion group functor. And yeah, he cannot build this like fundamental classes, for example. Okay. Yeah, by the way, so let me just say that Anala Shin recently posted a paper that says the theories differ. So the theories that we propose really differ from history. It's a really cute counterexample. So that's the second remark. It's this operational thingy. So three. There is block August, like a block August perspective. And maybe this is something that. And maybe this is something that's heavily studied by Kato Saito and their collaborators. So if X is smooth over a field, then there's the following formula which is I think very beautiful. The char star of X, so conventional char groups, the Fulton style char groups, is isomorphic to the following ring. To the following ring. So you take cohomology. Let's say it's a risky, but you can also put this nebbitch of x with coefficients in the k-theory sheaf. So the sheavification of the k-theory groups. And you can also put a Miller K-theory there. If you put quillants, equivalent proof this. And if you want to put Miller-K-theory, you should put Kurtz. So, how do you read this? Okay, so the way that you understand this formula is that child 1 of x is isomorphic to H1, the risky X K1. I mean, this is what this theorem says, but this is nothing but a Picard group. Just because K1, whatever you might have heard about K theory, this K1 is really Gm. So this is an extension of this como. So, this is an extension of this cohomological formula for the Picard group. Maybe you define Picard group by some V divisors, and you want to produce a cohomological home for it. And that's one. So, that's a proposal that was promising, but Mark and three of us showed that this doesn't really work. Which one of the bullet points breaks down? Yes, I'll say that. Yeah, so Levine's. So, so Levine's univas. So, I'm going to write R, or maybe spec R to be K X, Y, Z, W modulo X, Y, Z, W, product together, product 1 minus X minus Y minus Z minus W. So, this is a sub scheme of A4, and it tries to model the homotopy type of boundary delta 4, which is the 3-sphere. So, it's a homotopy type of that, if you oversee. So, that's what they contemplate this object. There's something funny when you do this. So you can look at k0 of the ring R, spec R of course. And this is isomorphic to a copy of Z. I mean, there's always like rank of a vector below, right? And this direct sum, the leftover thing, is K3. Is K3 of the complex numbers. Let's say I'm over C. So if you look at this, this is just some version of a suspension isomorphism. So you have to justify this, you have to make some calculation, and if you know excision, this is how you prove this isomorphism. But there's a suspension isomorphism between K-theory in some sense, and the K-3 appears, I mean, it works. That K3 appears, I mean, it wears its ugly head on T0. So, K3 of C has two components. So, if you are not an expert in K theory, I apologize, I can't really explain this too much, but there are two components to K3 of C. So, there's Milner K-theory of C, which is something to do with symbols, something which is defined using generous and relations. And then there's K3 in decomposables, which is the leftover. So I said that one of the bullet points, rationally, this thing must respect, like, whatever child groups are, okay, this must respect the atoms decomposition of k0 bar. So the atoms decomposition has different eigenvalues. So this z has like, let's say, k to the zero eigenvalues. So k is some number that I chose to make this atoms operation. This thing has k 3. 3, k to the 3, in this k squared. That was simple. So you have this cyclical operation that acts on these things, and these are the eigenvalues of this thing after I tensor with Q. So if I know, if I somehow learn that this is H0, okay, I'm just gonna shorthand this, H0K0, H1, K1. H1K1, H2K2, and H3K3, right? This is what you expect from a formula for K0 in terms of this block-august decomposition. Then this H0, K0 is isomorphic to this Z. And you can show that H3, K3 is isomorphic to this H2 of C by some kind of suspension isomorphism as well. So in particular, this thing is zero. So there is no way to. So there's no way to eigen space in this in this in this interpretation of child groups. Sorry, but yeah, so it gets mixed up. I mean you cannot separate out these two things. And even if you replace the K3 with a K3 miller, you just lose the material. Absolutely. Absolutely. Completely. Exactly. It's too small. This is too big. Yeah, so you expect that this K3 and decomposible. Expect that this K2N decomposible would appear here. But this is not zero, but because this is isomorphic to this, this must be zero. That's no good. So that's already not reasonable, so you don't do this. So, what you don't do is take the homology with coefficients in the middle K here. You can also try to do that, it also doesn't work because in normal K-theory, Doesn't work because the nominal k-theory will only be able to see this. And this one turns out to not be a k. The minimum version of that is not that. It doesn't matter if you take k-theory. K2 is normally the same as the k2. Correct. That's fine. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's the thing. So maybe this is number three. Number four, I'm going to skip one of the things. Skip one of the things. Okay, so there's also this thing called further structure. It's a bit vague. I don't want to go into the weeds of this block building something because even in the smooth case, it's not fully proved. But let me write down a statement which is kind of concrete and has made its appearance in the Markovin's talk. So I have k equals to k bar, a mobile algebraically closed field, not necessarily currency zero. Let's say a. Let's say A is a finite type that there is this thing of dimension. Let's say dimension D there is F D K 0, okay which is a subgroup of K 0. which is a subgroup of K0A defined by classes kappa X, where kappa X is the residue field of a smooth point of spec A. So because X is inside the smooth locus, this kappa X, right, there's a causal resolution of finite length. So you can take the alternating sum and make it land inside. And make it land inside K0, and the subgroup generated by those guys are called Fdk0 play. And the D is all the dimensions. Which is why it's closed parts, aspect. Closed, okay? It's mostly closed. Well, the A is a, you say a finite type of case. Yeah. But then spec A doesn't make sense. Oh, finite type K algebra. Sorry. Sorry. So in the good old days, this is really a candidate for zero cycles on A. So this wants to be like child over zero bets of A. And if it is true that A is a smooth K algebra, then it is isomorphic to the Fulton-style zero cycles on A, which was discussed in Mark's. Which was discussed in Mark's talk. And Mark also talked about the Euler class of a vector bundle. So if I have E inside a vector bundle over spec A, then there's this Euler class of E. So I'm over algebraically close field. I'm not doing anything quadratic. Although possibly a story like this will work. In that world, so E of A, E of E of E is inside this F dk zero of A. dk0 of A and a conjecture of Murthy which has since been disproved by Levine very away from the characteristic and then Krishna's universe and Krishna says that this is a complete destruction the splitting of a vector button To splitting of a vector bundle of rank D. So if E is rank D, then E of E is zero if and only if E is isomorphic to E prime direct symbol. So this is what Mark talked about when he talked about obstruction. But for A smooth, is but for E smooth. Sorry. Yeah, so this is defined for all A. A and if you are smooth, you can use motivational motivity theory to prove this. If you are not, you have to use other results, which has been proved. What if you have a known smooth voltage? Zero, which is zero. Yeah. Well, you assume k is algebraically closed, so you always have a dense. Yeah, if you are, exactly. If you're a finite tech separate. Reduced, let's say. If you want, yeah, you can say what you mean reduced. Yeah, reduced. Sorry, I think that's. Yeah, reduced. Sorry, I think that's better. Sorry. Okay. All right. So, should all these theories only depend on the reduced system? No, absolutely not. This will be point number five. Okay. So, okay, so there's a theorem. I mean, the real thing, or like the thing that implies this, so moved the immediate reduction that says this is true as soon as you know that child zero or like f um d k zero bay. dK0A is torsion free. So there's a reduction rather than non-trivial that says as soon as you prove this, okay, for this A, then you win. Ah, when D is greater than. Okay, so now one of the things that we were able to prove in Things that we were able to prove kind of within this similar structure is that if I set chow zero of A to be our chow upper D of A with this algebraic equals assumption, then that's isomorphic to F D K0 of A plus a new proof of torsion freedom. That doesn't use much geometry, or we exploit this recent development in prismatic homology. So, this is like an altogether different proof of this theorem. Okay, so that's what I that's the definition of charity. Yeah, I'll tell you. No, this is the new definition of charity, which I haven't told you. Yes, exactly. Okay, all right. Never mind, what's more definitions on the other? Yeah, A is a reduced finite type algebra over an algebraically closed field. Of dimension B. Yeah, this is the same thing. Okay. Alright, so six is deformation theory. So there is a usual setup for deformation theory where there's this. Theory, where there's this geometric category called Artin K algebras, which are augmented going to abelian groups. So I'm going to look at the following. I'm going to send x to this new chow, to the kernel of child star of x times spec A. Sorry, let's call this A into child star of x. Char star of X. So the spec A is augmented, you can pull back, and then you can look at this difference. So this is some kind of deformation theory of this functor. So all of us would live in this part of K0 for any algebra. Yes. Um it's more like it's more like if you put a Picard group, then you're looking at like this formal Picard group at X. At like this formal Picard group at x of x. This Art and Maser theory of formal brain and formal Picard group, just imitate kind of the same thing. Now, X here, let's say, for simplicity, smooth and projective. Okay. So make a remark that's not in general. Star is not in general nail invariance. So it does see the thickening. This is not a constant thing, it's not zero. So if, and we already saw this when child one, so child one of x, which is pig, and that is deformation theory. I say characteristic P, because that's like what I'm most familiar with, is controlled by H1, Chris of X over W. Okay, so this is, in the literature, this comes under the name of Cartier Dudonet theory, Cartier Didonet theory. So, if I were to write this functor as like curly CHX, then curly CH1, if I'm over a perfect field of characteristic B, is isomorphic to H1 of XW tensor over something called the Reynolds with the formal bit vectors. So, you're able to recover the entire definition theory of this functor just from knowledge. Theory of this functor just from knowledge of the first Kirsani cohomology, tensor, some kind of formal bit vectors. So, this is like an old story, but with Shuboti-Mondel in progress, we are trying to get formulas like this for this. So, it just gives you a definition theory of cycles that's meaningful. It doesn't just deform in a constant family. You can't really understand. Constant value. You can really understand all possible deformations of a cycle if you fix an x-set a central fiber. Okay, so I really have 20 minutes left. Berlin Chow thing is a sh what is a functor from Artin augmented to K algebra. We think of it as you're studying the deformations of the cycles inside of the fixed X. Correct, correct. Absolutely. Absolutely. Going back way, way earlier to the wish list, and you mentioned if you have a cycle in the smooth locus, that should be in your thing. Now, if you had two cycles, You're thinking now, if you had two cycles, both in your smooth locus, is the intersection, the ordinary intersection through the ordinary, what you'd want to be the ordinary product. That's all part of the package. That's part of the package. But somehow, not every element in this child is of that form, which is kind of annoying. And there are speculations on how to really give a cycle-theoretic interpretation of this thing, but it's still that's like, I don't know. I think that's a bit out of reach. Yeah, but that's a good question. That's a good question. In particular, your Chow is like a module over Chow, the ordinary Chow of the Smooth Locus. You can multiply it. Yes, if you like. How is that? I mean, you can take a cycle in the smooth locus and multiply it by anything else, in the non-smooth locus. If it's closed in the whole thing. Yeah, if it's closed in the whole thing. Sorry, yeah, yeah. Right. It's not real, it's not really the chow of the smooth locus. Yeah, sorry, it's. It's that doesn't work. Yeah, sorry, it's it's that doesn't work. I guess 'cause the question was if you had a something completely in the smooth locus and you mult you multiply it by something well I guess you don't have uh you don't necessarily have a cycle for thing. Yeah, exactly. There's stuff that's not cycles. Exactly. It's not that all cycles. There's stuff that's not cycles. But you can definitely take a thing which is hidden in the smooth locus, tucked in the smooth locus, and then copy it with s anything you want and get something else, which may be crazy, but who knows? Which powers to be? It's the functor is the difference between child of x times spec A and child of x. Yeah, but we're going to define something that knows. Yeah, this is the new child. We're going to define a new functor with this. You are going to tell us that the child. You should put EM as a subscript for the child. So we're going to have to ask you. This is the new child. Okay, fine. Tell you later. All right. Yeah, so the construction, and so for many of the K-theory people in the room, this is like you're probably sick of it by now, but okay. So the strategy to build this child theory is to kind of enhance it a little bit, ask for more. A little bit. Ask for more. For any j greater than or equal to zero, I can construct these complexes called the motivated complexes of x. And in a moment, I'll tell you how to construct this. But this is a complex, a usual chain complex. And I can take the 2j cohomology of this chain complex. And that's what I'm going to call chow star of x, chow j of x. Chow j of x. Maybe nu or something. So if x was smooth, this is exactly how you extract from the cycle complex or block cycle complex or multiply homology or whatever the ordinary child groups. You just look at the 2jth keys. So this is a new construction. So this x mapping to this complex is a new construction. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the same play in the playbook. So you just take the 2J. Play in the playbook, then you just take the 2j homology of this object. And then verify properties. What else needed? So now I'll tell you what this object is. Let me give a definition and then we'll give the motivate. Yeah, so definition. So X signal. So x, so qcqsq over k, or k, so k here is output q, and then k is fp here. So what I do is I take zj A1 of X. So out of motivic motivic theory, I can extract candidate motivic complexes. Candidate motivated complexes. So this is A1 invariant, this is nil invariant, and very much topological in nature. So this is not the correct thing. Sorry, can you just remind me quickly what that is? Okay, here's a construction, which is not the definition, but an equivalent formulation. Okay, so I take the usual, I'm going to write here block. Here, block of x. Sorry. So this is block cycle complex. This is built from algebraic cycles from smooth schemes. And then you formally extend it to all schemes by a procedure called left hand extension. Kind of just formally extend this in a stupid fashion, in some sense. That's not the correct thing, but you need to chiffify with respect to the CVH topology. So if you're not familiar with this, So, if you're not familiar with this, what I'm doing here is I enforce blow-up descent. If I see a blow-up square, I just have to make sure that it gets taken to a homotopy Cartesian square. And this is the initial theory that does that. So, is this you take usual algebraic cycles, you extend it formally, and then you at force blow up the sense. So, just what kind of extension do you take a limit overall? Co-limit overall maps of Eurex to a smooth. Correct. And we just write that because. Correct. And we just write that, because it's quite easy to define. It's, I guess it's the yeah, so Zj L Sn evaluated on X, like the collimate of X mapping to Y, where Y is now smoothed over my field, right? Of Zj B of Y. B of y. That's what extend from Limits. So this construction, if you like, has been there's a pullbacks. Exactly. So, in fact, if you read Barn Fulton McPherson, there's an appendix. And in the appendix, some version of this was written down for child words. This is just a fancier version of what's going on. But anyway, so I do that, and then I Anyway, so I do that and then I make blow of descent happen because anything that is motivic, like A1 motivic in nature, has CDH descent. So that's the only thing that's missing, I just make it happen. There is this corner. So on the other corner, I have the following. I have omega greater than or equals to j of x over q. So as written, this is just the jth truncation, upper truncation, upper brutal truncation of the Hodge complex of x. Of the Hodge complex elect. Omega j, omega j plus, omega j plus two, and so on. But of course, it's not going to be that simple. I'm going to do this left-hand extension, do the same procedure, but with like omega now, and I'm supposed to completely respect it of Hodge filtration. So I'm important to ignore this hat, just for technical reasons. But I do the same thing, just for Hodgechomology. Well, not for Hodge, but like this Hodge filters. So there's some Hodge theory. So there's some Hodge theory involved there that you have to stick in. And now I impose this just. So making the J bigger and bigger. Correct. J, J plus 1, J plus 2. And then we can perspective that. Correct. Absolutely. And you can also do this in the CDH world. And then evaluate on X. So this one is even better. It's even more familiar. Over C, More familiar over C, this is the usual Deline complex. You look at Deline things, it's like that. So, you can, what I have a student who like is trying to redo all the lean from this perspective, it's doable. Yeah, so there's a map like this, which is non-triggle to construct. So, the hard part is to make this map. The hat goes over the L in the bottom. Correct. Just so I punch. I mean, if you podge complete on the smooth things, you get zero. Yeah, it's like that's zero. Okay, so now you can take the pool back. Okay. So this thing is so the idea is this, so this thing was wrong, it's too topological. You need to like some you need to produce a theory which is sensitive to deformations, sensitive to like Stiff to deformations, let's stiff to like nilputen thickenings. So, well, I like coherent cohomology, that's something obviously you know tied to nil-putin thickenings. And I also like Hodge theory, which has, which is uh, I mean, conventional Hodge theory is just smooth, so it doesn't even make sense to talk about nilpoten thickenings, but there's a derived version of hodge theory, which is what is this. And that is sensitive to nilpoten thickness. So I just tried to modify it in some way to make it to make it to be to be sensitive to this to this thing. To be sensitive to these things. But that's a pullback. All right, so hopefully, this is a comprehensible construction. Yeah, so what's left when you take the hodge completion of this left-hand extension? What's left? Yeah, I mean, on the smooth things, you get zero. Yes. So what are you getting? Yeah, that's a good. What's roughly speaking? It's like. Yes. Roughly speaking, this hack thing. Roughly speaking, this hack thing, what you do is the following, okay? Maybe here's an answer. So you take x, maybe it's affine, you put it inside affine space, and you take the Hodge cohomology of this affine space, take the Drum cohomology of this, of this affine space, and complete it at X. So that kind of completion is a Hodge completion. You're completing the cohomology. Now, the scheme. Yes. And that's what a Hodge completion. This is a theorem you have to part of. That thing is exactly this. That that thing is exactly this hard formula. We can talk about that later, yes. Yeah, so if you like, there's this hard-schoon formula, and it's like it coincides with this in many situations. Okay, yeah, so alright, so that's this. So in over Fp, I'm just gonna write down the same thing, but it's modified a bit, so Zj mode, ZjA1. ZjA1 of X. So the thing that goes here is this thing called syntomic homology of X, which was studied by Barat Morrow and Scholzo. So this object, let me just say that it has made an appearance in all the literature by Elu Z, but refreshed by butts. Okay, then you do the same L C D H thing. And then let me take a look at my Z J modes. Okay. So you take this homotopy Causes first. So again, you're trying to modify this A1 invariant theory with something which is. Invariant theory with something which is kind of differential forms in nature. So I wouldn't have time to tell you what this is, but this has also to do with differential forms on X, even in characteristic P. Any questions? So I'll tell you why this is a reasonable definition. And then maybe if I have time, I'll tell you a funny formula for commons. So if x is common over a smooth projective variety, then the zero cycles that you produce now have something to do with. Has something to do with uh differential forms on X, on the core data taking over. Okay, so that's the main theorem, the construction of this of this Chow Nu is just for these fields. Only Q theorems, there are other fields. So I mean I can work over any field, right? K is telling us what it is in these particular cases. Well, so K is a prime field, F P over Q, and because my definition is over any scheme over K, Over any scheme over k, then it works over any fields, right? I can't just regard an x scheme over f9 as like a scheme over f3. That's right. Why it suffices, like if you have such a general definition, it suffices to work with prime fields. Good question. But it is field-sensitive, by the way, so yeah, maybe that's something that will make an appearance there. Okay. It's an absolute theory. Computed for the cusp? It's an absolute theory, yes. What? Can you compute it for the cusp? Cusps. You can? Yeah, definitely. You can compute it for cusp, you can compute it for nodes, you can compute it for cones so far. I think that's pretty much the most complete post-form computations that we have. But it's the early days. Okay, so why is this reasonable? So this really depends on like the whole the work of the whole community the K-theory community in the past I would say I don't know 30 years or something which has arrived at the following fullback square for some reason so this is K-theory spectrum of X which pi 0 is K0 but as a whole spectrum this can be described in terms of three other pieces so that Three other pieces. So there's this homotopy K-theory of X. So this is K-theory made A1 invariant, which belongs to conventional homotopy homotopy theory. There is a map to topological cyclic homology of X. So there is an approximation to X called Tc. And maybe you're not familiar with this, and I won't have time to tell you what it is, but over Q, then this is just equivalent to this thing called negative cyclic homology of X. The distinct or negative cyclic homology events. So, this is an object that's produced from oxygen homology. And then it is glued together along the CDH unification of this theory. And yeah, so this theorem constitutes the here. Sizinski U distu, Na antamo. Then this works for any general scheme X. So K-theory is described in terms of this differential forms type piece and this A1 invariant piece. So if you wish to define a filtration on K-theory, I just have to filter these three things and then work hard that they are compatible. That's kind of a simple definition. kind of a simple definition. So this is the equation for this definition. Of course, if you just define it like this, it's hard to prove properties and the hard part is proving properties about these things. So for example there's some vanishing bound that you expect on this motivic homology because you know someone vanishing bound on K-theory and that's something that you have to work hard to prove. Weibull's conjecture, like Weibull vanishing bound for negative dps. Correct, negative dp's. Yes. Yes. All right. So we finish off with the following thing that, you know, this construction can... So you're saying your pullback square is like this fullback square, but analogous to this pullback square. Oh yes, exactly. That was a point of telling us about this. Exactly. And you already said it, but it's going to be used. I think I. Yes. So just because I know this pullback, I can prove this pullback squared. Well, people can prove this pullback square, then we just use, yeah, we just refine this pullback square on the photo level. Okay. So I could, in the last five minutes, kind of tell you more about this theoretical stuff, but let me maybe display for you a funny formula that you can prove. So let's say. So let's say I have x inside projective space over some field k, characteristic k is 0. There's also a characteristic p version. And then let's say this is dimension d. So you can take the column, which is an affine scheme now. Which is an affine scheme now of dimension D plus 1. It's not a pullback, but it's the code. Yes, it is dimension D, it is dimension D plus 1. Sorry, yeah, fine. Oh, there's a map that way, not the working map. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Apologize, yeah. Yes. Well, no, there's nothing that way. You have to close it up. Yeah, so you're taking your number. I want to come with the vertex. I want the cone with the vertex. Oh, yeah. Okay, whatever. I can take the cone. What are you doing? Okay, I can take the colon. I can take the. You take the column. I can take the inverse image, I call it C, and I take C bar. Oh, it's the colon. Which is the mention D plus 1. Thank you. So there's this thing that is of interest, child D plus 1, of Of this column. So notice this is not affine. I've taken the affine column with the point. So this is a singular variety. And this is really Childi Nu. So it's isomorphic with the direct sum. So you do the bar. Sorry? Are you doing the bar? I'm doing the bar. Oh, yeah. Not in the next line. Left of R in the next line. The CX is this. Oh, the CX is that. Okay. Sorry for the. The C exactly. Sorry, but it's not a right. It's smooth, so there's no way it is. The X is smooth, right? Yes. Yeah. So the CX is also smooth. So there's nothing. Wait, no, CX is a connoisseur. Cx is a cone point. C X is a cone point. He's taking the con over of smooth things. Yes, it has one singular point. This is smooth? He has one singular point. Oh, then CX is the singular of X. X is the singular. C X is defined to be if you take the column, and you close it up in. I'm sorry, but what's the D plus 1 form? Is the dimension D plus 1? Well, it is dimension. Okay. I see. Sorry. Got it. CX is the CR. Yes. So here's what you get. So this is like this is the analog with zero samples. This is the analog with zero signals. Yes, exactly. J greater than or equals to 1. So what you get, so x is smooth projective. This is an affine. But the zero cycles can be described purely in terms of like the dth commodity of x with coefficients of omega d, d is the dimension of x. Twisted by this, you know, yes, it comes with an embedding, right? It comes with an O1. So you just keep twisting it. Run across all to. Run across all twists. Yeah, makes it oh, because the cone depends on the embedding. Exactly. So it understands the embedding. So this zero cycle somehow understands some cool module embedding. And if x is like finite type over q, then you can use seriduality to basically kill these reads, which is something that was previously observed in the original share. But we should also see somewhere inside there the zero cycles on the original X, no? The points that live in the smooth. The points that live on the smooth go away. Exactly. They kind of go away. So everything is coming from things that aren't cycles. What about the torsion in the omega? Torsion in the omega. Yeah, I mean, the Taylor differentials, for example, one on the cone, torsion because it's singular. Absolutely, yeah. You see it in a differential. You see it in a different childy. In a different childy. It's a different format. It's out there. I see. It's out there. You can make it appear. Okay, great. Yeah, so that's like funny. I don't know what's in. Questions for converted over ZP. We spread out Z, we specialize from Q. Specialize for GMA. So, Tess Bowie, who's a student of Matthew Morrow, they've constructed such a theory over Z. And yeah, extended. It's their thesis, it's coming up. It's not out yet, but it will appear soon. What kind of basis is it over? Z, over any basis. Yes. So you can talk about deforming things over. Talk about deforming things over different vectoristics, which is nice. But they're less, you know, the theorems that they prove is a bit less refined, but of course it's like harder, so what do you expect? Formula little reminiscent of what's a remote local cohomology at the cohort. Where you just twist. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But why aren't there any negative j's? Yeah, you mean the the whole thing the whole thing. Maybe that vanishes. There's a vanishing theorem somewhere. Probably, yeah. And do you know the other sub-dimensions? In general, in the other dimensions, there will be some spectral sequence whose terms look like this with various numbers. So there will be extensions. It will not like. Extensions, they will not like split. And are all the sort of the geometric cycles? So, the cone kills the zero cycles. Does it kill the higher cycles as well? No, actually it doesn't. So, can you sort of say how much of the sort of ordinary cycle period of the projective guy sort of, how much more is there or less, or does some of it get killed? How do you compare it to that? That's a great question. So, I don't have a specific answer to that, but let me, if you're tantalizing. Let me, if you're tantalizing conjecture that we maybe suspect could be true. So there are non-geometric cycles inside Chao J for any scheme. But you imagine that, like, you know, here's a way to put, like, you take a scheme X, right, and you can embed it into some, let's say it's quasi-projective, you can embed it in some large projective space. You can imagine that every cycle is pulled back from some smooth thing inside the projective space. This is probably not going to be true, but you have to iterate this construction many, many times and maybe fill out the entire thing. So you have some. Maybe fill out the entire thing. So do you have something mapping your singular thing? It's just something that's. Let's say I'm quasi-projective, right? But singular. And so I have a map to projective space. And so you have some random cycle which has no geometric meaning. You can imagine that it's pulled back from something which has geometric meaning on projective space. And then you can say that, but it's not going to be true that everything is going to be filled up like that. But you can imagine that if you do this, because you're not fucked reality, so you can sort of see, can I get some of those things from? So, to see, can I get some of those things from the biggest things? But I should say that there was one of the things I did all along. Because it was your thing. Oh, that's yours. It would allow continuous type of single. Yes. Like, not in the gross money and things. Yes. So that was... I'm not going to contribute that because there was this idea. She would see this calculation from that point of view somehow, but this stuff, like. Could use somehow. But this stuff, like this, this funny thing for the zero cycle, the zero cycle is on this cone. We could stick the cone in something smoother. That makes sense. But that would be a related question to that. Does a singular variety have a fundamental class in this theory? Well, singular varieties do. Oh, singular variety, singular variety, it's not singular, close sub-like a proper sub-subject. If you say you get a bet it, you have a pullback. I understand. What do you pull? You have a pullback. I understand. What are you pulling back? The only thing you can pull back would be the fundamental class on the oh no, you can just take the child, the thing in the child. Exactly. You're just taking the thing in the child. So it has a fundamental class living in the epi and smooth. The ebian smooth thing is back. Exactly. So if you're a proper singular thing, you still have a fundamental class in this theory. Yeah, because you can put it in a set projective space, and then just. Oh, no. Yeah, pull it. Yeah, if you pull back something or something smooth, then you need a class. Yes, exactly. There are more classes than what's really bus dreamt of. Have you done any more computations with singular findings? Yes. What else? Coincident over finite fields, over, you know, characteristic P, notes and notes and worst. Maybe that's about it in terms of systematic computations. Is there like a KUNIF thing? I mean I don't even know. KNIF. Yeah, Z. So like in my I'm recording. But the the the magic the the difficulty, the complication, the reasons why we love K-theory, to me personally, is the failure of the Kund formula for K theory. Of the Kund formula for future. In many ways, but of course, it's still an interesting question to ask: to what extent does these things have Kund formulas? Which sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Well, if there aren't any more questions, let's thank Eldon again for lending us to talk. Right, everybody on a good trip home. I guess we've got lunch now. The hidden paper. Go ahead. So now the column C. Yeah, now it's over Z. So test proof that projected by what you want to pronounce. You should pronounce this in there so. Really? What? What? That's a disaster. I shouldn't have to know this. That's a disaster. I should notice what was happening.
