First, I also would like to thank the organizers for this wonderful opportunity. And the talk is based on my joint work with Lachidi Salakor, is a postdoc at Ohio State right now, and with Shu Wen Xi, he's a PhD student at Urban University. At Auburn University. Here is the alternative of my talk. I will start with some general chemotex models and problems. Next, I will discuss two basic problems, that is global existence of classical solutions and the asymptotic behavior of strictly Behavior of strictly positive solutions or chemotex models with a logistic source. Then I will talk about how chemotex affects the spatial spreading speed and the minimum wave speed of traveling wave solutions. Okay, so let me start with the chemotex models and Chemotex models and general problems. Chemotex is the ability for living organisms to respond to chemical signals by moving along the gradient of some chemical substance. Either towards the high concentration of the chemical substance, in this case, it is called the positive taxes, or away from it. Or away from it, which is called a negative taxis. So here is a chemotax model involving one living or mobile species and one chemical substance on a domain in Rn which can be bounded or unbounded. If it is bounded, certainly we need some boundary conditions for the model. Conditions for the model. And U represents the population density of a mobile species. V represents the population density of a chemical substance. Now the middle term here is induced from chemical substance. So the Kaver function is the sensitivity with respect to the chemical substance. Chemical substance. If it is a positive, means positive taxes, and negative means negative taxes. The function f and g are related to the growth of the mobile species and the chemical substance respectively. The primates tau and d are non-negative numbers. They are related to They are related to the diffusion rate of the chemical substance. Now, chemotest models are also called Kilo-Sego models due to those two pioneering works, RI, Kilo, and the Siegel. And here I want to mention those two survey works on chemotex models, just for your left. Models, just for your reference. So, for this chemotex model with one mobile species and one chemical substance, it is called parabark chemotex model if both tau and d are positive numbers. Now, if tau is zero, d is positive, that means the chemotax That means the chemotex chemical substance diffuses them fast, which is called a parabark elliptical chemotex system. If tau positive and dz, that means the chemical substance diffuses very slowly, and that is called the parabark ODE chemotax system. Now, in any case, the dynamics of a chemotexis model depend on the function KaBa, F, and G. And here I want to mention some functions Kaaba, F, and G, which are widely studied in the literature. First, for the sensitivity function Kaaba, and those are And those are two types wider study in literature. First is so-called singular sensitivity. The V is in the denominator. So if a chemical substance, the density is small, that is big, in fact. So therefore, it's called a single sensitivity. Now, that appeared in Professor Hu Yapin's talk, if I remember correctly. Collector. The second one, the function Kaaba is a constant. This Kaaba in the right hand side means a constant. Okay, Kaaba Yu. And also, if I remember correctly, that appeared in Professor Printing Greedo's talk on Monday. And those are two choices for the growth function f. F is zero. F is zero. In this case, the chemotas model is called the minimum model. And another choice F is this one, logistical source. And now for the growth function G, those are the two functions widely studied in the literature. And the first one, biologically, means the mobile species. Means the mobile species consumes their chemical substance. And the second one, biologically, it means the chemical substance is produced by the mobile species because this is mu and you here. Now the parameters here are all assumed positive. Okay, so about Okay, so about the chemotas models, and here are some fundamental problems. First, the global existence and the final temporal up problem. That means with the for any given initial function, the solution of the model exists for all the time, in this case. In this case, we see globally exist or it exists up to some finite time. In this case, the solution goes to infinity as the time goes to this finite time. So it is left to finite blow-up. Now, when the solution exists globally, then it's natural to ask the asymptotic behavior of the solution. And target behavior of solutions. And there are two types of problems here. One is if the initial function is strictly particular. And some several problems here. And another, when the domain is unbounded or the whole space, what about asynchronous behavior of the solution? Behavior of the solutions with compact supported initial functions or frontlock supported initial functions. And those two are strongly related to special spreading speeds and the traveling wave solutions. So I want to talk about this problem for this simple model. Okay, the palabaki elliptic chemotest model. Elliptic chemotase model with a logistic source. So here the Kaaba is a constant. Okay, and it is the chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient. And the constant A means the intrinsic growth rate of the mobile species, and B is self-limitation rate, or it's called the logistic. Rate or is called a logistic damping coefficient. And now, look at the V equation. The parameter rambda is the degradation rate of the chemical substance. And the parameter mu is the rate at which the mobile species produces the chemical substance. So, in this model, the chemical substance. The chemical substance diffuses very fast and it is produced by the mobile species. And okay, in this talk, I will look at the case, the domain is unbound, it's a whole space. So for the simple case, we look at the domain is just one-dimensional space. Hold on. To see the effect of the chemo test on the special spreading and the minimum speed of the traveling wave solutions. Let's look at what we have when the chemotex is not there. That is, the Kaver is zero. If the Kaaba is zero, then the dynamics of this system Dynamics of this system is governed by the first equation because second equation is okay. The first equation is decoupled from the second one if Kappa is zero. And that is the so-called Fisher-KPP equation due to those two pioneering works. So we already see the Fisher-KPP equation in several talks and what we have for Fisher-KPP equation. First, okay, this constant positive solution is stable with respect to strictly positive perturbations. That means for any initial function which is strictly positive, it converges to this constant solution as time goes to infinity. Now, regarding the initial functions with Initial functions with a compact support, or is it front rack? We have challenging wave solutions. Okay, we know this, there is a minimum wave speed that is two times squared A. For NAC greater than or equals this number, we have a traveling wave solution connecting the positive constant solution. Positive constant solution and the trivial solution. That's minimum because there is no such traveling wave solutions of speed less than this number. Now, this number is also of the following spreading property. That is, for any given initial with a compact support, it will spread at that speed. That means That means if we run faster than that minimum speed, then what surrounded us is zero. If we run slower than that minimum speed, what we surrounded is the constant A common B. So that is what we know for the Fisher-KPP equation. So we'd like to see if we have this chemotex term. Chemotex term, how those results are affected. And for that, I want to first talk about those two basic problems. And then talk about how the speed and I mean the spreading speed and the minimum wave speed are affected by the chemotax. And here are the difficulties to study the chemotex models. The first one, we do not have compression principle for this chemotax model. That means if we have two initial functions, one less than another, when kappa is zero, we have this compressing principle. But if kappa greater than zero, we do not have that one. zero, we do not have that one anymore. So that is really the difficult. And the second difficulty is if the domain is unbounded and we do not have those super equalities, so there are also difficulties induced from the unboundedness of the domain. All right, so let me start talking about the global existence of classical solutions. Of classical solutions. And first, I want to introduce this space. Now, I only want to talk about those results which are related to the spreading speed and the travel wave solutions I want to talk about. So, I want to only present some results related to what I want to talk about. And I want to point out this one. We can solve the second equation and then plug into the first equation. So the system here can be also written as this form. And from here, then we can see, even though we do not have a comprehensive principle, but we still have a positivity. Still have a positivity property. That is, if our initial is non-negative, then the solutions will stay non-negative for t in the existence interval. So let me denote by this is the existence interval. And I want to point out this thing here. Now from here we see if B, the logistic damping is greater than Ka Ba. Is greater than Ka mu, then that is a positive. And if B less than that one, this neck, if this negative we have here negative, so become plus, then we have a second other term. So roughly that's not good. But anyhow, so remember this one. Now we have the global existence theorem. Okay, if B is greater than carbon. B is greater than carbon mu, then for any non-negative initial, the solution exists globally. And moreover, if B is greater than carbon mu, then the solution also stays bonded. Okay, the bond is this one. The maximum of the initial and this number. Okay, this is the global resistance. Is the global resistance. So we need this condition here: B greater than carbon mu. Now we'd like to see what is about asymptotic behavior for the global existence global solution. Okay, under this condition, we know the solution stays bounded. So what about the asymptotic behavior? Behavior, well, first we have the solution is stay away from zero. Now, this is important. That means the population persist. And if B is greater than two carbon mil, then we have the convergence of the global solution to the positive stationary solution. A over B for U and A over b for u and the mu of lambda a over b for v is positive constant solution. So we do have this converge when b is greater than 4 carbon mu. Okay, so these are the two basic things I want to talk about. Now let's talk about the asymptotic spreading speed. And so we'd like to see Like to see the spread speed for the solutions with the compact support initiative. And naturally, we expect it will spread. And the question is how fast and with the chemotex will speed up or slow down the spread. And for that, I want to introduce the The least upper bound and the greatest low bound for the spreading speed. Okay, so that is all the function with the compact support. And this set is all the speed C and if we run slower than the speed C, what we surround is not zero. That is all the C, such that if we Such that if we run faster than the C, then what we surrounded as is zero. So let us see minus star be the supremum of that set and C plus star be the infimum of that set. And it is clear the C minus star is less than or equal to the C plus star. That is a great slope. That is the greatest low bound for the spreading. That is the least upper bound for the spreading. And we call that the spreading speed interval. So graphically, we have that. Start with any initial and between minus c minus star t and c minus star t, the solution is away from zero. And at those two ends, the solution. Those two adds, the solution is near zero. So we'd like to see with C plus star and C minus star are the same, or at least we want to find some low bond and up bound for those two numbers. And what we have now that is the basic assumption. That assumption guarantees solution exists globally and bounded. With that assumption, we have With that assumption, we have C minus star is always greater than or equal to this number. That is a spreading speed for the Fischer-KPP equation. Moreover, if B greater than 2 kappa mu, then if we will run slower than C minus star, what is surrounded us is A over B. Okay, A over B. And under this condition, that constant solution. That the constant solution is stable. Remember that. So that's in plus if B is greater than carbon mil, and the chemotax does not slow down the spreading of the mobile species. And I should point out in the special case AB1 lambda mu also one, this is proved okay in this work. All right, now let's move. All right, now let's look at the upper bound for C plus star. And we can find an explicit up bound, C star, that is given by this number. We have that. C plus star is less than C star. And moreover, from the definition C star here, we see if lambda greater than or equal A. or equal a or b greater than this number that c star is the same as the spreading speed for the fisher kpp equation so we have the c plus star is less than c zero star that means the chemotex does not speed up the spreading of the mobile species provided this one or that one okay so graphically we have So graphically we have that. In general, when B greater than comma mu, we have the low bond for the C minus star, that is a spreading speed for the Fisher-KBB equation. We have an upper bound. And when B greater than carbon mu lambda greater than equal A or this combination, then we have a single Then we have a single spreading speed. That single spreading speed is the speed, the spreading speed for the Fischer-KPP equation. And however, in general, it is open, whether those two are the same, and with the C minus is a C0 star. That is open. Okay, now let me talk about the travel wave solution. Travis Wave solution. So a travel solution is a solution of that form. John, you are running out of time. Yes. I need like a mute. Okay. So we call it the connect zero, zero at the right end if this one. And then it connects another trivial positive solution at the left end if that is true. So that is a travel solution. That is a travel solution, it looks like. Now, here is our result. Again, that is our assumption. We have a low bound for the speed of chairman wave solution. And in the case B greater than 2 ka per mil, our travel solution also connecting to the positive stationary solution. The positive stationary solution that is about the existence of chairman wave solution, and that is a low bound for the wave speed. And now when B greater than two carbon mu, and we also have the travel wave solution with this speed, okay, low bond. And we proved that there is no travelable solution with a speed less than. With a speed less than the minimum speed of the Fisher-KPP equation. So, this is our result. And from here, we see if B greater than carbon mu and lambda greater than A, then the minimum wave speed of the spread of the Fischer-KPP equation is also the minimum wave speed for the chemotaximol. And I should point out this word. I should point out this word. They proved the existence of one travel wave solution with some speed between those two numbers. And in general, it is open with there is a minimum wave speed for the Fisher-KPB equation and if, sorry, for the chemotax model, and if so, with the minimum wave speed with the C0 star is the minimum wave speed of the chemotax model. Of the chemotesma. All right. Sorry for. Thank you. Thank you. Looks like we have spent the discussion time, but we can add some premium minutes. Okay, are there questions? Yeah, may I? I have a question. Yes, go ahead. Okay, thank you. So thank you, Professor, for very Thank you, Professor, for a very interesting talk. I would like to know: you assume throughout the talk that the diffusion coefficient is equal to one for the species, I mean for the U species. And do you expect that it would be very difficult to add the dependency in diffusion coefficients? Yes, yes. The diffusion, we could have the diffusion coefficients. Just those variations. Just those that variations may also depend on the coefficient, okay? So, so my remark was: uh, so okay, if you so I'm really interested in the limit, vanishing viscosity limit, actually, and uh I found that uh probably in the repulsive case then we should have uh there is a positive speed even when the diffusion coefficient converges to zero. Efficient converges to zero. And however, the KPP speed also converges to zero. So does it seem all right to you? Okay. It means there is a coefficient in the diffusion and when the coefficient goes to zero. Yes, exactly. Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's interesting question. But we have not studied that case. That case. Okay, so it is outside of your scope, maybe? Yeah, so far we have no result about that case. Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you. Peter, can I ask a question, Peter? Yes, go ahead. So seems this paper was published in the journal of mathematical biology. So from the perspective of biology, I want to ask whether or not there are some biological Note that there are some biological interpretations for your condition for B and kappa and mu. See, for example, B is larger than carbon mu or B is larger than double kappa mu. Is there any biological interpretation for this condition? Yes. What's that? Can you tell us that biological interpretation for this condition? So the okay, one condition is lambda greater than a. Lambda is the. Lambda is the degradation rate for the chemical substance. And A is the gross, okay, intrinsically growth rate for the mobile species. So lambda big means chemotax small because that's negative. So how about the condition between B and kappa? And B and Kappa, okay, B and Kappa B is relatively large than the Kappa. And that is And that is here. B greater than carbon can't is when B less than carbon, we even do not know whether solution exists globally. Because when B less than carbon mu, this term is positive. So here B is something like the clouded effect and carbon. The effect and copper means the chemotex coefficient. So this means B is larger than the copper. That's true. They can compete because this time like the chemotex term and that attract the mobile species move to that direction. And B like the DMP. If that big, it will push down. So prevent the blow up. So that's that makes sense. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And yeah. Okay, and yeah, two carbon mu is a guarantee that positive solution stationary solution is stable. Now, when B less than two carbon mu, there may be some other positive stationary solution. Okay, so that's easy. Yeah, there are some. That's good. Yeah, thank you, Venxian. All right, thank you. So thank you, Venxian, again, and also all the other speakers of this afternoon. So this concludes. Of this afternoon. So, this concludes the session today. Venchen, can you stop sharing? Venchen, can you stop sharing, please? Yes. Yeah, thanks. All right.
