To speak at this conference. So it's obviously happening with a tour delay, but I'm very happy to see that it is happening. And let's get started. Okay, so today what I'd like to do is to recording in progress. So today what I'd like to do is to report on some ongoing work concerning several problems for algebraic groups over higher dimensional features. Over higher-dimensional fields. And broadly speaking, all this work revolves around the analysis of algebraic groups with good reduction. So that's basically what I'm saying in my title. Now, to put things in context. Just one second. So there is some message in the... It's free. Oh, can you just? I don't think you can see that. I don't see it be on street. Sorry, Igor, we're gonna play with people. Sure. You can continue. Okay, can I keep going? Can I keep going? Yeah, as you can see. Okay, so yeah, to put things in context, I think it's fair to say, particularly in the framework of this conference, that one of the major achievements of the last 60 years or so has been the development of a rather complete and satisfactory arithmetic theory of algebraic groups over number fields and, more generally, over global fields. Now, more recently, Now, more recently, there has been growing interest in algebraic groups over so-called higher-dimensional fields, that is to say, function fields of algebraic varieties over various classes of base fields. And most of my recent work has dealt with several problems in this emerging theory. And as we'll see a bit later, one property that has come to the forefront. That has come to the forefront as a kind of a unifying theme, in a way that I'll make precise a bit later in the talk, is the analysis of algebraic groups with good reduction. Okay, so I'd like to get started by recalling a few points concerning groups with good reduction. Okay, so let's start with the definition. So suppose we have a field K equipped with a discrete valuation V. Discrete valuation v. So then, if we're given a reductive algebraic group G defined over K, we say that it has good reduction at V if there exists a reductive group scheme over the valuation ring of the completion whose generic fiber is isomorphic to the base change of G up to the completion. And then, as sort of an automatic consequence of this definition, it turns out that. This definition, it turns out that the special fiber or the reduction of G is a connected reductive algebraic group of the same type as G over the residue G. Okay, so in slightly more informal terms, what we're saying here is that our group has good reduction if it has a nice model over the valuation ring that behaves well under reduction modulo, the maximalized. Modulo the maximal ID. Now, of course, this is still somewhat of an abstract definition, but it turns out that in several cases of interest, it's possible to characterize good reduction in fairly concrete terms. Well, so first we have sort of a trivial case, which is to say split groups. And while a split group has good reduction at any place V, simply because V simply because such groups arise from group schemes over Z. So this is a consequence of Chevrolet's theorem. Now here's a more interesting example. Suppose we take a central simple algebra A over K, and we consider the group G, denoted SL1A, associated to the elements of reduced norm 1. Then it turns out that this group has good reduction at V if and only if our algebra is. And only if our algebra is unramified at V. That is to say, it arises from an Azumaya algebra over the valuation. So that's one example. And another example that I'd like to mention, since it'll come up a bit later in the talk, is a good reduction for spinner groups of quadratic forms. So suppose we have a quadratic form, a non-degenerate quadratic form Q in n variables, and we take G to be the corresponding spinner group. Then it turns out. Then it turns out that g has good reduction at v if and only if, up to scalars, our form is equivalent to a form all of whose coefficients are units at b okay, so that's a good reduction. Now, one more definition that I'd like to recall before I formulate the general problem that we're interested in analyzing is the notion of a k-form. Of a k-form. Okay, so suppose again we have our algebraic group G defined over k. Then we say that another group G prime defined over k is a k form of g if our two groups become isomorphic over a separable closure of k. So again, let me mention an example. So again, going back to our group SL1A. So suppose we have a central simple algebra A. Suppose we have a central simple algebra A of degree n over K. Then, of course, over the separable closure, it becomes isomorphic to a matrix algebra. And this means that the group SL1A is a k-form of SLN. Okay, so now that I have briefly recalled good reduction and the notion of a k-form, here's the general problem that we're interested in analyzing. So suppose we have a field K equipped with a set V of discrete valuations, and we have a reductive algebraic group G defined over K. Then what we would like to study are the key forms of G that have good reduction at all places V in V. Now, of course, stated at this level of generality, this is an impossibly difficult problem. So, really, to make this So, really, to make this question more meaningful and more tractable, we really should specify, specialize our field K, the set V, and possibly even the group G. Okay, so a little bit of the history of this subject. So, most previous work in this direction has dealt with what I like to refer to as the Dedekind case. So, namely, Namely, our field is the fraction field of a dedicated domain R, and V is the set of discrete valuations of K associated with a maximal ideals of R. So this situation was first studied systematically by Harder in the 1960s, and then also later there was work by Colyotillin and San Tzuk in the 1970s. Now from the arithmetic Now, from the arithmetic point of view, the crucial case where R is the ring Z, so this was studied in detail by Dick Gross in the 1990s. And then more recently, there is also some follow-up work on this topic by Brian Conrad. In the more geometric setting, Raghunath and Ramanatan studied torsors over the affine line. And more recently, More recently, the Ternosa Fragelian Pianzola analyzed a similar problem over the punctured athlete. Now, our work has taken some of the first steps in studying these kinds of questions in a higher dimensional situation. So, more precisely, here's the setup that we're considering, at least in the context of this talk. Least in the context of this talk. So, suppose that K is a finitely generated field. Then we work with sets of discrete valuations which are generally called divisorial. So, what are these? Well, so to define our set V, we pick an affine model X of K, that is to say, a normal integral affine scheme over Z or F P whose function field is K. function field is k and then we take v to be the set of discrete valuations associated with the prime divisors on x okay so as i already said such sets are usually called divisorial sets now if you prefer we can also formulate this in purely algebraic terms so basically considering a model x essentially amounts to finding a subring r of k whose fraction field is k whose fraction field is k and r is either is a finitely generated algebra either over z or f and moreover it's integrally closing and then in algebraic terms our set v corresponds to the height one prime ideals of r okay so that's uh the general framework uh that we're General framework that we're working in. And now, here's the general fineness conjecture, which sort of lies at the heart of most of what I'll be talking about in the rest of the talk. So suppose we have a finitely generated field K, together with a divisorial set of places B, and we take G to be a reductive algebraic group over K. So then what we expect is What we expect is if our field has good characteristic, in a sense that I'll specify in just a second, then we expect that the set of k-isomorphism classes of k-forms g prime of g, which have a good reduction all v and v, is finite. And what do we mean by good? Well, if we have a semi-simple group, then we say the characteristic is good. We say the characteristic is good if it's either zero or it does not divide the order of the vial group. And for tori, we take characteristic zero to be good. Okay, so that's our main finance conjecture. So basically, you know, in a nutshell, what we expect is that there are finally many K forms with good reduction. Now, from a philosophical point of view, this is, of course, a rather View, this is of course a rather natural kind of problem to consider. I mean, at the very least, we can see some, you know, at least formal analogs with the Schaeffer-H conjecture for abelian varieties. But more concretely, why do we refer to this as our main conjecture? Well, as we'll see a bit later in the talk, it turns out that this conjecture has close connections to several other problems of current interest. Problems of current interest, in particular, the study of local global principles for algebraic groups, some finance properties of unramified cohomology, the genus problem for algebraic group, for algebraic groups, which is concerned with the analysis of algebraic groups having the same maximum tori. And also some problems concerning weakly commensurable Zirsky dense subgroups. So this was initiated by Gopal. Initiated by Kopal Prasad and Andrei Ropenschuk in connection with some problems on locally symmetric spaces. Well, due to time limitations, I will talk only about the first and the third point. So I'll talk about connections to local global principles and the genus problem. Now, I should say that the fourth point is actually closely related to the genus problem. To the genus problem, and full details can be found in our fairly recent preprint. I'll give a precise reference at the end of the talk. And regarding fineness properties of unramified cohomology, so again, due to time limitations, I really won't say too much about that. But the point is that these considerations come up quite naturally in the proof of the main conjecture and also in local global principles for several. Principles for several classes of books. So, I guess the point that I'd like to make to finish up this section is that the study of algebraic groups with good reduction really occupies a central place in the emerging arithmetic theory of algebraic groups over higher dimensional frames. Any questions at this point before I continue? Okay, so as promised, I'd like to talk about some connections to local global principles and the genus problem. So let me start with local global principles. So here's the general setup in the comological approach to local global principles. So recall that we typically fix a field K, a set of discrete valuations. A set of discrete valuations. Well, a set of valuations. They're often discrete, but they really don't have to be. And we take an algebraic group G to find a group. So then we have the global to local map in Galois cohomology, and we say that the Haase principle holds if this map is injected. And furthermore, one defines the THI. And furthermore, one defines the THFR image set to be the kernel of this map. Now, one of the major results in the theory over number fields is, of course, the local global principle or the Haas principle in this context. So, here we take K to be a number field and V to be the set of all places of K. Place of k. So, as I said, a major result is that if g is simply connected or adjoined, then it's known that the global local map is injective. On the other hand, it's well known that for arbitrary groups, this map may not be injective, but it turns out that it is always proper. That is to say, the pre-image of a finite set is always finite. So, in particular, this So, in particular, this means that the take charge for every set is always fine. Now, what our recent results, some of which I'll mention at the end of the talk, suggest, is that this properness property should really hold in the much more general setting of arbitrary finely generated fields. Okay, so here's the precise statement. Suppose again we have a finely generated field K, and we take a divisorial set of And we take a divisorial set of places V. Then, again, we can consider the global to local map or a reductive group G, and we expect that this map is always proper. In particular, this would imply that the TRH set is finite. Okay, so as I said, I'll mention several results that we've obtained. This conjecture. We will obtain on this conjecture towards the end of the talk. But at this point, let me make precise the promised connection between the properness conjecture and groups with good reduction. Okay, so suppose that our main conjecture holds for an absolutely almost simple, simply connected group G and for all divisorial sets of. And for all divisorial sets of places. And recall, the main conjecture basically says that there are finitely many forms with good reduction at all places in our set. So suppose this holds for the simply connected group. Then it turns out that the corresponding global to local map is proper for the adjoint group and for any divisorial set. So, in other words, if we know the main In other words, if we know the main conjecture to be true for simply connected groups, then we automatically get the properness conjecture for adjoint groups. Okay, so that's the connection there. Any questions? Okay, and so now let me move on to the next point, which is the connection between. Next point, which is the connection between good reduction and the genus problem. So, as I already said, speaking, the genus problem is concerned with the analysis of algebraic groups having the same maximal tori over the field of ethnicity. So, to make this a little more precise, we introduce the following definitions. Suppose we have two semi-simple algebraic groups, G1 and G2, over a field K. G1 and G2 over field K. Then we say that our groups have the same isomorphism classes of maximal K tori if every maximal K torus T1 of G1 is K-isomorphic to a maximal K-taurus T2 of G2, and vice versa. And next, we define the genus of an absolutely almost simple group G to be the set of k isomorphisms. To be the set of k-isomorphism classes of k-forms G prime of G, which have the same maximal tori as G. And by the genus problem, what I mean is basically just the analysis of the genus of an algebraic group G. Now, of course, that's a rather broad thing. So, in my work, I focus on the following two more precise questions. Two more precise questions. First, when does the genus reduce to just a single element? And more generally, when can we say that the genus is finite? Well, it turns out that the answer is known over number fields thanks to work of Gopal Prasad and Andre Robinsuk. Namely, what they show is if G is an absolutely almost simple, simply connected group over a number field K. Group over a number field k, then first of all, the genus is always finite. And in fact, in a lot of situations, it's actually trivial. That is, it reduces to a single element. Namely, if G is not of type a n, e to n plus 1 or e6, then it turns out that the genus always consists of just one element. Okay, so what So what do we expect about the genus in general over arbitrary finally generated fields? Well, so first of all, if we have a finitely generated field of good characteristic in the same sense that we use good in the statement of the main conjecture, then we expect that the genus is always finite. And in fact, if we take k to be a function field and one variable over a number field, and g is an absolutely almost And G is an absolutely almost simple, simply connected group whose center is of size at most two, then we actually expect that the genus is trivial. Okay, so that's the general conjecture, and we verified this in a number of cases. And as I said, I'll mention some concrete results a little later in the talk. Okay, so what's the connection with good reduction? But here's the precise statement. So suppose we have an absolutely almost simple, simply connected algebraic group over a field K, which is equipped with a discrete valuation V. And furthermore, assume that the residue field is finely generic. And suppose that our group G has good reduction at phi. Then what we show is that every G Is that every G prime in the genus of G also has good reduction at V. And moreover, the reduction of G prime lies in the genus of the reduction. So this is a result that we actually announced some time ago, but the full details appear in our fairly recent preprint on this topic. And as I said, I'll give a precise reference at the end. The end. Now, from a philosophical point of view, the interesting point in the proof is that it gives a new perspective to the study or rather the existence of good reduction by characterizing the good reduction of algebraic group in terms of the existence of generic maximal tori with special properties. And in fact, in many situations, it's actually enough to require. It's actually enough to require the existence of just a single generic toroid with some special. And I should also say that although we assume that our residue field is finally generated in this theorem, it turns out that the statement also holds whenever our residue field is Hilbertian. Of course, you know, that certainly includes many fields which are not finite. Includes many fields which are not finally generated. And why do I make this point? Well, you know, this observation opens up the study of good reduction in the genus over function fields of algebraic varieties of dimension greater than one. Okay, so that's the connection with good reduction. Any questions? Okay, so basically what we saw is that, you know, if we have an algebraic group G, which has good reduction at a place V, then the same is true for any G prime in the genus. So in particular, what this means, if we take K to be a finite This means if we take k to be a finitely generated field equipped with a divisorial set of places k, then we can find a finite subset S of V such that every element G prime in the genus of G has good reduction at all places at V outside of S. So in particular, if we know that our main conjecture holds for all divisoral sets, then this would imply the finiteness of the G. The finiteness of the genus. Okay, so the point is that the main conjecture provides a uniform and conceptual approach to both the properness conjecture for local global principles and the problem of showing that the genus of an algebraic group is. Okay, so now that I've stated our conjecture and indicated the connections with good reduction, let me now spend my remaining time talking about some of the results that we've obtained in this trend. So Olivia started with the case of Tori, and the reason I do that is because basically all of the conjectures that I formulated have now been resolved in this case. Resolved in this case. So let's start with the main conjecture. So what we show is that if k is a finite generative field of characteristic zero and v is any divisorial set of places of k, then for any d greater than or equal to one, we show that the set of k isomorphism classes of d-dimensional k tori, which have good reduction at all all v and v, is finite. Is fine. Okay, so they're only fine in the mini tori of a given dimension, having good reduction at all places v and v. And it turns out that a similar kind of statement is also true in positive characteristic, provided we restrict our attention to a tori, which split over a field of degree prime to. Okay, so that basically settles. Okay, so that basically settles our main finest conjecture for Tori. Now, moving on to the properness conjecture and the context of local global principles, we actually consider a situation which goes somewhat outside of the framework that I introduced earlier, namely, we don't work, we work not just with tori, but actually with possibly disconnected algebraic groups whose connected component is a tori. Connected component is a torus. And what we show in the setting is that if K is a finitely generated field and V is a divisorial set, then for any such group D, the global to local map is proper. Okay, so in particular, if we take a K torus T, this implies that the Truffer Revital group is finite. Now, of course, this is a well-known problem in the context of number fields. But the thing is, the proof in that case relies on some results from class field theory. So in particular, Titanakayama duality, which of course is not available over arbitrary fields. So we have to do something different. And in the interest of time, I will not go into the details of the proof, but let me just say that. Details of the proof, but let me just say that it's based on certain idelic considerations. And the interesting thing is that if we return to the classical study of number fields, what our argument shows is that the finiteness of the TechFerrich group can be deduced from just two basic facts of algebraic number theory, namely the finiteness of the class number and the finite generation of the group of units. Of course, Of course, the approach using class field theory gives us significantly more information about the TR for H group. But the point is that if we're only interested in establishing the fineness, then we really just need the fineness of the class number and the finite generation of the group of units. And let me mention one interesting application of the fineness of the TechFofferish group. HR for H group. Okay, so suppose that K is a finite generated field, V is a double-serial set, and G is a connected reductive group. And we fix the maximal K torus T and consider the set C of T of maximal tori, which are locally conjugate to T. Then what we show, what, you know, What we show, what follows from our result is that the set consists of finitely many global conjugacy classes. And I should say that this result over global fields was, well, it follows sort of from some work of Philip Scheele and Laura Mora Bailey. And this was used in In work on the Andre Orr conjecture. So, but our result establishes this in the general setting of arbitrary fine legion. Okay, so that pretty much concludes the story for algebraic touring. And now, let me mention a few results for certain semi-simple groups. Okay, so let's start. Okay, so let's start with inner forms of type A, that is to say, groups of the form SL1A. So here's what we show. So suppose again, as always, K is a finite generative field equipped with a divisorial set of places V. Then we show that the number of K isomorphism class of groups of the form SL1A, where A is a central simple algebra of degree N, which have great. Algebra of degree n, which have good reduction of all v and v. So this set is finite. So in other words, we basically settle our main conjecture for such groups of arbitrary finely generated fields. And we also have a couple of results for the genus for such groups. So first, it turns out that the genus is always finite over finally generated fields. And moreover, if we And moreover, if we consider these groups SLMD associated with division algebras of exponent 2 over purely transcendental extensions, so number fields are finite fields, it turns out that the genus actually reduces to just a single L. And I should say just one word about the proof. So the proof uses crucially some results that we've Some results that we proved earlier on fineness properties of unramified Brower groups of finally generated fields. Okay, so this is pretty much all we can say over arbitrary finitely generated fields, and certainly there's ongoing work. But we have quite a number of results over a certain class of finitely generated fields. Of finally generated fields, which following Kato referred to as two-dimensional global fields. So these come in two flavors. So in characteristic zero, these are function fields of curves over number fields. And in positive characteristic, these are function fields of surfaces over finite fields. Okay, so these are our two-dimensional global fields. And so here's one result that we've established over such. That we've established over such fields for spinner groups of quadratic forms. So, if we have a two-dimensional global field K equipped with a de Saurial set of places V, then we show that the set of K isomorphism classes of spinner groups of quadratic forms and at least five variables, which have good reduction to all B and V. So, this set is fine. And we've also proved similar kinds of finess statements for several other classes of groups. So, in particular, some special unitary groups of types a n and c n that split over quadratic extensions, as well as groups of type g2. And more recently, I've been able to show at least over two-dimensional global fields of over two-dimensional global fields of characteristic two of characteristic zero, that we have a similar finest results for special unitary groups of special unitary groups of skew Hermitian forms over quaternion division. Okay, so that's concerning the main finest conjecture. What about the genus? Genus. Is there a question? The sound is not very good, so but maybe I can continue and then we'll do questions. The first line and by f in the second line. Oh, yeah, sorry. So, yeah, this the skew hermitian form is h. Sorry. Both, yeah, both should be h. Sorry about that. Okay, so that's concerning the main fineness conjecture. So, what about the genus? So, well, we showed in some previous work that the genus of one of these spinner groups. Of one of these spinner groups consists either of spinner groups or these quaternionic universal covers of quaternionic groups. So now, since we have our fineness statement for groups with good reduction, we obtain that the genus of such a group is always finite. We also have some fineness statements for groups of type G2. G2. So for example, we show that the genus is always trivial for purely for function fields, rational function fields over number fields. And over two-dimensional global fields, the genus is always finite. And we have some further finiteness results over some other classes. Over some other classes, finally generated fields. So, for example, function fields of rational surfaces, as well as certain several bar varieties. Okay, so that's the genus. And the last thing that I'd like to mention are some results on the properness conjecture. So, recall, the setup is that we consider. Recall, the setup is that we consider the global to local map in Galwa Cohomology. And we're interested in determining when this global to local map is proper. So here are several cases where we've been able to establish the properness. So for example, for groups PSL1A over arbitrary finally generated fields, then quite a number of cases over two-dimensional global fields. Dimensional global fields, and also several cases for groups of type G2. So, for example, over purely transcendental extensions over number fields, as well as function fields of certain Sierra bar varieties over number fields. And although I'm not saying anything about the proofs, I should say that, well, you know, some of these results. Well, some of these results are based directly on the connection between our main fineness conjecture for simply connected groups and the properness conjecture for adjoint groups that I mentioned earlier. So for example, this is the case for the groups PSL1A, as well as for groups of type G2. For other groups, some other considerations are required. Considerations are required, but the point is that all of these proofs depend quite crucially on the analysis of fineness properties of appropriate unramified coal molecules. And to finish up, let me just mention a few references. So first of all, let me point out our survey, item six, where we give a fairly detailed account of some of the history of good reduction. Of some of the history of good reduction, as well as the problems that I mentioned in this talk and some others, and a number of results. And also, there is a more condensed and perhaps more accessible version that appeared in the notices of the AMS last year. And then another paper that I referred to a few times is our preprint concerning algebraic groups with the same maximal tori. So there we give So, there we give all the details of the connection between good reduction and the genus, as well as applications to analysis of Zariski dense subgroups. So that's the paper that I mentioned. And finally, our various findness results for algebraic tori and more generally for possibly disconnected groups with oral connected code. Disconnected groups with oral connected components. These appear in items five and eight. And yeah, I'll make my slides available on the conference website. So if anyone is interested, that will be there. Okay, so I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Questions, please? Oh, yes, there is a question. Hi, Ikor. Very nice talk. Could you just comment maybe briefly on just the notion of genus? I mean, I understand it connects with the classical question of simple simple algorithms of the same splitting field, but what about for quadratic forms? I mean, there's also this more classical notion of genus in that concept. In that context? Is it somehow related? I mean, certainly. I mean, yeah, so maybe we can talk about this later. I mean, yes, there are definitely connections. Yeah. Okay, thank you. So, more questions? Hi, Igor. Hi, Inger, very nice talk. So, I have a general question in the theory of algebraic groups. One often has very different behavior whether the group is isotropic or anisotropic. And at least explicitly, this issue didn't show up at all in your talk. Do you have to make these distinctions somewhere? Or are these different questions where you do not care about isotropic algebra? Isotropic algebraic groups. So I mean the proofs, I mean, it's sort of implicit, but I mean, the proofs do not really, you know, make direct use of this distinction. So you are not using things like VN pairs. Not using things like VN pairs, also. Well, no, so no, this really is not, you know, no, the proofs proceed in somewhat different directions. More questions? In the definition of good reduction, you are go to the completion. Go to the completion, if I understand correctly, to define the grid model, right? The reductive model. Is this necessary? Well, so it's the reason we do this is primarily due to the connection with local global principles. So this makes it a little more convenient to work with. But that's a very good question. And that's something that we actually address in this preprint number four. So it turns out that working over the completion and working just directly Directly, you know, with a valuation ring, the uncompleted valuation ring, it basically leads to the same results. So that's something we address in this paper. More questions? What exactly is the connection to the problem about central simple algebras or central division algebras with the same maximal subfield? Well, okay, so let me just go back a little bit. Okay, so these results for groups SL1A, so of course, they use quite crucially our findings results for unramified bar groups. And these are questions that come up in the analysis of central. That comes up in the analysis of central simple algebras or divisional algebras having the same maximal subfields. The slight complication here is that knowing that you have a finiteness result for the genus of the division algebra, so that does not automatically lead to finess results for the corresponding groups SL1A. So the point is that, and I guess this is a result that really goes back to A result that really goes back to Leonard Scott is that it's possible that so having isomorphic tori obviously, you know, Know maximal tori in these groups arise as restriction of scalars of maximal subfields. But the point is that the tori can be isomorphic without the fields being isomorphic. So that's a slight complication. And so we have to do a little bit more work involving generic maximal tori. But that's basically the connection. So certainly, you know, our finest results for the genus of division. Our finest results for the genus of division algebras with the same external subfields. It's an important ingredient in the proof of these results, but it requires a little more work. So formally, the implication is a one-direction only? Well, I mean, it's not exactly a direct implication, but the result for division algebras is an important ingredient for the result. Is an important ingredient for the result for algebraic groups. Okay. More questions? Well, now it seems that it's not the case. So let us thank Igor again. Okay, so I understand that we resume at ten thirty. We resume at 10:30.
