So, the title of my talk, as it's written there, is Singularities of T-Varieties of Complexity 1. So, it's, I have given this talk before in this conference, but it's not the same talk. I mean, the whole build up and the general part is the same. I'm always doing this because I think I'm like a prophet. So I'm telling a story very often about. Story very often about T varieties is most of the talk is about T varieties, not about singularities. So, T there stands for Taurus. So, the talk is about varieties having a Taurus action. So, one example of varieties having a Taurus action, algebraic torus action, are toric varieties. So, we've seen already talks about Tauric varieties in this conference. Varieties in this conference. And my interest in this talk is about in the case where the torus is not big enough to make the variety toric. So the main object in this talk will be varieties that have an algebraic torus action. I will define at some point what the complexity here means. I can say it in advance anyway. It's the co-dimension of the torus, of the acting torus. So toric varieties correspond to T varieties of complexity. T varieties of complexity zero. Okay, so as I said before, some of you may have seen a piece of this talk, the buildup into the results. So the first image you should be seeing, it's like a picture of something. I hope we all agree. I hope we all agree this should bring to your mind P2, because it's the toric fun for P2. Actually, if I go to the next slide, it's written in Latin now. And some notation. So this is what I call the N world. So it's the co-characters of the Taurus. And there is a peak. And there is a picture that is corresponding to this sigma here that is called a fan. And that fan gives a variety, which I will be denoted by x of sigma. I will repeat this later on anyway. And this particular drawing corresponds, if you are not seeing it crooked, but if you see it, if you see it straight, this point should be one, zero. This point should be zero, one. And I guess that's. And I guess that should not depend on the screen. But if the resolution for the screen is correct, this point should look about minus one, minus one. So this should be the fun for projective plane. Again, I certainly hope that all of you have seen this before in your life. So this fan is a This fan is actually composed of four cones or phone four, sorry, of three cones, three maximal cones. For the sake of completeness, we also call cones, all the sub-cons in here. So I will also be calling a cone, this line and this one, and the origin and this one as well. But the maximal cones are enough to know the whole variable. Know the whole variety in this particular case that I have a compact variety, the projected space. And the way these three cones, so each one of these cones corresponds to one copy of the affine plane. We will see that in the next slide. And the way these copies interact actually say that these two copies of the these three copies of the affine plane are glued in exactly the way that creates In exactly the way that creates projective space. I will not repeat it, but let me just show, let me pick the green cone here and just take it here, just to remind us the way we were building these varieties. So I have the cone which was living in this end part. This end part corresponds to co-character or one parameter subgroups of the torus and the corresponding. And the corresponding dual world for that is this M world or M lattice where here. So in this M world, the dots here corresponds to actual characters of the torus. So characters of the Taurus. This dot here, these dots here, they correspond to characters. They forgot the age. I forgot the age correspond to characters of the torus. And the way I create a variety from this cone that was called sigma2 is, okay, I take in the M world the dual lattice, the dual cone, which is denoted by this sigma2 touch. And the pictures are fairly correct again, so the inner normal. So, the inner normal on this side is approximately that, and the inner normal here is approximately that. So, this is, if my pictures are correct, this is the dual column. And then I consider the integer points, which are exactly those that do correspond to characters in this M world. And I have to create a semi-group out of this cone by just taking the intersection of M. Of M, is written here. The intersection of M with the dual cone gives you a semi-group. And once you have a semi-group, you can create yourself an algebra from this semigroup. So the algebra is created here. Just take direct sum of the characters corresponds to all of these m's that are contained inside the dual column and are integral. So this cap M was missing. Tap m was missing. Actually, the multiplication rule is not given only the addition rule, but the multiplication rule is exactly what you would expect. So, the multiplication rule is when I multiply two characters, the corresponding elements in the semi-group, they add, add, and just to have it correct when you take have it correct when you take zero the character corresponding to zero should be the constant one and taking this semi this semi-group algebra in this power now in this particular case there are two red dots yeah there are two special dots that i mark in red here and it's very easy to see that these two dots they do generate the whole semi-group because this one here is the double of this one and this one here is the This one, and this one here is the sum of them both, and this one here is the double of the other one, and so on. So, these two they generate the semi-group, and as such, they generate the algebra, the semi-group algebra. And those two dots correspond to minus one, zero, the lower one, and minus one, one, the upper one. So these two are generators, they have no relationships. So, this algebra is actually the polynomial algebra in two variables, which means algebra in two variables, which means that the variety in question was the affine space. So this should be very standard, very, I hope it's well known to everyone in the room. And then we glue them together. So I'm not going to explain the way the gluing goes, but the important part is that the relative position of these cones is exactly what gives the way we glue them. That's all we are going to need to actually from the Actually, from the three copies of the affine space, create projective space. Okay, so what I want to tell you about is a generalization of such. Sorry, let me say something. So this, I can consider it like I'm giving some combinatorial data, the combinatorial data in this sun, and I can consider that this combinatorial data is given on top. Given on top of one variety that is called y, and this variety y is just the one-point variety, or maybe not zero, but point. So let's think that the variety y is a kind of quotient of the variety by the torus action. Since this example is a toric variety, so is a toric variety. So a toric variety, any reasonable quotient by the torus is going to give you just one point since it has one dense open orbit. And so this combinatorial data that I have here is living on top of a variety with one point. So now I want to generalize that picture to describe not toric varieties, but varieties of higher complexity. So where the complexity, as I said before, is where the complexity, as I said before, is the codimension of the torus acting on the variety. So what I would give is a certain picture like this one. So I have again one variety, one base variety here that it's some kind of quotient by my variety. So in this particular example, I took P1, but it could be anything. At this stage, it could be anything. Later, I could give some more precise version. I could give some more precise version of that. This is only for introduction. And what I give is something like a fan for every point. So the fan I've chosen here, let me draw it here, is the fan where you get the two diagonals. So it's the fan where this is the origin and the points are 1, 1. I'm not writing them all. This is minus 1, 1. one one the other generator is one minus one and finally minus one minus one there so this is the fun i took and i consider that i will at every point this is going to be the fun but there are going to be points that are kind of special so in the above zero i put this picture so this is a picture that looks a little bit like a A little bit like a fan, but it's not really because this one here is not a cone, and this one here is not a cone. And I haven't given the points yet. This point is zero, and this point is one, zero. Again, over another point, one, I give another strange picture, this polyhedral subdivision of the plane. I didn't wrote it here, but in the analogy, these are the NQs coming from Tariq World. And this point here, this one is not exactly the fan because the center is sitting at a different point. It's minus one half, minus one half. Just to give you an idea of the kind of pictures we have. And I would like to give you. We have, and I would like to give you in the first part of the talk a way to interpret this picture or to know how to interpret this picture into a variety. For the same way, you see this picture and you say, oh, that's P2. By the end of maybe most of this talk, I want to give you, this corresponds to a variety of dimension three having a two-dimensional torus action. I will tell you which variety it is anyway, but. Tell you which variety it is, anyway, but we will not do everything to recognize the variety itself. The same way that if I just draw a random fan, you cannot tell me which variety it is, but you know it's a toric variety and you know you can handle it. So as I just said, this is a three-dimensional variety with a two-dimensional torus action. As in the case of Tauric varieties, it's separated and complete. And complete and separation and completeness come from the same reason in Tauric varieties. Separatedness is because these polyhedra do not overlap and completeness is because this polyhedra cover the whole plane. And actually, I thought I was giving the variety later on, but the variety corresponds to the smooth quadric in P4. So just to be clear that we all talk about the That we all talk about the same thing. I have the standard notation for Toric varieties here. The only thing that may be non-standard is that I used in this talk Q as a vector space to tensorize, not R. But that's maybe that's a choice. Some people choose Q, some people choose R. It's no big difference. So, but this is the standardization for Torik world. Toric world is going to be the same. So now let me make let me make this part now. So the part where I come where I show you how to go from the picture in one color to an affine variety. So here I will be chosen, in this image, I will be choosing one color, the red color, and I will show you how all these pictures, only the red. Pictures only the red part, how this gives you an affine variety with a two-dimensional torus action. So some context before, so now an actual definition. I've said it many times, but let me show you. Let me show it in written for once. So a T variety is just a variety having a faithful torso action. So I added two things. So the faithfulness here is not really a condition because an algebraic torus, a split algebraic torus, you can always divide by its kernel and you get again a new split algebraic torus. When I say t, I didn't write it, but all my t's are just the multiplicative group to the power n. And you can think of the base field as being c all the time. See all the time. So, a T variety is a normal variety with a faithful torus action. There is also the hypothesis of being normal, which is standard in Tauric geometry, again for the same reasons as in Tauric, so that this geometry of cones reflects into varieties, you need the normality assumption to get. you need the normality assumption to get the to get saturated semi-groups which translates into saturation for the toric variety so the best known examples of t varieties are of course the toric varieties i've shown you one for a long time and i guess you know many others and as i've said already they are described by fans and the important part is that of course if i as i said as i just said if i give you a random plan you can Said that if I give you a random plan, you cannot know the variety. I mean, you cannot give equations for it, or you cannot name it because it may not even have a name, but you can read many of its geometric properties from this fan. And starting from 2003, first Allman and Hausen, they and then many others have developed a kind of similar theory for higher complexity key varieties. Of course, they did not start it on their own. Of course, they did not start it on their own. I mean, they were building on previous work by maybe Demasur Dolgachev Pinkham as well. But the way I will present it now started in 2003 with Alman and Hausen and for the affine version, which is what I'm showing today. And then for the gluing, they added one more Hendrix used. So, as again in the picture of the Divisorial fan, of Picture of the Divisorial fan, and as I said, I'm going to be taking the red part. So, I'm going to be for most of the talk just considering the red part. So, it's as in the case of projective space, each of the colors, in this case, there are four colors, they give one affine variety. And the affine variety that each color gives, they are good given by the relative position. given by the relative position of these pictures. And each one gives an affine variety of effects. So this is the one we're going to focus now. They're all similar. If you see they have essentially the same shape here. So here it's the red part. And now I printed in LaTic the numbers I wrote before. I have to give the I wrote before, I have to give the vertices. I'm not giving the slopes, but the slopes are all one and minus one as I or zero. And so now this picture is a clear geometric picture. So I have a base variety, y. I selected three points, zero, one, and infinity, which are three. Any three points in Q1 could be. Any three points in Q1 could be 0, 1, and infinity up to changing the labelings. And I have my given one polyhedra for each one of these points. And these polyhedra are not just generic polyhedra, they are polyhedra that have the same That have the same recession cone or tail tone. So, let me first tell you what the tail cone is. And to give you that, I have to recall what Minkowski sum is. So, if you don't know it, it's very simple. Minkowski sum is just the sum, all possible sums you can do. So, sum every point here with every point here. So, you get that the sum of this segment with this cone is exactly this polyhedron here. Is exactly this polyhedron here. And if you have, if we have a polyhedra in this NQ, we call its tail cone is the unique cone such that the cone, such that the polyhedra I have can be written as something compact plus a cone. So the cone you can add, it's unique. Unique. So, in this particular case, this is the same picture as before, but turn around. So, this polyhedra on the left, delta, is the sum of this segment, which is a compact polytope, and the cone sigma on the right. The polytope is not unique at all. For instance, if I could be adding this, just this, let me erase more. I could be adding. I could be adding instead of the segment all this and that would will not change the Minkowski sounds but the poly cone sigma is indeed unique okay now if I fix one particular tailcone sigma I will be calling Pole Sigma the set of all polyhedra The set of all polyhedra with that particular fixed tail cone, and the set of polyhedra with one particular tail cone, they can be added. And since the tailcone, since the sum, the Minkowski sum of a cone with itself is again a cone, and the sum of something compact, compact with something compact is again compact, the set of polyhedra with fixed tail cone is actually a semi-drug. Tailcone is actually a semi-group under Minkowski sum. And the neutral element for this semigroup is just the tail cone. So if I take one sigma polyhedra and I add sigma, this does absolutely nothing in Minkowski sound. Great. So now I have to define another object coming from toric geometry. So if we have, we fix all around one Around one polyhedra, one sigma polyhedra, and this is fixed for all the time. And we want to define the support function. So the support function, you may have seen it before. So the support function is just taking. So again, the polyhedral lives in the M world and this support function is a function on the M world. So it's a function coming from sigma dual into Q and it takes every point. and it takes every point to the minimum of the duality between set point and the element in the polyhedral. Of course, since everything is convex and polyhedral, the minimum will be achieved in a vertex. So the minimum is achieved either here or here. And the vertex where the minimum is achieved. Minimum is a sheaf actually splits divides the cone into a fan and in this case it divides it into two chambers both where the minimum is achieved with one zero so the duality with one zero is just the m1 of course given that the points here are m1 m2 and here the mini the minimum is achieved when you take duality When you take duality with respect to zero, zero, so the point that the duality here gives zero. Okay. Now I have to come to mix polyhedra with varieties so that I can give you this picture here. So we take y, just as I said, y is going to be one kind of quotient by the torus action, but it's not allowed to be. Action, but it's not allowed to be just any variety. It has to be a normal semi-projective variety, where semi-projective simply means that the morphism going from y into the spectrum of the global functions is projective. So, this means that the variety is projective over a fine. That's the only. The only condition to be semi-projective, and we fixed, as we've been fixing through all the talk, one strongly convex polyhedral cone that we will use as the tail. So we define a kind of divisor, a strange thing, which is a polyhedral divisor, which is just a form of sum, the way you create divisors. You take a formal sum of codimension one sub varieties, which I'm calling them Z here. Which I'm calling them Z here, and the coefficients. And the coefficients, I will be taking them as sigma polyhedra. And again, when you make a device for you define it this way, but you say, okay, all but a finite number of coefficients are zero. So here, again, the same, all but a finite number of coefficients have to be the neutral element for the semi-group of... Neutral element for the semi-group of polyhedra. So it has to be sigma. So this is what my picture was encoding. So in this example, the semi-projective variety that I've chosen is actually projective, it's just P1. And the divisor is the one that has tail cone everywhere, except in these three particular points where different sigma polyhedra are chosen. Okay, so now So now I want to, okay, now I want to show you how I go from this picture to create an algebra, the same way I did at the beginning for the target case. So we fixed this polyhedral divisor and we're going to take the support function. Remember the support functions we defined a little while ago? So we take the support function for each one of the coefficients. So now Now I can. So there is a checklist in here. We can see D, the polyhedral divisor we have there, as an actual function into divisors, into Q divisors. Because, okay, if we take any M inside the dual cone sigma dual, so the dual was. dual count sigma dual, so the dual was missing. I can create a divisor that I will be calling the evaluation of t in m simply by taking the same divisor as before, but I will be changing the coefficient, which was a polyhedral coefficient by its support function. So the support function can be evaluated in M and the fact that everything was convex implicate that actually D is concave, meaning satisfying this, and the fact that everything was polyhedral means that D is piecewise linear. So I have a function that satisfies this condition down here, this convexity condition, and is piecewise linear in the sense that, okay, it's piecewise linear. Okay, so now Okay, so now let's recall what I've created. I've created for every M in this dual con sigma dual an honest Q divisor this time, not this weird divisor. So in my example, I can actually create the evaluations. So the evaluations are exactly these ones. So in this one and infinity, so here. An infinity, so here in one, an infinity, there is only one vertex, so the minimum is achieved in that vertex all the time. So as you can see here, the evaluation is given by m1 in one and this formula in infinity and at the other side it's the same. But at the point zero, there is actually some difference. My support function was m1. support function was M1 in the pink side and zero on the I don't know two quash color so these are my evaluations in the example I'm using to show you all this okay now the construction so if I take a p-divisor I created myself this evaluation divisors that I've shown that I've shown here so when I take my evaluation divisor When I take my evaluation divisor, I can take global sections of that divisor. So, this here is just nothing but the linear system associated to that device or the same way we do it in TORIC. I just multiply that. So, in the TORIC, we were putting just semi-group algebra. So, this was just the base field. But I multiply that by a character and I take direct sum. Take direct sum over the semi-group given by sigma dual, which is taking sigma dual intersected with m and this is an algebra and I take spectrum of that algebra. So let me convince you for a while that this is indeed an algebra. So of course multiplication for characters. Of course, multiplication for characters, there is no problem. The only thing that could fail is if I take f to be a section for m and I take g to be a section for m prime, I have to make sure that fg is a section for m plus m prime. But the concavity condition gives exactly that, because having this sun and this sun. And this sum, okay, the divisors or F and G can be put together and the concavity conditions allow me to go from here to here. So actually, exactly the fact that everything was convex, all the polyhedral were convex, gives me the result that A is indeed an algebra. I didn't even use that they were polyhedral. Okay. Of course, this is an algebra. It's not. Of course, this is an algebra. It's not a finitely generated, reasonable algebra to actually this being an affine variety. So this is just, for the time being, it's just a scheme. And it's going to be something very weird unless we impose some conditions on D. And the actually, the right conditions for D are this one. So a polyhedral divisor is called a P-devicer, which is the object we will be interested in the sequel. Are these strange divisors with polyhedral... Strange divisors with polyhedral coefficients satisfying these two conditions. So, in full generality, what I need is that the evaluation divisor that the priority was only a vial divisor has to be Q Cartier and also semi-ample. Semi-ample means that a multiple has a section. And moreover, if we are in the relative interior of the cone, so maybe not in the boundary, but in the relative interior, we need to ask that the evaluation divisor is The evaluation divisor is big. So big means that as M is changed by a multiple, the sections they grow as fast as the dimension. So these conditions are very hard to check in general. So the theory is not such, I mean, it's a good theory in all complexities, but in complexity one is where we get the most satisfactory results. The most satisfactory results for this particular reason. So, all these weird conditions about being Q cartier semi-ample and big in the relative interior, if the base variety is P1, it can be replaced by something very simple, simply that the degree of D, where the degree of D is defined, as you expect, as the sum of the coefficients. Degree of B is just the sum of the coefficients, have to be a subset of the tail tone, but not the full tail tone. So it has to be a proper subset of the tail tone. So this is a very, very explicit combinatorial condition, which becomes much more complicated if you want to take y a different variety. If y is not p1 but a curve, it's also easy. I mean, not as easy, but easy. This condition plus Is this condition plus semi-ampleness you cannot read combinatorially? Okay, so this is going to be the object. So this particular example works. So in our particular example of P divisor is, this particular example is indeed a p divisor. So the evaluation divisors are here. In P1, it's quite simple. it's quite simple. So being semi-ample means having degree positive or zero. Being big is having positive degree, which is the same as being ample. And all devices are Cartier because it's smooth. So we can just read from our evaluations that they are, that they satisfy what is required. required so it's securities so i have the computation of the degree in each one of the cases so i maybe i will not show it to you because i'm already running a little bit behind it's much slower going online so and actually the degrees give exactly what they have to give and if you if you think it a little bit it gives this is one limit case because it exactly in this line and two minus m one gives zero so gives zero so it's really only semi-ample in the boundary and not big the same happens here in this line m1 plus m2 gives zero so it's exactly the condition of being big only that it's necessary to be big only in the relative interior in this particular example is used it could be big everywhere and here it goes the theorem the The main theorem is that all these things that I've been telling you, they make sense. So if V is a P divisor on a semi-projective normal variety, then the scheme I constructed before by taking the spectrum of this weird algebra is a normal affine T variety of complexity, the dimension of y. And conversely, every normal affine T variety is equivariant. normal affair in T variety is equivariantly isomorphic to X of D for some T divisor and some semi-projective normal variety Y. So this is the, sorry, this is the standard result for affine toric varieties, but in this higher generality. Let me, just before I'm going to skip some parts, but let me just tell you that in these conditions that I gave here, the big nest is actually to achieve is actually to achieve the complex the required complexity so that the complexity is exactly the y the dimension of y is ensured by this bigness here and the fact that is that the algebra is finally generated is achieved by this semi-ampleness here that was already some in the essential part of this was already proven by Zariski this semi-ampleness condition okay so actually So actually we have everything we could do all the computations for this particular example I've shown you here. So this particular this particular example actually corresponds to simply to the affine space of dimension tree. It's dimension three because y have dimension one and n have dimension two. So the torus is a two-dimensional torus acting on a three-dimensional variety, which is a tree. And here is the torus action. As I said already at the beginning, I will not explain you how the gluing process works, but the gluing process is the same as in the Turi cases. So the relative positions of these different colored P-devisors, now we can call them P-devisors, gives you the way they are glued. And this is where the general case completely abandons us because these nice pictures will only work in complexity one. I will not explain why, but this nice This nice picture that I'm showing you here that gives you a the fact that this picture gives you a variety can only work in complexity one. Okay. So let me quickly tell you or just very quickly tell you there's there have been a lot of things done in this direction. So I'm it's like in 2003. It's like in 2003 when they started or 2005, they just took the any Toric book, I mean the Cox book that was being written, and then they started to try to do all the sections. So the beginning started with the simplest part, device or cot strings. So this is the way we construct toric varieties by fans, but you could also do it by polyhedra and take and only obtain the projected ones. So this is the equivalence of. So, this the equivalence of that was done also at the very beginning. Also, the formations. I myself have studied more or less, so here's Langlois as well and me, algebraic group actions on T varieties, some topology, you know, maybe just I will I will not have time to go through all this list, but you can read some names if it's Read some names if it's if it interests you. You can contact the people there or ask me. So, this G variety means the same way you go from toric varieties to spherical varieties. So, some people have generalized this description, going from T variety to G variety, following this approach and mimicking the passing from toric to spherical. So, here I come to the more in the come to the more in the part that interests us more so it was not even clear how how to check whether a variety is smooth so actually i was involved in in giving a good criteria for smoothness but in general complexity in complexity one it's always easy and the part i'm going to tell you and this which is repeated from the talk i gave a few years ago is that we can actually give a weak Can actually give a weak resolution of singularities using this method in a very simple way. And that weak resolution of singularities can be used for several things. So we did the most we can with the knowledge we have on singularities, but I'm pretty sure some people with more knowledge on singularities can do more. And there's one addition that was not here not so long ago. So the Nash problem was also studied by Langlois, who's around here. Langlua, who's around here, Murtada, and someone else, Purqui. So, let me give you, I don't know how far we'd like to go, but let me give you an idea how to get this resolution of singularities. I did not write here weak because it was not enough room, but it's weak resolution of singularities. Okay, so let me again come back to my weird construction of algebras. So, I start with the same. I start with the same object as before. So I take a p-divisor. We know what p-divisor is now. And I will... I constructed before this algebra here. The algebra A. So it's just the sum of global sections of all of the evaluation divisors. But we can do a little bit less. So we can just take the sum of the chips. So we can just take the sum of the sheaves, not of the global sections of the sheaves. So now this is not an algebra, but it's a O of Y sheaf of algebras. But the algebra I constructed before corresponds to the global section of these algebra, because the direct sum and global sections commute. And now that I have O of Y sheaf of algebras, I can take of algebras i can take not the the spectrum but the relative spectrum over y of this sheaf of algebra and this gives me a variety so i i define all this with tilde yeah a tilde is this algebra x tilde is this variety already from the original from the original work by alman and housema it's it's known that that the morphism going from this x tilde to x which is called r is proper and birational and actually the morphism from going from there is a morphism going but it's not regular morphism it's a birational it's a rational map going from x to y as i said y is a kind of quotient it's actually called show quotient but i will not enter into those but I will not enter into those details. But the morphism that goes from x tilde to y is actually actual morphism. It's not even, it's not just morphism. It's also a good quotient for the torus action. So here we have like a proper rational map on top that we are going to be using. So let me first tell you a bit of this, the description of key varieties. Of T varieties is actually not unique. As always, in the torid case, we have automorphism of the torus, and this is reflected in base change in the lattice N. Also, the show of the equivariant rational map from X to T has something to do. There is also, of course, always automorphism of the base. I can take an automorphism. Of the base, I can take an automorphism of P1 in the example before, and I will change. So, there's an automorphism taking 0, 1, infinity into 3, 4, and 7. And of course, applying that will not change the variety I obtain. But there is one more fundamental way this is not unique. I can make birational modifications of the base. So, if I take any y and I take a birational modification of this y, so I take a morphism. So I take a morphism from y prime to y, and I pull back my polyhedral divisor, which means pulling back every evaluation and making a polyhedral divisor. This can be done. Then the variety I obtain is the same because I'm pulling back the rational map. It needs to be projective. So y is projective as well. So y prime is projective as well. And of course, global sections will not change. And of course, global sections will not change. So this X was constructed with simply global sections. But this X will change. Okay. So this is probably not this. Okay. So we take again a T divisor and we take, we call the divisor to be simple. Device for 2v simple normal crossing or SNC. If the base variety is not only normal but also smooth, I can resolve its singularities, everything is characteristic zero, and the support of the divisor is also simple normal crossing. So in this particular case, if the device or the polyhedral device or the P device or I took device or the P device or I took is S and C, then X tilde, not X, but X tilde is toroidal, meaning, so not meaning, but this implies in particular that every point is locally isomorphic to a toric singularity. So all the singularities that are left of this X tilde can be resolved only using Tauric methods. So the corollary of this is what I said before. If D is simple normal crossing, then there is. D is simple normal crossing, then there is a weak partial resolution given by this map R, where X tilde have only at most Toric singularities. And it's really weak resolution what we can achieve because this map R could change the smooth part of X. So we don't have control on not changing the smooth part of X with this technique. But through everything regardless of singularities that can be Everything regardless of singularities that can be, where you can live with such a resolution of singularities, this is a good object obtained completely combinatorially. So let me give you now the results I wanted to show. So this one is just, we can use this weak partial resolution of singularities up to something that is toric. up to something that is toric so all toric varieties are rational so we can use this resolution of singularities to measure whether x is or not rational so so i wrote the definition here of rational singularities maybe i will not read it and this so everything up until now was in general in general complexity but the results so this result can also be obtained in general This result can also be obtained in general complexity. The ones that come afterwards, no. So the actual theorems that I will show, I will consider them only for complexity one based on P1. It's very easy to know that the singularities when you are complexity one, so the base is a smooth curve. So the smooth curve could be P1 or have genus. If the base curve have genus, the singularities are horrible. So they're not rational, not coinmakula, not. Not coin Makula and not do one, not anything. So the only interesting case is, I mean, for this type, the only interesting case is in complexity one is the case where the base variety is P1. So using that partial resolution of singularities, weak partial resolution of singularities we had before, we can prove the following theorem. It is very easy to read. If you have P divisor on P1 on P1 everything is SMC of course because P is P1 is smooth. I mean all devices on a curve are simple normal crossing. Now check whether the singularities are rational or not you simply have to check the degrees. So you take the evaluation. If you remember the evaluation evaluation the degree of every evaluation had to be greater or equal than zero this is this is by the condition of semi-ampleness or bigness yeah because in p1 as i said big semi-ample is having degree zero and being big is having degree positive degree but this is the degree of the divisor yes and the divisor is q divisor so divisor is q divisor so if i take round down the degree could go down and it could go down as much as it wants it could go to minus 300 of course you need lots of marked points to have a very small number so the singularities of the t variety of the complexity one t variety over p1 are rational if and only if the degree of all the evaluations this time with the divisor with the evaluation With the device or with the evaluation rounded down, it's greater or equal than minus one. So if any evaluation goes to minus two or lower, the singularities are no longer rational. So there is one example. So the simplest possible example we give here. So it's so So there is a mistake here. So this is the torus is just Gm, so the multiplicative group, we're going to get a GM surface. The base variety is P1 and the tail cone is just the, I mean, for a one-dimensional torus, there is only one ray, no, zero infinity. Up to changing t by one over t, you change the positive ray with the. you change the positive rate with the negative rate. So if I take this, I mean this particular P-devisor, so the P-devisor has coefficients minus one-fourth in one and two, and three fourths in 0.3, plus, of course, plus the array. So this is to make the everything consistent with the notation. We have that the evaluation in one In one gives exactly this, and this degree is minus two. And if my computations are correct, so this polyhedral divisor actually corresponds, you can get an equation for it, corresponds to this singularity, which is rational, but has a non-rational singularity at the origin. And Tom, there was there is here I have one question in the slide before. So that singularity is quasi-homogeneous. If you make the weighted blow up, do you get genius? No, you get P1. You get P1. Yes. In this particular Yes, in this particular case, I think in this particular case, you get P1, but it's still not rational. I see. Thanks. Okay. One final example. Can I continue the question? And the touch curve that you get after blowing up is isomorphic to the question by the CS star. By the CSTAR vibration is isomorphic to the quotient of what? Sorry? So you have a GM action. So you have a GM action. Yes, on the surface. If I blow up, I will still have a GM action. And when you and this and the GM action leave each point of this curve fixed or not? Curve fixed or not? Ah, the GM action does not fix all the points in that curve. No. No, that curve actually, if you quotient, okay, now again, if you quotient, the curve is going to be contracted to one point. You quotient by GM action. Okay, I had one final example that I'm going to be using in the next. Going to be using in the next slide. So, we can make a higher-dimensional examples. It's just simply to give you a higher-dimensional example. So, this is now it's really a two-dimensional torus. And now we have four marked points again on P1, and they are marked with one half comma zero and minus one half, sorry, one half, one and minus one half, one. And then you compute degree simply evaluate. And then you compute degree simply evaluating in this particular point one, zero. Okay, okay, I didn't set the cone, but the cone is the first quadrant. Yes, so one comma zero is in the dual cone and you get degree minus two. So again, it's a singularity which has non-rational singularities, yet it's rational itself. Okay. I really didn't just. Okay, let me just skip this one. Let me, okay, maybe let me tell the truth. The one thing we cannot generalize, all these theories, they generalized some results by Guatanage before for GM varieties. So he did the rational thing for GM varieties before us. And he also did the coin makulai in the case where the variety acting is only one, so the G, the torus acting is one dimension. So the G, the torus action is one dimensional. And the Coin Macaulay part is the part we cannot generalize. We don't see the way it's in maybe 10 years. I want to do this. And we cannot generalize the Coin-Macaulay part. So this is the best result we can get. It's not really full. Let me just skip it. And let me tell you. So there is one particular kind of singularities that are important for... I mean, there are lots of singularities important, but. I mean there are lots of singularities important, but these are important for the people in the minimum model program. They are called Dubois singularities. Maybe I will not read the definition. It is very intricate. So either you know it or you will not learn it today. So let me say I have three minutes left. Let me just show you the end result. Again, it's very hard to find singularities that are rational, but not you. That are rational but not du bois. I mean, somewhere in the limit, or that are coin makulai and not dubois. So we can get this particular theorem that seems very restrictive, but it's useful to find examples of things that are hard to find. So we call array is called big simply if this intersection is empty set. section is empty set so this is just technical condition there will be two kinds of arrays in a cone in this case the big ones and the not big ones and again we have a p-divisor we have to assume that it is coin makulai so the variety sadly you have to prove that it's coin makulai somehow differently you cannot use our our i mean the combinatorial version to prove whether it is or To prove whether it is or not Coinbaccule, but then if you know that the variety is Coinbaccule, then you have a criteria to check if the singularities are du Bois or not. And again, it's checking whether some degrees are greater or equal than one in some set. But this time, the set, as you can see, is there is some duality with race that is minus one. So this is a set of points that is not inside the column. coin this has some this is in some sense a sense a generalization of what what anadi did for for coin makule case so in that case you have to take evaluations outside the the place where you were taking them at the beginning so here is some condition along the same line and you can go and check whether your singularities do what and i have an example it's not the is not the the it's not the it's the same example as before i took it for i show it before for that for that reason so if you take i cannot give you equations for this variety but if you take the same example as before so these four points with these four coefficients two of them one half one and two of them minus one half one then you can actually compute that the singularities are two boa so this is So this is a way to create an excellent, and you can also check that this coin mercula by different techniques, not combinatorial. So because this is a quotient of something smooth. So the variety is coin-Magoule and Dubois, and the singularities are not rational. So I did not put it here, the example, but we can also produce the other example. So something that is con-Makuli and not. Coin my cool and not do one, not rational, but I only put this one in the slide, and it's perfect because it's exactly my time. So, with this, I finish. Thank you very much. Thank you, Alvaro. So, thank you for your nice talk and overview on tree varieties. So, any questions or comments? Please. So, I have one question and some comments. And some comments. Can you go back to the definition two slides? So you said that it is hard to produce singularities that I mean in between rational duvois and coin makulai. Yeah, yeah. It's hard to produce examples in both sites that are coin makulai duva and not rational, coin makulai not duba, not rational. It's a here, it's an order. It's a here it's an order, but coin macaulay not the one not rational is easy not the one not rational, that is easy. Okay, maybe no, I am reading your definition of the one. Yeah, so you take a x cube plus y cube plus z cube, you make one blow up, you resolve this is an elliptic curve and. curve and R1 pi upper star of O of the elliptic curve is non-zero because this is non-rational and it is it is coemacauli it is a hypersurface yeah yeah of course hypersurface is very yeah but you're kidding because you're but that is coin macaulay so makes sense yeah it's cool it's very easy yeah that's of course i agree it's easy yeah so that's easy i should i should have taken the Yeah, so that's easy. I should have taken the other example then. And in the paper, we have both of them in both sides. I mean, Coin McCoy, not the one, and Dubai not rational. I see. I see. Okay. And I have some general comments in the survey of results that you made. I forgot to say it. Before you say something wrong with me, I only have to say. Me, I only updated it's updated at January. I am not saying anything wrong. Okay, good. So, there is something on the NAS problem. Yes, it's very that's from last year. Yes, so NAS problem was solved in complexity one, but only when the quotient by the group action is not rational. When it is rational, it is harder. It is harder. It's really, really hard. I mean, this case, that was the reason I said, I said, so for this case, I'm only interested in P1 because the singularities, when it's not... This is the heart. This is the heart case. Yeah, exactly. Because when it's not P1, the singularities are awful. And also, I would like to help you to complete the list. So there is classical work computing intersection cohomology of toric varieties. Section homology of toric varieties in terms of the combinatorics. And there is a generalization of this for T varieties of complexity one due to Augustine and Langlois. But there is a marked him here. Yes, it's true. I was aware of that, but as I said, this is not updated. It was the last time I updated it was January, I think. But but this is this is this is older. This is uh this is old and they took a new one actually. They they put a new one recently. Actually, they put a new one recently, but the first is three or four years ago. Yeah, and that's all. Thank you. Any other, sorry. You wanted to say something, Alvaro? Oh, my point. No. Okay. Any other question or comment? Okay. If not, let's thank Alvaro again for his talk. And we resume, like in ten minutes, more or less.
