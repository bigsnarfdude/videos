Sorry. Okay, I want to apologize because I'm not going to talk on complex fluids, but nevertheless. But nevertheless, the model I'm going to talk about is related to material science, and in particular, it's related to the nanostructures which are formed in diblock copolymers. Diblock copolymers are chains of two different monomers, say of type A and of type B, which depending on Which depending on the interaction, chemical interaction between the two monomers, and depending on the temperature and on the volume fraction of one monomer with respect to the other, exhibit different nanostructures, which are quite interesting from the mathematical point of view. From the mathematical point of view, here you can see two typical situations. On the left-hand side, you see Lamellar structure, and on the right-hand side, you see the blue monomer forming spherical structures surrounded by the red one. Well, of course, in both cases, you have a thin interface separating. Interface separating the two structures, the two monomers, but the geometrical features of these structures are pretty clear. However, the situation is more complicated than this because other structures do appear which are spheres inside. Inside. So one of the two monomers forms spherical structures inside the other one, or cylinders, or more complicated structures such as gyroids and diamonds. As you can see, this depends on the relative amount of the mass of one monomer with respect to the total mass. And finally, when the two masses are almost compared. Are almost comparable, you get Lamella structures. Okay, the interesting point is that, sorry, but do you see all the screen also the bottom? Yes. Okay. What is interesting from mathematical point of view is that all these structures are bounded. Boundaries of sets with constant mean curvature. And in order to explain why these geometrical, precisely geometrical structures appear, one model had been proposed a few years ago by precisely in 1986 by Otta and Kawasaki. It's a very simple model, but It's a very simple model, but as I want to explain, it's quite effective in explaining the configuration that you see. Okay, so omega is your container, the container of your diblock copolymer, and u is the function with values between minus one and one, which describes the density. So you have u equal to one when you are. To one when you are in a region where the monomer A is, and then you have minus one on the monomer B. And of course, you have intermediate phases, intermediate value between minus one and one on the interface. So in this model, the idea is that the configurations that you observe are those who are local minimizers of Minimizers of an energy made up by two contributions. The first one is an attractive short-range interaction, which is given by it's of the type of the Canilliard energy or Modica mortula, if you want to call it this way, in which, as you can see, the well, epsilon is very. Well, epsilon is a very small parameter. So, if you want to minimize this part to make as small as possible this part of the energy, the best thing you can do is to take the function u as close as possible to one and minus one. So, to stay on the pure phases. However, if you are on a pure phases and you have to pass from one phase to another, you have to pay a gradient, but A gradient, but they don't pay so much because this gradient term, the integral gradient squared, is multiplied by a small epsilon. On the other hand, this term, this term is what? This term is given by the solution of the Laplace equation with the density function u on the right-hand side. And then you take the square of the gradient of this solution. Solution times a positive constant. Okay, as I said in the Otakawasaki model, epsilon is very small, while gamma zero is a constant which depends on the chemical properties of the materials and on the temperature. It is convenient if you want to study this problem from the mathematical point of view in order to understand the Order to understand the formation of these configurations, to let epsilon go to zero, in which case you can prove that in a precise term, in a precise sense, which is the gamma convergence sense, the minimum problem attached to these energies E of epsilon converge to the minimum problem of To the minimum problem of a limit energy, where this time the function u only takes two values, minus one and one, so you have pure separated phases. Well, the constant here when passing to the limit, it changes up to this factor 3 over 16. But the first part of the energy goes to what? Goes to the What goes to the jump measures one half of the jump of the function u across the interface? So the function u now takes only two values minus one and one. And so this term is nothing else than the perimeter, so the area of the interface separating the two phases. And in fact, the function u is, you can see, as the different. Is you can see as the difference is nothing else now than the difference of the characteristic function of the set E occupied by the phase A minus the characteristic function of the set omega minus E occupied by the phase B. So in the end you have a sort of geometrical problem in which you have this area term plus this non-local term given by this potential. Given by this potential, where again you take the gradient square of the solution of the Laplace equation with the right-hand side, the density function. Okay, it is convenient if you want to understand the problem from the mathematical point of view to assume that to work with periodicity condition. Why? This is for two reasons. First reason. Two reasons. First reason is that periodical structure are what you physically observe. And second reason is that we all, we all, I mean, people working on this problem, we conjecture that equilibria of the previous energy, the limit of the Ottawa-saki energy when epsilon goes to zero should be. When epsilon goes to zero, should be periodic. This conjecture have been, I don't want to discuss this point, this conjecture have been partially solved, but let's say, okay, let's go for periodicity condition. So, this is your general energy, the perimeter of the interface inside the flat torus, your unit cell, plus. Plus the gradient of this function v, which is, as I say, the solution of minus Laplacian UV minus the volume fraction of your set E, which in the flat torus is just a difference of the volume of E minus the volume of the complement. And one problem is that you want to understand in order to explain the configuration. To explain the configurations that you saw in the picture is under which conditions stable critical points for this energy are local minimizers. People have studied this problem by calculating the second variation of this energy. This has been done by Choxy and Stenberg in 2007. And then there is also a series of papers by Ren and Wei where they prove that certain They prove that certain particular configurations are local minimized are stable critical points and are local minimizers with respect to some special variation. What do I mean by local minimizer? By local minimizer, I mean that if you take another configuration with the same volume and you measure the distance. Measure the distance between your local minimizer E and the configuration F by taking the volume of the symmetric difference, the symmetric difference up to translation because we are working in a periodic setting. Then you want that your energy is strictly lower than the energy on F. Okay, first thing you can The first thing you can observe is that minimizers of these local minimizers or minimizers of this energy satisfy the following Euler-Lagrange equation, which tells you that the mean curvature or equivalently the sum of principal curvature plus four times the constant gamma, which appears here in the energy in this non-local term, times. times the function v is constant and as you can see since in practice this constant gamma is very small this already gives you an idea of why the configuration you observe look very like a constant mean curvature equation, because in practice the mean curvature is almost constant. The mean curvature is almost constant for local minimizers of this problem. But in order to talk of stable critical point, you have to introduce the second variation that you can do very easily by fixing a vector field X, considering the associated flow, and but And but be careful, we want to study local minimizers under a volume constraint. So in order to be sure that this family of deformation that you get by solving the associated flow keeps the volume constraint, you have to assume that the vector field X has a zero divergence, at least in a small neighborhood of. A small neighborhood of your set E. Then what do you do? Then you define the second variation as the second derivative of the energy at time zero. And what do you get? You get a first term, which is the second variation of the area term, plus two other terms coming from the non-local guy. B here is the is the Is the sum of the principal curvature, so the norm of the second fundamental form, and g is the grain function associated to the Laplace operator with periodic setting. So if you have a critical point, so solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation, you call it stable if this second variation is strictly positive for all sets, for all vector fields. Vector fields with zero divergence around the boundary of E, which you can equivalently replace by considering this quadratic form as a quadratic form on a function phi, because as you can see, the quadratic form actually depends on the normal component of the vector field x. So if you replace x dot nu. So, if you replace x.new by a function phi, what you want is that the quadratic form that you obtain is strictly positive for every phi non-zero. Remember, you have this divergence condition, which translates in the condition that the mean the mean of the integral mean of phi over the boundary is equal to zero. Over the boundary is equal to zero. So, the first result that you get in this framework is the following, which I proved a few years ago with Emilia Sherby and Massimiliano Morini, which tells you that any critical configuration with positive second variation, in this sense, is a strict local minimizer. Meaning that if you have another configuration with the same volume, Configuration with the same volume close in distance to the set E, then not only the energy increases but increases up to a factor which goes like the square of the distance. Okay, all this that I said up to now is because now I want to consider the evolutionary counterpart of the model, which is the so-called non-local Malinsekirka flow. Malinsikerka flow in which you want to study a smooth flow of sets which solves the following equation. Here Vt is the normal velocity at the boundary. On the right hand side, you see the jump of the normal derivative of a function w, which is harmonic outside the boundary of the evolving set, which Which is equal to the mean curvature of the set, of the boundary of the set, plus four times the function v, where v is, as before, the solution in your set omega of the equation minus Laplacian equal to u minus the integral of the mean value, the The integral mean of u. u, recall u is the function which is 1 over e n minus 1 on the complement of e. Note that this flow is volume preserving because if you take the derivative of the volume of the evolving set, you get the integral over the boundary of the normal velocity, but this is equal to this jump of the velocity. Jump of the normal components, which in turn is equal to zero. So the volume, the flow is volume preserving. And this flow can be obtained as the gradient flow of the Ota-Kawasaki energy by letting epsilon to zero. And this was proved by Alicakos, Bates, and Chen in 1994. Bates and Chen in 1994, and Lei, I guess, in yes, for gamma equal to zero, and lei in the general case, gamma different from zero. And in fact, this flow and the sharp counterpart, which is a non-local Mali-Sekerka flow, they can be seen as the h to the minus one, one alpha. Minus one, one alpha, sorry, gradient flow of the Otakawasaki energy, which for the case in which gamma is equal to zero, so the energy coincides with the surface energy, coincide with Il-show flow with surface tension. Let me tell, well, clearly the the Let me remark that this equation is a third-order parabolic equation because this jump of the normal components of W here is essentially related to the one one alpha Laplace. One alpha Laplacian of the mean curvature. Okay, what are the features of this flow? Is that singularities may appear at five, even though the flow is instantaneously regularizing, singularities may appear in finite time. There is no comparison principle. The equation is a third order non-linear. The non-linear parabolic equations, and there is no comparison principle. Differently from the mean curvature equation, convexity is not preserved along the flow. And local in-time existence was proved for this equation only in 2002. Okay, and just to finish, because I think my time is over, the result I want to mention. I want to mention, which is a consequence of the stability result I have mentioned before, concerns the stability of the solution of this equation. It is a result which was proved by Sherby, Ulin, Morini, and myself last year, and it goes like this. Assume that Assume that F is a strictly stable set and that you start your flow with an initial datum which is close in C1 to this strictly stable set and such that for the initial datum, the gradient of this term, which is the sum of the mean curve, which will plus four times. Plus four times the function v is very small. So you are in a situation in which, remember, your strictly stable set has a constant mean curvature. This condition tells you that roughly speaking, the L2 of the mean curvature of your initial datum, of the gradient of the mean curvature of your initial datum, is not too big. Then the flow starting from The flow starting from each zero is defined for all time and converges exponentially fast, not precisely to the set F, to the strictly stable set, but to a translation of this set. And the reason why it converges to a translation is that because in the flow there is also a translational component. also a translational components so not only you have you have uh you have the the boundary of the evolving set which are changing but together with the boundary you are also moving by a quantity which again is you can prove is this translational effect is smaller and smaller as long as you start close to the As you start close to the strictly stable set. Okay, I stop here. Sorry for being a little bit late, and thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Nicola.
