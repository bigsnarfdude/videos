People came in and went Anita, thank you for your patience and everyone on the line. Yeah, no problem. Whenever you tell me to go, I'll go. Okay. All right, well, morning everyone. The presentations today are after my heart, so I guess I'm the speakers. This morning we have Bonita Prince of Cassetto from Notre Dame and Notre Dame, and I don't understand the title, but it looks interesting. Satellite operations that are not homomorphisms. Oh, I'm importance. Oh, it makes more sense. Yeah. Thank you, Ryan, for the introduction. And thank you for the organizers for inviting me. And thank you all for coming. I have to say that I first heard of this problem, the one Problem: The one and only time that I have been in banff. We had a problem session, and it was Matt Hedden who asked this question. So let me start with his conjecture. And if Matt is in the audience, then he can correct me. But he says that if I have a pattern that gives me a side. That gives me a satellite operation. It's a homomorphism only if P is either the trivial homomorphism, the identity, or the map that reverses orientation. Okay, and so Ty, Alison, and I have been thinking about this problem and today what I'm going to tell you is I'm going to give a criterion or for a satellite to not be a homomorphism. Homomorphism. Okay, so let me maybe start by telling you what Ahomum satellite is. So here's one example. I'm going to cheat and I. So here I have my pattern. This is my pattern P. This is my pattern P, and now this is a knot, but it's not a knot in S3, it's a pattern that is contained in a solidorus. So basically, we are in the setting that Jake was talking about a couple of days ago. And again, just like what he did, I am going to denote these patterns sometimes by not just by saying that I have a knot embedded in a solitaurus, but rather by saying that I have a two-component. Rather, by saying that I have a two-component link where the second link component is a non-not. And then the operation consists of taking any companion and then by identifying this solidorus here with the tubular neighborhood of our naught in such a way that meridian goes to meridian and longitude to longitude. Longitude, then the image of the pattern under that identification is going to be the satellite knot. And this operation is defined on knots and it's not with some work you can see that is defined, it's well defined up to isotopy, but moreover, it is weight-defined and on concordance. Okay, in the sense of concordance, if we take if we just attach or identify this solitaurus cross I with the concordance, with the annulus, then that's going to give us the concordance on this side. And so that's how we get, that is well defined. And so the question is, is this a homomorphism? So let me start with one. So, let me start with one specific example. And actually, before I move on, there's one quantity here that is very important, which is the winding number, which sometimes I'm going to denote by double d sub p, which is the linking number in S3 between the two components that make up my pattern. Um so disclosure this case I will ignore completely Because I don't know how to deal with that the the methodology that I'm going to use does not allow me to consider this case in a reasonable way um this is because the you know like the method To prove that some satellites are not homomorphism involves a homological border of branch covers. So let me be more specific. So, what are the obstructions or some obstructions to P being a homomorphism? Well, the first one is we need the identity to go to the identity. So, I need P of U to be concordant to the and not. Concordant to the a not. So, in other words, I need the pattern to be a slice not as a not in S3, not just in the solitor. So if we ignore J, then we need that not to be slice. So for example, we do, you know, in this case here, which is the example of the 4-1 cable, that is not just slice, it is the end knot. So great, that we do have that. So, or bad, if you. Or bad, if you want, to prove that it's not a homomorphism. But on the other hand, if we choose a pattern that is not a slice knot, then we win and we already know that it's not a homomorphism. Then the second one, and which is the one that I'm going to use, is we would need. So if we already have the first one, then we already know that this is going to be concordant to the R naught. And so we also. And so we also would need that this sum be concordant to the n-naught. Okay, and if this is the case, then I'm going to call this a pseudo homomorphism. And this is the obstruction that I am going to use. So today. Going to use. So today show that under some hypotheses for P there exists a knot such that P of K connected some P of minus K is. Some P of minus K is not slice. Okay? But really the way I am going to do it is again, you know, going back to branch covers. So what do I know? So I have this theorem of Casson and Gordon. If I take a prime number, If I take a prime number, if K is a slice knot, then the R-fold cover of S3 branch along K is the boundary of a rational homology sphere. Or maybe let's say a three-manifold with the same homology. With the same homology as the three-sphere. So really the obstruction will be that the R-fold cover of P of K connected sum the R-fold cover of P of K P of k P of minus k is oh sorry this is not s3 obviously this is before does not bound rational homology before okay and the way I'm going to do it is Going to do it is to use the D invariant of Auschwitz and Saul that tells me that if I have some map, it's a homomorphism from rational homology, the cobortism group of rational homology spheres to the integers. And basically, so if I have a rational homology, A rational homology three-sphere that bounds a rational homology before, then the D invariant is going to be zero. So really what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you that under certain circumstances, the D invariant of these or the sum of the D invariants of these two elements. Variance of these two elements are not going to be zero. Let me do one example, or maybe let me stop here. Are there any questions? Okay, so this is sort of like the model example the two one cable, okay. So, the 2-1 cable is given by this pattern. Turns out that in this case, this is asymmetric link. So, here I have my 2-1 cable, the pattern. My to one cable, the pattern to one cable, and here I have J. And so to take now that I am realizing the cable as an unknotted component, then the two-fold cover is going to be just taking this symmetric. I have this. I have this simple involution along this axis. I should say here that the way I am representing the satellite is by introducing here the node exterior. If I remove a tubular neighborhood of this component, This component, I take so over here. I what I said was that I to get the satellite, I identify this solitaurus with the tubular neighborhood of the knot, but I can think of that instead as saying I can identify the or I can take the union of the not exterior, the companion exterior. Exterior, the companion exterior, and take the union with the complement of the, or take the union with a remove a tubular neighborhood of this component J and replace it with the not exterior of K. And so that's that's the way I am representing the satellite in this case. So over here to get the twofold cover, What I am doing is, I am gluing in one copy of the not exterior to each one of these copies. And the way I am going to record this is, you know, in the definition, what I said was that the meridian. The meridian of the knot is identified with a meridian of the solitaurus. And this is the same thing as saying a longitude of J. And so all that I have to do is look at where a longitude of this knot goes, and that's where I'm going to attach the The um the meridian of the node. So, I can, in this case, this case is kind of simple because what I have here is first, this is just a hop flink. And if I keep track of the longitude, then what I'm saying is that the meridian is going to get identified with the minus one curve on each one of these components. So I can always then. So, I can always then just put a number, and this number is going to tell me I can represent all of the branch covers of satellites in this way. Okay, so what I have over here, what I am saying is this general fact. So, let's say that R is a prime that. That divides the winding number of my satellite, then the R-fold cover of P of K is going to be the union of the R-fold cover of the solid torus branched along the pattern. Along the pattern, union are copies of the node exterior. Again, in such a way that the meridian is, each one of the meridians is going to be attached to the ith lift of a longitude of j. Okay, or if you want, I have, I can also say this in terms of the twofold cover. Of the twofold cover, the R-fold cover of the pattern as a not in S3. And then instead of taking the R-fold cover of the solitaurus, then I can just take the R-fold cover of all of S3, and then I remove the lifts of the second component. Okay, and so what is going to matter for me today is this pair, the artful cover of P of U together with this link because from those plus some linking information Or some, or the framings, the lifts of the longitude, which we can think of as a framing. And this is going to, the reason why I care about this is because this determines all of the other, you know, for any companion that I choose, I can just that can be obtained from understanding just this piece. And that's This piece, and that's going to be super important in terms of finding bounds of the invariant. But going back to my model example, so this is one description of, or this is the description of this cover that works for all patterns. But in this particular case, there's also this other magical way of describing it, which is, okay, so let's. Which is okay, so let me now introduce here my knot. Let's say here I have the knot, and then if you notice, here I have a Mobius band. So any 2-1 cable for any companion is going to have this Mobius band that it bounds. And so I can use a construction of Agvolut and Kirby. And then I can just look at the core of this surface. Take two copies of it and then sort of turn it upside down. But then I have to remove, change the orientation of the knob. the orientation of the knob and um the the framing of or the what agua term kirby tell me is that the twofold cover or in in general the arfold cover whenever you have a surface but in this case the twofold cover of any one of these knots is going to be a certain surgery on s3 along this connected sum and the framing is given by precisely the number of twists Precisely the number of twists that I have over here. So, in this case, it's plus one. Great. So, then the next thing that I need to do is I need this information. Let me just cheat in the interest of time and say that here I have these very. I have this very nice result. This is a consequence of a theorem of Osburg and Sabu. Regarding the invariance of plus one surgery. So in this case, so here I do this computation and I'm done. And in fact, what's going to happen is that this is the one computation that I will have to do. Computation that I will have to do in general. So, you know, like going back, what this, so let me just conclude that this is a way of showing the 2-1 cable is not a homomorphism and concordance. Because here I have that if I pick any k, you know, I can just pick three, the trifle, plus the Plus, the invariant of its opposite is going to be negative two, which is not zero. And so I have that these two three manifolds are not homology cobord or rational homology cobordant, and therefore these two notes are not, the sum of these two notes are not going to, it's not going to be slice. So now, um, So now, what's good about the twofold cover of C21? Well, one, or rather, let me just do it for just you. This is S3. Okay, so this is too good. And also for a general comparison. Companion ED surgery on a knot and as a consequence of these two, or just the first one, what I have is that the lifts These two lifts are null homologous. And the linking number between these two, well, if we use this description, this lift, the union of these two components in S3 is the hop fling. Is the HOPF link with minus one framing if we want to take that approach? But in any case, the linking number between these two is one, which is non-zero. So what I want to do or what I'm going to do is instead of talking about S3, because this is too much to ask, I am going to just make these two assumptions. And these are the two assumptions that are going to allow me to then compare. Allow me to then compare my general cover to this particular model example in terms of the D invariance, which I know I have for this model example. Okay, so how do I do that? Going back to my description, so let's do that. To my description. So let me just write down the theory. So here I have a satellite operation. And let me say that the winding number is not one. If If let R be a prime dividing the winding number. If the linking number in the artful cover of P of U of any two lifts of the unadded component is non-negative and not And not all zero. And the second one is precisely that each one of them, all of these leaves are null homologous. Then, as a consequence, I have that P is not a homomorphism. P is not a homomorphism. Okay, so here as a corollary, but I should say, you know, it was one of the first proofs. This is really a result of Bob that I believe he proved. That I believe he proved differently. The white head double is not a homomorphism. Okay, and why is that? So, the reason why it follows from our result. Our result is that if I look at the, so what's the winding number? Let me, let me maybe look at this picture. This is the whitehead double, just in case. So this is the pattern, companion, and satellite in all cases. line in in all cases so the twofold cover of let me call this the whitehead positive positively class whitehead double of the unknown or or of any nod let me say this is going to be the complement of the two four Cable link union two copies of the node exterior in such a way that mu of k goes to the minus two one curve in the boundary of the ith component. Of the ith component, where this is the ith copy, okay, and so you know, or in other words, what I am saying here is that S3, the complement of the two, four torus link in S3, is precisely the twofold cover of the whitehead double branch along, sorry, the two-fold cover of S3 branch along the. The twofold cover of S3 branch along this white double, which is just an unknown, and I remove the two unotted components. And so what is it? So then what I get, so I get for free that I have that these components are non-homologous because this manifold is S3. And then the linking number, the linking number between the two components. Two components is not zero. And we're done. Okay. In general, how do I get to my conditions? Well, or how is it that I use these conditions to get to them? To one cable. I think I have time. So, proof of the theorem. So, the first one, the first part is that I am going to first focus. I am going to first focus on this pair that I had mentioned before. So this is, or there exists, I should say, a series of null homologous Null homologous integer surgeries from this pair two S three and a link of the same number of components such that Such that the linking information is the same and the framings, whatever it is, basically the linking number between the These are going to be the same as the framing of this link. And how do we do it? Well, you know, like basically this is going to be surgery on S3 with some framing along a certain link, gamma. Of some length. And so these Ji's are going to leave in S3 as some L prime i's. And then what I need to do is just make sure that I change these L i's. First, to get this linking information, I just have to make sure that this, the linking between this. Thinking between these components, which are basically just realizing the JIs as knots in S3, that they have linking number zero with the surgery curves. And I can do that, or not the surgery curves, the surgery link. And that's just done via a series of handle slides. Great. So, well, why Why is this good? Because then I know that there exists a constant such that the D invariant of my Clovers are only an epsilon away from it's not S three. Yeah, I think that this is just what I want, this this with this link that I had over here. Okay, so I do need these two conditions, this condition I need so that I can get this bound. Then the next step. Or maybe let me announce what the steps are going to be. So, the idea, the sketch of the idea, is easier to follow instead of the details. I start with this manifold. I do some integer surgeries to some other rational homology sphere. Actually, no, that's precisely what it is. So, the first thing is that I do integer surgeries to react. First thing is that I do integer searches to realize it as an integer homology sphere. This is a rational homology sphere in general, and then I go to integer homology sphere. Then I go from this integer homology sphere with some linking information to precisely the twofold cover of The cable, and this I do via a series of negative definite cobordisms and claspersurgery. And I'll go into the details if I have time. But then if I have these two, what I have. What I have is that the D invariant of this three-manifold can be compared to the D invariant that I had already computed. And this is just going to be, you know, they're going to be a way, there's going to be a bounded constant, a way where this constant. Does not depend on the companion, it only depends on the pattern P. So then if I have that, then An n large enough so that the d invariant of the two-fold cover of the 2,1 cable over the 2n plus 1 torus knot is sufficiently negative. I mean I just have to compensate this thing, right? Like it's not so easy as I had before in the proof of the basic case, but now I, you know, I have to just pick the end large enough. It might not be the triple, I just might have to. not be the treble. I just might have to take the T99, T299 torus nut. Okay, and so basically what we do, you know, like the real heart of the theorem is proving that first we can do this and second that if we have that, then we do have these bounce, right? That is actually the heart of our paper, of our result. And so let me. Um, so let me go back to telling you uh the steps. So, the step, the first step, this first step is precisely doing this. The second step, um, let me show you by means of an exam instead. So, here I have, this is going to be the example of the five one. Of the 5-1 Taurus cable or cable. Okay, so this is the pattern. This is the five-fold cover. Again, we're here. I mean, that I am going to. That I am going to attach for any companion, I attach the exterior to one of these components. And what I am going to do is, I'm going to, so I'm going to look at this link. So here, implicitly, what I'm saying is that the lifts of this component J, which is this component over here, is precisely. Is precisely the T55 Taurus Taurus link, which then immediately gives me that I have a non-zero linking number that I get for free. But then I have, how do I go back to this second cobordism to get to the to something reasonable, something similar to. Something reasonable, something similar to the two-fold cover of the 2-1 cable. And that I do by simply doing minus one surgery along these curves. How so? If I do that, then what I get is a cobordism. Cobordism between these three manifold. So, this is a negative definite cobordism to just the union of one component that is precisely the same hopefully that I had, and then I have three components. And then I have three components or that have a zero over there, where again, what I mean by zero means that I have the union of this unknown component with the not exterior in such a way that this goes to the zero, one curve. Which is the same thing as saying that I am just attaching a solid torus to this link, to the node exterior in such a way that the meridian goes to a meridian. So I'm just filling it in. So this is again S3. So now I have a negative definite cobordism from this five-fold cover to precisely the two-fold cover. You know, this is this. Cover. You know, this is all a very strange way of writing S3. And the only thing that survives is this portion, which is precisely the two-fold cover over the cable. And because I have a negative definite cobord dissonance, then Oswat and Savo tells me that I have there's a bound in the way, in the comparison of the de invariance. Way in the comparison of the de invariance on one side and on the other side. Okay. Questions so far? Did I lose everybody? What is this negative definite cobordism here? This negative definite cobordism is basically I'm just going to do some surgeries along these curves. Curves the ones the ones that are drawn in here, but I do it on this picture. So do these surgeries on this picture, right? These pictures are supposed to be the same, but one shows where I'm going to do the blow-ups. So I just attach some unknotted components here along not all of them, but you know, some of them. I do a minus one. Of them, I do a minus one surgery, which is this, or in other words, I attach a minus one frame to handle, and the result is this for three manifold, which is the two-fold cover of the two, one cable of my knot. Okay, and here I started with the five-fold cover of the five-one cable of the knot. So, what you're saying, you do nine blow-ups or something? Nine blow-ups or something in a particular way? Yes, exactly. In this particular case, for the 5-1 cable, I know exactly which blow-ups I am going to do. So in this example, I do. But the whole point in our theorem, you know, what we say is that in general, we're not going to know what these specific blow-ups are going to be, but we are going to know. But we are going to know that. So, for a general P we do not know the specific say blow-ups. But what we do know Is that we can actually, so by a series, so this is the lemma for a general pattern via a series. I'm not going to rewrite what I wrote on this here. wrote on this here so maybe let's say so this this first step is so that I go to a integer homology sphere so I reduce I make my life easier in homology and then what I do know is that so but moreover so in in step one what I what I have is that I have To a certain, I have this information, this linking information. So, basically, what I'm saying is all the information that I need to construct my twofold, my R-fold cover, I can replace by this one. And so, what I have is that in general, I have a cobordism from any general knot to. Any general not to the result of taking this actually now I turn it into S3 minus a collection of knots union all of the knot exteriors and this I know that is via integer surgeries. Surgeries and so that this gives me over the d invariance okay then step two is precisely okay I want I have this linking information But what I really want is something that looks more like this linking information. Okay, so my first step two is use negative definite cobordisms, or what I really mean is minus one surgery along some. Some are not in components to go from these three manifolds where again here the gluing takes place along Mk going to Going to whichever framing is induced by this linking information that I had from the cover. And now I can just change it into the so in step two, all I have to do is change this framing information. So that I don't go to framing one, but rather. So here I'm going to change, I want to change the link so that now the identification happens. I'm just going to change. This is going to be sometimes one and sometimes zero for two specific components and this is. And this is why, in the statement of the theorem, I need to have one, I need to say that not all are zero, so that I can then actually find this cobordism that has a plus one for two specific components. Otherwise, I don't know. Otherwise, it might be that all of them are zero. I cannot do this via negative definite cobordisms. And then the framing is going to be. And then the framing is going to be negative one for those two specific components and zero for all of the other ones. So now here I am in the setting. So in the example of this table, I am now in this setting. Actually, no, I am in the setting of a link. In the setting of a link that has the same link information, but I don't know if maybe over here I am going to have some other nodding. So that's the last step use class per surgeries, so theorem. This is a theorem of Matveyev. If two, three manifolds have the same homology and they have They have three manifolds, and I have a link inside each one of them. If their homologies are the same or isomorphic, Or isomorphic and the linking information is the same, then there exists a series. There exists a series of clasper surgeries to transform say Y1 into Y2 and what is a class per surgery Is the result of removing a trivial handle body and And gluing it back using the homomorphism or the diffeomorphism on the boundary that gives rise to T3. Two T3. So I already had the correct linking information that I needed to go all the way to the two-fold cover of the 2-1 cable. And with the theorem of Matt Vayev, I can actually just assume that I do actually have this. Do actually have this link and not, I have unknotted components and not just a random link that has that linking information, but that actually might just be a lot more complicated. And so maybe this is the part, this step three, I think that using the formal properties of the D invariants is not too hard to see. Too hard to see that after doing integer surgeries and using negative definite combordisms, we do have, you know, what we're doing is we're making the de invariance bigger. But in this step, it is, you know, like, why is it that there is a relationship between the de invariance of two manifolds that are related by class per surgeries? And that is part of what we do. So we just prove a What we do, so we just prove a lemma if we have that two, I think, integer homology, three spheres and Y1 can be transformed into Y2 via cluster surgeries. Then there exists a constant such that their d invariants are only going to be bounded by this case. And this is a consequence, actually, of a more general lemma. General lemma: What does this constant depend on? Right, let me let me tell you. So, the real lemma is let's say that I have a homology sphere that is the union of a genus G handle body along another one with some homology. One with some homomorphism And let me go back to this or something similar to this diffemorphism If we have that if we have elements of the Turali group of the mapping class group of the surface and we are going to construct a new manifold using Using some composition, but I don't remember exactly in which way. Basically, what I am trying to say is, I'm just going to remove one of these and I'm just going to glue it back, but now using an element of the Torelli group, in whichever way it has to be written correctly. Then the D invariance of these three manifolds. Is going to be bounded by a constant that depends on G, the genus of the handle body, and the number of factors in an expression. For the element of the Torelli group in terms of the generators of the Torrelli group that That are either Dean twists, plus or minus one Dean twists along non-separating curves or I don't remember the name of these ones.
