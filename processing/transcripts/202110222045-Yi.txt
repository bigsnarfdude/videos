So let's start with our next talk. It's going to be given by Chai Hong Yi from Hangzhou Normal University. She will talk about a flow approach to the music market audit scales image program. Please. Thanks to organizers for invitation, and I'm honored to give this talk. Honor to give this talk at this conference. And the title of my talk is a fuel approach to the Muslim Oliver Goss Imaging Program. Can you hear the voice? Yes. Yes, yes. Okay. This work is joined with Professor Lee, Professor Sen, and Professor Ye. And this representation. This representation is divided into three main parts. First, I will introduce the Muslim Orange Gaussian imaging program. And it's a class of mixed G type programs, but it's a very general and very general program, which is special to some very important mixed G-type programs. So we will list some results of your MIXG type programs. mixed the type programs which relates to this program problem so uh like such like lp dawn mixed problem uh lp mixed problem and so on and finally i will show the proof of our stellars briefly okay in this talk we donate by the notation the class of convex folding in Of convex folding in m plus one dimension, a nuclear dispatch, and we use this notation to donate the class of convex foldings which contain the origin in their intervals. And as we know, the MIT type programs is a parameterization programs for the geometry metric layers of the common sportings. Commerce boarding. So let's introduce some basic concepts of commerce boarding. This definition has been covered by the previous reporters. So let's review them, graphene tools, make it more easier to understand. Let's look at this picture. And this is a convex body. And given a unit of And given a unit of vector new, we can draw a hammer plate perpendicular to the new perpendicular to the new and moving a plate to until it stops when it first touches boundary. So the support function mu at new as the Nu is the distance from the origin to the hammer plane H, and the radial function is the distance from the origin to the boundary point along the directed vector C. And to this distinguishment, to distinguish between the two scale, we can call this spell the normal scale and this one the radial scale. The radial scale. So yeah, we can introduce the Gauss map, which maps the boundary to the normal scale and involves Gauss map parametric boundary. And if given a site E, which is a subside of the normal scale SN and the reverse radio cross imaging of E. Gaussian matching of E is a subset of the normal scale by the inverse Gaussian mag. And the principal conventional VD can be expressed by its support function. And we describe the two correspondence by the host of metric. Given a small slope of the normal frame field on the Of all the normal frame field on a scale, the radio function and the support function can be related in this way. Okay. And then we review some operations on the commerce boardings. The mixed G composition for two commerce boardings is still convexed and its support function is defined as for. Is defined as follows. And later, fairy introduce the fairy P SAM. And when P is greater than 1, P sum is a new convex body. While P is less than 1, the P sum may not be convex. So the work she finds as follows. It is introduced to define. To define a new commerce volume. Okay. The Muslim Orange Gross Imaging Program is firstly introduced by Wang Qing Zhong, Xin Shu Dan, Edo Bing, and Zhu Bao Chen. So let's review the introduction of this problem. The most like OLIS function belongs to the class. belongs to a class A and the function G is satisfied G and G partial A are continuous on the domain. And G partial J donates the first order partial derivative of G with response to its first variable. And the most likely function G Function g is used to define the general value of the omega with response to the measure lambda. And the mutual Eulish function psi is used to define a new operation on the correspondence. And it's called the Mutilat Eulish repetition. So we have the new operation. And so we can define the new. Yeah, so we can define the new worth shape in terms of this much like addition. So by calculating the variation on the on the on the venom of the new wolf sea, we can get the get a new geometric measures. Okay, this is my this is my This measure for the music-like Orange Crossing force for its borer side omega, which is the size of the normal scale. So the lambda is actor on the reverse radio durse map of omega and the small side is different, it's different ideas. correcting less the new geometry performators is called the Musulak Oliji-Gaussian major program. It's regressed as follows. And let G and psi is the Muslim all H function and lambda is and lambda is a non-zero finish measures on scale. And what conditions on the theta and the given boreal measures mu on scale? Because there exists a convex bodies such that the mu is just the most like polished costly measures of the convex body omega. The term of the We can move the function psi to the left of the equation, and the programs can be rewritten as follows. And when the measures lambda and mu have a density function p and i respectively, the program reduced to solving the following monumental equations. And this notation. And this notation means the determinant of the principal convention and is also the reciprocal of the ghost of the ghost conventor. So if we want to buy the geometry flow method, we should think about the bus chemistry flow. And this program is very general, and in particularly in the powers of mailing MIXG type programs. For the function G is equal to R with power Q and the function psi is equal to U with power P and the function P is equal to 1. P is equal to one. So the in that so the index p is equal to zero, it becomes dual mixed program introduced by Huang Yong, Lu Dong Wa, Yin Yang, and Zhang Dong. So the PDF forms as follows. And when he is greater than zero and less than n plus one, those people explore the people explore the sufficient competence conditions for the existence of solution. And when Q is less than zero, so in get to the existence of the solution for general measures. And if one Q is an abstract real number, by studying the homogeneous of the anisotropic cross Of the anisotropic cross-sequential flow. So, when we get the existence of the small solution for the smallest function f. When the index q is equal to n plus one, it becomes the well-known LP-Mix D program. And when it's equal to one, it's It's a classical mixed program, which has been complicated by Nyungborg, Chen Yang, and Pyborov. And regarding the studying of LP in CD program, many methods can be used to study these questions. When VLP is in different Well, P is in different ranges. So we list the sum of the results. Okay. When P is greater than one, Lutwat gets the existence of a unique orange symmetric correspondence for even measures new. And had Lutawa, Xinyang, and Zhang Gaulung. The existence of the polytypo for convex polar typo for the decrease measures. The LP ministry program for polytypes is very important because the LP ministry program for general matters can be served by approximation agreement. Approach mention argument by first serving the prototype of case. And from the view of the PDE series, prove the existence and regularities for the LPMC program. And when P is greater than zero and less than zero and less than one. Her wife, Young, and Zhang get the existence orange symmetric solution for the even measures. And they solve the LPMC program depends on the method of calculus of variation and And the existence of a solution to the X-ray problem. And the 2. Yeah, to the existence of the convex polar type of depreciated bias. So, Chen Shu Bi, Li Xu, and Zhu Ban Sen prove the resistance of the solution for general arbitrary measures. General arbitrary measures by using the prototypal solutions to the arbitrary LPM program and approximation argument. So when P is equal to zero, it's a logarithmic XD program. And these people prove the existence of a solution for even measures, equation measures, and general action. Measures and general arbitrary measures, respectively. Okay, for the general P and Q, it's just the LPQ 6G program, which is introduced by Lu Tua, Yang, and Zhang. When P is greater or equal to Q, they get a resistance of the convention prototype for great measures. It creates measures. And when V times Q is greater than or equal to zero, by a geometrical flow method, Chen Chen Chang, Huang Yong, and Zhao Ying get the smallest orange symmetric solutions when the smallest function is even. And by using the prototype solutions to decrease Solutions to adequate majors and coordination agreements. Brown spin and fundle prove the resistance of the solution for general measures for this case. And the convest body which is certified this program may contain the orange on its boundary. And how the NB2A get to the existence of the small solution by using the symmetric flow method and compared with a proximation agreement, they got the same existence result. And they improve the condition P greater than one to P greater than. Than one to be greater than zero. And the remainder case was solved by Chen Hao Den Shibian each rate for even measures. Okay. Later, Gender will introduce the general dual only program to. To extend the LP domix problem. In particular, it's also a special case of the mutual actual imaging program. So look at this. They deal with the program for two cases. The case one is G partially. Partial day is great is less than zero. They get the existence for general measures. And Lu Jian gets the existence of small solution for the F by geometric flow method. And there we just recover the solution to an LP dorm XG program for Q is less than zero. Q is less than zero and k is less than or greater than zero. For a test to see partial rate is greater than zero by using the prototypal solutions to write quite the measures and proximation arguments. Gender help should be done in get this theorem. That is theorem. And when we take a special function g psi, we can know that the result covers the solution to the L P double mixed problem for Q greater one and P is greater than Q is greater than zero and P is greater than one. And the reactor is obtained by a body chicken bundle. Look at this limit condition. This condition corresponds to the condition p is greater than one. Turn how the animation improves the p is greater than one to the condition p is greater than zero. p is greater than zero so we want to remove the condition the limited condition limited condition so we decided to deal with the g partial is greater than zero for the multi-lack origin glossing imaging program once that program is settled this this program is also in Is also improved. So recall to the Muslim orange blocks in magic program. For case G partial is less than zero, it all gets the result for the general measures and the even measures for the case. For the case C partial Z, if we can know then zero, we get the without and without the limit condition. Okay, our wave is based on the study of the parameter flow and use the approximation argument. And we deal with And we deal with these programs into for two cases. Because in case one, the convention boardings that satisfy the programs will contain the will contain the orange in its integral. But the case two, the convex omega will contain the will contain the may contain the orientation on a boundary. So if we want to use a geometric flow method, we must make some modification for case two. Since the case to since the case two the since the flow of our case two Flow of virtue may be not small for a long time in general. For small function, we consider following parameter flow. And we introduce the monitoring function j. It's proved that the flow finally comes. um it finally converges to your ola lagaron equation lager language equation of the monitor function and the ola lagrange equation is just the user like all these bossing imaging program problem so uh and the co-inficient eta is chosen to keep the volume constant The volume constant, and so that your function is strictly monitored along the flow with the equation if and equality fault if and only if it satisfies the most like all the bottom matching problem. For a case to one must make some must make some modify modification since okay it's complicated you can look at this picture fixed epsilon is greater than zero and less than one we can replace the function psi with function side with the with this function and we can concentrate a new function on the interval such that the new function is most on our domain and the um conventional flow is as follows Since we use the conventional flow method, we should get the C0, C1, and C2 estimates to prove the flow as the uniformly parabolic equation. So we can use the uniformly. Use the uniformly parabolic equations theory to prove the long-time existence of the flow. So by the maximum principle, we can get zero estimate and look at the lower bound of the support function. Support function. You can make go to zero as each loan comes to zero. But we can get the eta t is uniformly bounded by a positive constant independent of the epsilon. And we can also we can also prove the wise function is uniformly bounded by a constant by a pointing constant independent of each and the C2 estimate is also is learning with the head of the accelerator function and we can And you can reforce the works of Tsao Abbas in writing and this one. It's a permanent operation. And we can get to the principle. We can get the principal collector RD is uniform. And once we get this, we can prove the flow as a uniformly parabolic equation. And then using the Bornov and the Savarov's theory, we can get the Hodder estimate. And we can also get the pair derivatives by the uniform. By the uniformly parabolic equation theories, we get a long time resistance of solution to the flow. And together with the monitoring function, we can prove there are sub-sequences convention to the solution of this PDE. This PDE and then we need light epsilon cat to zero to get the weak solution of the mutual orange bossing major problem. And recall the west function is bonding is uniform bounded and the eta is uniform bonding by the by By the quality constant independent of extreme. So compared with the proposition, the measures can to this measures weaken. And we can get the work solution for the smallest function g, psi, and p and f. So we get this result. Get this result. By the static approximations for the function g p psi, we can get, we compilate the both. Thank you. Any questions, please? Questions, please.
