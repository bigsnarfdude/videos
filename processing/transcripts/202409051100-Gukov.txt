Right, so this first slide summarizes connections that I just described in words. I already mentioned all the main players that will appear in this talk. And like I say, some interesting connections will actually go through quantum topology, which focuses on three-dimensional TQFTs. And typical bridge that it provides is that. That it provides is that if you consider line operators in three dimensions, braids, knots, then the braiding nicely reflects global monodromies and vertex operator algebra. So this is, of course, basis of Dreen Fultona theorem and many other facts that relate the two sides. So, but in this talk, as an outcome, so this aspect surely will be present, so there is nothing wrong with that, and this component. So, there is nothing wrong with that, and this component will be part of the story. But there will be yet another component, and particularly yet another connection between quantum groups and vertex algebras, in particular logarithmic vertex algebra. So that's my promise to you. By the end of the talk, I hopefully will be able to provide what exactly is bullet one and bullet two. There will be some very specific either theorems or conjectures that one should try to prove in a completely algebraic way. Whereas a big Algebraic way, whereas we can arrive to them in a very different way. And another perhaps general remark is about the nature of this talk is that if you talk about quantum groups, then structure of quantum groups, there is this kind of dichotomy that on the one hand, definition of a quantum group, say in terms of Chevrolet generators and relations, is mostly straightforward generic values of Q. So I'll think about parameter Q. Q. So I'll think about parameter Q, parameter of the quantum group as sitting inside the unit disk. And that's where, from this definition perspective, things are most natural. On the other hand, the whole talk will be about the fact that here for generic, you will have to deal with infinite dimensional representations of quantum group. Whereas if we go to roots of unity, there we have finite dimensionality of all kinds of things, in particular focus on finite dimensional representations. On finite dimensional representations, finite number of them, and so on and so forth. So, finiteness in terms of dimensionality will be at roots of unity. But that's where we have different kinds of quantum groups. So, it's like a candy store. We can go and, at the root of unity, choose many different versions, and they're all interesting. So, in some sense, the story becomes more delicate there. But all this delicacy goes away at generic cube, but there will be forced to deal with infinite dimensionality. So, there is this trade-off. So, there is this trade-off, infinite-dimensional versus one and canonical notion of what quantum group means. And then we'll face it. So, that's in some sense, that's what the talk is about. So, let me spend first 10 minutes talking about TQFTs and motivating this study from general from different perspective, and then I'll come back to subjects closer to vertex algebras and quantum groups and give you. And quantum groups and give you more mathematical definition of what originated actually in physics. And from the topological quantum field theory point of view, the motivation here is to study topological quantum field theories in three dimensions. Again, it's all about three-dimensional TQFTs, which assign infinite-dimensional spaces to surfaces. Okay? So Sir Michael at he defined TQFT motivated by work of Motivated by work of many as a functor from Borgisms to vector spaces, but he explicitly, in the set of his axioms, emphasized that he wants finite dimensionality, which I already mentioned a moment ago, and I'll keep saying it over and over again throughout the talk. So this talk is all about finite versus infinite. And indeed, if you want to compute, for example, some topological invariant for Riemann surface times a circle, it A circle, it basically, what you do, you basically take a trace over that space H, and if it's infinite-dimensional, you get nonsense, you get infinity. So, that's the reason he didn't want anything infinite-dimensional. That's the reason he insisted or put one of the axions to be that these are finite dimensional spaces. So, therefore, from the perspective of Sir Michael, naively relaxing that is illegal. I mean, theories or such TQFT should not exist, one should not consider them, and then or. Should not consider them, and then, or they're not TQFTs. So, one of these questions: can we make sense out of it? Because TQFTs were these spaces which are finite-dimensional for surfaces sigma were considered for 30 years. So that's good. But can we move on and discover something else, something new? So that could be a motivation from TQFT, but naively it runs into roadblock that Sir Michael prevents us from doing that. And not only Sir Michael, many other reasons. You'll see them in a second. You'll see them in a second. So, another thing, which maybe is also relevant, is that, as I'll explain, so I'll put a mathematical theorem on a couple of slides down, which will tell us that how manifolds are built, three-dimensional manifolds that build by cutting and gluing. That's a very standard procedure. So, you cut along some surface sigma, which on this picture looks like a torus genus one, but it could be of high genus. Genus one, but it could be of high genus, and you glue pieces. And in various approaches to topological quantum field theory, what happens is that you assign algebra to a surface, so algebra A for surface sigma, and you assign modules over that algebra to three-dimensional pieces that have been glued, and then when you're gluing them, you take some kind of home or analog of it. Long a bit. So, in the story that I'll tell you, you'll see it actually by yourself on the next slide. It seems that the algebras that arise in this way naturally have symmetries of, represent symmetries of the topological setup. And in particular, if you look at genus 1, which you'll see is the most crucial case, mapping class group of a torus is SL to Z. So many of this algebra is naturally come with SL to Z action. Naturally, come with SL2Z action. So, therefore, you can think of quantum topology as the study of algebras where SL2Z plays a role or modular group acts in a natural way, kind of like that. And in particular, in the story that will be directly relevant that this talk is going to be about, this algebra will be close cousin of spherical double affine Hick algebra. In fact, for a while, people thought, including myself, that the algebra either Including myself, that the algebra is just spherical affine Heck algebra, which famously has very nice SL2Z action. And in the past, even I myself gave talks where I suggested or thought that this is the case. Fortunately or unfortunately, the story turns out to be more delicate, more complicated. So when I gave the title that will focus on toroidal structures, I had this example in mind. And of course, that's what the talk is going to be about. That's what the talk is going to be about. But, like I say, now we understand that the story is more tricky, and that's why it is probably true that the relevant algebra to what I'm describing is close cousin of spherical Dacha, but I don't know all the details. And again, the representation theory is going to be quite interesting. So I'll be happy to discuss it in more detail after. But that's maybe one of the very few slides where Toroidal will be fairly explicit. But again, since the whole talk is going to be about. But again, since the whole talk is going to be about one particular theory, it will be sort of on a background for a while. All right, so that's the goal. In general, I have no idea what to do with such TQFTs where we violate AT's axioms in such a bad way. I don't know what to replace them by. I have no clue. But we'll focus on a particular example, which is. Focus on a particular example, which is interesting for a number of reasons that people have been developing for about 20 years. Where recently progress was made sufficiently, and the subject is connected to many other things sufficiently well that it's easier to see how to overcome such barriers. And this special class of theories labeled by Lie algebra G or compact or non-compact group G. Non-compact group G is called Chern-Simon's theory. So this is defined using formal integrals over space of all connections with some functional being Chern-Simon's functional and so on and so forth. Of course, this makes very little sense mathematically. And as I'll explain in a second, in instances that we're actually going to be considering, it doesn't even make sense physically. So my first few slides is. So my first few slides is basically to explain that even from physics perspective, it's ill-defined. The only thing we can probably do is perform subtle expansion over critical points, which are flat connections, but the integral is kind of problematic. But the good news is that when group is compact, this will lead us to finite-dimensional spaces. Spaces, this Hilbert spaces or spaces H of sigma. And that's precisely the theory of well-known and well-understood invariance due to Witten, Rishitikin, and Pourade. So that's a very well-behaved theory. And natural question that people asked again a long time ago is what happens if you replace compact group G, such as SU2? For me, everything is going to be in rank one. When I was young, I learned that in representation theory seminars, if things are complicated, Seminaries, if things are complicated, you're supposed to ask, How does it look for SL2? And for me, this SU2 or SL2 is all I'm gonna focus on. I'm not gonna leave the world of rank one. And if you replace SU2 by something non-compact, such as SL2R, that's a real form but non-compact, or even go further and complexified, answer SL2C, we'll naturally get infinite-dimensional spaces assigned to H sigma. Assigned to H sigma and therefore as a TQFT it immediately runs into exactly that same roadblock. Okay, so what do we do with that? What will happen is that, like I said, SU2 case is super well understood. It's 40-year-old, so that's very, very nice. But SL2C, the complex case, which is in some sense more non-compact, it also will be nicer because working over complex numbers is easier. Is easier. Well, if you think about usual algebraic geometry versus real algebraic geometry, of course, it's easier to solve equations over complex numbers than over reals. And this will be relevant to us because the problem will result in various moduli spaces or various varieties. So that's good for those of us who like geometry, geometric structures. Dealing with them over complex numbers will be actually nicer or easier than over real. So in that sense, the problem. So in that sense, the progress that I'm going to tell you about concerns only the last line, which is actually more non-compact in terms of moduli spaces, than the middle ground, which actually is more difficult, because not only it's non-compact, it's also real. And that's going to be the challenge. So that's the goal. Now, I already alluded to this relation between finite versus infinite dimensionality of spaces, and later on. Of spaces, and later on in a second, we'll talk about representations. And they are sort of in one-to-one correspondence with compactness or non-compactness of those geometric structures, such as moduli spaces, that arise in these problems. So Chern-Simon's theory is also nice because this bridge, again, can be made explicit or precise a number of ways, or there are many aspects to this relation. And one of them is simply that the them is simply that the spaces associated to surfaces sigma are meant to be quantizations of spaces of flat connections, moduli spaces of flat connections associated with our group on that surface sigma. In particular, yeah. So why don't we replace for this out and this quantization? Well, you will just replace the same thing. It will be still, yeah, what I say, this quantization is Yeah, what I say, this quantization is completely general. So you would just replace a group by SL2R. So you'll be studying space of SL2R flat connections over sigma. And that's a nice space. The problem is it's non-compact. And that's going to be the issue. The second problem that I mentioned on previous slide is that it sits as a real slice in space of SL2C flat connections on sigma. And SL2C flat connections actually nicer space. It's holomorphic symplectic. It's holomorphic symplectic and yeah, we can think about it as a Coulomb branch actually. So in modern terminology. So in fact, yeah, so this problem is nothing but problem of quantizing Coulomb branches for complex group. For compact group, for instance, if G is SU2, this moduli space is also compact. The reason is very simple, because after all, it may sound scary that, oh, it's a moduli space of some differential geometric structures. Differential geometric structures, but by simple theorems, we quickly reduce it to solving group-valued equations. And if our group is compact, then the space is compact. So that's the basic reason. So in particular, at the top line, the moduli space is compact. So if you try to quantize it physically or mathematically, it doesn't matter. We take sections of some line bundle. And in genus 2, for example, this moduli space is just CP3. So it's a very nice complex projective. So, it's a very nice complex projective space. Space of sections of line bundle over C3, of course, is compact or is finite-dimensional. So, that's the reason why this H of sigma is finite dimensional. Now, if you run the same machinery for SL2C, which is complex version of that, then the moduli space is going to be non-compact. So, this M flat for GC is the same thing as space of Higgs bundles, Hitchen modulus. Space of Higgs bundles, Hitchen moduli space, and that's non-compact. So if I try to ask for sections of some bundle over it or holomorphic functions, there could be plenty. So that's the reason things are tricky and the space H sigma becomes infinite dimensional. In fact, what I'll explain in several slides, in fact, we'll come back to this a number of times, basic case of genus one. case of genus one is extremely important and also useful and it's a good illustration. So in this case, so sigma is essentially just a two torus, very much like I have on the picture written here. And the space relevant to us, what we'll be quantizing in this case, will be essentially complex torus of our group G times complex torus of the Lengland-Double. Complex torus of the Langelands dual group, or equivalently the dual torus, divided by the while group. So that's a very nice space. It's easy to see that this is indeed the space of complex flat connections on for any G, in fact, on a genus one surface. So we would be quantizing that. And those of you, again, who like things like spherical double affine Heck algebra already probably recognize what's going to happen next. But before I do that, I want But before I do that, I want to emphasize again that the problem here, or again, suppose we're trying to approach this theory naively, that's how many people did, say, 20 years ago. You would say, well, in the Reschettian drive theory, when a group is compact, when you do cutting and gluing, the surgery operations in 3D TQFT, you perform a finite sum. And this is actually extremely important for proving many, many theorems, because you don't have to worry about the fact that it's About the fact that it's well defined, well defined from the perspective of just summation. Whereas if our space H of sigma is infinite-dimensional, and that's the beef of the story, you get something infinite. You get either infinite sum or integral, depending how you represent the answer. So it looks like, again, we basically lose earth under our feet, so we don't have a solid foundation anymore. And that's the challenge. So that's the challenge that many people. Challenge. So that's the challenge that many people try to overcome over years in various different ways. And again, in general, I have no idea how to solve it. But for this class of theories, luckily, there are so many alternative perspectives that were guiding progress over years. And that's what I'll try to summarize. Anyway, that's exactly the theory that's related to quantization of this particular Coulomb branch. And we have founding fathers of like Eric and Nakajima. Like Eric and Nakajima-san, who would immediately tell us what the answer is. And that's another connection to why it's toroidal. But again, I should emphasize that in quantum topology, toroidal structure is actually quite natural simply because this torus plays a very important role. So I'll explain in a second that any three-manifold can be obtained just by cutting and doing only long-term boundaries, and that's why toroidal algebras or structures play very simple. Or structures play a very central role in quantum topology. Any questions so far about the sort of motivational philosophical perspective? Feel free to ask, interrupt if any point. Okay, so if not, yeah, don't hesitate. Right, so next slide basically tells us a little bit about the surgery formula. Tells us a little bit about the surgery formula that emerges if we try to quantize. So if our group is compact, as we get compact moduli space in finite dimensional space of states, H of sigma. And this is a concrete answer for torus, essentially, depending whether this is always going to be torus in the group. And if group is compact, it's compact. And if not, then not. And that's basically what you get as a result. As a result. And in practice, what this amounts to is when we do various cutting and bluing again along the two-dimensional torus is all you need, we'll see either finite sums or infinite sums or integrals. So I'm just repeating the same thing. And in the context of WRT invariance, that's going to be a sum truncated by the level. But if you worked with a complex group, there are With complex group, there is no notion of level, or at least it's a complex parameter, so there is no meaningful way by which you can truncate anything by complex parameter. So you would already expect from just that that it should, first of all, be completely untruncated. And also accompanying that fact is that lettuce, instead of single lettuce, you basically, single truncated lettuce, you get two copies of the lettuce. And that has to do with kind of doubling everything because if you replace SU2 by SL2. If you replace SU2 by SL2C, you basically double your space when you complexify. And that leads to, again, this doubling of the lattice, which is actually very nice because you get lambda and lambda check, which is nicely emerging from quantization problem like this. So again, we see something throughout. So, okay. This is probably more relevant to physicists, but More relevant to physicists, but there are some interesting lessons here as well, which will result in concrete mathematics. That, as I mentioned in the beginning, this Feynman path integral is not super useful, especially if group is non-compact. But what it is useful for is what we call perturbative or saddle point expansion. So if you find a critical point of that functional, you can expand around it, and actually, then you get finite dimensions. Then you get finite-dimensional integrals, which physicists study in the form of Feynman diagrams. And because those integrals are finite-dimensional, they could be made mathematically sensible. So that's what Cott Accelerod, Isinger, and many others did. And that actually works well. So in other words, to any order and perturbative expansion in terms of parameter h-bar, so I'll use Q most of the time, but if you expand. Use Q most of the time, but if you expand in log of that nearer Q equals one, that actually can be made sense. People tried that. So that was done a long, long time ago. And then for decades, people tried to basically resume formal series in H bar into expression in terms of Q. So that's what the whole story is about. And it involved many kinds of ingredients. For example, one approach that various people, including myself, That various people, including myself, studied 20 years ago, was based on triangulation. So you would triangulate three-dimensional manifold into tetrahedra, try to glue them, and produce something that depends on Q, not H-bar. And that didn't work for what seemed like technical reasons. For instance, not all critical points were present. So IBID and flat connections were completely missing from that approach. And many struggled how to bring them back, how to add them to the story. Back, how to add them to the story because obviously, abelian flat connection or just connection equal to zero is a critical point, so it should be present. Why not? So, that failed for some reason. And again, at that time, it was puzzling, but in retrospect, it, of course, makes sense. Various other approaches to the problem managed to produce something for manifolds with boundary, such as not complements or link complements, but never managed to close them up. But never managed to close them up. So, to produce anything for closed manifold. And here, the reason it's slightly easier to see, because if we deal with something infinite-dimensional, it's much easier to regularize it by imposing just boundary conditions. So, if you have a three-manifold which has a boundary, you can just declare that boundary condition is fixed, and that, in some sense, only picks a subspace out of all configuration space that your moduli space should see. So, you can basically. Space should see. So you can basically, that's what kills non-compactness. So having boundary is good. But actually, another close cousin of this appears in the story of Fokken Gancharov. So when in early days they were studying analogous problem for surfaces, for technical reasons, it was important to them there is always one puncture present. There is always one marked point on a surface. And they couldn't get a theory without any marked points. So that's exactly the analogue of the issue that Exactly, the analogue of the issue that appeared here about 20 years ago. So, again, the challenge was to close things up, and because then you wouldn't have any boundary, you would have no control how to force things. And that's what people were trying to solve over the years. And one thing, so there are a couple of things that emerged over this journey, and they're quite surprising. So, one surprise that emerged is that there Is that the resulting theory actually is not just usual to QFT, but it carries about spin structures. So, this is maybe too topological of a notion, but for physicists, it means that the theory is basically fermionic, which is puzzling because the starting point, the goal, was to understand Chern-Simon's theory, which has no mention of fermions. It's purely bosonic, it has gauge connection, one form, so there is no. gauge connection one form so there is no i mean there is no spin any anywhere in the definition at least classically or perturbatively so uh question arises like where does it come from who ordered this spin dependence that's that's that's that's kind of cool another thing that happened and that's related to my comment earlier that double affine heke algebra or spherical double affine hake algebra is probably not the full answer is that even for the torus the answer turned out to be larger for this space of Larger for this space of states than what we would naively get from quantization. This is not too surprising, because if the answer was literally what we get from quantization, it would also not carry any information about spin structure, so it should be bigger. So that's that kind of, if you already see the first bullet point, you could predict the second. And it's not much bigger, but it is larger. So what it tells us is that trying to make sense of a theory. Trying to make sense of a theory which is perturbatively well-defined but non-perturbatively non-defined requires a larger theory. And that's actually not surprising. This happens, at least in physics, all the time. We start with some perturbative theory defined by some Feynman path integral. Non-perturbatively, it's not well defined, and sometimes it requires a bigger theory. It requires sometimes theory in a higher dimension, or sometimes it has to be embedded in a full string theory for it to make sense non-perturbatively. And this is actually exactly what. And this is actually exactly what's happening here. So that's the physics part. In particular, this appearance of spin structures is a very specific phenomenon, which is what physicists call anomaly. So sometimes your starting point looks okay, but if your theory involves quantum field theory, not just quantum mechanics, where you have exactly this infinite dimensionality of something, that might. That naively makes no sense. Physicists have their ways of regularizing the infinite-dimensional objects, and in the process of it, they discover sometimes that to do that consistently, they need sometimes additional structures. So, that's exactly where spin structures are coming from here, and this is what's called anomalies. So, when physicists talk about anomalies in QFT context, the word anomaly for them is reflecting, it only arises It only arises in infinite-dimensional setting. And therefore, it's not surprising that that's exactly what we're finding here, or what happens when we try to move on from nice, comfortable, finite-dimensional setting of Sir Michael to infinite sums, infinite integrals, and so on. Because that's what QFT is all about. QFT is all about regularizing infinities, and again, that's where anomalies come from. Sometimes anomalies are so bad, they tell you you can not make sense. You can not make sense of it, period. Sometimes they tell you that, yes, you can make sense of it, but you need something additional. And that's where the spin dependence comes from. Okay, any questions so far? So in this line of development, the spin dependence, spin structure dependence was surprising five years ago, but now it's understood reasonably well. So you can understand it from a number of perspectives. Number of perspectives, Razansky-Wittson theory based on Coulomb branches, and various other things. So let me elaborate on this point a little bit more. So mathematically, what happens is the following. I already explained that the problem of dealing with something infinite-dimensional will have natural geometric perspective pretty much no matter which alternative perspective you'll try to use. Geometrically, To use geometrically, it will always have to do with non-compactness of geometric moduli spaces, like in that quantization example, quantization of flat connections. But we can poke the problem from other alternative perspectives, such as, again, Coulomb branches, Rosans-Kiviten, and we'll see the same thing, that in nice setting when H of sigma is finite dimensional moduli spaces are compact, here they'll always run to non-compactness. So, what do we do? So, what do we do? So, we always have to find some compactification divisor. So, in algebraic geometry, that's usually one of the most exciting things. That's the most delicate thing, but also most important. And that's exactly what happens. So, to make sense of this problem, one has to deal with non-compact varieties and ask what is the right compactification, how does the problem get solved. And this is counterpart of what I mentioned a moment ago, of trying to make sense of theory non-perturbatively. That whatever these words mean for physicists, mathematically they mean find the right compactification divisor. Find a bigger framework where your problem is sitting genetically as a sub-variety. And that way, compactified and then make sense out of things. What happens is that along the way, once we add this compactify, Along the way, once we add this compactification device, the theory gets bigger. So, in particular, you may happen to find additional elements or even critical points to your original problem that come from the boundary. Again, that happens, that's not a big deal, but we have to watch to the sort of effects. And that's part of the reason why, for instance, in the story I'm going to tell you about, the space H of sigma is actually bigger than you would naively expect from just quantities H. Would naively expect from just quantization. That's also the reason why spin C structures come in, and so on. So, yeah, on this slide, I'm basically repeating the same thing, maybe in a more specific context, that if you started with the gauge connection A, and what we try to do, we try to complexify it. So we immediately create lots of non-compact dimensions to our configuration space. So again, it's not too surprising that things become normal. Not too surprising that things become non-compact, so we have to add compactification divisor, and that's why things are become bigger and so on. Okay, so I have last two slides on topology, and then I'll move on to representation theory. So this is again to motivate the story, and I spend my first fifteen or so minutes trying to tell you how non-compact moduli spaces are dangerous for quantization and other problems. Quantization and other problems, and because they result from something infinite-dimensional, and this sounds like a challenge. So, this sounds like a problem, right? So, now let me try to shed positive light on it, say that actually this is something we do want. One of the big challenges in quantum topology is to connect the two topology. So, if you're not aficionado of either of the subjects, you may be surprised because both subjects. Surprised because both subjects I mentioned, both areas have the word topology in it. So, how come fundamental is not connected to low-dimensional topology? The problem is, it's not. So, they have slightly different goals. And it's true that for almost 30, 40 years, the two subjects remain pretty disconnected. So, in quantum topology, we construct many, many powerful invariants labeled by groups or presentations, whereas in topology, the questions are some. The questions are some of them are listed here. And unfortunately, very few out of this quantum topology ingredients answer these questions or shed light or can be even useful. So that's why it's actually a very serious, a long-standing problem to bridge the two subjects. So that's yet another motivation. And what I want to explain in these two slides before I move on to more representation theoretic aspects is that this barrier, this infinite dimensionality, is actually something that's. Is actually something that's very good, that is expected to be helpful in bridging this gap. So, let me try to explain the gap between quantum topology and low-dimensional topology. So, perhaps the most famous problem in low-dimensional topology is called smooth point-correct conjecture in dimension four. In dimension three, it was nicely settled by Perlman, but even before it was settled, we knew that conjecture is true. So there are some conjectures in mathematics which we expect are true or false. Are true or false? There is definitely a majority vote one way. For example, out of millennium price problems, P versus N P is a good example. Everybody expects that it's false. That's P is not equal to NP. We don't know. I mean, it still needs to have a proof, but there is a majority vote. So unlike that, my favorite conjectures are where we don't know. For example, smooth point correct conjecture in dimension four is a good example. We don't have a majority vote, we don't have many arguments. Don't have many arguments why we have some arguments why it may be true, but we also have some arguments why it may be false. And it's hard to weigh them objectively, so therefore, if you have colleagues in your department, please indeed call them and ask them. So in low-dimensional topology, there are some conjectures where there is a vote, but this is not one of them, especially these days. One of them, especially these days. So it's actually quite an interesting question, but in any case, it's definitely more exciting than P versus N P or its version in dimension 3, where we had a very clear winner, where it was very clear where things probably should go. And again, since mathematically we want proofs, even probably is not good enough. We have to have a proof. Right, so that's probably the most famous one. Then there is an important conjecture, which, in my opinion, is actually just as interesting. Conjecture, which, in my opinion, is actually just as interesting, and also to one which we don't know which way it's going to go. It's about knots. So, knots have these properties that they can be sliced or ribbon, and it's trivial that one implies the other, but Ralph Fox 60 years ago proposed that converse is also true, and it's equally open, and we have no idea if this slice-ribbon conjecture is true or false. And then there are various questions about cobordism groups, for example, cobordism. For example, combordism theory started with Pantraging and Tom in the 50s, and many people, including Sir Michael, whom I already mentioned, Novikov and others, Herbert, Milner, they computed various versions of cobordism groups by late 50s, early 60s. But one version remains unsolved in dimension 3. And again, dimension 3 and 4 are kind of special. It's a cobordism group where you require that your three manifolds are homology spheres and all mass. Homology spheres and all maps, all combordiums are homology cylinders. So, surprisingly, we have no clue what this group looks like. We don't know if it has the three torsion, if it has the five torsion, how big it is, and so on and so forth. We know it's infinite, unlike many other homology groups, so it's actually quite interesting in these theories. And then there is analogous version for knots called knot concordance. So, I could continue this list. There are many other problems, such as generalized Tom conjecture and so on, which And so on, which are completely open. And again, my point is that quantum topology surprisingly had little to say about these questions until so far. That's the challenge that as quantum topologists we want to contribute, but that was difficult. So let me actually step back and ask, okay, why is it difficult? Or at least try to be introspective. And what's interesting is that in all of these questions, however little progress was made, However, little progress was made was based on the fact that you want invariants which are very asymmetric with respect to orientation reversal. So you could complain to me that, hey, Sergei, you started with a three-dimensional quantum topology, but some of your questions are intrinsically four-dimensional, such as combordisms or even point conjecture. That's not the issue. When we think about four-manifolds and analogous things, we still think in terms of three-manifolds and knots. Manifolds and knots. At least, at present, that's the language which is dominantly used. I'll review it a little bit in terms of Kirby calculus or various alternative constructions. So, it's not the issue because even four-dimensional questions can be perfectly phrased using three-dimensional dictionary. But the issue is that as we deal or construct invariance of three-manifolds, we need something which is very asymmetric if you change orientation on a three-manifold. So, for example, for a sphere, So, for example, for a sphere, if you change its orientation, nothing happens. It's equivalent to a 3-sphere, but that's not true for the 1 cross-sphere. 1 cross-sphere and minus 1 cross-sphere are completely different. So you need something which is asymmetric. And now let me bring this point home, point out why this infinite dimensionality is actually something that can contribute to this. So if your invariance, such as at roots of unity, using quantum groups at roots of unity, or obtain as finite sum. Or obtain as finite sums, changing orientation on a three-manifold is the same as replacing q by q inverse. That's a very simple fact. You can derive it in many, many different ways. And therefore, what happens is that if you had a finite sum, changing, and it's expressed in terms of q, powers of q, whatnot, changing q by q inverse basically means that you're doing a law conjugate, that that you're basically uh taking complex conjugate. Taking complex conjugate. So, therefore, you don't see a symmetry. Now, what's going to happen for us in the rest of the talk, we'll try to work with this infinite-dimensional space H of sigma. So we'll have to make sense of it. We'll have to regularize it. And suppose the story regularizes and produces for you something like this Q series. So then, naively changing Q to Q inverse would flip the whole thing, and it will be a series on Q inverse, right? And it will be a series and q inverse rather than q. But if theory produces for your series and q for every three-manifold with one orientation or the other, what should happen is that morally that operation of flipping q to q inverse can be re-expressed back in terms of q. So there is some kind of more regularization going on, and this is much more non-trivial. So that's the one which may have a hope to be very asymmetric. To be very asymmetric under exchange of orientation. And now this brings me to one of my important points. So I promised you two things about log DOAs. And one will have to do with maybe characters or things like that. Imagine that you have some kind of Q-series which has forms similar to what we're going to see in the rest of the talk. In the rest of the talk. So it will start with a fractional power of q. So my example is actually a real-life example. So then it will have integer coefficients, which may have some enumerative meaning. They will be counting something, C0 plus C1Q plus C2Q squared, and so on and so forth. And I think that pretty much whatever area of mathematics you're interested in, you probably encountered such objects. So try to ask in your area of mathematics, what would it mean? Mathematics, what would it mean to have such a thing go between chi of Q into some dual object, chi of q check, where you morally try to invert q. What would be the meaning of this operation? So interestingly, the meaning, depending where your problem comes from, probably does exist. But operationally, how to do it. But operationally, how to do it is quite non-trivial. And here I'm already writing it using chi rather than generic function f, suggesting that I'll be applying it to vertex algebraic characters. But again, you can actually think about this much more generally. Just consider some function of Q, some Q series, wherever you get it, it's up to you. Could be from combinatorics of counting partitions or something nice. Could be counting, I don't know, whatever you're counting, or somehow integrality of coefficients probably. Somehow, the integrality of coefficients probably is important. And ask what is this operation? So, again, I'll get to this operation through this particular angle by looking at the problem that we want to have asymmetry between left and right, a symmetry between manifold with one orientation and the opposite. So, if it happens, and it actually likely does happen, it's actually good for topology. So, that's kind of my setting point. That's kind of my selling point to topologist. But even on applications to representation theory, surprisingly, there will be quite a big asymmetry between positive and negative, okay? Like left and right. So you already may start thinking about favorite examples. And again, if you think of them or if you have some other perspectives on this question, please come talk to me. I'll be really excited to discuss it. So that's going to be one of my bullet points, one of the things that I probably. Points, one of the things that I promised to fulfill. Any questions so far? Since Atoshi gave us an extra half hour, please ask questions. Otherwise, I'll finish early like Harold. So I'll mention in this talk a couple of examples. So this story is rooted in quantum topology, so the invariants and Quantum topology, so the invariants I'm going to describe next, are precisely examples where things asymmetric, very much asymmetric. And what I was trying to emphasize is that the examples where they're very symmetric is very easy to find. We just take any T-type TQFT, such as Richie T and Tori, for any group, and that's going to be an example. In part, because it's hard to achieve asymmetry when we only have finite sums. But with infinite sums, there is a chance, because we all need to. Because we'll need to rethink what the answer means if we try to flip what's denoted by energy here. So we'll be literally in a situation where there will be some kind of conformal vector E, and its eigenvalues will be forced to flee. But if there are infinitely many eigenvalues, then this may give us a chance to have something asymmetric. And actually, that's what happens in practice. And actually, that's what happens in practice. So I'll give you examples. In fact, I think I'll give you an example on the next slide, which again comes from this theory, trying to make this complex transience meaningful, this TQFT. And I'm already kind of transitioning a little closer to quantum groups, which will be there even next slide. But if you apply the theory I'm going to tell you about in a second to a very specific manifold, which can be realized as some surgery on non- As some surgery on nodes, you'll get, for example, one of the expressions written here on the top of the slide. And if you apply this theory that I'm going to describe in a second to manifold with opposite orientation, you'll get a sum which is written here on the bottom of the slide. So both of them are Q-series. Those of you who have laptops open, you can actually expand both on Mathematica, for example, up to 20 terms. And you'll see a couple of things. So first of all, you'll see that both are You'll see that both are Q series. So they have no negative powers of Q, I mean, just Q expansion. So, second thing you'll see is exactly the phenomenon. That's why it's actually good. You'll not offend me if you try to do it right now. It's actually good if you try, because you'll see asymmetry between the two Q expansions. The way they're written here as sums, it's not apparent, but one of them is very sparse. So, in other words, its coefficients are very rare. You have gaps and powers of Q, and coefficients. Of q and coefficients which do appear at non-trivial powers of q are very small. They're like plus, minus one, zero, they're very lazy. Whereas if you expand this expression, you'll see that coefficients grow very quickly. There is no gap. It's not sparse at all. So you'll see qualitative difference. And that's actually a good thing. So see, we were looking for invariants which are completely asymmetric. And this gives us, I mean, this is very asymmetric. This is sparse. This is far from sparse. So that's great. Sparks. So that's great. So, but then this rises a question: in what sense on earth is this expression related to q by q inverse from the previous expression? How could it even be? So, well, there is an easy way to do it, and a high school way to do it. So, this form called q hypergeometric form is a sum over n such that every single term is a rational function of q. So, indeed, take  ⁇  so this is my second homework to you, besides expanding. My second homework to you, besides expanding it up to 20 terms and then seeing what I'm suggesting. Take this sum and on the back of the envelope, replace q by q inverse. Because every term in the sum is a polynomial on q divided by another polynomial on q. What will happen is that it will be polynomial in q inverse divided by polynomial and q inverse. Then multiply both numerator and denominator by sufficient power of q, of course equal for both, and turn this back into expression in terms of q. Back into expression in terms of Q rather than Q inverse. I claim what you'll get is exactly this expression. So that's a fun, magical exercise. Is this clear? This magic trick? Of course, this magic trick is cheating. So mathematically, why is it cheating? First, such form, Q hypergeometric form, did not have to exist. In a second, I'll give you such Q series for any three meters. Such Q-series for any three-manifold on Earth, for every three-manifold on Earth, or not only on Earth, and many of them I have no clue how to write them Q-hypergeometric for. So therefore, I have to make sense of this separation. In fact, I have to extend the separation, as I said here, completely to out of context. I don't want to rely on this anymore. So, the question will be: indeed, can we understand it better? And we'll come back to it. And then we'll come back to it. That's going to be my second bullet point. But also, what can happen is that things may be too nice. In mathematics, we ask for existence and uniqueness. So when this Q-hypergeometric form exists, it may be non-unique. And then, of course, if you try applying what I just told you, this back-of-the-envelope calculation of switching Q to Q inverse, multiplying by powers of Q, if you apply it to a different Q hypergeometric. Different Q hypergeometric presentation, you'll be different dual. So, this duality definitely cannot go through this Q hypergeometry. So, don't use it. That's why it's cheating. Here it works, but we need something better, something more systematic, something mathematically well defined. So, that's the goal. That's what I mean by the second Buddhist. Any questions so far? So, right, so I'll spend a couple of slides on telling you now the mathematical definition of this invariance. So, what exactly was computed? This will be very far from this motivational Chern-Simons. It will be a mathematical definition of its non-perturbative completion, which actually exists and produces answers immediately in terms of Q. So that's the one which will have larger space of states than what you would expect by a quantization and then so on. Binate quantization and so on. And it will go through quantum groups. But before we get there, so I have to tell you a couple of important theorems. One to which I already alluded is an interesting fact that if you are a three-manifold topologist, you only care about two torus. So that's where toroidal things or mapping class groups being modular groups originate in some sense. Why? Because, first of all, there is this classical theorem of Lee Kurt. There is this classical theorem of Liquorian Wallace, which says that if you want to build three manifolds by surgeries, meaning you take knots and links and then remove their neighborhood and reblue it back, of course, boundary of the neighborhood of any knot or link is a torus or collection of tori. That's why genus one is only the one that we care about. So that's the Ethereum. And you can build any three manifold in this way, but it's Any three-manifold in this way, but it's highly non-unique. So there are many, many Kirby moves which relate different presentations. For instance, this manifold I showed you on previous slide can be built by surgery on both trefoil knot, so-called figure-eight knot, and then there are infinitely many presentations simply because they're related by turbulent moves and non-unumi. So for us, this is maybe slightly technical point. It will be important that there is a stronger version of this theorem, which says that you can focus only on a particular That you can focus only on a particular class of knots and links, which are called homogeneous braid knots. These are the ones such that in braid presentation, the knot-or link diagram is given by a closure of a braid, and the braid word is such that powers of each sigma, each generator of the braid group, appears only either in positive powers or negative powers. For example, here, I only use positive powers of sigma 1, so this always goes over, and it doesn't matter. Goes over, and it doesn't matter in which order how I have it, but I have to be consistent. So, sigma 1 here has to be just in positive powers, whereas here, sigma 2 has to be in just negative powers. So, this is called homogeneous braid. And knots and links, which have this presentation, are called homogeneous braid knots and links. And the claim is that you can achieve any three-manifold by using only this class. Okay, so that's a theorem which is actually not true. That's a theorem which is actually not too hard to prove using Kirby calculus. So, Stalings, who worked on such presentations decades ago, actually laid all the important foundation. But this will be very important to us because if somebody asks you for what class of manifolds what I'm going to tell you is well defined, in order to say that for all, we need exactly this theorem which says that yes, all three manifolds can be achieved in this way. Okay? So that's one thing. So that's one technical thing. Second thing that we need is if you want to use surgeries, we need to associate something to not or link complement first before we close it up by by surgery. And this is one of the important theorems in the subject, which was built thanks to work of many people, including my early work with Manalesku, then Sanyu Park, and many others, which said Park and many others, which says the following. You can actually try to do the following. You can take R matrix, the follow-up-derived construction, and take R matrix for infinite-dimensional modules of quantum group, for Verma modules. So the fact that they're infinite-dimensional is a direct reflection of this infinite dimensionality of the TQFT that we're trying to build. So the fact that we use Dermal modules, which are infinite dimensional, is direct reflection. is direct reflection of infinite dimensionality of H sigma. Okay? So we will get same problem. Naively will get same problem. We'll have to, when we try to compose these R matrices according to information about crossing, we'll have to take traces. So naively we'll have to deal with the infinite subs. And therefore in this theorem, when I say well defined, this is a very loaded statement. It means two things. So first of all, it's well defined under the mice to remove. This is the kind of thing Rhythmeister moves. These are kind of things that Rushi-Tikin and Turaif had to worry about as well. They had to worry that this satisfies Rhythm Eister moves, and most interesting, Rhodemeister 3 follows from Young-Baxter equation. Our matrix for Vermont modules also satisfies Young-Baxter equation, so that aspect also checks out. But here we need to worry about another thing, which was not a concern if everything is finite-dimensional. Because if everything is finite-dimensional, you just get finite sums. That's not a big deal. Finite sums. That's not a big deal. So, here we have the second aspect of what well-defined means is that it's well-defined as a number. So, it means that sums actually make sense. And this is where this homogenous grade presentation plays a very crucial role, because it allows you to marry, just a second, just a second, representation theory with topology in a very clever way, which uses all kinds of race-track diagrams and other tricks to make. Diagrams and other tricks to make sure that everything works. So this is very non-trivial part. Yes, please. What does... Oh, so yeah, so there are a couple of things which are happening here. Yeah, thank you for your question. I was planning to get to that, but yeah, since Rust, this is perfect. So, Q is generic, so we are working with quantum group at generic Q. So, that's the Q. Second variable X or another grading is the fact that if you work with Vermont modules of quantum group a generic Q, your highest weight no longer needs to be integer. So, at roots of unity, if we restrict ourselves to finite-dimensional representations, highest weight or lowest weight has some integration. Weight or lowest weight has some integrality. It's a discrete thing, right? So here for Verma modules, which are illustrated here on this figure, actually, I apologize, I'm not using this anymore. I'm right next to the slides. So highest weight lambda is no longer, has to be integer. It can be any complex number where this Ferman module starts. So this is an example of highest weight Fermi module. And lambda is a general complex parameter. So in this story, which again, In this story, which again, affectionately 20 years ago, people would call complex because everything becomes complex. So, in this version of Schoen-Simons, both quantization parameter Q is not quantized and complex number, so that's one reason to call it complex. Another is that your lines that you're trying to braid are labeled by complex numbers which are this highest weight. So again, that that also becomes complex. That also becomes complex. So x is q to the lambda. So to answer a question in one line, I should have said that, yeah, so x is q to the lambda, but the point is that if q is generic and lambda is generic, this is also generic complex number. So that's the way to think about it. Okay, any other questions? So this is the hardest theorem of the talk. So that's that, in some sense, that's the one which. In some sense, that's the one which fuels the whole thing. Now we can start doing applications. And even though quantum groups appear here in a crucial way, I want to say that this will be a basis for us to collect the dividends after. So now we can start applying and getting all kinds of things after. So that's like that. Yes, so a physicist would say it's a non-perturbative completion, meaning that at some Meaning that it's something bigger, and now again it's understood in what sense it's bigger. For example, it will require these spin structures, and if you try to cut and glue, this h of sigma is going to be much larger than, or not much, but larger than what's naively expected. So it's embedding that ill-defined theory into something, trying to tame it, and in a very concrete way by, again, think about adding complexification divisors. So it adds stuff, but not too much. And as a result, it allows to do. It allows to do cutting and gluing, and as a result, it allows to essentially tame this infinity. So it provides a mechanism. That's right. Okay, so any other questions? All right, so this was a lot of topology, and I apologize for that. I already made a disclaimer that that's sort of my. That's sort of my interest. So now I'll try not to use it. But also, if you really feel lost in what I said before, all the surgeries sound too naughty. So there is a class of manifolds which are labeled by graphs. Or they look like quiver diagrams. And I know that every single person in this room likes quivers. So otherwise, please leave the room. I'm joking. So imagine that your surgery diagram is made out of basic and Is made out of basic unknotted circles. So they have no non-trivial topological information, and as a result, you can replace them by vertices in a graph. Or again, think about quiver presentation, quiver diagram, where integral surgery coefficients will be the labels. So A1, A2, and so on, are the surgery coefficients which we record. And every time we have one component of this Kirby diagram linking to another in a nontrivial way, we draw an edge in. Way, we draw an edge in this diagram. So, therefore, if you want to ask roughly how big is the universe of three manifolds, it is at least as big, in fact, it's much bigger than all such labeled graphs. So, therefore, whatever we're going to do, we should be able to do, at least for this class, which is kind of nice. And yeah, it has a name, it's called plumbed. Why it's called plumbed, that's a separate story. In fact, I'm not sure. In fact, I'm not sure it's like a great name, but it is what it is. Right, so I mentioned Kirby moves, which are analogs of Redemeister moves. So in this world of manifolds labeled by graphs, these are very simple moves. They allow you to remove or delete vertices, but in a very specific way, which changes some of the labels again in a very controlled way by plus/minus ones. So this is something. And for And for definition that I gave you, one of the first theorems in the subject was actually precisely for this class of manifolds, but now again it's established more generally, which says that, first of all, this object is well defined in an analytic sense. You check, even some kind of version of ratio test will tell you that it's convergent inside unit disk. It looks like this integral power series with integral coefficients, something already mentioned before. Already mentioned before. So that's actually good because it looks like a character vertex algebra. Maybe. We'll see this in a second. It's invariant under Kirby-Neumann moves. That's actually important because otherwise what I'm telling you would not make any sense. This is hardest. So as you go down the list, the bottom parts are harder and harder parts of the theorem. So invariance on the Kirby moves is already quite non-trivial. And the last bullet point says that, well, how does it compare to something that we knew before? In what sense, what we Before, in what sense what we did justifies to be called invariance of UQ a generic Q? Well, simple answer because we used German modules and we used UQ a generic Q in process of building, but also because if you take Q to root of unity, you recover some of the invariants that people studied before. And depending on whether you get rid of spin structures or don't get rid of them, you can reconstruct a lot of interesting invariants, such as so-called non-semisimple logarithmic invariants. Non-semisimple logarithmic invariants associated to logarithmic algebras, which will make yet another appearance in the story. Okay, so now I promised some dividends, so let's start collecting the dividends. What I described so far was intentional. So in other words, there was a particular problem to solve, this dealing with infinite dimensional representation. Dealing with infinite dimensional representations, taking traces, that was the issue. And what I told you is basically the collapsing 20 years of development in this quantum groupy stuff, how to overcome it. But then there were some surprises, some things which were not expected. And since I'm already over my initial time almost, and then luckily we have more, I'll limit the surprises to just a few. And one of the surprises, A few. And one of the surprises, which non-quantum topologists anticipated or cared about, is the following fact: that what came out turned out to be a character of logarithmic vertex algebra. So many phonemothropologists, including myself, didn't actually know much about logarithmic vertex algebras. But since this turned out to be the case, we kind of have to take it more seriously. So, this is one very cool aspect which is One very cool aspect, which is an active area of research, and it's Ethereum for some class of manifolds. So, again, using this graph presentation that I mentioned earlier, we can check that for some graphs, or think about them as quiver diagrams, you can find familiar friends, such as singlet, triplet, some of the well-defined log VOAs. But then, very quickly, you start getting new things because, like I said, this universe of manifolds is humongous. So, therefore, natural. So, therefore, the natural question is: what do you get if you slightly generalize? And it's easy to see that you start getting new log DOAs. So, actually, this fueled some of the developments in log DOAs. For instance, in this paper with Fagin and other collaborators, and also former student of Arakawa-san, Shama Sugimoto, and many others produced new log VOAs following Fege and Tipunian construction, where log VOA is realized as intersection. Realized as intersection of kernels of screening operators apply to very nice VOA, lattice VOA. And you can ask which lattice VOA? Well, we already have a graph, so its adjacency matrix defines a quadratic form. So that's the lattice VOA associated with that quadratic form. So this became quite nice, interesting industry. But of course, again, you can go even further, ask what is more general, and so on. So in general, that's a conjecture that for every three-manifold. That for every three-manifold you'll get a character, but constructing this log VOA, verifying it is an active area research. And in some families, infinite families, you get Ethereum out of it. So, okay, this is nice. This is, again, breach that was completely unexpected and surprising. So, what can we learn about log VOAs or what can we learn from it? One thing that we should check first is whether this conjecture is even reasonable. Conjecture is even reasonable. In other words, in vertex algebras, characters grow in a very specific way. For example, if your vertex algebra is nice, meaning rational, then growth of coefficients has to obey this rule, which sometimes is called Cardi growth law. So if I do Q expansion to development free series in Q of my character, I should see that coefficient am grows not polynomially with n, not exponentially with n, but exponentially. With n, but exponential of square root of n. That's a very specific growth. And coefficient actually is a very meaningful object. It's one number, it's a single number, which summarizes the data of our vertex algebra in like one number. And this number is called central charge, or more precisely, effective central charge. So one question to ask is, does it even reason? Well, because we can try, I mean, I told you that we get the skew series for any three manifold, so maybe for many generic. So, maybe for many generic three-manifolds, it doesn't even have this growth. Maybe it grows much faster. Surprisingly, it doesn't. Surprisingly, that's exactly what happens. So, the rate of growth is consistent with the conjecture that was on the previous slide. But then there are some new lessons. So, this is my first bullet point. So, I promised you two bullet points, and I'll complete them in about 10 minutes. So, one of them, first one, is about rate of growth. Of coefficients a n. So I thought when this story started to emerge that the growth of coefficients a n in logarithmic vertex algebra will be exactly the same. In fact, I think I gave talks where I speculated that that's probably true. I didn't know how to prove it, and I asked log DOA experts to prove it. I don't think anybody did, and it's good because it's not true. And it's good because it's not true. It's not a correct statement. So it's not a correct statement to say that in log VOA coefficients grow in exactly the same way. So there are two new phenomena, which actually is interesting. And these are kind of phenomena that you don't see in the simplest examples, but you see if you go to next to the simplest. That's a cool situation in mathematics where it's dangerous to make conjectures if you see only a couple of examples. You really need to explore it a little bit, otherwise conjectures can be wrong. So what happens is two things. Is two things. So, first of all, in logarithmic VOA, so first is actually not too surprising. You could have probably anticipated because in logarithmic vertex algebra, this number C, this effective central charge, is no longer positive real number. So it's expected that it's rational in general, but for rational DOA, a log DOA, but for unitary ones, it's real. But here in logarithmic ones, it's not. So there are easy situations for. Not so, there are easy situations where it's negative. In fact, in general, it's expected to be completely like random, maybe not random, but fairly general complex number. And therefore, you have to have real part of this expression somewhere, because if my coefficients are integers, this A ends. So whatever we are writing on the right-hand side has to be compatible. So there has to be real of something, right? And what this results in is, if we put this real part, it results in Real part, it results in the fact that real and imaginary part of this C control not only the growth of these coefficients, but also the oscillations. So, what you see in logarithmic VOA, one effect is that there are oscillations. And there are many ways now to understand how things could be negative. This could be talking about derived world or many, many other things to which I don't want to venture. So, second effect is actually something that's more subtle and that's more interesting prediction. That's more interesting prediction. It has to do with the fact that if you do this plot of A and garden variety log VOA, claim is that you're going to see this several branches. You're not going to see one simple curve as we had in a CORG case, in a rational VOA. What we're going to see in logarithmic one, that's the conjecture, based on this theorem, which assumes something that is very standard in this dictionary. So we'll see several branches. So the number of these branches, number of this sub- Of these branches, number of these subcurves, is controlled by the denominator of this rational number r. And to explain what this rational number r is, it's actually not rocket science. Let me kind of sketch where this theorem is coming from. So this theorem is about behavior of this invariance that I defined. And it's assuming here something that in the field everybody believes. So it's not like a smooth one-correct conjecture or exotic things. It's something like a number theory. Something like a number theory, many theorems start. Let's assume generalized Riemann hypothesis. This is kind of an assumption that again we believe is true. So, assuming that behavior, it's an assumption about the behavior, what you can do is the following. So, if you want to control the growth of this coefficient for any function, of course, you can, first of all, extract this coefficient by grassroots theorem. But then, this contour, which starts life as a contour near q equals zero, you can try to push to the unit disk. Try to push to the unit disk so it's hiding unit disk from the inside. And then you can try to do it by saddle point. That's basically what Ramanujan did, that's what Cardi did, and so on. And this integral near the unit circle may be dominated, so that's the bottom thing here, by some point on a unit disk. So here we have some small imaginary part, but it peaks at some rational value of tau. And that rational value is exactly this r. Exactly, this R. So if it's near q colour 1, if the peak happens here, that's the dominant saddle, then nothing interesting. We don't have these branches, so we'll get Cardi behavior. But if R is non-zero and has non-trivial denominator, then we'll have these branches, and there will be as many of them as denominator of R. So it's easy to see that if Saddle happens at some value of tau, which is rational, then it has to happen at the negative. Then it has to happen at the negative value of that tau. Okay, so and then obvious thing you take, so this was a theorem about setup, which has to do with this invariance. There was independent conjecture that invariants are related to log VOA characters. So composing the two, you get another conjecture that in log VOAs or log CFTs, that's a more accurate version of the growth of coefficients. So I challenge the audience here to prove or disprove this using completely algebraic techniques. The algebraic techniques. So we arrived to this using all kinds of song and dance, talking about manifold surgeries and so on, but it produced a very concrete statement, non-trivial statement, which makes sense in just world of log DOA. So that's precisely the outcome. So any questions? And now I'll tell you in the remaining two minutes. So, I did abuse the time as Satoshi allowed me, and I'll give you two applications. So, one is precisely the growth of the coefficients, the second is going to be about something else, this huge asymmetry. So, previously, I was emphasizing that for my, as quantum topologist purposes, it's good to have something very asymmetric. And the asymmetry comes from infinities. So that's From infinities. So that's if you again, if you are to remember one thing from this talk, remember this. But it's interesting that similar phenomena appear in other worlds. And there are problems also rooted in representation theory which can be recast in this language. So I already mentioned Kazdanloustic correspondence as a bridge between vertex algebras and fine algebras and in quantum groups. And if we go to the subject, we'll see that there. The subject will see that there too we have larger symmetry between so-called positive level and negative level. Okay, so this has nothing to do with value of Q, so unfortunately that could be part of the confusion because now there are several, many, many new elements in this relation between vertex algebras and quantum groups. So this level has nothing to do with Q, okay, that we use so far. But in work In work on cache dynastic, the two sides of the level, positive and negative, behave usually very differently. So that's why with some set of conventions in original papers, such as these ones, for example, you see negative level featuring very prominently, even in the title of the paper. So that means authors want to tell us that, no, it's not going to work in the same way for positive level, whatever their conventions are. That's basically the message. So there is huge asymmetry. Message. So there is huge asymmetry. And actually, that asymmetry is not very different from what I talked about before. Because let's do the following. Let's apply now this correspondence to logarithmic vertex algebras, which were subject of our discussion a minute ago, but now through this lens of Kartanluz. So for Kartanluzi, they're associated to a small quantum group or some version of it at the root of unity, reduced, and so on. There are many different versions. So we can ask. So, we can ask what happens to this story if we switch from positive level to negative level. If level is of one value, for example, in some conventions negative, then we get very nice familiar log DOAs such as scripted, singlet, and so on. And their characters are not exactly modular. That's an aspect of logarithmicity. They're log modular or mock-modular, as they're also called more professionally. In any case, these are simpler guys. In any case, these are simpler guys, and that's what you saw if you did this expansion that I asked you up to 20 terms in Q. That's what you saw on sparse side. This was exactly the false theta function side. And I'll give you the definition of false theta on the next slide. But natural question is, okay, what would happen on positive side? And I don't think anybody knows. Again, I talked to Arakawasan quite a bit about this, and I would appreciate any comments anyone can give me. So let's discuss. Anyone can give me. So let's discuss these two sides. What would be the analog, for example, of singlet or triplet on the other side? Naively, what it corresponds to is very illegal operation. It's the same thing. It's actually yet another manifestation of the same problem we had before. So if you had a module, such as VOA module, in this case, logarithmic VOA module, so what corresponds to switching the going from positive to negative zone is basically switching the direction of the eigenvalues of the conformal. The eigenvalues of the conformal vector. So you basically take this guy, flip it up, and now everything is like you lose boundedness. I mean, everything falls apart. So, what you may imagine is that flipped version has some kind of resolution, maybe in a technical sense, in terms of these modules we used before. And this indeed seems to be happening, and some people thought about it. For instance, there is very nice work of Arhipov Gates-Guri, also Dennis Gates-Guri, has a long paper about 10 years ago on the subject. About 10 years ago, on the subject where he talks about this duality. So, some of the younger followers try to study this. But if you ask, okay, what kind of modules do you get, and what is the analog of false theta function, the story is too abstract to extract anything as concrete as that. You cannot just count how many degeneracies you have at each level. So, that's the issue. And more concretely, for triplet and singlet, characters are expressed as lead. Singlet characters are expressed as linear combinations of false thetas, as I mentioned before. That's the definition. So the reason they're called false thetas is that this is sum over lattice, where Q is raised to something quadratic in terms of lattice vector, but coefficients can be plus, minus one, or zero. And that's a very well-known fact in the study of this logarithmic triplet and singlet algebras, that characters are always combinations of these guys. But one natural question is. Question is: Can you have, and in fact, the example I showed you is exactly a particular combination, so namely that one. But natural question that I would ask experts five years ago, can you have a dual in a sense of that Q goes to Q inverse for just individual false theta? Not for linear combination, not for the package, but for individual guy. And people would shrug. Because if the answer is yes, the question is how to define it, and can you give me an actual series? An actual series for P, which is the level, and A, which is an additional label which runs up to P. So it's a very concrete question. It can be basically turned into something super explicit. And the answer should be yes, this is what the dual is, or no, and give some. Most people said no, that they wouldn't expect it. That was probably the easy way not to do any work. But surprisingly, the answer is yes. So in recent work with a video, So, in recent work with Evidio Costing, Gerald Dunn and Angus Gruen, we basically, using this technology, we proposed for every value of P and A, how to extract the dual of false theta function. So, and Ramanojan didn't expect this for sure, because if you think about some of Ramanojan's work, it stops at, I don't know, level p equals 13, 15 or so. And he believed that it's like a finite number, it's very special. So his techniques don't extend anywhere. Don't extend anywhere, but surprisingly, for this entire infinite family, you can construct the duals. So now, if I apply this to log du A, this is kind of a prediction for what should be the dual character of triplet, singlet on the other side. And yeah, I have lots of questions. Obviously, it's nice that now we can understand what the duals of these false thetas are and maybe apply to other characters. But the question is, can one uplift the separation or understand it from? Or understand it from log VOA point of view, and so on and so forth. So, yeah, that's my second point: that this operation seems to make sense across many different domains. So, I think I'm happy to end on this question.
