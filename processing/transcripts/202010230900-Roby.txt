And then at 9:45 Mountain Time, we'll have our usual 15-minute breakout room. And then we'll have a talk by Suichi Okada. And then instead of a third talk, we'll start the poster session right after Okada's talk. So we have lots of posters lined up, and all of the abstracts are under the workshop files on the workshop website. So you can feel free to take a look at those at some point. But let's just jump. But let's just jump right into Tom Roby's talk, where he's encouraging us to be rational. And he's going to tell us about lifting periodicity and homo messy to higher realms. Great. Thanks, Jessica. I'd like to thank the organizers very much for inviting me, allowing me to give this talk in this conference, and in particular for setting me up so well. All the previous speakers have defined a lot of the things that ordinarily I would have to define myself, and this makes it easier for me to. And this makes it easier for me to get a little bit further than I would ordinarily be able to. Here's the abstract that you probably already read, acknowledging my co-authors and people who helped me with their source code for slides and a host of other people in this great community we have that I'm really grateful to be part of. And here's the outline of the talk. So I'm going to talk about eight different kinds of row motion and how they're linked. And how they're linked. And so you can see that they've got various names here. There's four of them are row using a row of various types. So we're almost on an anti-chains on order ideals is J. Oh yeah, let me set up my annotate spotlight thing. All right, so we've got order ideals, we've got anti-chains. When we listed the piecewise linear level, we've got row motion on chain polytopes and order polytopes. And then when you continue. Polytopes. And then, when you continue lifting, you get what used to be called one of my favorite actions to consider was called rho B by Einstein and Propp when they lifted it. And that made me very motivated to work on it. And then there was a, Rindberg suggested a way that things could be lifted to a non-commutative setting. And so I've worked in various pieces of this, but the main recent work. Of this, but the main recent work was this parts three and four here, where we maybe I need red is better, where Mike Joseph and I lifted these notions along the anti-chain sort of thing. So, and I'll explain all these things and give you lots of examples. This will be an action-packed talk. But I'd like to point out the themes in dynamical algebra, ray combinatorics. Dynamical algebra, great combinatorics that are worth highlighting. So, one is the question of periodicity and order and orbit structure, which is important at the combinatorial level, but then becomes sometimes even richer at the higher levels where there's no reason to expect that your map even has finite ordering. There's a certain amount of work involved in proving periodicity at all. Then there's this notion of homomessy that we've already seen before, but it lifts to all these higher levels. Seen before, but it lifts to all these higher levels, or at least to the first three. There's questions of equivariant bijections, which often give nice proofs of these things, and those also lift to all these levels. And, you know, lifting to the higher realms just enriches the possibility of connections and the tools that are available for you to do these things. So let's see, next slide. So we'll start with the anti-chain row motion on post. We'll start with anti-chain row motion on posats. So, this has been defined before. I'll give you a quick definition again, just in case you weren't at the earlier talks. If you've got anti-chains in a poset, you can look at what happens when you saturate them down to an order ideal or a downset. And then you can take the complement of that and get an order filter or an upset. It's closed under going up in the post set. And finally, if you take the minimal elements of that, you get another anti-chain. So this three-step process is Three-step process is called row motion and it takes you from anti-chains to anti-chains. We'll see later how a similar three-step process takes you from order ideals to order ideals. And here's a list of people who've considered this map. When I make slides up, I make, I don't expect people to read everything in real time, but I like to put references and things that people can go back and look at later if they want. Okay, so here's one of the or examples of homo messy, which is let's Which is let delta be an irreducible, reduced irreducible root system. And you can talk about the positive positive roots. If you don't know what that is, it doesn't matter for this talk. I'm just going to show you some pictures of them in a minute. But if you look at the action of rho-motion on anti-chains and you look at the average cardinality of the number of anti-chains over any orbit, you get n over 2. So, this is a conjecture of Pan-Ushaf that was proved by Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas using a. By Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas using a lot of non-trivial bijections, non-crossing partitions, non-nesting partitions. But in our language, I just say that what we're saying is that the cardinality statistic is homo meset with respect to the action of row motion on anti-chains and reposits. So that's just the statement that over every orbit, the average is the same. So here's a picture that I stole from Stryker and Williams, which gives you the classes of posets that are included in Panushev's conjecture. Included in Panushev's conjecture. And here's a concrete example for the type 3.8 reposet. So if you look at this, on the type 3-8 reposet, there are 14, a Catalan number of anti-chains. And this map takes you from one anti-chain to another. And the first orbit that I've written has eight anti-chains. The second one has four anti-chains. And the last one has two. This is why we need to take averages because all This is why we need to take averages because all the orbits don't have the same length. And if you look at the average cardinality of the anti-chain for each of these things, you always get three halves, which is three over two, as the theorem says. And Jim Propp and I started to consider this phenomenon on products of two chains, which are the type A minuscule posets. And we found that if you do this, that you actually get the same, you also get Homo messy with the same average cardinality. Homo messy with the same average cardinality over these two different orbits, and that's all the five choose two anti-chains for this picture. Here's another picture for the chain two cross two, which is going to feature prominently just because when we start looking at birational functions, it gets hard to write anything else. And I think it's already been mentioned that Brouwer and Schreiber back in 74 showed that row motion is periodic with period A plus. Row motion is periodic with period A plus B on this, and von der Floss generalized that to making a specific statement about the orbit. So, this is one of our themes: periodicity and orbit length. And so, Jim and I were able to prove this homo messy phenomenon for the average cardinality of anti-chains and show that it was AB over A plus B, which in our example was 2 times 3 over 2 plus 3. And the simplest proof we know uses a non-obvious equivariant bijection called the Stanley-Thomas word between anti-chains in A cross B and binary strings. So you can see I've got an anti-chain here in the schematic that Ben Young kindly made up for us. And here, what you look at, you've got one, two, three. So I won't tell you exactly what's going on, but the positions of the anti-chains. Of the anti-chains count positive, whether they're in that row or not, tell you what goes here. And then in this row, it tells you you look at the things that are not there. Those are the things that count positively. And it turns out that doing row motion on these anti-chains, even though it looks like a fairly wacky map, here it's just cyclic rotation of these bit strains. Okay, so that's our first equivariant bijection. And we've seen a lot of these, Jessica talked about a bunch. Jessica talked about a bunch, and the people talking about like K-promotion and increasing Pablea versus plain partitions, it comes up a lot there. But here's the first one for this talk. And what this bijection also allowed us to do was not that just to give a very clean proof of this homomessy, but also to prove a more refined homomessy. So sometimes homomessic statistics can be thought of as built up from simpler ones. Up from simpler ones. So that's what the next slide is about. So if you just focus on, you've got a red, I'm calling these fibers because I don't want to use rows and columns for historical reasons. So you've got a fiber here and a black fiber there. And if you only count the elements of the anti-chain that are restricted to that fiber, if you just count those, then you get the counts 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. And on this orbit, you get 1, 1, 1, 0, 0. And the average is 3 fifths. Average is three-fifths. And it turns out that the black fiber will also have average three-fifths, and those two averages add to six-fifths, which is the homomessy we already saw. So there's a sense in which homo messy sort of function like a vector space where you can add and multiply them. And here's if you look at the negative fibers, the ones going along this axis, then you end up similarly with the count of two-fifths. With the count of two fifths, it happens to be the same. It doesn't necessarily have to be, but it's the same for each negative fiber. So you've got three negative fibers times two fifths gives us back the six fifths that we were looking at earlier. Okay. So why am I showing you this? Well, these kinds of refined homo messies actually lift all the way up to the birational realms. And also, the Stanley Thomas word will lift all the way up. Thomas word will lift all the way up to the non-commutative realm. Okay, so here's the technical statement. You don't need to look at this now. This is just what I showed you in pictures before stating what looking at average cardinality along these fibers, either this way or that way. Okay, so now I want to talk about the other kind of combinatorial row motion in this talk, which is row motion on order ideals. I'm calling it rho j because j is. Ideals. I'm calling it row J because J of P is usually the set of order ideals. Those are the sets that are closed as you go downward. And if you just take this three-step process and shift the waltz feet by one, which if you're a very experienced dancer, you know how to do, then you can think about this map as going from take an order ideal, complement that, take the minimal elements, and then saturate down. When you do that, you go from one order ideal to another in a three-step process. ideal to another in a three-step process and you can also start with the order filter if you want and because in this talk I'm trying to do the things that are a little bit lesser known I'm talking more about anti-chain row motion and row motion of order filters although it's clear that for any of these things you could just consider the the action on the complements as you go along so row motion on order filters you go from this order filter take the minimal elements saturate down Comments, saturate down, and then go up. By the way, I assume people are asking questions in the chat if they have any, and that my collaborators will take care of answering them unless something needs to be forwarded to me. So another interesting aspect of all of this is that we thought of row motion as a three-step process, which seems fairly natural, but we can do this also in slow motion in the terms of The terms of Hugh Thomas and Nathan Williams. So, when you do row motion and slow motion, you write it as a product of involutions called toggles that have a minimal effect on the order ideal or the order filter or whatever it is you happen to be toggling as you go along. So, here we've got this, we're looking at U of P for upsets as a set of order filters on a finite postet P. And if I toggle a particular order filter, what do I do? Well, What do I do? Well, if E was not in the order filter, then I'll add it in as long as that would still be an order filter. And if E is in the order filter, I'll take it out as long as what remains is still in the order filter. And otherwise, I play like a good doctor and do no harm. First, do no harm. So Cameron and Funderfloss gave this realization in terms of toggles for row motion. For row motion, on they were thinking about them as Boolean, sorry, as 0-1 labelings of the poset, which is another useful point of view. But if you toggle from top to bottom along a linear extension, that gives you the action of row motion on order filters of P, equivalently order ideals. So here's a bunch of slides that show that. If you were worried, if you saw If you were worried, if you saw how many slides there were, you might have gotten terrified and wanted to leave the talk right away. But many of these are kind of, you know, poor LaTeX animations as opposed to the really lovely ones that Jessica constructed in Sage. So we're starting with this four element upset order filter, and we're going to toggle from top to bottom. So we say, can I take this top element out? And the answer is no, because if I did, it wouldn't be an order filter anymore. It wouldn't be preserved by. Order filter anymore wouldn't be preserved by going up. So we have to leave it in. And this one's the same boat. If we took it out, we wouldn't be closed on going up. So we have to leave that one in. Now, this one's different, right? This one, you guys can still see my mouse pointer, I assume. So if this one, if I took it out, I would still have a perfectly good order filter. So I do that. Okay, and then I just continue. That one looks like that one could come up, but I'm still okay. Now, this one, if I try to add it in, I won't be closed under going up, so I can't. I won't be closed under going up, so I can't do that. And similarly for that one. So I've replaced my three-step process with a well, here it's a six-step process, but in general, it's an A times B step process. So you're doing many more operations, but each of them are simpler. Okay, and so here's just showing you this three-step process again. But now I've given these things names, not because I'm going to try to say that much more about that, but just to let you know that these kinds of transfers. These kinds of transfer maps taking us between the realms, the lands of order filters, anti-chains, order ideals, and such. All of these have analogs at all four levels. So they're another way that you can get information about or you can think of these row motion actions. But there's no time to write down all the definitions in this talk. So So, now Jessica Stryker, in a really nice paper, generalized toggling to just in a very abstract setting where you just have some class of allowed subsets, not necessarily ordered filters or their ideals. And so one that was particularly interesting is thinking about toggling in the land of anti-chains. So now our toggles are something different. There's still one for every element of the postet, but I'm toggling in the realm of anti-chains. And so that means that if I want to toggle at an element, will I add it into the antenna? It is an element. Well, I add it into the anti-chain if that would still be an anti-chain. I take it away, and I can always take it away because if you remove an element from an anti-chain, it's always an anti-chain. So you no longer have this extra condition that you have to check that taking it away leaves you in the space of anti-chains. But otherwise, there's still a do-no-harm clause. And so we'll let toggle A of P be the toggle group generated by all of these things, which is a subgroup of a symmetric group on the set of anti-chains. On the set of anti-chains. And so Mike Joseph proved that if you apply anti-chain toggles from bottom to top along a linear extension of P, that's another way of describing real motion on anti-chains. Okay, so we're going from bottom to top now. We have different toggles. And I won't talk about this very specifically, but toggles commute under certain circumstances. And when the order ideal toggles commute is exactly when the two elements are not adjacent in the Haase diagram. Are not adjacent in the Haase diagram, whereas anti-chain toggles commute if and only if they're not comparable in the Haase diagram. So they commute less often than the order ideal toggles. So we're really looking at, so these setups really are different. It's not just trivially isomorphic. Okay, so here's another way that we can get through a lot of slides quickly. We start with this anti-chain. We can't toggle that in. We can't toggle that in because it wouldn't be an anti-chain. We can always take something out, so that goes out. We go to the next guy. That one can't be added in because it wouldn't be an anti-chain. That one, it looks like we can add in and still get an anti-chain. And then, of course, when we get to that guy, he's got to go. And then this one can't come in. Okay, so we've gone from a two-element size anti-chain here to a three-element size anti-chain. Here to a three-element size anti-chain there, and you can check that this jives with our three-step walls operation. Okay, so feel free to stop and ask questions or ask questions in the chat, and the moderators will stop me if necessary. So, the next thing here is we've got these two different toggle groups generated by order toggles and anti-chain toggles. And Mike Joseph, could you? Toggles and Mike Joseph constructed an explicit isomorphism between these sets. So, if I want to mimic the anti-chain toggle tau sub E, going from anti-chains to anti-chains, I'm going to call this element tau sub E star. But what is it? It's what I get when I conjugate T sub E, the order toggle, by a certain product of order toggles. And the product of order toggles that I take is exactly the toggles corresponding to elements that are below E in the postat. Below E in the POSAP. So here's the example. This is 2-2. Oh, I didn't plug my laptop in and it almost went out. Good. Rookie error, number two, barely averted. Okay, so this is 2,2 in this post at that element, and tau of 2,2 would put that guy in. So now what do I do? Well, if I want to mimic this with order ideal toggle, so this generates that. So, this generates that order ideal. And now I do the order toggle T11, T12, T21, which toggles all the things directly below this element in the order ideal sense. Then I apply the order toggle T22, and then I do them in the reverse order. It's conjugation because these are all involutions. Okay, so, and then if I look at what that generated, the set of anti-chains up here, then I get exactly what I should have gotten. Exactly what I should have gotten. So these isomorphisms are useful because they allow us to create equivariant bijections between row motion in order ideal land and row motion in anti-chain land. And I won't show you a slide that looks like this again, but this whole idea lifts all the way to the non-commutative setting, even when toggles are no longer in volutions, which we'll get to later. Okay, so now we're going to. Okay, so now we're going to lift from the combinatorial level one step up to the piecewise linear level. This is the place for people who like posats, who like polytopes. So Stanley, in one of his many prescient papers, defined some polytopes associated with posats back in 1986. So you've got chain polytopes and order polytopes, and maybe we'll start by looking at the examples. So the condition to be a chain polytope is you're using labelings from Because you're using labelings from the real numbers between zero and one, so these could even be irrational, except that this is a talk about let's be rational. And here you're looking at you, the condition is that as you move along any chain in this post set, you're always bounded by one. The sum of the labels is always bounded by one. So, whereas the order polytope is labelings by real numbers between zero and one, that's order-preserving. That might seem like the more obvious. Preserving. That might seem like the more obvious one to begin with. And Stanley considers things like the face posets of these polytopes and gives a transfer map that allows you to carry certain properties from one to the other. And those proper, and actually those transfer maps, one of those transfer maps is exactly our Nabla or Nabla inverse in those, one of the things in the 3B walls. So in particular, the vertices of the chain polytode are the 0, 1 label. Polytode are the 0, 1 labelings, which are anti-chains, and the 0, 1 labelings in the order polytode correspond to the vertices, and those correspond to the order ideals. Okay, so that's what these postets, that's so, you know, combinatorially, we've got these polytopes, and the actions we were looking at were just acting on the vertices of those polytopes. And this territory is ripe for further explanation by people who really like this kind of geometry because. Geometry because most of the things that have been proven about this, not all, involve lifting, you know, lifting to a higher level and then just using the fact that if you've proved it at the birational level, that proof holds for the piecewise linear level. Although Al Garber's talk actually is a good example of something where they prove the periodicity without having to move to the birational level, but they still use some significant machinery. Okay. So. So here are the piecewise linear. So now we can toggle in these things, which means, you know, we're going to replace the label at a vertex with a different label. And the way you do that, this is Einstein and Prompt work based on work of Kiriloff and Berenstein, is, you know, you, again, you leave the thing alone if you're not at the vertex in question. But if you're at the vertex in question, you replace the label at F, this F of V, with what you would get if you reflected it. What you would get if you reflected in the allowable interval. So, any label that goes has to be bigger than or equal to the max of the thing labels on the elements directly below, and it has to be less than or equal to the minimum of the labels on the things directly above. And so then this adding those two things and subtraction is just a reflection. And we'll put zeros at the very bottom, and we'll put a special zero at the very bottom and a one at the very top above the post-ets, although I won't show those generally. Although I won't show those generally, just to make this formula always consistent. So, Mike Joseph was able to do the parallel process for anti-chain. So, he's lifting, if you look at the set of all maximal, you define the piecewise linear anti-chain toggle by saying take one minus the max of the sum of the labels along any chain over all the maximal chains. All the maximal chain. So, let me give you an example of that because it's easier to see. So, suppose I want to toggle this kind of wacky postet that nobody really cares much about except for this example. So, you want to toggle at this red element that has the label 0, 1 for now. And so, you consider what are all the chains that go through it. So, there's this chain, which has a sum of labels 0.5, and there's this chain, which also has the same sum, 0.5. 0.5. And if I go along this chain, I get the label 0.6. If I go along this chain, I get the log 0.7, and that's the maximum. And so now I'm going to replace the label 0.1 with 1 minus 0.7, and that gives me 0.3. Okay, so that's how a toggle works at the chain polytope level. And once you've got that, you can then do piecewise linear anti-chain row motion on the chain polytope. Remotion on the chain polytope. So I start with some. So here I'm in the product of two chains and I look at 0.2 and I look at all the chains going through 0.2 and I decide what the maximum was and the maximum value I could have gotten must have been 0.9 because I switched this to 0.1. And so we're going to just rapidly go through the 50 slides here so that we don't run over time, but you can again One overtime, but you can again look at these slides on your leisure. And there's the let's see, maybe I'll go back one. And so the other thing to notice is that when you, this is the one you started with, and when you go five steps, you actually get back to the original postat. And that's the first time that happens. So this is showing that the periodicity phenomenon lifts from, we have the same order of periodicity, A plus B, that we had in the combinatorial setting. The combinatorial setting. So that's interesting. And it's no longer obvious even that the order of this map should be finite, much less that it should have such small order. So and for other posets, you don't get this. So there has to be something particularly nice about posets to get this periodicity in our experience. All right. So now the next realm that we want to lift things to is called the birational realm. Called the birational realm. And so again, Einstein and Propp showed how to lift this. So the key thing is this dictionary where when you tropicalize something, you replace plus with max and multiplication with plus. Here we're going the other way. So we replace max with plus and plus with multiplication. And what that means is that here we've got one minus the max. So I'm replacing this one here with a generic constant C for reasons that probably aren't important for that talk. That probably aren't important for that talk. They're more important if you're considering homovusy generalizations to this level. And now, minus means one over, max means some, sum means plus. And so now we're looking at a toggle, which replaces the birational labeling at a vertex with another birational labeling given by looking at products of labels along chains. So I'll show you that in a minute. So, I'll show you that in a minute. And what Einstein and Propp did, so they didn't do this part. This was, this was, Mike and I think were the first to define these birational chain polytopes. But Einstein and Propp did this one. So max becomes sum. And then min, if max is sum, then min becomes taking the negative of the max of the negatives. And so that turns into this parallel something. That turns into this parallel something where you're taking one over the sum of the one overs. Okay, so if you thought about that for a minute, if I gave you a minute to think about it, it would be fine. But I don't want to run out of time. So here's the definition of the birational anti-chain toggles corresponding to an element, which is you only change the value at E and you change it according to this thing that we just decided. And so then bar motion. And so then bar motion, birational anti-chain row motion, because we have two different kinds of birational row motion now, I can't call it rho d anymore. So we have bar motion and bore motion. So this bar motion is the newer one, and we're going to follow the anti-chain lead and go from bottom to top. So again, here's a picture so you can get some sense of what this action looks like. So in the first step, what did we do? We took C and we divided by the sum of the products of the labels going along the chain. Of the labels going along the chain WXZ and the chain WYZ. So we get that. Now we only have one chain going through X, and we take C over the product of those labels. The C's cancel and you end up with this. By symmetry, when we look at Y, we end up with that. And now again, when we go to this level, we're going to have to take C divided by the sum of the two possible chain products. And that's a X and that's a good exercise for your college algebra students. So you get xy over x plus y. So that's one iteration of bar motion. And now I'll show you what the second and third and fourth surprise, we get back where we started. Of course, this is probably not a surprise to anybody who's been listening to this talk and certainly not a surprise if you're a cluster algebraist because you're used to such things happening. Because you're used to such things happening. But if you try doing this with a bunch of postsets in Sage, you'll find that even nice postets like the Q, the B3 do not have this property. All right, so now I'm back. So now I want to quickly review Bohr motion. This is the better known one. This is the one that was lifted by Einstein and Kopp. And so we're going to, I like the term remote. We're going to remote a generic labeling here. And we're using Bormos. And we're using Bohr motion going from top to bottom. And so, if you do one step, so you take the sum of the things below, divide by the element where you're at, and take the parallel sum of the things above. So, you just get x plus y over z. At the next level, you take the sum of the things below, multiply by the parallel sum of the things above. Fortunately, that's easy, and divide by x by symmetry. You get the same thing here. And now, here's where some exciting cancellation is going to happen. Exciting cancellation is going to happen. So you have to take the parallel sum of the. So when you do all the cancellation here, you end up getting 1 over z. And so here's the four step outline of what happens. And just for comparison, I made a And just for comparison, I made a slide where you can see. Oh, I see I'm covering myself up, but if I do that, I think you can see everything right. So there's what happens. So when you do four motion, you get those 16 labels. When you do bar motion, you get those 16 labels. Okay. And I'll talk about some properties of these maps in a minute besides periodicity. So So, when David and Jim were working on the Einstein prop paper for lifting, they were able to lift a lot of the homo messy results fairly straightforwardly, but the periodicity seemed to be the hard part. And they didn't want to have to redefine the notion of homo messy in such a way that it worked whether your orbit was finite or infinite. It just seemed less clean. So, Jim put it on his hit list to try to prove this periodicity phenomenon. Periodicity phenomenon. And so Dari Grinberg and I managed to do that using an argument where we kind of make an equivariant bijection, sort of embed it in the Grassmannian and show that cyclic rotation of the columns turns out to move equivariantly with birational remotion. But there's a bunch of complications involved in making sure that the labelings, every labeling has a good realization there. So the So we proved that, and we also looked at certain products. It seems like when post-ets get complicated, when they're no longer kind of two-dimensional, it's much harder to get good results. But with things like graded forests, so here's a graded rooted forest. I've got roots here, and I want all my leaves to be at the same level. So that's what the grading means. Then we were able to prove that the order of birational order row motion was the same as the order of just the Of just the combinatorial row motion on order ideals, and that it's usually the LCM of these numbers or the visor thereof. So for example, here, I'm pretty sure that this postet has order 12, if you do combinatorial or birational remote. But even if you look at simple postets like this, we've proven that these posets and also the Boolean lattice B3, the Q, have infinite virus. Q have infinite birational order romantic. So finding the right cosets is not so easy. And but we'll see more examples in the next talk. Okay, so here's another slide I get to slide over. That's why they call them slides, I guess. So antipodal reciprocity. So here's what this means. I wrote out the formula, but what it means is that Formula, but what it means is that after one step, I have z at the top, I end up with one over z in the antipodal position. After two iterations, I've got x and y at this level, you know, the penultimate level, and I get, in the antipodal positions, I get the reciprocals. And finally here, the w shows up after three steps as a reciprocal. So that's another thing that came out of our proof. Came out of our proof. And it's very nice because it means that certain properties, for example, this implies the geometric version of Homo messy, which is that if I multiply all 16 of these labels together, I get one. Okay. And right here, we're no longer in a situation where we really have orbits because things are just doing that. Things are just very general, but. Very general, but okay. And another thing that Jim and I proved back in the combinatorial level: remember we had these fiber, if you looked at, there was fiber restricted homo messes for anti-chains. Well, for order ideals, instead of restricting to fibers, you want to restrict to files, by which I mean the thing perpendicular to ranks. So instead of having ranks, you look at the things that are in the same vertical. Arrangement with one another. And so the more refined version of this is that if you multiply all the four of the blue vertices, blue labels, or all eight of the red labels, or all four of the green labels, that you get one. Okay, so remember that when we lifted, when we lifted plus became multiplication, so now we're not interested in averages or summations, we're interested. Averages or summations, we're interested in geometric means, but geometric means are kind of a mess. So we just look at the products and don't take roots typically when we write on the formulas. Okay, and so this was something that Greg Musicker and I were able to prove after we gave an explicit combinatorial formula for iterates of birational remotion in terms of ratios of families of non-intersecting lattice paths. So that also gives a more common And so that also gives a more combinatorial proof of the periodicity. And I think Soichi has generalized those to other posts-root and or minuscule posets. Okay. So here's what bar motion looks like. I showed you this orbit before, too quickly for you to memorize it. And so, how do we do properties? So, how do we do properties of that? Well, the order of bar motion is still going to be A plus B, and we don't have a direct proof of that. It just follows from our equivariant toggle group isomorphisms, and we get an equivariant bijection between these two different kinds of remote. And then the Homo Messi results for anti-chain cardinality lift to the study because we can actually lift the Stanley-Thomas word. It's no longer an equivariant bijection, so it doesn't prove the periodicity, unfortunately. Improve the periodicity, unfortunately. But it is an equivariant surge action. And so here I've tried to illustrate what that looks like in this two by two poset. So you multiply the things in this fiber and then in that fiber, and then you take C divided by the things in this fiber and C divided by the things in that fiber. Okay, and so those products, so it's possible to have more than one postet that has the same Stanley-Thomas word. But the Stanley-Thomas word rotating with this gives you the homomessy results. Gives you the homo messy results and even the refined homomessy results for product of two chains. Okay, I always linger on the diagrams that took me a little longer to make longer than I should. All right, so now, so Grindberg lifted birational toggling to work over a skew field. And here you have to be really careful about what order you do things in. So you can't put the one over. Do things in so you can't put the one over f of v out in front, it has to go in the middle, and here you still have the sum of the things below and the parallel sum of the things above. Um, and this is sort of bad, but um, right, this is all those formulas have nothing to do with each other. So, here I've defined parallel sum for u in the case of a skew field. So, things aren't commuting. I'm writing m bar for m inverse, and so here I've got the sum. Inverse and so here I've got the sum, the bar of the sum of the bars. Now these toggles are no longer involutions, but we can define their inverses, which of course had to be called Lgots, E sub V. And it turns out that the toggles and the L gots for elements which do not cover each other commute. Both, you know, within toggles with toggles and toggles with L dots and L dots with L dots, right? That's all you have to check is whether they're adjacent in the Hasa diagram or not. And so then as usual, we'll define. And so, then, as usual, we'll define the order of motion in this category as multiplying from top to bottom along a linear extension. And to spice things up, people, so there's one question in all of this as to what do you do with the labels on the very bottom element and the very top element? And so to spice things up, sometimes we'll put the labels there. And since something interesting happens, I've labeled them, I've kept them. So you can see here, I've got an alpha label at the bottom and a beta label at the top. Bottom and a beta label at the top. And unfortunately, I couldn't make this both easy to fit on one slide and legible, but I think you can get the idea. This is what happens after I've done one iteration of NOR motion, and then NOR, NOR, NOR. And this is the last iteration when I've gone four times. You'll see that this somewhat hairy-looking expression actually simplifies to just y surrounded by the alpha beta bar and its conjugate. Alpha beta bar and its conjugate. So when you go through this four times, you get what you started with, except that if you've got labels, so if you've made these labels equal to one, you'd just be back where you started. But if you make these labels more arbitrary, then you get this kind of interesting behavior. And for other purposes, people will assume these labels commute, but we're not assuming that in this picture. Okay, so I've only got a got a I've only got a couple of quick things to say. So, Nara Motion, so Mike and I lifted, did the anti-chain version of this lift, and we were able to also lift the bijection between the order ideals, so we were able to show that na and nur have the same order. And it turns out that the Stanley commas word looks even to this setting as a tuple that cyclically rotates with the action. We no longer can figure out whether it's proving some kind of non- Figure out whether it's proving some kind of non-commutative homo messy result, but maybe this is what non-commutative homo messy should mean. And so here's the standard picture with the NAR orbit and the Stanley-Thomas word. So here's the open problems and conjecture and questions. So the big open conjecture is that the operations of NAR and NOR on the post at A cross B of order A plus B. B of order A plus B. We haven't been able to prove that yet, but it's now on my most wanted list. And of course, there's some trouble even handling the technicalities. You know, in the birational land, we've got surrisky topology, we've got rational maps, we know how to define those. We're not so worried about issues of dividing by zero. But in the non-commutative setting, dividing by zero is an issue that we don't know how to handle nearly as well. We're also hampered by the fact that Sage doesn't have any good way to do those computations. And the other question that is, you know, what other posits can we extend this to? We'll see a partial answer in the next talk. But it seems like there's right for more to be done in all of this. And what other operations can we birationalize? I think that may be coming up in the talks next Wednesday. Okay, so the summary is that, you know, we've got our three themes: periodicity, homo message. Themes, periodicity, homomessy, equivariant bijections. I'd like to point out that if you've got cyclic sitting floating around, that's also a ripe hunting ground for homomessing. Maps that can be built out of toddling evolutions can be particularly fruitful. And these combinatorial objects are often just discrete shadows of continuous piecewise linear objects, which in turn reflect algebraic dynamics. But combinatorial tools are still useful to study and understand and can be lifted to higher levels. Okay, so the slides for this talk, I hope, are available. Okay, so the slides for this talk I hope are available by now. And I'd like to thank you very much for your kind attention. All right, let's thank Tom for this wonderful talk. Thank you. Hey, we have a couple minutes for questions. There was a little bit of activity in the chat. Theo had a couple of good questions, which I think were answered by other people. But if you still have a question, feel free to ask or anybody else. I had a question. I had a question. Go ahead. Tom, have there been any examples where, rather than homomessy, you get that if you just sum the statistic that you're interested in over the different orbits, you get the same sum without dividing by the order. And you mean we're in a situation where the orbits could have different sizes? Exactly. Yeah, I mean, if the orbits have different, there are some cases where the orbits all have the same sizes. So I think that's a trivial. I'm talking when the orbits have different sizes. I'm talking when the orbits have different sizes. Yeah, when the orbits have different sizes, I haven't noticed anything like that, but this is the right form to ask. It's really a question. Yeah, that's why I was asking because I found an example of that and I wanted to know whether it was known. But it sounds like it's not. You could call it something like messy, messy or messy. Yeah, exactly. Homo summation or something. Yeah. So, okay. Yeah, no, and it and. Okay, yeah, no, and Sam, it's not summing to zero. I'm talking about actually summing the sizes of the anti-chains, and they come out to be the same for all the orbits, but the orbits are not of the same length. I didn't dare look at the chat as I went along because I was worried I'd get distracted, which that can happen to me on the best of situations. All right, are there any other questions? Well, I guess. Well, I guess I don't know if this is a question. No, I'll phrase it as a question. So, is there strong evidence in favor of your conjecture about a non-commutative row motion? So, it's hard to, as I said, to actually do the computations and get explicit non-commutative polynomials out of the likes of SAGE if somebody knows a better way to do that. But it is possible to run experiments where you like test hypotheses. Experiments where you like test hypotheses by picking some random matrices of sufficient order and seeing whether when you do this operation A plus B times you get the right answer. And of course, there's also the evidence for it that it seems to work at the birational level. So those it's been proven. I think for most of the posts, a lot of the posts that's of interest, we've got proofs of the periodicity. Periodicity already at the birational level. So, why shouldn't it work at the non-commutative level? But it could be that we're A cross B is product of two chains, especially. So I'd say medium spring. All right, well, let's thank Tom again.
