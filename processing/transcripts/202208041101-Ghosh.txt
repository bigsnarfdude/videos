Thank you for inviting me. I'm a physicist and an experimentalist. So, instead of looking at this extremely complicated many-body systems, my view will be to take few particles together and understand them. And obviously, I'm going to deal with the drive friction, which is quite a pain for writing analytical models for it, for simulation. Models for it, for simulations, for various things. And if you bear with me through the talk, this is what you have: a sand pile. And we all know how a sand pile behaves. I'll give you a sand pile which looks like this and no walls. You'll just see a sand pile which is only made half of it. So I'll show you how to get it. And that's an experimental part of it. So it's truly I'll show you a sand pile, which just looks, occupies only. It just looks occupies only half of your space. Anyway, so what are the problems with right friction? Now, if you are a point particle, you use Newtonian mechanics, it's a differential equation, you solve the differential equation, you get your equations for the system. However, if you're rigid bodies, then you go from this to configuration manifolds. And for configuration manifolds, you need to take derivatives and the manifolds is to be. Derivatives and the manifolds to be well-behaved and things like that. But, however, you get into the kinematic difficulties because, since objects are rigid, they don't interpret it with each other. So, essentially, you have unilateral constraints in your system, which means that only a part of the space is allowed, a part of the space is not allowed. How do you write equations when you come to the corners and things like that? That's one part of the problem in this. The second part is the dynamic difficulty, which means that I could kick the football anyway that I feel. Ball, any way that I feel like the end result is going to be that the football is going to come to a stop because there's friction in the system. And we know that this kind of beats the whole purpose of classical mechanics because it tells us that if I knew what was my state space at one point, that means I knew my velocity and the position at one point, I should be able to progress in time and tell you what the final state is. And these are unique. So if I have the final state, now I should. The final state. Now, I should go back in time and be able to tell you what the initial state is. So, time reversal symmetry is broken by friction, and that makes writing equations difficult. So, just to get us started, I'm going to use a few tools that we have been developing over some years. And bear with me for this one or two slides that I'm going to show you up. So, typically, friction is given by this one number, which we call as the goofy. One number which we call as the coefficient of friction, and I'm not going to separate coefficient of dynamic friction and static friction, but let's take the coefficient of static friction, and it's defined as a ratio of your normal forces and tangential stresses that tells you at what point its object starts to move. And since mu, which is a coefficient of static friction, is f by the normal force, it's a real number. So, and what you think about such a real number is it doesn't depend upon the direction that you apply the applied force on. So, you take a Apply the applied force on. So you take a book on a table and you can push the book along the x-axis, you can push the book at the y-axis, choose which direction you want to push the book at. You expect that the coefficient of friction to have the same value of it. So essentially, if I were to be a geometer and come up with a figure which will give me this, I will say that let's start writing it in polar plots. And in the polar plots, the radius is f by n. And if my force, that means that my force is smaller by than a critical value, which is given by mu. Critical value, which is given by Î¼, and that's the radius of the shaded region. I'm going to get a stuck state, things won't move. And once I go across this particular line, then things are going to move. So that's a moving phase and a static phase, and this is a circle, because circle, the radius isn't depend upon, object doesn't depend upon any angles. The angle is a quantity that you can take the quotient out of in the system. Okay. But we know this kind of doesn't work very well, right? So, because if you try to take a thin Because if you try to take a thin plywood and try to push it, you know, things which are more flexing tend to have a larger friction coefficient than things which are more rigid. So if I pull the cardboard in one direction along its thin axis, it's going to have a low friction coefficient. If I try to move it perpendicular along its long axis, then it's basically going to have a high friction coefficient. So naively, we know that the circle is not a good number. That the circle is not a good number. And for a sledge, it's obvious that the sledge will have some very high friction coefficients along its sidewards direction and a low friction coefficient along its long axis. Okay, so the shape won't be a circle, but the shape will be something like the oval shape. So the region A in this plot that you see is basically the region which is stuck, and the yellow region is the region which is moving. The region which is moving, and the boundary tells you what the friction coefficient is. And you see that it's not a number, but it's a curve of some kind. Well, you also realize that there can be corners and things can get stuck in corners and things like that. So, for example, they have this slate. These are these two sharp corners and this two sharp corners come towards P and Q. These are corners in which things are going to get stuck too, and that will give you a large friction coefficient in the system. So, coming to this other simple. Coming to this other simple model is suppose you have, and all of these could just only slide, but if I have sliding and rolling, I have another problem with me because I have an easy axis of motion and a difficult axis of motion. For example, along one direction, the object is going to roll and we can take the rolling friction to be zero. Another direction, the thing will actually slide, and that has a large enough coefficient of friction. So, you need large forces to get it moving. It moving so instead of being a circle, you'll get some kind of an object which is like this, and that's an onset curve for it, right? So, you basically, this is a region in which if you're stuck, if you're inside, if you're out of this, you're moving, depending upon which direction I've applied the force on. The reason that I'm going through this is I'm going to use this to basically construct toys to help us understand some things. So, what are the pandemic difficulties that I have? That I have, in order for an object to affect another object, there must be some kind of contact between them. So, next, till now, I was talking about one object, but if you have two objects, we realize that if you have to influence the other object, you must have some contact. Two, because there are changes in time, you know, the objects are not touching each other in exactly the same way. And they need not always touch each other. They can touch each other, then break the contact, then again touch each other, things like that. Things like that. Can we say something about what its influence is going to be? Now, this turns out to be a difficult problem, but would be able to say something about what the previous contact did to the future of it. And remember, in the middle, it's not touching each other. And from these kind of considerations, can we make something very interesting? Okay. Now, the other thing that we have because of kinematic constraints is you have interlocking possible distributions. Interlocking possible these two tumbles can interlock with each other, cylinders don't interlock with each other. So, I'm going to show you the first experiment. The first experiment is going to be a cylinder, and this is a hollow cylinder, it is inclined at an angle. And what I've done is I've basically put into dumbbells. These dumbbells are two plastic walls, which are connected by a plastic rod. And these are of the size of a few millimeters. And I'm going to set this whole cylinder. Whole cylinder in motion, and we'll see what happens. So, basically, what happens is these two dumbbells form spairs and they kind of magically start to move against gravity. So, they are climbing against gravity. And look into this whole system, there is nothing which tells you that it should do so because it's gaining constantly height as it is moving. So, you'll have this dumbbell which goes up and then falls off. So, if this thing was very long, it kept. This thing was very long, it kept keep on getting any height and going to great distances. So, there are two things: three ways that you can have dumbbells. You can either have dumbbells in a way that they are left-handed because there's a clarity involved in the way that I have put in the dumbbells. They can either move up, they can either move down, or they can just stay put if you have this. So, depending upon how you interlock them, uh, let's look at what a single number does for that. It's easy to Number does for that, it's easy to look at the configuration space for this tilted cylinder. So, along the x-axis, I've plotted the azunuthal angle, which is the phi. Along the y-axis, I plot the distance along the axis of your cylinder. So, as beta goes up, basically the height is going up. And these are the red lines that you see are basically constant isochontal lines of equal height. So, these are the height distances from, say, for example. Distances from, say, for example, your table. So these are the equipotential lines. Now, you go from lower potential to higher potential as the lines go up in eta. Now, you have one dumble up here. What you do is as the starting starts to rotate, the dumble kind of climbs with the cylinder. It goes up to a particular distance. And at that distance, it loses the grip on the surface. Now, we have already seen that this motion is anisotropic. Is this motion anisotropic? So, this dumble, though it has lost grip, it can't come down along the streamline because it has to overcome the sliding friction, and that's larger. So, what it will do is roll. And if it rolls on a curved surface, it's going to roll along its geodesic. So, that's what it will do. It will kind of slip here and then go along its geodesic. And you look at this, what has happened is it's gained height in this whole process and it goes on. Sorry, and it goes on and on forever. Now, why does it a single dumble work? It a single dumble work because there's an extended object that talks on the system, and the talks will make the dumbbells lose their heading. And as the dumbbells lose their heading, they kind of become flat. And finally, a single dumble will never be able to climb. Their heading will go to zero and they will fall down. Now, why do dumbbell behave differently? It just so happens that if you take the two dumbbells together, this is the interesting part of it: is that if you Is the interesting part of it is that if you take the tumbles together, then at your so and you at your meridian line that means that phi is equal to zero, you can compute the energetics of it. It turns out that in a in an interlock position, a finite heading is a minimum energy configuration for the system. And what the dumbbell does is as it falls, though it breaks contacts and makes contacts together, but overall it maintains this lower energy configuration. So it kind of removes. Configuration. So it kind of reinforces the heading when it makes a collision with each other. So that's how you can get this functionality just by using the interlocking behavior in the system. Let me go to a different system. A system in which, again, I'll use this whole idea of steric hindrances and get some behavior which is interesting. So what I'll do is I'll take this beaker and you can do it with anything, but let's say, for example, we are going to have two pencils in it. Two pencils in it, and I'm going to shake this pencil in a vertical shaker. So, you shake this up in a vertical shaker, and I'll show you that this structure, the pencils themselves are not chiral, but the arrangement is chiral, and the arrangement will give you a chiral current in your system. So, so what I've done is I've put them on an electromagnetic shaker and I've switched on the shaker, and you can see that the whole thing starts to move, and it has a chirality, it has a direction in the whole system. I can do something is I can. I can do something if I can pick out one of the rods, and that's what I've done. And you see, the current ceases to happen, there's no current. You put it back, but now make sure that you have done it the other way around and you've got the other chirality, and the system starts to flip in the other direction. Now, the interesting part of this whole problem is if there is a chiral system, the chirality will give you, will convert the linear momentum to an angular momentum. So you will get currents out of the system. However, the Roth doesn't. Out of the system, however, the rod themselves are isolated conditions, they are not chiral. Just like in the previous case, it is the steric hindrance which gives you the chirality in the whole system. So you can do it for toothpeaks and whatnot. So if you have one rod, you can calibrate its theta. Theta is the angle that's moving, so it's kind of linearly moves in with time, and you can calculate what the average velocity is. You go up in your You go up in your frequency, so you start driving it still faster, you get a larger current in your system. So the drift velocity is larger. But if you go still higher than that, then what you get is basically you get the current to come down. Because now what happens is you have put in so much of energy that one chirality is not preserved. The thing constantly toggles between the two chiralities. You can assume that you have these two pencils which are up there. So these are these like this. These are these like this, but they can just go up and jump and become like that. So, occasionally, this will turn in this direction, occasionally, this will turn in the other direction, and on average, the current will come out to be zero. So, you have these two basins in these two basins in energy, there's one energy minimum on the left-hand side, there's one energy minimum on the other side, and there's an energy barrier, which is given by what is the height of the rods and things like that. And you can calculate that, and you can find out the gamma C, which is basically the critical frequency to which you can drive. Critical frequency to which you can drive, beyond which you'll start to get a drop in the current, and uh, and we'll measure it. And this theory works perfectly fine. Okay, now from a scenario where these contacts are kind of the nature of the contact is not changing as a function of time, let me go to a different scenario. A scenario in which the contacts are constantly changing as the nature of the contact contact is changing as a function of time. Now, I told you that the friction is no more like a mu. You can write a continuous moduli space of friction coefficients, but even then I had taken mu to be a time-independent quantity. I got put time explicitly in the coefficient of friction. But say we did this particular example in which we had taken two rollers together and put them side by side, we know what will happen. We know what will happen. We know that the two rollers cannot rotate in the same direction because if they did so, then there would be shear forces which would prevent them from doing so. So, you can think of a Jack and Jill story where you have a cylinder which is like this. You are basically rotating this cylinder and you are put in one particular ball at the bottom of the cylinder. It's a hollow cylinder. The ball goes almost at the bottom position of the cylinder and it's a steady steady somewhere there. Well, I have given, I have. Somewhere there, well, I have given I have shown here with some finite angle, but basically it would be five theta would be almost zero if rolling friction is zero. Then, if you have another particle, what happens is the moment these two particles come together, the rolling is not allowed, then the system topples itself from going from a rolling to a sliding state. And basically, the thing goes to a higher angle. And then, any noise in the system which breaks the contact between the two, the lowest particle will come running down because it has to go now. Running down because it has to go now, it can roll and go to the rolling condition, which is almost like the bottom of your rotating cylinder. And the top also comes and catches up with it. And once it catches it up, caught up with it, it again becomes a sliding pair and climbs up. So now instead of saying that critical mu is a time-dependent quantity, I'm going to tell you that mu is a time, is a quantity which depends both on the fraction of the time it has been either in the rolling state or in the slide. Either in the rolling state or in the sliding state. So if mu had only been in the rolling state, then mu average, time average would have been just mu rolling. But if it was FR time, the fraction of a time, if Fr was the fraction of a time it was in the rolling state and one minus FR was the time it was in the sliding state, then it would be a linear combination of the two, which would tell you what your time average U and V. And why would you be interested in such a system? And I'll tell you that suppose you want to get self-organization in any system. What do you? Get self-organization in any system. What do you need? What you need in a self-organization system is to get homeostasis synthesis. So you need feedback. So things have to change. Otherwise, you cannot have a stable structure. This is one reason why sign piles are not stable. It depends on how you have coded. You go and tap your table a few times, the sand pile will flatten out. Because there is nothing which prevents it, which actually auto-tunes itself and adjusts itself so that the critical point is maintained. However, However, in this particular system, friction being an autotunable parameter, this particular problem of your granular system, which is typically a protocol-dependent state that Sawana usually gets to, is kind of overcome. So you will get states which are not protocol-dependent. You will get states which are otherwise not stable in any other condition. So, how do I show this? What I do was, I'm going to do an experiment which basically Uh, experiment which basically has a cylinder in which I have some particles in it, and the cylinder goes and does something which we call as an orbital motion. Now, what is an orbital motion? Orbital motion is something where the orientation is preserved. The cylinder moves on a circle with a certain frequency mu, omega. And however, the orientation of the cylinder doesn't change as a function of time. And you can think of this: like I have a book like that, and I just move the book. And I just move the book in this direction. So, if the book has a Pudicel vector written on it, that Pudicel vector doesn't change as I direction doesn't change as I start to move the entire book. Now, what it does is, and I'm not going to go through the steps of it, it is what it does, it effectively creates a potential, and the potential starts to sweep along the surface of the cylinder. So, you can think of this as a potential created up there, which attracts all the particles into it, and then the potential will actually sweep along the surface of the cylinder. Potential will actually sweep along the surface of the cylinder as I move the cylinder around. So, here is it. So, I can show you in a lab frame, there's one single particle up here. And you can see what happens is the particle is actually rotating down up there. If I go to the frame of the vial, you can see that there is a minimum. That's a minimum, but the white line is a minimum, and the particle is actually following the white line. Well, you can calculate out what your the It out what your the distance that the particle is away from the minimum tells you what the friction coefficient is, and you can calculate the friction coefficient for a ball. It comes out to be 0.01. The rolling friction is a tiny little rolling friction between the glass, the plastic container, it's a pexiglass container, and a metal particle. If you have a disc, we all know that disks cannot roll. If it's a very thin disc, it's only slides, and obviously the friction coefficient is large. And obviously, the friction coefficient is larger. And you see that there is no one friction coefficient, it is spread in the friction coefficient, and for a disc, metal disc on a plastic plate, the friction coefficient of this particular system was about 0.3. Okay, so here is what we do. You take a few particles and you move it, and you can see that the particles kind of stay on one side of your log of the line. So it's not occupying the end. Line, so it's not occupying the entire uh uh potential, so only half of the potential is that that's a potential which is lagging behind is occupied. The front part of the potential is not occupied. What you do is you add more particles to it, the story kind of reinforces itself because nothing crosses this white line, uh, or everything is on one side. You can add still more particles, and this was what the picture that I was showing you. And this was what the picture that I was showing you: that nothing causes the potential minima, everything is on one side of the potential minimum. And this is surprising because, remember, if I had put in disks or something else which could do only sliding, I would have got some really symmetric object which would have been moving in time along the surface of the container. So, just to drive home the surprise part of it, so I have a Surprise part of it. So I have a minima. And if I put in one particle, well, the particle's lowest position adjusts itself so that to handle the minima. And if I keep on adding particles, the force distribution is going to be such that you're going to have a central minima. And about both of them, you're going to have particles around it. So that's how it's going to work around. But however, in this particular system, what you see is there is a central minima, and no particle actually crosses this central line. This is the central line, and there's no wall on the other side. And why does it do so? Why does it do so? Is to look for it, what we did is we put in not particles because you can't see whether particles rolling or sliding. We put in dumbbells, sorry, we put donuts in it. So, donuts, we know that if you are looking into a donut side on, if the donut appears black to you, that's a rolling particle. If the donut appears with a hole on front of you, Donut appears with a hole on front of you. That means the donut is sitting flat on the face of your container and that's sliding because, in that condition, it can't roll. So, if you do this image, then you can find that what happens is just all the particles that's close near to the wall, those are the particles which are all rolling. The particles which are the rear end are particles which are sliding. So, the system has space separated itself into something which is like the rolling and sliding. Something which is like the rolling and sliding, and remember, this uh the particle which is rolling now does not always roll, it can convert itself to sliding, and once it does so, it goes back to the back of the system. And some particle by fluctuations from the sliding state would become a rolling, and those particle will come front. Okay, so this is what happens in this whole system. There's a constant and redistribution of rollers and sliders, and overall, this actually allows you to keep a shape in the system. And this is surprising because this. System. And this is surprising because this is one of the first instances that you see that coefficient of friction being an autotunable parameter during the experiment. And just to convince you, we put these experiments on with disks and disks can't really roll because that's unstable with the thin disk and you get a symmetric distribution. So that's us. The distribution is entirely symmetric. There's no funny things about the when you don't when you cut away that rolling degrees of freedom in your problem. What does it do? It can also give you very interesting phase diagrams in your system. For example, this is an example which I'll so what I'll do is instead of taking it on a cylinder, I'm going to put it on a Petri dish and I'm going to drive it now in a Petri dish. This is not exactly the experiment that we do, but this is this drives on the point. And say we want to get clustering in your system in a particular way. So whenever you see, whenever you see a Whenever you see a donut with a hole in it, you know, these are sliding particles. Any donut which has no hole on it are rolling particles. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with a high frequency in which everything is basically rolling. And I'm going to slowly down, switch it, switch down the frequency in the system. So I'm going to come down with the frequency. And as I come down the frequency, I'll show you something that happens, which is interesting. So you write the system. The system and I am slowly coming down in frequency. You see, some of these objects have started to become like sliders, and then you can see them up there. And as I lower down the frequency, you will see that there's a cluster formed in the system. And as the cluster starts to grow, and finally, you get a beautiful clustering in the whole system, right? So, this is a system in which it's only possible if you have both rolling and sliding degrees of freedom, because once it starts to slide, To slide that becomes a liquefaction point. You get another particle which collides with it, and now this collision is non-momentum conserving. Everything is lost by dissipation. Two particles stick together and sit at that position. So though we do not have attractive interactions, dry friction can actually induce something which is like an attractive interaction because dry friction has something which is odd, which is known as the velocity gap. So if you reduce the velocity in your system, force in your system for a linear Force in your system for a linear friction, you know what will happen. The velocity will go to zero. For a dry friction system, as I start reducing the force on the system, suddenly there is going to be a point where the system goes from a finite velocity to a zero velocity. So that's the dry friction, that's the velocity gap in the system. Once you have a velocity gap in the system, you can use a velocity gap to get this kinds of attractive interaction of CDO problem. Okay. So, come with the conclusions of this talk: what do I learn from it? Shapes give rise. Do I learn from it? Shapes give rise to steric hindrance and interlocking. That's right. And this interlocking can give me some kind of functionality in my system. Now, it gives it the non-interpretability conditions, for instance, walls and configuration space. And this would mean that, you know, if I have a ball which is bouncing on a table tennis place, the configuration of space which is allowed for this ball is only z greater than zero. The rest of it is. Greater than zero. The rest of it is not there. So, if you start putting in constraints in your system, then if you have one constraint in your system, you have the face of a polyhedral, which you're now not allowing it to go. If you have two or two configurations, then you have a corner. If three configurations, you will have a corner. If you have two constraints, you will have a line. So, in principle, for this dumble case, you could have a high-dimensional configuration space. What you see up here, the The what you see up here, the shape up here, is basically the space which is not allowed. So, anything inside this space is not allowed, anything outside the space is allowed. And what you do is you basically start doing dynamics on this particular configuration space. So, on the surface of this configuration space, which we call as a polyhedron. And forces like gravity and things actually force these particles to be onto this particular space. And the particles make their dynamics on this space. And this is how it gets stability. This space, and this is how it gets stability. This is how it gets functional. So, what you can do is typically we know that minimas are of this kind of things where you have e is got x squared. The minima is at the point where the restoring force is zero. But once you have corners, you're basically reinforcing these particles because at that point, very close to the point that meets the particle is the force is not zero. So, you're reinforcing the particle. So, it's a strong enfrapment that you can have in your system. Okay. Okay. These chiral structures come out because the system itself is not chiral, but the configurations, their interactions, the arrangement makes them chiral. The other thing is that the energy input is the system. How do you drive an energy? That energy input depends upon what is the state of the system. For example, if you have a, just to point it out, that if you have some rollers, and if I put a pusher sponge on it, and if they're in a rolling state, then basically the Rolling state, then basically the table is not going to see any energy transfer onto it. But if I push onto the sponge, the rollers will become sliders and there will be a large configuration energy which will be pumped into the system. So you can use all of these to get various interesting structures in your system. And you can get tripping non-trivial states. Thank you. Let's thank Professor Shankar Ghosh. Very, very interesting talk and cool, cool videos. I'll always love. Cool, cool videos. I'll always love watching your videos. All right, let's take some questions from the audience. Uh, see if uh Srikant, you're raising your hand or you clap in. Kids clap. Okay. All right. Questions? Either in the chat box, unmute yourself. Okay. Hold on. One question from here. Hi, this is Charles Meno. Real interesting experiments. interesting experiments. I'm wondering if are there other systems where you could have just sliding friction types of particles with different types of sliding? In other words, I don't know, I'm thinking perhaps a polyhedron with different areas that are touching the surface and then ending up with this kind of face separation only with sliding friction. Yeah, you can. You can have polyhedrons which are faces which are narrow and there are faces which are broad. And there are faces which are broad, and you can get a lot of interesting behaviors out of that just by sliding friction alone. No need of rolling friction. So it depends upon how if you have thin edges on it, then like thin surfaces on it, small areas, anisotropic area, faces on it, then anything. Yeah, objects which roll also in a different way, constant width objects, they also give you nice interest. Okay, so we have, okay, we are over by a minute. So let's thank Professor Shankar Gosh one more time and we'll move on to our next speaker. It's Professor Li Chen, and he's going to be talking about four-scale multi-phase. Multi-phase.
