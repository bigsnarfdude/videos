So the starting point was a discussion with Paolo. He speaks us about the cactus groups and he asked us the question, can we explain can we understand this group with from Can you understand this group from an algebraic point of view? So, if you look to this presentation, you see immediately that there are this very particular presentation because it is a C-group presentation, C-bar group presentation, on the Russian quadratic. So, this means that it's very close to right-hand girl acting group or right-hand girl oxyter. So, the first idea is to say, okay. So the first idea is to say, okay, perhaps we can apply what is done for right-angle concept group. So just me recall you what is a right-angle concept group or right-hand acting groups. We take a simple graph and just the rotation is given by the generators are the verte vertex of the graph and the relation are commutation, two generators commute when there is an edge there is an edge between the two. There is an edge between the two the two generators. So for example, in this graph, A and B commute, B and C commute, C and D commute, but there is no other cooperation. And if you want a right-handed cocksetor group, you just declare that the generator are complete. So how can you solve the world problem in such a group? Well, it's quite easy. Just read your word. Just read your word from left to right and push as far as you can the letter. So start with this word. Start with this word. Okay, B is in first place, so I can't push it. You can push A because A and B commute. Then you can push C. You can push B, but you can remove B with B minus 1. And you will continue, and then you can't do anything. This is not the empty work, so this means that this work does not return one. Okay, so you have a solution to the work problem, but you don't have a normal form. This is not, you that does not provide a normal form because if you take these two words, you can push D from the left and then push A. From the left and then push A from the left. So it is not terminating. But you can say, okay, it's not a problem. I fix the total order on my letters and then I have a terminating and confluent solution to obtain normal form. This is not true. Can't just fix an order because if you do this, yes, you will have Yes, you will have a terminating process, but it will not be compliant. You lose the compliant when you impose to have a terminating process. So you have to be more clever. You can modify, of course, can solve this problem. You can fix this problem. But it's not as simple as it can be. Okay, so let's try to generalize this problem to capture groups. As Paulo said, Groups. As Paulo said, cactus group is an example of a marginal family of cactus groups. The cactus groups are set to coxceptor groups. So if you don't know what is a cockset of groups, it's not very important here. Just recall what is necessary. So a cockset of group is a group with a particular group pronotation. You have a set of generators that are invocative, and you have a nice relation like this. This is the planet. This is the prototype of the symmetric group, if you had inverted errors. And cocksettor group is the generalization of that kind of pronotation. So there is some particular cocksettor group. This is the cook sector group that are finite. When the cook sector group is finite, there is the biggest, longest element. That I denote by W good omega X. So, tech cockseeta groups and text all the yes, didn't say something. Coxeter groups have a very particular family. If you take any subset of the generator, you take the subgroup generated by this subset, it is again a cook sector group. With the presentation, just keep the relation that concerns the generator. And if the cook sector is And if the Coxeter group is finite, of course, all the subgroups are finite. So I take all the longest elements corresponding to the finite cocceptor group, only the ones which are irreducible. Okay, so this means that I don't take all of them. Irredictible, it means that the coseter graph is connected. If you don't know what it means, it takes just some of them. Is made just it takes just some of them. And the capture group has this plotation. So it is very similar to GM. You have involved relations. You declare that some generators commute and the other one does not commit but can it commute. So you you the point is that if you take uh a parabolic A power extra group on the take the cookset elements that correspond to this power x2 group, then you permit all the cookset elements of the subgroups. So for instance, the cookset element of the coxeter groups sends this parallel group to this one. So it's not commutation, it's not ketic commutation. Commutation with not KT commutation. This means that you have a nice presentation like for GM. And of course, as Paulo explained, you have a morphism from G of Ws to WS, which sends the copy to the original element. Of course, in the copy set of routes, you have more relation between the W, but you just keep this. So as you can see, of course, catalysts are C bar groups. Caturus R C bar. Okay, so take an example. I take this graph, this toxeter graph, which corresponds to a permutation group. The capital group has, the genetic set of the capital group has 10 elements which are written here. Correspond to the subset. This coxeter group is finite, so I take all the coxeter part of the group, just already. Coxenter power with the group, just reduce reducible. I have this ten element, and you you can see I have put red arrow on a blue arrow, so just follow, just put to the red arrow. You have a natural order, partial order on this subset, which is given by inclusion. So you can say, okay, I have a partial order. Each time you have a partial order, you can complete it to Order, we can complete it to a total order. So let's say that I competed with the lexicographical property. Okay, A is including AB, AB is lexicographical, lexicographical. Okay, we have this total order. Now, how are the relations? If we take a If we take a cockstate element, then it permits only the generators that are smaller than the generators that you are taking. So ABC permutes AB and BC, you can use A and C, but it will nothing further than one. Okay, so now I want to solve. Okay, so now I want I want to solve the work problem and I want to have a normal form. So I want to do the same game as I done for right handler tube. So I take this one, WA, WD, WBCD, and I try to push on the left the biggest element. So you see I can D is bigger than E, so I can push W D like this. Push W D like this. But if I touch from the same word, this element is bigger than in one. So I can push WBCD on the left of W D. Of course, when I push W D, it becomes W B because W B C D ex B and D. And then I can do nothing here. And I can do nothing here. So you see, this is not confirmed. This is not confirmed. Because you can't do any can do nothing here, you can't do nothing here. You have not the same word, and you can't apply any rules. So your process is terminating, but it's not confluent. This is the main problem for the same problem for rectangular symbols. So you have to fix this point to obtain a normal form. So what is the So what is the idea is to speak about strata. So you have to put together some elements. For right-on-narrative group, what you do, you put together elements that commit. Here, we don't put together elements that commit, we put together anyone that commit or casic commit. In other ways, we put together anyone that have a relationship. So a strata is a set of elements. So a strata is a set of elements such that any two elements of this subset possess a relation of xy equal to something. So if you had such a strata, you can associate the word. What is the word? You take all the amount of the strata and you use the total order to write a word. So if you want to write something which is more classical, a strata corresponds to a click in your graph. In your graph, everyone is an LBA between any two generals. Of course, if you talk to the world, the first thing you want to do is to decompose this world as a set of structures. Set of strata. And of course, one letter is itself a strata. So you, of course, starting for any word, you can cut it in a second of strata. And now the game is to modify this strata in a confluent and terminating process. So Eg of S phi, this is the strata, this is the strata, and the associate water is this one. So you see that AB is bigger than D and bigger than. That AB is bigger than D is bigger than A. So now you play this game, you push on the left, the bigger enemy. So let's take an example, take this word. You can cut this word in two strata because you can see that this word is a strata word and this word is a strata word. So you have decomposed. Is the strata work? So you have the cognition in two strata, which are these two. Now, if you look to U2, you can see that WS can be taken to be put in U1, and again, you will have a structure. So if you think in terms of word, I say, okay, I take this word, which is in the second word, take this letter which is in the second word, and I put it Which is in the second word, I put it in the first world. But the problem is that if I do this, this new word is not a scratch because this edge is not at the right place. So you have to push it as far as you can on the left. And if you do this, of course you change. You see, if you push. You see, if you push WS on the left, it will modify these three letters because these three are smaller than this one. Okay, so this means that your rating system is the same as this one. You have takes WS, you have pushed it on the left, and then you obtain your new structure. And then you can repeat the process. Look at the two elements that Look at the the two elements that that are here. You can push you can't push this this element on the left. But but you can you can can put this one. You need first to take WB and put it on the left of WEB and become WA and then you can put WA in the new set. So now you have a new ratio. So you can consider these two elements because you have involution. Because you have involution, and then you obtain this second transfer. And then you can't do anything. And now you have a rewriting, confirmed, and terminating process. So you have a normal. And if I take the previous example, I said that okay, with the previous example. With your proceeding process, you have finished, but you have not the same one. But you can see that this one is not written as a structure. And now this is processed determined with a unique set of strata. So you have a real T process which is confident on terminating, and you have a normal form on any capitalist capacity. So why do I need to? Why do I need to do this process? I need what is written here. I need a graph where I put an edge between any two elements for each elevation. I need a partial order in the red line. I need something which says, okay, what is the torsion of the generators? Your edges are not direct. No, not directly, but I have an order from the top to the bottom. So the red edge are order. You have a bigger or smaller. But the blue one are not order. Because for this one, I have commutation. So I need them. Okay, I'll. Okay, we can say why do I need this? Because I want to define some tricker groups for groups which are not just involved generators. So I need to decide, okay, if it is to the power 2 or to the power 3, which is equal to both. And I need an action, a partial action, which says, okay, for each element, I have an action on the smallest response. I have an action on the smaller suspicion. And of course, I need rules that make everything compatible. Because otherwise I have a nothing. Okay, I have the definition of a trickle point. So what is a. I need double first to define a trickle graph. So what is a trickle graph? It is a graph with a partial order on some vertices. and some vertices with automorphism with partial automorphism and with a map which says what is the order of the element this is what I used before but I need two rules two extra rules this one so this means that there is an edge between X and Y Between X and Y, and they are not comparable. So if I have two generators for which I have a nature that are not comparable, if I take an element which is polar from one of the two, then there is an edge the other element and they are not comparable. It's easy to understand to this case. It means that if you take Case. This means that if you take two subsets that are disjoint, if I take a subset of one of the two, it is disjoint to the other. And the other rule, you just say what is written here: if I start with these three generators, Z, Z, Z Z, which is smaller than Y, which is smaller than X. I can start by pushing this one here and then push the two here. But I can start to push everyone here and then push this one. And of course, this is conjugation, so at the end, I have the same. So at the end I have the same system resistance. This means another way to say this, it is to say if I have x, y, z and I want to push z on the left, I can do this. Or I can first push a Y. You wrote the same thing? Yes, that's the topic. Yes, that is not what I want to mark. Okay, I mean probably don't want to write it because write something wrong. But it's really the the the way you want to push element. You you can want you have two choices to do it and you have to you need to have something compatible. To have something compatible. This says that it is compatible. First question, sorry. So if you push the other way, you get that the end set while executing maybe correctly. Yes. So paid, no, concept. Yes, but you impose a you have to impose what so that it contacts. Another silly question. So when So when there is no conclusions, can you add just additional relation to compare these two to equalize the two different words? This is a technique from Grove Man Basis, but I'm not sure. I think it cannot be applied. There is no conflict. The two words that are in In pseudo-normal form, that should not be induced more. They are equalized and added to the relations. Is it similar approach here or not? So, when you have this rule, you of course can define the trickle groups. So, the definition is clear. Here you define that x to some power is equal to one and you provide this obvious relations. So example, right angle cocketta group, right angle RT groups are trigger groups, cattle groups are trigger groups, of course. We do this through this. If n of x is n of x is equal to infinite for every x, then of course you have a sequence of unique. Okay, we put the definition so that this works. So of course if we have a tweaker graph, we have a writing process for the tweaker graph. So you we don't just solve the world problem, but we have extra properties. But we have extra properties. For instance, as Paulo explained, if we take any subset and a subset such that it is closed by the automorphism of the subgroups, then exactly like cocaine groups or halting groups, the subgroup has the expected prototype. You just keep the relations that are concept. So, you have a notion of parabolic group in any trickery groups. On light article groups or coxeter groups, if you take the intersection of two parabolic groups, it is a parabolic group, which is generated by the intersection of the substrate. So, for instance, in a capital group, if you take a set of generators that are not comparable, one within the other, then Within another, then it is the right of the artimus. The two book generally is the right to generate. Because this is what says it. But we have more. If you take the corresponding acting root, this means that you consider only the case where n of x equals infinity. Then, Then you can see that the plotations are positive, so you can consider the monoid with the same plotation, right, for Artemis. Then the monoid with the same plotation inject in the group. The group, of course, is the enveloping group of the monoid. The other section of the monoid. Of the monoid with any parallel group is the parallel monoid and the monoid, like forouting groups, is conservative, process GCD unconditional LCM. And if and only if the graph is complete, then we obtain gas values. So we have so this part is not very difficult to prove. We have all the techniques of the gas. The techniques of the Gaussian theory, which say it's work. It's not very difficult. So, now, okay, we have property, but do we have extra examples than the factors? Yes. There is this nice example. If you take a cox set of groups, you can consider the cost setter element. Here, the cooksetter element. What is a cocksetter element in the cocksetter loop? It's just the product of the generator in a fixed order. And you have the notion of parabolic elements associated to this coxeter element. The parabolic elements are just the ones that are smaller for the length associated to the reflection. And the other thing in point is that this coxeter elements. Is that this coxipedal element permutes the parabolic element? So you are exactly in the same position as for CAP2. Because for CAP2, you take the longest element and the longest element permutes the longest element of the parallel mixed group. Here you have the coxeter element which permutes the smaller coxeter element. You can play exactly the same game and you obtain what we call the dual characters loop. So, for instance, for the red loops in two generators, this is the prototype of the dual characteristic. And why I like this blue is because you are just relative elements. Here you see that you have an element which is of source function tree. We have also other examples. So, Paulo explained that we have virtual breadth groups, but to each white ordering computer, we also can also associate a tricker group. And the Thompson group is a tricker group. So, you see, we have a lot of family of groups which are trigger groups, and this machinery can expect that in You can expect that it provides a lot of things. We have not finished all we can do because just, as Paulo said, work in progress. But as you know, right-angularity group have a lot of properties, and this group are very close to right-handing group. So, we can expect that a lot of the techniques used to right-hand group can be applied to these instruments. Any questions? Which Townsend group do you mean? Okay, I don't know about the others. I asked this question. I ask us questions. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So we know how to solve the conjugacy problem, but did not have time to write it because the paper is already 50 page long. So already. But okay. I observed the question of the payment talk. How do you see the social work when you write on your RTP? You have three algorithms with three generators. You put, you take, you read a word and you put things like that where the pilot just commit if the engineer does commit and otherwise they stop. This provides a solution to the work problem, this provides a linear time solution to the work problem. If you want to do this for If you want to do this for the conjugacy problem, you just say okay I group some generators and I start to take the one which I've committed on turn and repeat. And at third time, this will stop and then you have a unique resulting element of the conjugate sequence. This will work exactly in the same way, more or less, for Tucaro. uh for uh uh for to curl. It's more difficult because you have not just not just conjugates, you have just a commutation. The element changes. So it it's a little more difficult to deal with. But I'm very convinced that it's working in three years. Another question. Let's send Katie again.
