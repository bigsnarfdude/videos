Personal de la Plata and their studios of incipient in the Plata and their doctoral in Buenos Aires. And we are working in this context of this context in a European, we are studying Europe when they go in the problem that we are working on.  University of the Republic of Montevideo. And the idea is that this device is with a little bit working. So, I can understand a case that is connected and that the case that we generalize and extend the groups achieved. So, I'm talking about groups. If groups and the functions of induction actions in groups, so the context Ar je un grupo ace un subgrupo de je y voya considerar a una ache algebra. Tema action el groupo ache en el algebra a y minotación para las actions cuasar la sien. Tenego de elemento de a y actú por un elemento de ache en este caso vacer a dericha. So So we are looking to algebra, we have construct aid, a new city. So what we want is a algebra combuenas provided. This construction of the algorithm that is a construction that is popular. It's a construction that can control Eugene and Corteñas. So, how construction is this algebra? Well, I will consider p to the projection of GEARC. How we construct this Indo-equiet are the elements of Indo-CIO, are the functions of the group function in the algebra with it. Consortas proprietors. That we could say that when we project the support of the function that function, it supports infinite support with classes, and that when we go to an element of algebra, so we can act for action, that is the same thing that applies to porch. Yes, this conjugate is in the structure of algebra with the multiplication point and what action that has. So, we are element, we are an element of the group. This is going to have an element of IN so that evaluation of an element of the group and this because. Because they have this algebra. Yes, this construction is functorial. One is that we have the group, ache, of the group, we have a function of the category of achievement, algebra, in the category of GE algebra. And that proposed. And that proprietades verify this construction. Well, some proprietades, for example, if our action is applicable to a G, well, we have our original queue porcelain with a trivial action, with a subgroup trivial. Trivial and construct the end bueno que recuperamos are the functions in support definitive. That passes for example if the tomb action trivial action, how we are trivial algebra. I don't mention that with a change, I don't mention if the algebra about a niche or a book is construction, you can see for a solution. But But consider the complex children that are not interested in the antenna that parameters trivial power to the complexity. So, pass with the application to the complex construction, when recuperamos are the functions of support finite. And for very important proposals, we have isomorphism. Modi algebra. So we have my algebra in that algebra. The non action of G as if the product crusaded with an algebra. Well, the result that is very indexed by co classes confined non-commands and with coefficients in the crusader of the case with A. Con a. Yes, that is a very important. Well, yes, we're generalized. Generalization is construction for other types of actions, other things algorithmic actions. And what is our first question, what is the first passage that we have? Well, here we go in the actual group, we are correlating finite dimension. So we have y a security. The host of event finita novidar the definition forces algebra and hope of event finitely, but one provided tengo and algebra of Jobs. What have you good? Tengo queche is an algebra unital y la pensar on the complex. And the voyage on the complexes. Lebanese, that when we have a joke, we have a structure of algebra, and a structure of co-alphores that are compatible. So we have a unit, we have a multiplication delta entry other than verify the co-a societividad, y the co-associativity. What allows us to notice that, we have the same thing that multiplication of achievements, the description as a tensor ache. We have a conident that is a line of ache. And we have a antipode that is a very line and that we have to result. And in the context of the JOP, of the finite dimension, what we have is a good duality. Look at how we refer to good, which we can dual algebra, the three functions of the algebra, and this is a structure of memory of Josh. If the multiplication that we have in the dual is the dual of the multiplication of Aristotle in particular, in the dual multiplication, that is the product of convolution. Yes, we have a good validity, we have a dimension, and if dualism recuperates our original and And we have a relation between the actions of the John and the coax of his dual. Here we are referring to this: a modulo algebra, or a directory, a modulo algorithm, y solo siamentiene un estro. Atamientiene una structura de dual comodulo algebra. There is one dual comodulo algebra. Y si sabiri una algebra directa, vu yar recover una commodulo algebra aquier. Entonces. Ava ser una algebra conidad. Y decir que es una modulo algebra adericha, decir que tin unaction de adercha. If you have a Of it, if we have an application of the tensor, in A concert proprietary compatibility of the multiplication, the multiplication of the data. And it is a dual commodity, or if you have a co-action in dual so that we have a application in terms of also with verification. Or in the case of finite dimension, or it is.  The finitading data that is simple. Or simple and the same thing. Si shotengo a una uka modulo algebra. Si a Si, A es una uncomodulo algebra me puyo construir una ache comodulo algera. Puyo construir una ache como yo algera. No cualgieras. No question, yes, that verification proprietor. If there is a model, we are coindeing, or we are induce a co-action, because we are coind orchid, and if we have a application, you are already in a tensor. Coincidence. Yes, I want to coaxión y a demas qui quiero. Y a demas qui quiero. Talquí como mentionciones, avara sitengo, una ache, combulo algier, la puedo pensar como unache dual modulo algira. Entonces, talque cuando la pienzo como ache dual, modulo algiera como ache dual modulo algira, fila pienzo con lación de dual temo locente. So temo la coindee. The coin pens as a checkual modulo algebra. Puedo tomorrow match with a checkual, where this map is like a generalization of the product of groups, like a checkual action, potentially to put a character. Now, what is a como algebra? So, this is the podcast as a UDO algebra, and an action of Udo if it is also important in this match with UDU. And what I want to do is algebra seem to have the group what we have algebra of the product crusader with algebra of matrix with coefficients in the algebra. In this context, what we have is a moderate equivalent between these two algebra and equivalencia. Y existence dos vimos os existe eme un a ve A ve vimobulo y ene un ve modulo tal que hondo semos lo tensors, puedo ser e tensor e sobria y esto vacer isomorpho y no al rave no, the tensor. Algo Eme tensor ene sobre ve y esto vacer isomorpho a como avimoblo y pu acer ene tensor e me por así sobre ve y esto va ser isomorfo pargón sobrea y esto vaser isomorpho a ve como vimodros. This requires que valencia morita que estamosca. This problem that we are working in, but you have to embla. What if I have a group? If you have a group of finito groups, We have dimension finite dimensions in the multiplication that we are considering in this group, an element of groups age or how. Again, that is the multiplication. What we are going to think: what is paramount elements? Well, we will sum it up, about the group elements, as a group, you are finite, and the combination of formal combinations of the elements of the group, all of them. So, if we have a Jof of Dimension, challenges that suddenly dimension. Jof definitely finished. The dual element of the dual element, we are going to think like a combination of formal source of indicators. If the subject are calves, and the indicator of G, the function that will group in the group in an element of the group, going to one, segment, pose. If you do algorithm, it is a John of infinite image and that is the multiplication in this case. Well, the definition for indicators can extend to an indicator to assume about all the group elements of the indicator of Of the indicator of Genamenos, one tensor el indicated. So we have one of the infinite dimensions that if we solve the problem, that comment also results in case when we group now, and if the group is not infinite queas because in the contrast original contribution that contains groups, the group is necessary in definite group. Those who pass and infinite. Well, if you finite, it's already grouped on the John, what you will pass in finite dimensions. That's a gender, but what we can do is the dimension. Or else what we can do is dual as the John. Select a John, but their dual no. Yes, all we have is a problem. And the problem is that when we work with the John, who are infinite dimensions, which is miraculous duality, there is problems to define multiplication. So, surgical idea of passing the idea. The idea is work with groups of algebraic groups. Groupos, quanticos, algebraic. And because we can work with quantities algebraic groups, well, because the dimensional infinite dimension and this algebra of groups to the group, the group of quantities algebraic groups. So this is how general problems are grouped in algebraic groups, and we can work so the first thing that is a group of quantities. That is a group quantity alphabetical. Well, I claim a definition that is simple and it's good to a group quantity of the theorical group is a hole of multiplicadores. Yesonal Jerajo. The multiplicadores regular que tiene invariantes rados es un grupo quantico algebraic group. So we have the algebraic Express of the algebra of John multiplicadores. Algebra de Jove de multiplicadores. The idea of algebra of John Multiplicadores is that generalization to the algebra of John that had unidaired. When we go, we are in the unital, so we can generate this notion. Well, people in the Johnson of multiplicadores. A associative mention, so what we could do a multiplication, but what this comultion is always valid in the algebra of multiplicadors of 100. Yes, age of multiplicable consideration as well. If not a galaxy, it algorithms multiplicable is a algebra that contains. Algebra who continues as vilat. So, what we did is that the multiplication, tome values in the algebra of multiplicadors. We have a community and we have a antipode, and the part of regulatory in this definition is that this antipoda is invariably because it is a multiplicative. If you have a fermental, we have a joke. If you are not afraid of it, Yes, we have a unital generalist. So here immediately are the invariants. The invariants are functional linear functions, well, it is invariant invariants, invariants adorned. A invariant is a linear function, multiplicative in the corpus. Multiplicador is the corpus and the probability that verifies the casojo, in the casonitis to simplify the notation. If you have the casojo, we have the notation of sudden notes for the multiplication in the case unit that we have the invariants that in ache por uno segual ache uno por fiddle. This verify an invariant agearda because it is similar. Similar. So, what we need is invariants in non-results that are invariants are unique to the multiplication porch. I have to say that existing invariants are invariant, invariants to change. So, that quality group and the notion of duality because very important is that we have a notion of duality in this context. We have a group point of quality group, we have a notion of groups of. Algebraic group, we have a notion of group dual group that volume is a group of hierarchical groups. So, how we do the dual. Well, we have our group 2, and we have an invariant invariant, we are constructing the dual queue that the original issue, and we will give some of the functions. That functions what they can exclude. The physics is Of my group, this is a calculation of a here, and that's a description of the dual elements, if there are similar managers, and a structure of 200 groups. And we have when we are the original group, like The quantity original group: with filter dimensions. So, this is the most general context in the work. Now, we have our example: the HOF of infinite dimensions have invariant dimensions, because it is a quantity group of groups. And the group is geography where it is necessary, it is a joke and also invariant. That is the invariant. Invariant. What is the invariant in this case? The indicator of the neutron. So, with this invariant, we say that it is group quantic algebraic. And here the dual, like the dual identifier with the functions of Gesopor definitive. Support infinite. Tomamos dual que view se la functions of support infinito, y tenemos una comultiplicación. The multiplication tomos values ustamente en la alternate multiplicador desola definition of the multiplication in the mismaque, if an indicator una suma about all the elements of the group. The elements of the group group and not multiplicadors. If we have our multiplication, we have the group quantum group. And in this case, in the case of the group, and its dual queue is what we are doing a quantity of discrete group. Yes, this is a quantity of the discrete group because it suddenly. Although discrete because its duality. The infinite algorithm is the group of quantities, the compact group because they are grouped. In this case, I will show a result of induction and what is the result that we have a group, or a group calculator, not necessarily definitely, and we are grouped. The idea that If you have group subgroup, I will consider and achieve. That if the crib as it is, like group offinito, they are all the functions of ache, not yet. So, a unaccountable thing. Una de ache comodulo algebra si salgo de a una si seros de ache comodulo algebra lo que construimos es una sej comodulo algebra. If we have induced in sino de Guntrimos una serodiger, as well and how. How about, like, this is a very tensor. If you are a construction with the tensor, and what we say the city device has worked on as a coalition, but a group of quantities compact, work with the formation. So, this point is a series of modulo algebra. Y cuando la miramos como se dig modulo alfiora y cuando pasamos al dual and miramos action dual recoberamos lo que tenimos en groupos. Talque como seje, mobulo, anchira conci con la construct. In case of algebraic groups, there is a little work that reports that you have a notion precisely of this group. We have a notion precisely of their group 2 proprietary group to include actions. But what we want to contact is working all day. Mucha gracias. Gracias Xí. Bueno alguna presunta Zoom at the audience. Bueno este a la estimos velda si sela y fretamamos don semería con la siente. Y? Y verbaras con si se la mosa sí trajando en este problema que estamos aí sarando.
