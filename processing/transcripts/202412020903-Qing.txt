Very uh nice to be here. I think the lecture room is the same as before, but the uh living place is much better. So it's great to see a lot of places here met before. So I'm going to report some of my recent work with my collaborators, Sui Wong Ma at Nankai University. So we found that some So we found some potential theory approach to study conformally invariant PDEs and specifically on the estimate of the size of the singularities. So I'm going to start this. Let me recall quite very quickly that for analyst we're going to take geometry as simple as such, that take a coordinate and set the metric. Set the metric, crystal symbol, then covariant differentiation, then curvature. That's all. And then we have the medium curvature, scalar curvature, and the first equation come up is the Gaussian curvature equation in two dimension. And then for scalar curvature, we have this Bobby equation for scalar curvature. Really is that looking at the transformation of the curvature. Transformation of the curvature under the conformal change. One thing maybe special is how we're going to represent the conformal change. The exponent here sometimes different to make the equation nicer. Okay, so this is the conformal passing, and it turns out that there's high-order analog first observed by Pennice. This is the This is the R fourth order. There's a corresponding curvature, Q curvature. And in conformal geometry, similar later, you'll realize that people like to use the shortened or scotten curvature and the trace of the Scottish curvature, J, A and J. And for that, you have a curvature. And for that, you have curvature equations very resembling the Gaussian curvature and the scalar curvature. Previous page. That you have a four-dimension, you have this exponential nonlinearity. And then in dimension bigger than five, you have this very similar to scalar equation of fourth order. In fact, you can look at high orders, so-called the GJMS operators, where Operators, where most important is the conformal covariant properties for this operator, which again give us a very nice equations. And the orders or the leading orders is, if you look at the Euclidean space, exactly is the 40 Laplace. And again, the equation resembles the Gaussian curve. Resembles the Gaussian curvature and scalar curvature equation. Now, even further, if you are in the case where the manifold is conformable infinity of a Poincar√© Einstein manifold, in this case you can define through the scattering the so-called regularized scattering operator, which resembles the integral of orders. Now it's a fractional order. And you can look at the so-called non-local. You can look at the so-called non-local curvature. I put a quotation because curvature is supposed to be local. But there's quantity, and again, then you have an example of the Gaussian curvature in the case where it's odd dimension. Then this is again not the differential operator, that's a pseudo-differential operator. And then you have the resemble the Gauss, the scale-covision equations. So those including the So, those are including the GGMS operator, especially when the manifold is a conformal infinity of the Pancuri Einstein. So, we're going to consider the solution to such equation when the right-hand side can be represented as a radar measure. In the clearing space, this is the standout equation, and then in Equation and then in general manifold, you're using the regularized sketching operator, and then you have the right-hand side as a radar major. You have this. Then we call those solutions as superharmonic functions or generalized superharmonic functions. And we're going to appear to the linear potential theory, the rich potential theory to study those solutions to those equations, or superharmonic functions, which mostly going to generalize what we know about the superharmonic functions in two dimensions. Superman functions in two dimensions. It turns out to be something a little bit more complicated than you would think. But starting from the work of the in two-dimension, that we're going to focus on the Hopper theorem and the application of the supermodel functions in two-dimensional. I'll talk about it in a minute. But I want to introduce another set of equations in conformal geometry. In conformal geometry. Which is, I'm looking at the Schulten tensor, but instead, I'll call the attention to the intermediate Schulten curvature tensor, which is a combination of the Schultz curvature tensor and the scalar curvature. So lambda p is moving up between one and the infinity. It turns out it does have a L. The P Laplace equations in general dimensions. And we're going to use the conformal metric in this form. We'll find this exponent so that the equation seems simpler. And the Q, the nominality on this side, the Q, in this form. And the curvature is not a pure curvature term anymore, it's a curvature. Term anymore. It's a curvature augmented by the U, the solution U. Okay? So there's a gradient to the P minus 2 power. Then there's this intermediate Gaussian curvature, which is in the direction of the gradient of U. So that's the equation. I'll call that P Laplace equation for conformal geometry. Now, what P Laplace is defined to be divergence of. Defined to be divergence of the gradient to the p minus 2 power gradient u. So p equal to 2, it turned back to the classical Laplace. And this equation turns out to be exactly the Gauss-Covitch equation in two dimensions for p equal to 2. So in some sense, this is another generalization of the Gaussian-Covich equation in general dimension and general p. So for p ranging from 2 to n, for 2p equal to 2 is one dimension bigger than equal to 3. This exactly is the scalar curvature equation. So you see the in this affirmative curvature term when p e go 2 this term goes away and this exactly is the scalar curvature. So that's the scalar curvature equation. And then for p e go to n it turns out To n, it turns out when p equal to n, we get this intermediate scouting curvature tensor turns out to be just the Ricci curvature. So this is about the Riggy curvature and this end-up ass equation about Ricci curvature. And we have encountered that recently. So I also want to mention the situation where P ranging bigger than N. So when P bigger than N. So what P bigger than N, the curvature, this equation still stands. But the Q, this power became a negative. And this is the way to do the conformal change. Very interesting is that when you take p to infinite, you will end up with the infinite Laplace equation, where the curvature, intermediate curvature, is now simply the Schausen curvature tensor. So, these are a completely new set of equations. Of course, it appears in PE, but not in the conformal geometry in this way. There's a lot of interesting work for the P-Laplace equation and especially the L infinity, the infinity Laplace equation and application of those things. So, that's the in this case, we're going. In this case, we're going to look at the equation. Let me start with the cleaning case, which is what we call the p-superharmonic functions, which is a solution to this one mu. The right-hand side is radon major, a non-negative radar major. Then this will be called p superharmonic functions. Then potential, non-negative potential theory in DBS, and the wolf potential turns out to be very effective. Turns out to be very effective to study the p-harmonic functions, p-superharmonic functions. So we'll appeal to those non-interpotential theory. Okay, let me tell you what's the motivation for us. That really goes back to the lot of it covers the motivation for developing conformal geometry in higher dimensions. A lot of it originated from the success. It originated from the success in the two-dimensional. So we start with, of course, the uniformization approach, which first is this uniformization for closed Riemann surface. The answer is that the remote covering of any closed Riemann surface, the two-dimensional surface, is conformally equivalent to one of the three: the disk, the clean space, and the Clean space and the Riemann sphere. Well, in the geophysical geometrical approach, this can be considered as finding the conformal metric within a class that has a constant Gaussian curvature, which in the end equivalently is that we're looking for solution to the Gaussian curvature equation where the right-hand side here is a constant. You can set to be negative one. You can set to be negative 1, 0, 1. And that's sort of a PDE approach to uniformization theories in the differential geometry. One step further is the what about the open surface? So if you look at the complete surface, say open surface, and assuming that the how to classify the open surface, assuming that the negative part of the Gaussian curvature. That the negative part of the Gaussian curvature is integral. In this case, Uber showed that such open surface is always going to be just topologically, it's going to be the closed surface with finite number point removed. So that gives a very good idea of what the open surface can be. Well, analytically, really. Analytically, really is the key is to show that if you look at a domain, on any two-dimensional domain, a surface, on surface, which is there's a conformal metric, G-bar, conformal metric in two-dimension expressed in this way, geodesically complete near the singularity. In other words, if you're running into the singularity, you need an infinite length of geodesic to go there. Of geodesic gold there. And if you are assuming that the negative part of the Gaussian curvature of this conformal matrix T bar is integrable, then the singularity, the S singularity set, can only at most be finite number point. So this is the analytical, really analytical part of the Hobo theorem. Very nicely that it can be pushed to be the global result about all. Global result about open surface. So, another in high dimension, another way to generalize what successful in two dimension, of course, look at a more constraint, more restrictive class of a manifold, which is locally conformed flat. Especially those that can mostly possibly have a uniformization theorem. Uniformization theorem. Uniformization term for high dimensions in this case mostly is looking for the holonomic covering or the universal covering to be simple, to be a nice domain in the standard space SN. So let's assume we're in this situation. You have a development map and development is injective. Okay, so we're in the nice case. In this case, then In this case, then what we interest is the domain, the target or the image of the development map, which is the phi of the M2 dot n, whether it's a hormonal covering or universal covering. Then, of course, you can take the metric from Mn and goes up to the covering, then push to the image. The image that will be conformal to the standard metric on the sphere. So there is a conformal metric on the image of a development map. And then the geometrical property of the privatization assumption can be assumed on the MN, but then it goes to the image of the developed map for this conformal matrix G tuit. For this conformal matrix G tau. Okay, so one is interested in the size of the singularity, which is now can be considered as end of such image of the given map. And so the image of given a map in SN, which is the end and the singularity, is the subject we are interested in. Subject we are interested. And through this, I'd like to understand some topology of the MN where there is cover. There's covering, right? So in fact, this approach is expected to relate the curvature and topology, the amount of topology measured by homology and homotopy groups. Groups. So that's one approach which can see the impact of the PDE. Of course, in general, the PDE is available and if you have a way to handle the PDE in general domains, then you can push to the results more generally. But this setup that you can actually do the study of the PDE. Do the study of the PDE to get not more global or even topological properties of the manifold. So, those are the motivation. Another way to see the motivation is a very direct way to see how the curvature influences the topology, as we think that the more positive the curvature is, and somehow the simpler the topology or less the topology would be. Or last the topology would be. In other words, you would expect a vanishing theorem. So looking at the Bayesian numbers, this is a perfect situation. So how to measure the positivity of the curvature tensor? Well, you look at the especially two tensors that you cut at the associated cone. So that's why we introduced the cone. This first cone is the cone for the intermediate. Intermediate Sharp Scottan curvature tensor. This is the Kong for intermediate scotten curvature tensor. And then there's Kong that associated with the curvature term appears in the Brocher formula for forms on the local electron format manifold. I'll give it to you just probably the next page. Okay, so. Okay, so now very interesting to see how the comb behaves, and most consequential is the last one to see the relation between these two combs. That somehow the positivity of the intermediate scouting curvature tensor implies certain positivity of the curvature terms in the Boche formula. This is a much more direct way to see how they derive a vanishing theorem. Derive a vanishing theorem. Okay, so that's the consequence of the last relation between these two cones. So indeed, if you're assuming that the intermediate scatter tensor is non-negative, then there's a vanishing, the Bay number vanishing, or you can see the rigidity from the buffer formula. From the Bottler formula. So I'm going to mention this Bokala formula derived in the case where manifold is local formal flat. One can see the work of Kwan Pong Fi, In Tanso, and Wong Gofang in a few days. And then Naya Tani also considered this situation. But it's nice to look at this curvature tensor and relating to the rich tensor already. The rigid tensor or relating to the scouting purgatory tensor. For us, it's relating to the intermediate scouting curvature tensor. In your notation, what's AP again? AP is the, yes. Sorry, website. But it is really important, of course. It's the work what I like to call intermediators, Scott and Kuftevincer. Intermediate is Cart and Curtis Tensor. So this is scaled curve tensor and there is combination with the scale curvature. Somehow the AP or the positivity of AP reflects how possible of the Richie, how positive of the Reaching, in our view. And that's why the curvature equations are interesting. Okay, so in this case, indeed, the intermediate scale and curvature non-negative has an easy consequence, which implies vanishing of certain K numbers. Or if it's not vanishing, you would have rigidity out of it. So, as I told you, that the management. The managing theorem we'll look at investigated before, but our observation is that the intermediate Scottish curvature tensor has a more straightforward relations to the non-negativity of this curvature term in the Bogana formula for forms and forms in local recompense flat manifold. Okay, so that we consider as a Okay, so that we considered as a motivation for us just to start to see the so let me now tell you the results. Yes? Sorry, so there's no value of P for which you recover the shouting tensor, right? Well, it depends on the P is here. Then those vanishing B number depends on P. But I mean, so this intermediate shouting tensor, there's no value of P, which gets you back to the Shouten tensor. Value of p, which gets you back to the shelter sense, right? Or p got infinity. As p goes to infinity, right? Yeah, as p go to infinity, it recovers d. So for this result here, you want to restrict it to be less than n. Yes, less than n. Because decode n is already reaching. And if it reaches positive, then you have a lot, lot better understanding of local fan than where you haven't classified, it actually even classifies. So just to ask a little bit. So just right, so the the last equation, normally we file and richie, we say you can just a richie tensor. Yeah, this is a local combo flat manifold. I've been in the result at the bottom of the page, but it's also likely component flat. Yeah, simple combo flat. So that's the original curvature term. The curvature turn became much simpler. And that's the place where we see how to relate to the intermediate this cone. Mediate this cons. And then the last is relating this to cons relation. Basically, it's saying that if the AP is non-negative, it implies the curved term is non-negative. As I said, this is being investigated before, like the work in the Guan D1 and also the Net NIATENI. But our observation is Our observation is using the intermediated cutting computer is more straightforward. But mostly rely on their work to do the rest of it. Okay, so let me tell you the main results that based on these setups, you have equations whether it's a semi-linear or you have a quasi-linear case, right? Right, and in those cases, either appear to the superharmonic functions or the p-superharmonic functions. And then we study the behavior or singular behavior of those functions to derive geometrical or sometimes even topological consequences. So, this is the approach. And now, let me tell you the result. So, the first result is going back to the scalar curvature equation. Kirk equation. So now we can still conclude that the signal energy has a Holtzoff dimension less than or equal to m minus over 2, only assuming the negative part of scalar curvature is integrable in certain sense. Okay, so this is a little bit improvement of the previous work, particularly if you're assuming the scalar curvature is non-negative, of course, this condition will be satisfied and you would get this result, which no one to This result, which is known to you, which is in the work of Shonghan Yao in the late 80s, which is important work to relate the conformal geometry to PB. So we allow some negative. But if you read their work, you certainly easily be convinced that there's an alternative approach by Alternative approach by potential theory, by capacity estimate. So they're using the more direct PD estimate or in the world estimate, but certainly you can use the potential theory to do the more fine work without assuming, without appear to say, gradient estimate, which often you have to assume is some low bound on which. Okay, so this is a alternative to the T D. So now in the case we're to use the Penny's equation in high dimensions, we can have negative part of the Q curvature in some integrable then implies n minus 4 over 2. This is using the Over 2. This is using the fourth-order equation, where we're assuming this conformal metric is geodesic complete project to the singularity, and assuming the scalar curvature is non-negative. Then, if the negative part of the Q curvature somehow is good, then you can derive. If you look at the four dimensions, then this can be seen as a four-dimensional Fourth, four-dimensional analog of the Hubert theorem more directly, which assuming the q curvature negative part is integrable, really just integrable, and of course, we are assuming the completeness and the scalar curvature non-negative, then you can see the singular set at most finite point. Okay, so this is a little bit, again, a little bit improvement of the early work of Alice Paul and me. But this time it's completely. But this time it completely relies on the potential theorem. So for the P-LaPas equation, then we have a very similar work. If you're assuming conformal metric, this time using this expression here, you have this Kila-Pass equation. Assuming now is the intermediate Scouten tensor is non-transparent Mediate Scout and TensorFlow negativity, you can push to estimate the household dimension of the singular set. And then a consequence of the size of singularity, you can have vanishing of the homotopy group, or trivialization of homotopy group, which are a little different from the vanishing of PD number, of course, topologically, they are strongly related. But this time is a But this time is a route to the P-Lapse equation instead of purely Bochnato. Of course, you can use the, this is about Vici curvature and the endless pass equation. If you have assumption on the negative part of the Vicci curvature interval in this sense, then In this sense, then metric is complete, the confirmed metric is complete. This time, only assuming the scalar curve which is bounded from below, where we have some sort of a solvent, then the single set can only be finite at a point. This is a pretty strong analog of the Hobo theorem in high dimension. This time it's assuming some Ricci, the negative number. The Ricci, the negative, the negative part of Ricci somehow is integrable. Okay, and just show you the end-lapse equation here. The curvature term here is the V chi in the gradient u direction and then multiply with the gradient u to p minus 2, the n minus 2 in this case. So those are the results. Now let me introduce the potential theory and the Introduce the potential theory and then sketch a proof of the Huber theorem to tell you how we can take advantage of the knowledge from the potential theory applied to the geometrical setups. If you look into potential theory and the development of potential theory, you should realize that the potential theory can be developed on the matrix space. On the matrix space, not more general, whether it's linear or non-linear. So, there, of course, in other words, you don't have to look at the remaining geometry. You can look at other geometries which provide or induce this metric space where potential theory can be used. But potential theory mostly is a stock. As a story and analysis side. And on the geometrical side, there's a different, and then people need to push to relating the geometry and analysis to have this work carried out. Okay, so let me tell you the story about the potential theory and very briefly. So, first for risk potential, simply, I'm going to do it on a clean space, but you can do it, as I said, you can do it. Clean space, but you can do, as I said, you can do that on metric space either. So, a certain metric space. You can just, this, of course, this kernel comes out as green function. Okay? And then in the two dimensions, the log terms. You like to do it in a way that is scaling nicely. So that's why you put the D here is the size of the domain. So once you have So once you have a potential, then you define capacity, capacity from the potential. So capacity defined to be the, this is one way to define, there's an alternative way, and there's a dual theorem. So there's a full story about the potential theory, but I'm going to just do the one side. Simply take the capacity as the minimum total charge. I can say that way. Can say that way, assuming that this distribution of charge button major generates a potential at least one on the given set E. So indeed capacity is coming from the physics or can be put in the physics context. But purely mathematics at this point. So this is capacity. So, this is capacity of set E in a given set omega. And we like to do this way because that gives us an opportunity to look at things locally within the omega. So, once you have the capacity, you can look at the capacity, propitive capacities. It's confusing with the terminology, but I With the terminology, but I guess the way you can say that is capacity is usually at least auto-measure. If we learn the measure theory, it's at least auto-measure. Auto-measure means that monotonicity and the countable subjectivity. Okay, once you have auto-measure, you can make a measure out of it, but then you have to only define on the measurable set. Measurable set. Those terminology can only be different for the potential theory, but it can be put in the more general major theoretical language. So other property is coming from the kernel and the way we define the potential. Once you have the scanning property for the potential, then you have scanning property for the capacity. So, another very important factor is that the so-called contractive property is that if you have a contracted mapping phi from omega to omega, then the image can only have a smaller or not going to be bigger capacity. If you condense, if you contract. So, for example, if you have a ball, a sphere in the ball, and then you project. In the ball, and then you project everything exterior to the sphere onto the sphere. So that's a contractor mapping. Then the capacity for the projection to the sphere is not going to be bigger than the capacity in this region between the sphere and the ball. That's the way we're going to use it. So we all know that. We all know that harmonic analysis, one of the characters of harmonic analysis is to look at this so-called dyadic annulus. So we decompose the domain into dyadic analysts and study properties if we know somehow the scanning is very important. So that's the idea of that. So therefore, let's define what. Define what is a thing set. Something is small, electrical to the certain singular operator, singular in goal operator for harmonic analysis. So it's really, if you look at the set E, restrict to this annuli, which the little omega stands for the little one, and the capital. The little one and the capital bigger stand for the bigger one. Okay, but this all generates the dyadic animal to decompose the domain. So if you look at the capacity of the E inside this little one relative to the big one, normalized, right, this is just normalization divided by what's the standard one means normalization. What the standard one means normalization. And if this summation is finite, which means that when the set goes to closer, closer to a given point, then the E seems to be smaller, smaller in some sense, or better theoretical sense, or capacity sense. Okay, so that's the E, that's the thing. And in the end dimension, so when alpha equals Sorry, when alpha equals n, then the capacity is scale invariant. Therefore, you don't have the normalization. But this i became extra factor to make this small. Okay. So it's quite complicated notation, but it really is the anuli and the dyadic anuli. And the dyadic analyte and decomposition of domain. Okay, so one thing this is true for remaining geometry or for Euclidean space, you can observe very easily, I mean that very easily, is that if you have a Euclidean space, a point, E, a subset E, is alpha thing at the point P, then there always is an array from P avoiding this E set E. Avoiding this set E. So you have a point and some subset. Somehow there's always a point really avoiding the subset if the subset, of course subset can be everywhere, but you can always avoid the subset if the subsets are for thing. You get the ring. Okay, this is a pretty easy consequence of. Pretty easy consequence of the fact that the capacity of a sphere inside a ball is positive. And the capacity has this contractive properties. That if you can project everything down to a sphere, first you can pull this subset all to the outside by scanning properties, then project to the sphere, then use the counterpart. Then use the countable subjectivity plus the fact that this is positive. But this summation, when it's thin, summation is small, so you can look at it closer and closer to the point. So therefore, there always ray that escapes thing set. This turns out to be the opportunity to use the geodesic completeness and analysis of the solution, analysis of the Solution analysis of the superharmonic functions, the singularity of superharmonic functions. Okay, so let me, for example, we're going to just first prove the result on the potential, then use the potential to represent the solution or to describe the solution. So, more theoretical is to do this for the potential. So, assuming you have a risk potential, then for the p. for the p, for the alpha that not n, so that's the n, then you are in the usual, the kernel is a spring function, and in the case where it's n, then your kernel is becomes log terms. In either case, that if the if we want to study the singular behavior of the potential, Compared to the kernel function or green function or kernel. It's comparable, okay, but away from a thing set. And this ratio turns out to be the point charge, a point measure of given runaway measure at this point. Okay? So this may be considered. This may be considered or, yeah, you can interpret as somehow at least the potential is asymmetrically symmetric. In a sense, video is symmetric, because kernel is a video function. Okay? And that's the highest order singularity you can observe. And now, let me give you a very quick proof. So you can understand why. Can understand why in harmonic analysis approach, the concept of thing comes up. So, the proof, of course, is to look at the potential, which has, I'm going to do it in case N, so I can easily explain. So, in the case where this is integral, potential, right? So, separate this integral in three parts. One is not much relevant, so outside a given. Outside a given size of a ball, of course, size can be chosen, should be chosen. The second part is away from smaller ball, but within the annuli. Within the annuli, capital omega. And the last one, last one, of course, is in within the annulus. So the decomposition domain into three parts. Into three parts. You can easily imagine that this part is easy. And this part somehow also not too difficult to manage. And this is the part where we need to use the thinness. Let me tell you. So the first is easy. The second term is going to be separate in two parts. Separate in two parts. One is away from a ball, with maybe a little bit subtle, the size can be a little bit relevant. Or in a very small ball. So the last small ball, that's away from this any line, right? So in a small and all outside and bigger. But still within the gibbet size. And then for the very small one, the dominant will be the point charge. Will be the point charge. That's why you see this point charge here. And this one is still not much relevant. Okay, so really is the difficulty part. Within this annual line, for each given point x, so given point x, I know where I look at. Within the anti-line, it turns out the approach is to go the other way around. It's to find where you don't get the result. Don't get the result. What do you mean, don't get a result? Well, if you don't get a result, is that somehow the potential compared to the kernel is relatively large. Okay, so if you now that then this log term here, log term, the kernel function really relates to the I. That's related to where the x is sitting, when the x is sitting in that annual. Be exceeding in that any line, then that's approximately is I. So now let's look at the capacity of this tool called the back set. It turns out exactly measured by the measure of the omega, capital omega, the ring, this only line, divided by the lambda i, the choice of the lambda i. By the way, lambda i is big, it means relatively big. It means it doesn't go to zero as we want, but still can be choosing to go to zero. Oh, it goes to infinity. Depends on the choice of lambda i here. Anyway, it's not as we want it to be, goes to zero as fast as we want. Okay. So then you look at the union of those best set. And you look at the in the n R5 n case, you want to look at the summation of these terms. Summation of these terms. It turns out to be summation of the measure of the ring divided by lambda i. But the summation of the measure of the ring is finite because the radon measure, right, radon measure is a total finite or locally finite, whichever way you want. So the measure is finite, summation, because the overlapping is just a given multiple. Given multiples, right? Three times or four times or whatever, given numbers. So this is finite. Then there's a very nice calculus result proof in the early days is that when you have an infinite series which is convergent, you can always divide something close to zero. Something goes to zero, still finite, the summation. So, this actually is quite big in the development of mathematics. That is to say, somehow infinitesimal small is not measurable. This is a big, big issue in the history of the development of calculus. In terms of a precise result, is that if you have an infinite series which is summable, which is convergent, then you can always Then you can always multiply something, goes to infinite. Then the term still converges. So that's the place to give us the lambda i, that lambda i we can use so that this summation is still finite. So in other words, what we prove that is the best set we collected turns out to be thing. And if it is a thing, if it is thing, then we have proved that its result that It's a result that out of a thin set, this is true. Okay, really, it's a pretty standard harmonic analysis based on the concept of thinness. So the very similar work can be carried out for the non-linear potential theory, where instead of a resist potential, look at the walk potential. What's the walk potential related to the peak? Related to the P subhamma function is to this way, not now not exactly linear anymore, so it's non-linear. Therefore, what you do is use the walk potential to squeeze in for the solution to the cross-linear equation. And of course, you have to know some information about the solution. In any case, this turns out to be enough to carry out what we did for the linear potential function. And you can do similar things using. And you can do similar things. You start with the behavior of the potential, then push that into the solution. So, let me quickly give you the proof of the Hover theorem in this approach. So, you have a sense that how do we put everything together as I already told you? So, you have the Gaussian curvature equation, subsets away from singular set. And first, you want to show that the non-negative part of the Gaussian curvature is integral. Curvature is integral actually implies the curvature is in the global. This is very big in the development of Hobo theorem because this implies somehow open surface has a finite topology. So that's very big. But there's very much analytical proof, some integral by positive estimate. The third step is to actually show that the right-hand side is actually Actually, not singular, not too singular in the sense that it can be proved to be a radar measure. Now, when you put this radar measure, it's not just on the equation on the, away from the singular set, it's equation on the whole meter. So that already includes the similarities. The similarity, this step is saying the similarities is a little bit mild that potential authority can cover. So, not a trivial thing. So, not a trivial step. Now, once you have this, then you can look at the comparison to potential. Okay, so away from addition to harmonic functions, then it's mostly potential. This is because the equation is linear. So, therefore, we are only interested in the behavior of potential. Then, you can apply this. So, the comparison of the potential to the kernel green function. Kernel green function is comparable by the point measure. And then you can calculate, right? Once you know the solution is multiple over log, then you look at the metric, which is exponential to conformal to the metric. Really is distant to zero to some power. And that power has to be some given numbers in order for this. Given numbers in order for this to be complete, in order for the conformal factor along a straight line to be infinite. Okay, so that's why the point measure has to have a lower bound. Now, once you have point measure and lower bound, of course, your singular set can only be finite. So that's the way to show the Hopper theorem. Okay. Okay, so let me mention that. Okay, so let me mention that to estimate the host of dimension, we're using a generalized, I said is a generalized Lebigothera. It's saying that if you look at the best set where the measure of the ball divided by the videos is somehow infinite. Okay, for example, when D is N, the measure of the ball divided by the uh including nature of the ball. Euclidian nature of the ball. If it's infinite, then we say the subset, the set, this probably has to be the bigger zero nature, right? So this is generalized to this case. And so if this is a D, then the D host of nature of this bad set has zero. So this gives us the choice of a point on a single set where the round of blooddown measure has limited behavior. The behavior controlled by the radio to the power, which can improve our potential estimate. The potential is estimated by this power for the alpha away from the thing set. And this gives us opportunity to measure using the geodesic completeness to measure, to get contradiction if alpha is not correct. Not correct. That's the estimate of the host of dimension. And this is a non-linear version. And that's the end of my story. Before we do questions, we'll turn off the recording so you can ask.
