Oh yeah yeah, so it's on the point. Yeah, so I guess Alibia used kind of old version of schedule, and so the title of my parallel is slightly different. So I want to talk about neural symmetry and perlinear structures. Structures. So this is something which lives on the intersection of number theory and enumerative geometry. So I'm not really sure how much it's related to Hughes bunches and stuff. But I don't know really much about numerative geometry and I know next to nothing about number theory. So for me, it was the best way to learn something about it is to somehow do something. Something about it is to somehow do something on the intersection. So my talk is going to be kind of elementary, and so probably it will be quite easy to follow. Well, let me start with the following motivation, at least it was motivation for me. So there is an object which is called the cluster massum. So it's the following thing. So close Hermann sum. So it's the following thing. So here Z is going to be an element in the finite field, defined as follows. So it's a sum over n tuples, x1, plata part, xn of elements in this finite field. finite field opponent to pi pi over p and then here you have the following superpotential normal so it's a a very simple object, right? So it's a finite sum of uh elements. Each of these elements is a piece root of unity. P is root of unity. And in principle, you can modify this sum. I guess it's called closed terminal sum when m is equal to 1 in this picture. For general n, it's called hyper closed terminal sum. And in general, you can work with any finite field. So you can substitute this guy by FQ. Well, Q is some power of the prime E. In this case, The prime u. In this case, let me call this some ks. And then the formula remains the same, and you just need to introduce here trace. So trace is a map from FQ to F. So it's always a sum which consists of finitely many elements, in principle, very simple object. When appears, and so this object is. When it appears, and so this object is more than one hundred years old. It first appeared, I guess, in the work of Juan Carrera. And then many mathematicians studied this sum, including Grail, indeed. And I don't know much about number theory, but this object is important when you study things like the distribution of prime numbers. For instance, you want to know an estimate of this complex number, right? So this sum is a. Complex number, right? So this sum is a sum of complex numbers of unity, and you want to estimate its absolute value. This is something important. So let me hold the result of the Lin. So x i's are non-zero. But what? x i's are non-zero. Right, so uh thank you. Runs over non-zero elements. So Ethereum is due to the V of the I guess it's 1975, if I'm not mistaken. And it was proven. So he developed some techniques of a lattic shift, so some pretty advanced technology. And with that, he proved the following result. So maybe the absolute value of this water. The absolute value of this qualitative sum has the following estimate. So roughly speaking, it means that this is the square root of the number of terms in this sum. So which means that there's some kind of root. A lot of cancellation happens in this sum. Which is maybe not surprising. Which was maybe not surprising. Uh second thing is uh the following. So there exists maybe maybe I'll say it this way. There exist algebraic numbers alpha 1, alpha 0, alpha n. And when I say algebraic numbers, I mean they are roots of They are roots of harmonic polynomial with integer coefficients, right? So, algebraic numbers in terms of numbers easily such that the cluster on sum is equal to alpha 0 plus alpha n. Well, of course, those numbers are the choice of z. And if you study this more general closed-term and sum, so when we do a summation over the field of q. Over the field of Q elements, right? So Q is the S powers of Q. The formula remains the same, but it's just write every number in the power S. And here these algebraic numbers have the sol have the following the ideal relations. So by a V P I mean the idea correlation. I mean p-adic correlation, so alpha 0 is equal to 0, and so on, v e of alpha i is equal to i. So p-adic valuation means the following. If you think about these numbers as p-adic numbers, right, so every p-adic number is a power series in this prime p, it means that this power series in p starts with r. So. So roughly speaking this means that alpha i more p to the power horizon gives you think about them as theoretical. And so this together imply this estimate. So yeah, so what what you suppose to see from here, let's see alpha n. So what you're supposed to see from here is a cohomology of Em. So what I'm going to say is that the number of alpha i's with evaluation media alpha i's with evaluation alpha i is equal to q Alpha i is equal to k. So, if you look at the size of this set, well, in this example, it's trivial. You have one alpha i in each variation. It's going to be a cognology dimension of a cognology 2k of x, and x is so but in general, I I mean, we will have a picture which is kind of gonna work for us but really kind of work for us with really variety, but this is just stages. And so what this means, what this formula means is that this loss-term sum, you should think about it as some matrix of dimension n by m, right? So there exists some matrix with eigenvalues alpha, zero, alpha. Values alpha 0, alpha y, alpha n. And this Glostermann sum is phase of S powers. So there exists some natural operator which acts in the cogamology of this space and the Gostermann sum computes as traces of powers of this matrix. So it's going to be like a Flavinian structure in B. Is that clear? So why this object was interesting to me? Because if you ever studied quantum cognitive, you should immediately recognize that this is a neural integral for the quantum coherency of Em. So it's kind of a finite version of this neural integral. And so let me just quickly remind you. So let me let me just briefly remind this. So quantum topomology of En, so I have X, which is Pm. And then quantum tochomology is controlled by quantum connection. So it's a connection on H2X, which with trivial fibers used by alternative X. So we have a So we have a trivial connection. So we have this trivial bundle over H2. There is a connection here. And well, so what is the epidemology of X? Well, everybody knows that this is generated by a single element with one relation. So you have basis, basis of H Basis of h star x, which is given by 1, c data dot c to the power n. So if you look at this basis and cognitive, you can write the quantum connection very explicitly. So this guy is just C. I put some coordinate here. Let's call this coordinate Z on H2. And then this quantum connection looks like Z over D plus sine. Thus, some explicit matrix, and then this basis, this matrix looks like 0, 0, 0, 0, then 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. So it's kind of a Jordan block. And then there is also one element, which is right in the column. And all other matrix elements, I assume. So the point is that when C is equal to zero, right, so this is just the multiplication, classical multiplication by C in this basis. I see in this basis. And when you do a quantum cardiology, there is some kind of deformation. So this is a deformation for anything. Usually it's called Q, but since I already have Q, I will call it C. So this is an operator of quantum multiplication by this point. Well, and if you have a connection like that, right? So you're interested in flat sections of this connection. So you have different. Of this connection. So we have differential equation of rank n and order one. This is equivalent to differential equation for the second module part. What is that? The one over z or one over z? Uh because because this important part is uh I think the second of the I think the second order or so first of all you have z times e over dz yeah for connections you really want that I forgot I I need to check I need to check here but this would be because of like a hyperplay class not from the top of my head it looks like this in that case but this is for the hyperplane class so that look like that's not the thing that's kind of the beautification I didn't check I didn't check, but from the top of my head it looks like this. Uh so uh you may so we have differential equation of r of order one with run ham, but you can rewrite it as some differential operator of order n, let's call it d and some functions of z is equal to zero. And so in this case, this differential operator, again, if I'm not mistaken, took some kind of d over dz. To the power n plus z. Right, so for n is equal to 2, when n is equal to 2, you just get the best equation. That's a very classical object. And then the solutions of these equations, right? So you may look for solutions in power series. So you may think about the size of power series. It's called i function, j function. And the coefficients of this power series, they compute the number of goes. Series, they compute the number of curves in P, and so they have a numerative meaning. And well, the mirror symmetry says, what is the mirror symmetry? The mirror symmetry says that the solution of this equation have a nice integral representation. So I, so let me write integral. So I looks like an integral, there's some mirror variety. And for Bm, the integral looks like Again, the integral looks like p to the power exactly same superpotential we have. So it looks exactly exactly like like this. Well, um Well, okay, so what is this neighbor in the case of Tm? Well, this is just C star to the power of n. So you can choose some contour, half-dimensional contour here, and you integrate over that. By choosing different contours, you can start whole solutions of this construct. Alright, so yeah, there is this analogy. So for what I'm going to do in the future, sometimes it will be important to introduce Sometimes it will be important to introduce equivalent to domination. So I want to do, I want to think about my Pm, right, as P of some vector space. And on here I will have an action of a torus, C star to the power n, which kind of scales the coordinates. So you choose some bases here, you have some torus which scales coordinate here, and it scales them with four characters which you call A. These four characters which you call a1, a n. And then you do curve counting equidact. So everything remains the same. There will be some differential equation, but the coefficients of this power series will depend on the sequerent parameters. Well, basically, the answer is that how you define this integral representation, you will produce here you think like x1 to the power 1, xn to the power of 1. Example for solutions in general. So sometimes it will be all right. So this was the motivation. And then there's a very nice source of, I would say, there's a very nice set of varieties which have. Set of varieties which have a nice quantum coherency and interesting quantum differential equations. They call quiver varieties, micajima quiver varieties. So basically the quantum cognomy of these varieties is extremely rich object. So quantum cognomology of micajima varieties are controlled by representation theory of some quantum groups. So this was some ideas developed by Mikrasa Proshapashvili and then further developed by. And then further developed by Atempoff and Marie. So basically, they're very rich and beautiful. And so, like, this type of integral representations, they have full analogs of this integral representation. They come from representations in the epsilon. So, alpha mechanism. So for example, what is an ecogene variety simple star? It's the star. So they always symplectic varieties, and you may think about in some sense as deformation of this story, right? And so when you do quantum costomology of Makajima varieties, it's very important to have some extra equivariant parameters. Equivarial parameter, so there is always some extra action of the pose. In this case, it acts on this phase by scaling at anging directions. So there is a extra toros C star, I'm gonna call the equivariant parameter of this torus H bar and it will be important that it we always have this uh this time. We always have this done. So, in general, Mecogeno varieties, they are examples of symplectic resolutions, and for symplectic resolutions, you always have to section. And so, say what would be the analog of the integral representation of this integral for G star Pm? So I also have the same formula. So let me call it IZ as well. Call it IZ as well. And the difference is that it looks like this. So there is also the same terms which corresponds to equivalent parameters of action on Bn. So it's a unique thing. And then instead of this exponential, I would have the following formula. X1 minus X2 to the power minus I equal to Xn minus 1. x n minus 1 minus xm and xn minus n. So this kind of representations for solutions of quantum differential equations for Lekajima varieties are very well known. So basically if you give me an Likajima variety, not that simple, but hardly, I can write an integral like that, which is going to solve quantum differential equations for this variety. With this variant. And the reason is that, well, in this case, they are always examples of QPZ equations. So for instance, this is a QPZ equation. This is a solution of QPZ equation for SLL. So this example is SLL. So somehow let me square. And for this equation, there is a For this equation, there is a well-developed theory of integral representations for solutions. And again, so if you look at this guy, there is an arithmetic, an analog of this thing, right? So what would be the analog of closed-term sum in this case? Well, exponent here is an example of additive character, right? And here I have a product of powers. So sending an element to the power is an example of multiplicative character. So the closed-urban sum, so to say, will be a sum, again, over tuples f star to the power n. So let me call this whole thing f x. f x. In the theory of integral solutions, it's usually called Meister functions in the theory of Hippy's equations. And so you choose any multiplicative character, chi, and evaluate this thing as the biggest sum. So chi is multiplicative character. Yep. Which confused by one thing? I thought the For one thing, I thought that the quantum differential equation was this Trig Casimir equation. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, this is an equation for this case for Jangian. I also think about Jungian as some kind of quantum. So, I'm not using the terminal knowledge one has at present. But this is an equation for Juncker. So, it's a differential thing and not the difference. So, the one which we That's the one which is a differential in Kayla parameters and difference in it. Alright, and this object has exactly the same properties as the object I started. So I said that there is this theorem of Believe, which says that these kind of guys are sums of powers of some algebraic elements. The same thing holds here. You can find some algebraic elements and the powers, sum of powers. Elements and the powers, sum of powers of these algebraic elements will conclude this case. So, this is a full analogy. And so, the volume is. H is an integer for. So, what is h? It's a good question. So, in general, it's going to be a rational numbers, a rational number with some properties. That shouldn't be defined. You will see. So, let me move on from this point and you will see what exactly. When I do the integral solutions, he doesn't really matter. He is just a form of parenting. But when we switch, it will be a form. Okay, so the point is that how would we define and construct such objects, such sum, and reapprove maybe the Lean theorems using the quantum cognition. Theorems using the quantum cognomen. So, presumably, this analogy extends to all Mecca German varieties, and using some ideas from mirror symmetry, we can try to prove our Green theorem in a different way. So, I guess there is analytic theory of p-adic differential equations, which are not very well known. It's developed by Dwork many years ago. Developed by Dwork many years ago, but somehow papers of Dworks are unreadable. And so a lot of parts of the theory of B differential equations are not quite known, really deep. So I'm going to follow kind of these ideas here. So the point is that we're going to be able to do this. So the uh the point is that uh we can study uh differential equations like this, uh which appear from mirror symmetry over p-iadic fields. So the parameters of our differential equations, these equivalent parameters, will leave will be will be some p-adic numbers. And when you do that, you have a lot of new structures which appear in these differential equations like that. And most important Equations like that. And most important structure is Frebenium structure. So I want to explain what is that. And then somehow this estimates for the post-Terman sample follows from existence of this fabric. Okay, so let me say what is the Radinius syncopiner. So a Fradinius syncopfinder So if we're being a single finder between connections and so you should think about this as quantum connections, which depends on some parameters. So in this quantum cognitive story, A. This quantum cogeemology story A are the equivalent parameters, and Z is these parameters in which we have differential equations. So is an isomorphism in the following thing. So you look at the connection where you raise the quantum parameters to some power p. P is the prime number. Here is only Number. Here isomorphism is a circuit function. And most important, which is the ideal bound. So there is some kind of black box here, so I will explain in a second what it means, but this is the most important. Basically, you wanna have a a gauge transformation which identifies one connection with another, which is which converges very, very fast and that makes sense. So if this is one, two, if a is equal to a prime, right, so original, so this ephrogenous substitution maps your connection back to itself. Just equality, it means, well, equivalence means gauge. Gauge consumption. So, in a second, I'll explain what it means more precisely. Yeah, and so in this case, it's called Frabenius optometries. And then, the whole question is that those Frabenius optometries exist sometimes for some choices of these parameters. There it is. Okay, so now. Okay, so now in simple language, what it means, what this means, the gauge equivalence like that. Well, suppose we have two matrices of fundamental solutions. So these are the fundamental solutions of this differential equation. Of these differential equations for these parameters A and A prime. Then what is the Frebenius intertwiner? So it's basically a matrix. So you suppose you solve your differential equation in some basis, and in the model, in this basis, you find some fundamental solution matrices. Matrices and then our Ragina symbol pressure is described by a matrix of gauge transformation which does the following. Psi A prime z lambda is equal to u z psi a z prime. So what is lambda? Lambda is a constant mass. These coefficients in paradigms. So, in language, what it means? It means that this matrix U identifies fundamental solution like this with original fundamental solution up to a possible change of basis in the moment. So, this matrix you should think about it as a possible change of basis. So, the boundedness, what the boundedness is? What the boundedness means? So I said that this is the most important part. The bounded, so you call this inbounded if u c mod e to the power n is a rational or any so this last equation is exactly the same. So, this last equation is extremely strong. So, if I mean, if you haven't seen it, it's kind of maybe looking strange, but it's extremely strong. And if Rabinius transformation exists, it is completely fixed by this problem. Maybe it's a good point for somehow say a few words on how you would. On how would you discover Frabenio structure, say, using a computer. So, if you like to play this computer and do experiments, so the way I do it, you can discover Frabenio structure as follows using this property. So, suppose you ask your computer, so for instance, for Pn, right? So, I write differential equation for Pn very explicitly. So, on the computer, you can write. Explicitly. So, on the computer, you can write solutions, this fundamental solution as a power series in Z, say very, very far, up to a degree like 100, like 1000 in Z. So, you have another solution. Then, what you do is the following. So, what is the matrix U? So, you have this fundamental solution, you have that fundamental solution, you can express matrix Z out of them. So, then matrix U is a Matrix U is equal to psi z a I call the prime z prime z lambda psi a z to the power b inverse. So this is a power series which you know experimentally very very fast power series in z. This is another very power series in z which you know very very far. And you look for some constant matrix. Let's say this is some pianic elements RJ. some paid elements I j of the form C0 plus C1E plus CC code squared and so on. There's some chaotic expansion. So we assume that it's a paid number. There's some expansion. Alright, so this condition requires that module any p, this matrix is rational. Well what you do is well you say like p is equal to 13, you fix some prime number. Then we substitute number with a non- Then we substitute number with unknown coefficients and ask when is this matrix mod P is rational. So you try C0 to V1, or like Z, doesn't work. You try C0 to be one, doesn't work. C2, doesn't work. But then at some point, some miracle happens. Say when when you try C0 is equal to three, then some miracle happen. Some miracle happened. This power series has a lot of cancellation on that, and you actually have an expansion of the Russian function. Okay, so you have three here. Then you do C squared. Sorry, P squared. So modulo P squared, you look at the second coefficients. And you play the same game again. 0, 2 doesn't work, 3 doesn't work. And then maybe at 4, some miracle happens. But you need to do it with every metric. You need to do it with every matrix. That's what it is. This has C2I actually, of course. Somehow you can use a computer to discover these things. And the miracle is that they unique. So if they exist, they are miraculously determined in a unique way by this property. Well? So this is what I'm doing. So, this is what I did. So, this is how I experimented with that. And I tried to take a Mechadimo variety, some non-trivial mechanism variety, like T star dress main, for instance, and try actually to do the same thing, to do a diademic expansion of this matrix elements. I did it far away, you know, for relatively high degree of P, and then I tried to guess what is this expansion, what is this expansion. Can I say something about that? Can I say something about it? So let me give you a conjecture. So I don't know how to prove it, but again, this is kind of the experimental thing which works. And it works in many, many examples. So I basically have no doubt that this is correct. Let me give you the answer for this target as me. Sorry, why do you want this from Venus Interspiner? Why do you want this from Venus Interspin? Oh, yeah, because in the end I'm going to relate them to this. I'm going to relate them to these clusterman sums and extract the properties of these clusterman sums. So basically clusterman sums will be the traces of this matrix traces of our sort of examples. Alright, so let's take a Alright, so let's take maybe simplest non-trivial mechanical II, which is to start Grasmanium. This means it's relatively easy to experiment. So you discover the following Fredinian structure. So let me maybe call it conjecture one. So So it's probably not in the most general form, but at least this is the way those revenue structures I see so far. So let P a prime number of the following form P is equal to Q L plus 1. Sorry, this Q appears. This Q appears not the queue we have at the beginning, so Q and L are some unnatural numbers here. Then let delta A C be a quantum connection of X star resmain here. Right, so A is going to be equivariant parameters of some n-dimensional torus, which acts here, n-dimensional space. So it acts on n-dimensional space by scaling coordinates. You have an induced action on the on the Gasmanian. And then we have extra equivalent parameters, again which I call h-bar. This parameter which scales the catangent. The Katangian function. So now we want to specialize all these parameters to some rational numbers. So one h is of the form r over q. So i is equal to 1 up to q minus 1. And second, accurate parameters a i, you want to choose them any rush. Any rational number which is paddedly integer, so the denominators are not divisible by p, such that minus a i belongs to z. There are a lot of such. Then there exists a fabulous intercliner. Travinuous interpoiner between connections A Z and delta A prime Z where A prime I is equal to P eta and H And h prime bar is equal to h bar. So you don't do you're not doing anything with each part, but you impose some conditions on it. So the amazing thing is that, as I said, you can discover this matrix by looking at its EID expansion. And in this geometric setting, you can really tell what this matrix is. You can give an explanation. You can give an explicit exact formula for this matrix. So this lambda given by multiplication by some cosmology plus, which I call, let me call it gamma v 1 minus h bar. So let's play one of the middles v in In cogamology of your. So, this is going to be some cogomology class. You look at an operator which is given by multiplication by a cogamology class in any basis in cognition. It will be some matrix. And the claim is that this is this matrix one. So the last claim is that to the power of p on one of those? That's the power of P on one of those? Ah, so I I defined an interplane from here to here when you're raising. Like in particular, if all equivalent parameters Ai, if A is just zero, consider this non-equivariant situation, so to say, then this is Frebenius Aftermath. So your equation have this symmetry which says that when you raise it when you raise z to the power of p, you get the same equation. So what is my annotation here? I guess I need to explain what gamma plus is. So what is gamma? So first of all, let me recall that there is a thing which is called parima. There is a thing which is called Maurita gamma function. This is analog of gamma function for p-iadic fields. So it's defined as focus. If x is integer, it is defined as a product minus 1 to the power x. Then the product over all numbers lie between 0 and x I guess up to up to And uh such that p is not divisi pi is not divisible by uh by right so for any integer you have just uh this number and in pietic situation you know every pietic number can be approximated with infinite precision by by an integer. So this thing analytically continues This thing analytically continues and give you a word in point of magnitude function of Marita gamma function. And then if you look at the logarithm of the Marita gamma function, then it has the following expansion in the neighborhood of zero. So let me call this expansion from one to infinity with some coefficient mt, x to the power t. These coefficients are also interesting, I guess. Interesting, I guess, when d's are bigger than one, this is just minus the addicted zeta function of d divided by t bigger. Alright, so this expansion is some expansion with connotations given by zeta functions, PID versions of that. And then That. And then I need them to cook up an equivalent economology class. So let me do the following. Suppose V is a vector one on X, then let's say you look at its churn vector. So by definition, this is an expansion of the following in its churn roots. So X1, XN are the churn roots of this. Excellent the churn roots of this bundle. So you call expansion on this churn roots, or what's that? Let's call them C H M X critical this are some So, these are some cognology classes defined. So, this is just some topological characteristic classes determined by the bundle, the union cognology. And from that, you compute, you just use this expansion of Marita-Gamma function to define the following log p of a vector bundle, log log, my ritagamma function of a vector bundle. I'm going to define them as a power series with the same coefficients raised to the power. Raised to the power zero this efficiency in the columns and then from here formally by exponentiating we define gamma plus really function. Alright, so that's the definition. Alright, so that's the definition. This gives you some classic gamology. So, what are you summing over? I mean, is there a relationship between M and D? Yeah. Okay. Right, and yeah, so this explains this thing, except what is this P? P is the polarization. P is a polarization. P is a polarization. So what is P? Well, for Nakajima varieties, there is this thing which is called polarization. This is canonical choice of one half of a tangent space. So P is the property that P plus P star is too is equal to the tangent space of x. And for the for G star Grasmanian, well we can we can write a simple formula with it. So for G star Grasmanian, E is equal to Gasmanian E is equal to, let me call it W, it's going to be trivial n-dimensional vector bundle on Gasmanian tensor V. V is going to be k-dimensional topological bundle on Gasmanian. So on Casmanian, there is this topological k-dimensional bundle minus V star V. So if you're familiar with representations of So if you're familiar with representations of quiver varieties, so this target Grasmanian corresponds to that frame quiver. So here we have Cm, so here we have CK, here we have an arrow. So the terms of this guy always corresponds to arrows. So this term corresponds to this arrow here. This term corresponds to the vertex. So you can look at this class for every indication, right? Basically that's the answer and it's checked. Basically that's the answer and it's checked very far away and I know that this answer is correct. So basically the nice feature of this answer, I guess I really don't have time to explain that, but the nice feature of this answer is the following. It kind of works both equivalently and non-equally. Equivalently means that if AIs are all That if A i's are all different, they're not the same, they're distinct, then this gamma class, well, it's given very explicitly as a diagonal matrix in the basis of fixed points in equal tomology, whose matrix elements are some explicit products of Marita-Gamma functions. Very explicit, just diagonal matrix. If all Ai are equal to zero, meaning that you can see they're non-equivalent in phidomology, well, Equivalent cognomology, well, then multiplication by this logarithm class is, you know, in non-equivalent cogamology, multiplication by any class is just important. This is just a finite sum. And so it gives you some, in any basis you choose on cognitive, it gives you some very explicit matrix with coefficients given by pietic zeta functions. And so the point is that we can We covered basically all known results about hypergeometric functions. So, hypergeometric functions, this is the case T star, yeah. So, if you look at the quantum differential equations for this guy, you recover some of generalized hypergymetic equations. So, we recover known results for the existence of a B structure for these equations for this answer actually. For this answer actually works just for Pm. So my second conjecture, which I don't have time to explain, says that exactly the same thing works for Pm, not this target meaning, just for this meaning, when you forget about this H mark. Same formula works and you recover known results about existence of a view structure for Bessel functions for bes uh for Bessel equations. For Bessel equations. So let me do one example, just to what is Mika here. In a good example of x is equal to England. So this is the clusterman equation from which I started, right? So again, the topology of this guy is just q c of modulus c n plus 1. And so I have a basis. And so I have a basis C R1 C dot C to the power F. And then if you follow that definitions, again, this is not the star, I'm a congeneral idea, but the conjecture I write just remains the same when you get rid of h gamma total in the gamma class, which I definitely. So basically, if you look at this log gamma function p of function p of polarization. In this case it looks as follows. So this is n mu 1 plus n mu 2 c squared. This is finite sum, right just because I have the relation. And so the last one is n and c that's going to be a definition of this gamma class. That's going to be a definition of this gamma class in this case. And the coefficients are, again, this mu are novice obset function. So explicitly, the matrix of log p of log, it acts in this basis as the following matrix. So it's an important thing. So it's a matrix 0, 0, 0, 0. 0 here, we have mu 1, mu lamb. On the second diagram we have mu two. Second diagonal we have two, then we end somewhere here. Then, exponent of this matrix gives you a matrix lambda, which you need to construct for universal. Matrix lambda is just exponent. So, exponentiation here is just, you know, because everything is important, exponent is just finitely many terms. And you compute some explicit. And you compute some explicit matrix, and the matrix coefficients of that matrix are some combinations of these zeta functions. And it works, right? So it gives you the Frobenius structure you would like to find. And I check that it works for Grasmanians, Kn, designed by Kn and T star Grasmanian. Alright, so finally let me go back to the questions about this finite sound. Right. So, this formula describes an answer for Freginio structure for Grasmere. So, now you want to extract Boston and some from this Fregnius structure. So, what you do is the following. So, let me again say it as a conjecture. Then I say when it's actually a conjecture, then we can prove it. So, let UZ be Rubinius structure. A structure of X, which is the Rasmanian Pm. Let me go just this, and then I'll explain more about T star. So here I know the answer for T star by semi-monominous. So, alright, so let's. So alright, so let's say you fix C, which is an element in FQ, and then for that you always have its prepe, its technology represent. So it's an element which lives in a closure of the atomic field. So there is a canonical way to associate with any element on FQ. It's so it's representative in So it's representative in in. So for instance, this representative satisfies, it's a unique element which satisfies the condition u is equal to q and is equal to z when you do reduction, reduction to the groups. So modular modular P, it's it's Modular B, it's supposed to give a Z back. So it's called equivalent representative. Then, then the following is true. Then we take a trace of our Fabinius stratetic structure related at district mirror element, Tz, multiplied by Fabinius stratic structure related at mirror element to the power T and all the way up to T to the power up to t to the power e s minus 1. So you get this matrix, you get a trace, and then you compute it when you find that it's actually your closest. It's x and x check. Let me say the most important is this part. F uh well this exponent the biodique exponent of rays of FQ FP of suita potential. So the point is that for P m, when k is equal to one, that's gonna give you back your Fragile's uh your most remote side. Most of them are summons. The most remote summons is just like that. And so the interesting story here is the following. So I knew that Frabinius, the traces of this Frabinius structure, supposed to give me the closed terminal sums for Pm is the non-superpotential which I write at the very beginning. But then for Grasmanians, we know. Rasmanians, we know from just physical consideration what is the structure of this superpotential supposed to be. So it's going to be some polynomial superpotential which known to physicists who are studying quantum coherence of Grasmanian since like 90s. But what was not known is what is this set? So naively this set is going to be just the same as in the case of PM. It's going to be just some torus, right? So you may say that, okay, maybe it's a torus. you will say that okay maybe it's a torus which looks like fq to the power the number of variables x in this case and it's a torus or k to the power n minus q so that was my naive guess and then when when i when i computed this continuous structure i was trying to check is this still true if i take this sum this superpotential i sum over all points in the torus and presumably it should give me this trace and it didn't work so i was quite puzzled So I was quite puzzled by that at the beginning, but then I recall that there is a kind of old paper by Marsh and Riesz, which discuss so-called exact mirror of aggressimia. So what they do is they say that you should actually embed this torus to some cluster variety, so it sits inside a So it sits inside a variety which is called Richardson variety. Let me call it like this. That actually looks like original Rasmania with the dual Grasmanian minus the class of anti-canonical divisor. Basically Rasmania minus an anti-canonical divisor. It's a cluster variety. Inside it there is a cluster of charts which looks like a photos. And on that portus Like a porous. And on that porus, there is this naive superpotential, which I know from physics. But then what they do is that they say, like, okay, you should actually consider this bigger variety, and it's equipped with superpotential, which restricts back to Taurus to the name superpotential. Alright, and then I just took their paper and said, okay, maybe I should take a sum over this Richardson variety, this potential thing. Potential. It actually works. So this is this is the, I'm pretty sure that this is the answer. I know the inferno function, I know the function. Right, so everything is kind of well now Ginsburg, but you need to be careful with where exactly it is, right? Well, so the point which I wanted to stress here is the following. To stress here is the following. Basically, when you study these Fabinius interplinors, or you study the, it's an interesting question to study the traces of these Fabinius interplinors at the points given by Fabinius representatives. And those traces are always finite sums of square roots of unity. And if you want to figure out the exact formula for this sum, you need to write a sum over some variety. To write a sum over some large. And if you try to do that, you will discover so-called exact mirrors of a cosmic. So in this case, you can, studying some arithmetics, you can discover exact answers for the mirror variables. So that's my point. And that may be the very last thing which I wanted to say, maybe the last five minutes. The last five minutes. So, as I said, for Grasmanian, I have the exact answer, right? But then, what happens with the situation when I do T-star Grasmanian? Maybe I'll call this other code. So, the conjecture which I describes gives you an explicit answer for these maths, which you can probably use. So, I know that answer. I know that answer. And then, of course, I can just take the same trace and ask what is this trace as a sum of rules. And then for my expectation is the following, is that for this stargress main in, that's going to be a sum, again, over some points of the multiplicative parameter of the Multiplicative character of the superpotential function. So, this is the superpotential function for the solution of kinesium zomological equations, well-known superpotential. And usually this superpotential, in the theory of KC equation, this superpotential lives in a space which is just Cm. So it lives in Cm. Number of X's, I guess it's Cm. CK. I guess it's CKN minus K minus some hyperpollins. So this is the Meister function and it's defined on some complement of the hydroplane function. So naively, this sum should give you the drips. And it's correct. So works For t star m with this complement, well, it's just again just basic codes. In this case, this mirror variety is FQ, FQ star to the number of rays. So if you choose a torus, then it's fine. But the same situation as I had before arises here. So I don't know what is, what is the And I don't know what is what is the right version of this of this Richardson variety in the Catangen keys. So in the case of Graspanian, I was able to figure it out. But here I expect the same is true, but you need to somehow invent some s some smart c computification of this potential tripoplanes and eventually it's very beautiful. And it should be some analog of which I write for potangians. which are just right for Catangen situation. This this I don't know. So that's the point of this. Four questions for Andre this drama class is kind of the theater of the drama class actually Firoci introduced for the For the quantum model, I'm chipping. Right, right. So it's kind of again one more indication that gamma classes are important in quantum cardiology. And if you study them the ideally, again, the same gamma classes show up. It's kind of just analogs of the same gamma classes. And there's other things that there is some work by Candela as the Laos uh a strategy. A strategy. So they actually compute some periods, some theoretic periods actually, or some analogy to false. And actually that story looks quite lost, the story you actually presented. Because what they actually missed probably is the definition of this gamma. But they make some computation to get a Frebinus structure and actually they put this matrix U for. So they study, as far as I understand, they're more concerned with like quantum cosmology of like Fano writings. They were actually Calabi Yaros. Calabi Yaros. Calabijo functions. Because they wanted to compute this zeta functions, this other zeta functions. It it's very similar. The with the difference that I wanna do it for like an extreme variety, so I can move it in that direction and they could like the other. Direction they will quite charge. Again, I don't think they have, I'm not sure they have this formula for the gamma plus, but they don't. I mean, it should be quite similar. They make a statement that you have this matrix, and some coefficients of this matrix, they supposed to be extractable from the topology, topology of, and for some reason, they only see the zeta tree, which I don't quite understand. Which I don't quite understand, like if they're recognized. Is there any dependence on which C Taurus in this cluster writer you're summoning over? I to give the I to get the exact answer for this trace, I need to sum over all answers of it. So, as I said, my naive guess was that I was summing over some torus, and it didn't work. But to actually have an equality here between the trace of the interconnect and this sum, you need to take a sum over all overall Richardson varieties. Not just all those ones. Not just all of the one str one chart. I'm really interested what is what is the analog of this week organizing. Do you expect this conjecture for arbitrary microgenerical varieties then? You know, it didn't work that long for that, and so that is the only source of my experiment so far. So I'm pretty sure that it remains true for. That it remains true for things like T-star flat varieties. So, here my intuition is like positive, but I'm not sure about general mikajima varieties. I haven't done any experiments in that. So, sometimes the Kajima varieties, which are quatangent bundles of like flag varieties in Chi plane, they have some special properties which will not continue to exist in that possibility. But I think I need to experiment with this. I think I need to experiment with this things like I heard  The last slash might be the speak issue because I'm not sure. I don't think it's nice.
