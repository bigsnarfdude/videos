Okay, so given simple simple algebra for k with evolution sigma group R0 of A gamma sigma. So here R0 means the neutral component of the automorphism group. The neutral component of the automorphism group. It is actually a joint, absolutely simple, and conversely, every Adjoint, absolutely simple algebraic new best of the form of plant base new for some Okay, so oh, yeah. Every absolutely simple group of classical type. Classic. Thanks. Okay, so there are exceptions to this. I said almost always. So exceptions. So exception to one. So, the exception to one is when A is of degree 2, degree 2, and sigma is orthogonal, then the group is not adjoint. It's actually limited, it's a decent group adjoint. And when A is of degree 4, and again sigma is orthogonal, then Then this thing actually is not absolutely simple because the root system is even as iron. And exception to 2 is in the case of D4, right? So in the case of D4, not every group of type D4 is isomorted to R0. Not every group of type P for a subset. Okay, so this holds in the case of fields, and moreover. The functor of naught from central simple algebras of degree n prime of 5 star. So, 5 means, so we say that a comma sigma is of 1 star where star does Where start is A, B, C, or D if the corresponding group is of the same type. So you have a category of central simple algebras of degree n prime of type star, and you also have the category of adjoint schemes, sorry, adjoint groups of the. Sorry, adjoint groups of D of rank M and of type star. So these are actually groupoids. This is group points, groupoid of degree and prime central simple algebra of type star and adjoint groups of rank n of type star. This is an equivalence. This is an equivalence. So this n prime actually is a function of n and also the kind of evolution that we have. So where n is bigger than 1 and n prime is n plus 1 if star is like a. I gave the n prime is equal to 2n plus 1. Star is of type B and n prime is equal to 2n. So star is of type C and the last one is type D group, so n bigger than 2, n not equal to 4, n. equal to 4 and time equal to n if star is of 10. So this is field and this gives you a classification of adjoint groups, absolutely simple adjoint groups in terms of as many algebraic solutions just by taking the Just by taking the automorphism group and then taking the nature of I and for simply connected ones are just obtained by taking the simply connected covers of each of these. So the goal is to generalize this for group schemes. Group schemes or arbitrary schemes okay so in other words I must say adjoint so you're asking if you have an adjoint group scheme with absolutely simple fibers then is it true Fibers, then is it true that such a group scheme is actually a component of automorphism group of some SMA algebraic function. And so you want to do that. So let's look at C, let's take S to be your base scheme. And you want 2 to be invertible. 2 is invertible in S. If 2 is not invertible, you encounter a lot of problems, just in the case of Ps. So this is your base game. And we want to establish an equivalence. And to establish An equivalence of categories just like in the case of fields. So you want almost algebras with the evolution of a given type, a given type and and degree. With the category of adjoint loop schemes, absolutely simple fibers of given of the same type, same type and corresponding back. So this is the goal. We want to establish equivalence in this case. So in other words, I claim that every adjoint group scheme with absolutely simple fibers of classical type is of the form classical type classical type. Classical type is out perform automorphism, the neutral component of automorphism group of as a new angel. Okay, so I'm just going to start with some basic terminologies and definitions. Talk about group schemes following definition is g over p group scheme G over S said to be reductive, it's called reductive. It's called productive. You can change the subjective to adjoin, semi-simple or simply connected, etc. If G is smooth and affine over S. Over S and for every S in S the geometric fiber G S R is productive irrespectively product adjoin so that's in a simple case. I think reductive needs connected, I guess. I think reductive includes the definition of reductive. Okay, maybe I should make fun of that. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, it's correct. It's just that the fiber has to be connected with that. Oh, the fibers, yes. Oh the fibers here, I see. Yeah, but my definition of reductive is already been corrected. Okay. Okay. My second definition is the type respectively the random of G. Of G at S and S is the time and respectively the rank of the geometric filter. Okay, so as Philip mentioned, the rank is locally constant, type is also locally constant, so these are locally constant functions. Locally constant functions. So when S is connected, particularly we have a defined notion of type for G. But in general, we say that type of G is A if every fiber has type A and so on. So, the following is well known. We need to adjoint group schemes with absolutely simple fibers of a given type and track. Then they are locally isomorphic. So, any two adjoined, and then we have to do that. Adjoint group schemes or S with absolutely simple fibers are of given type and rank, of given type and rank are um dialogus. Tal locally. Okay. So, on the other hand, we also have azime algebras with evolution. Let's just look at them. So, as I algebra contributions, so let's call this pair a comma sigma. So I think I should define involutions of first kind and second kind just very briefly. So an involution sigma from K to A of so set to be of Of first kind if it fixes the center. If it fixes, so this is over the scheme S so if it fixes for S it is of it is said to be of second kind so second kind means there is an So second card means there is a non-trivial automorphism. Okay, so I think these study of Azimi algebra sub contributions over arbitrary schemes is studied by Nas, Palimala, and Srimas in 90s paper, and I'll say it in 92 through both of them. So, but what we need is the following. So, what we need is that the following thing: that suppose given A sigma star locally, one of the following holds So A sigma is isomorphic to the matrix algebra and n with the transpose involution where A equals to A transpose. In this case, C1 is our problem. The second The second is this A sigma is isomorphic to the symmetric point. So M n, S P, where S P is the evolution, given by taking A to J M A transpose J inverse, then J is this matrix 0i minus I and so So, this these two correspond to involutions of the first kind. So, this is to our first kind and for the second kind, what we have is so let me write as suppose. So let me write as suppose A sigma over P is of the second column then there exists I need to talk over there there exists degree two Tau extension D to S such that the tau locally, this is actually trivial, so this isomorphic to this, and the involution becomes the exchange involution. A comma sigma is isomorphic to Mn cross Mn comma P. So this is the exchange involution, which is A D of goes to about B. Okay, so in double cases, in all of double cases, we say that A has a degree n as a layer algebra with evolution over S. Okay, so specifically in this case, Okay, so specifically in this case, even though the center is not S, center is an eta extension of S, the degree is computed over this. So we say that this is degree N as a May algebra over S even though the center is not S. Definition of second kind. When you say it's of the first kind, if it fixes OS, else it's of the second kind, you actually mean everywhere somehow. Well, if S was disconnected, it could happen that somewhere one piece is of the first cup. What is usually called out of the first cup? First kind means it affixes everywhere, second kind means it is. Everywhere, second kind means it is the other way around. But I'm not considering the mixed condition. First kind means throw out the first kind. Second kind means throw out and second kind. Okay, so now let's just study the automorphism. Automorphisms of the gamma sigma. Okay, so I want to show that this is actually smooth affine group scheme. Well let's just consider the functor. Of the sigma from the category of schemes over S, the category of groups, which takes a scheme over S and sends it to the automorphisms or OU algebra automorphisms of the pullback upstairs A massigma. So, the theorem is that sigma is represented by a smooth line using this. Okay, so maybe I will just write on the notation. If the functor, if underlying functor f is representable, then f denote the scheme which represents it, the representing scheme. This square. This is representative this moon. I'll find groups tomorrow. So I'll give you a brief sketch of this proof. So if you take any F p Q somorphism Then the category of affine schemes or S is equivalent to the category of affine schemes over Spanish descent data. Category of affine scheme S is equivalent to the category of R. Category of fine schemes for this pine with data. And moreover, the property of being smooth is FQC local over the base. So it suffices, so it suffices to show when this is actually. When this is actually split, because the target will be split. Okay, so now when A, sigma split, it is split in a sense it is one of these. So you have the transpose or the subject evolution or the exchange evolution. So in this case, so we are going to assume that it is split. So assume that this is split. Now, if you just look at this functor of A from schemes over S to groups, which will just take it, which just takes any scheme over S to the automorphism group of the pullback, what we have. Group of the pullback of the assumption algebra. Then this is given by this functor as closed sub-scheme is given by a, is represented by a closed sub-scheme, represented by closed subscheme. Of N OS of K. So OS module isomorphisms of K, OS module. Okay, so which is just M degree A square matrices are of size degree A square cross degree A square. So you have to the vector works in a question. There's a functor and then there is an underlying scheme which represents it. Yes, there is some notational. Yeah, there is some notational. Yeah, I think I should put it mentally for you. Yeah, that's edit. Spec scheme of scheme of this. And so therefore, this is fine. So this is represented by By a fine fine skin. And if you look at odd of A sigma, then this functor is actually a sub functor of this, which respects the involution structure. But respecting involution is also given by a bunch of polynomials. So this again a closed scheme of that. This is again a closed scheme of that. So, this is again closed scheme, which implies that this is actually fine. Now, I want to show smallness. Okay, so to show smoothness, I need the following lemma from SGAT. So it says that let H inside G be a monomorphism of this group scheme. Of this group schemes and suppose the sheaf the corresponding functor of G over H over H. This is considered as an FTQC quotient. Quotient sheaf in the FPQ topology. So, if this is representable by an SK GO and H, then the following is true. So the first thing is: suppose if G is smooth, then G over H is also smooth. If G is smooth, then this is also smooth. And conversely, if H If H and G board H are smooth, then so is G. Okay, so to show smoothness of the automorphism group First, let's consider the case when A, Sigma is of the first kind. So if A, Sigma is of the first kind, then we have R of the first is the orthogonal corresponding to the orthogonal. Corresponding to the orthogonal evolution, this is just O over the center like this, but then this is smooth over Z so therefore the quotient is smooth. Similarly, if you have simple ethnic involution, this is just a speed. S p to m sorry sp and this is also smooth over z so therefore smooth over s and then the quotient is also smooth. And for the other kind of A sigma is of Is of second time and to show smoothness, I think we have to do a little bit of work. So consider the functor OS cross OS. Os cross Os algebra homomorphisms of Mn cross Mn with an evolution, exchange evolution from schemes over S to groups which takes any U over S to the automorphisms which is just R O S U plus O S M N U MN U plus M U O U okay but this is this is all the automorphisms which fixes O s cross O s so this is just part O s of an n O u plus the exchange evolution doesn't come into picture so that Evolution doesn't come into picture. So, the automorphism which exchanged the factor doesn't come into the picture because it has to fix the new things. So, this is just this. So, this is again, we know that this is actually smooth, fine scheme. This is representable file smooth fine scheme. Now we also have a similar functor which actually is the automorphisms of O s cross O s both os so we also have similarly the functor odd code s O S or O S cross O S is represented by actually the smooth group scheme, Z ma 2, the finite scheme. Okay, so now we have an exact sequence of sheaves of O s plus O s algebra of OS algebra of M n plus M n to our OS algebra of M n plus M n and then it goes through this one goes through on S or from S Multiple S, square root of S equals U. So now these are actually these functions. So these two are represented by smooth, defined group schemes suggested. So, therefore, by the lemma that I just erased, this is actually. Erased, this is actually also represented by a small, affine group smooth. So this is smooth. Okay, so this finishes all the cases. So we have shown that automorphism group of azimuth algebras with involution is represented by a smooth affine horse. Okay, so in the equivalence we also had the notion of neutral component. So study this sigma. What is that? So maybe I should define what the nuclear component of our group scheme means. Definition: let G be a group scheme. Scheme over S then the neutral component G0 is defined as follows defined as the functor which takes takes values and schemes over S, or sorry, which takes which maps category of schemes over S to X takes T over S and sends it to U n G of P such that for every S and S. such that for every S and S, U S of P S is contained in G s 0, G is not. So this is the connected component, the neutral component of the fiber here. I didn't say it is representable yet. It's just because you need the No just because you you you need uh you you need the you you need that your your fiber are algebraic groups are local yes oh yeah uh yeah yeah yeah so these are yeah these are algebraic groups so that yes so so if you put look at people kind of draw that in mind if you put look at look at the cards out and then it makes sure that this is actually algebraic groups exactly yeah so we Yeah, so no click for time. Okay, so composition is that this computer can use base change. I think this is in SGAP, I'm not sure, I think SGATP or EGA. So it commutes with base change. That means that you can take the electric component, base change it over S prime is the same as base changing, and then you take the neutral component. How much time do I have? How much time do I have? Five minutes? Okay, um all right, so now uh the following proposition is, I mean I just write down the following. So if g over s is smooth connected Separated scheme of finite presentation such that G number S is productive. Productive for every S, then G0 is reductive. It's a reductive group scheme, which is both open and closed. This is due to red. So in our case, we just showed that R0 of A to sigma is actually Is actually productive. And moreover, if you take the fibers, if you take the fiber at s, I have another lemma which says that the functor ought not respects umpac in the sense that you can take this S and psi options r naught of K sigma fiber is just r0. Is just not A S T C. Okay, so this is not easy to show, it's not hard to show, it's just using definition and also using no that is that just says that we can pass it forward to the connective component of connective component is the uh base change of the neutron component is the neutral component of the base change. But I'm taking it inside Yes, may I just take the shoe up right after S five to be just Yeah, sure, but then you still have, you still have, you have to take it inside A s sigma square. Let's go back. So this is just odd naught of A sigma A s of sigma s. But then you know like the now we are in the case of fields and then we know that this is actually joint. Joint. So, in the case of fields, we have this is a joint group scheme, which is just really simple fibers. But for the weird cases. So, what we have shown is that this is actually F naught, A sigma is adjoint, absolutely simple. The simple group scheme over this. Okay, so now we have defined this, we have shown that this is the object that we actually were actually looking for. Now we construct the equivalence of categories. So construction plus Let's call it AZ and start schemes over S Defiber category of Isoma algebras with involution of type star and star and degree n and similarly you have the fiber category of rank n group schemes adjoint group schemes absolutely simple fibers of type star rank n type star absolutely simple Joint the fiber categories over S over schemes over S and we have a functor so maybe I should just down our lemma that these are actually gerbs these are gerbs Germs for the tile topology. Okay, so it is clear that these are stacks for the eta topology because by standard descent theory we can show that these are stacks. And why are they germs? Because it are locally everything is of a given type in the isomorphics. We get germs with the target topology. And now we have this functor ot naught of azumia algebras of degree n prime of the evolution of type star with group schemes, adjoint group schemes of degree n of n of type star where n prime is a function of n as I as we just as we just showed for the same functions function. for the same functions function of for the same function n prime in terms of n for different types of evolution, then I want to show that it's a theorem that this is an equivalence, this is fiber categories. So it takes A sigma So it takes A sigma to hot naught of A sigma and the morphisms are given by conjugations. Okay, so the proof is quite simple, it's not very hard. So since we have the functor between jibs, to show that the functor is actually in equivalence, it suffices to show that the sheaf of automorphisms, the functor on the sheaf of automorphisms. The functor on the sheaf of automorphisms of any object over S is actually since the R0 is a counter between jerks suffices to show to show that R0 induces isomorphism of sheaves of sheaf of automorphism of any object over S mount Of naught. Okay, so this is where A, Sigma is as star over S. And then these are sheaves because this is both are in stacks. So these are sheaves. And I want to show that OTNOT induces actually. induces actually isomorphism. By standard theory of gels, this will imply that this is a remote system. Now why is this why is this an why is this an isomorphism of sheaves? It is because if you take the fibers, so first of all note that we have shown that this is representable by smooth scheme. This is representable by a smooth scheme, right? And this is a semi-simple algebraic group. And SGA3 tells us that this functor, automorphism functor of any semi-simple group scheme is also representable by a smoother plan. This is smooth by SgA3. Okay, so if you put any G, which is any simple, this is actually a percentage of smooth affine group scheme. So we have two, we have a map between smooth affine group schemes. And if you take the fibers, what happens to the fibers is that if you take fibers, you can, by this pullback lemma, you can just take the fibers inside. You can take the fiber of this, it's just fiber of this. This is just you know fiber of this, and then taking the odd. So, along fibers, you get R0 of KS from R of E K Sigma S to L. But then now we are in the case of fields, but you know that in the case of fields, this category of central simple algebras as a given type and degree is equivalent to the category of adjoint algebraic groups of the Adjoint algebraic groups of the corresponding type and rank. So, this is over the case of fields. So, this is isomorphism by the case of fields. And then now we have a map between two smooth affine group schemes whose fibers are all isomorphic. So, that means this is since we have. We have isomorphism of two. We have morphism between two smooth fine schemes over S which are isomorphic long fibers. Long fibers so therefore this is an isomorphism. So therefore okay so that means that this is an isomorphism therefore gives us an equivalent. Any questions? You know, there is this argument which is called cotton leak fiber wires and isomorphism criteria, which is mostly so-called cotton leak fiber wires isomorphism criteria. I don't understand, you say? Is that what you use or do you use something special for a schemes? For this game, it is just a general fact. But this is a big update. It's asset. It's as in head of the GFO. Yeah, but there is no shortcut across my field. There's no shortcut. So actually, we just show that this is flat. So if we have, if this is If this is of locally finite type and this is locally a finite type, and if the fibers are flat, then this map is flat, the first thing. And then you have flat, and then you show that it's of open inversion. This is an open inversion because fiber-wise, it's all isomorphism. So flat plus open inversion is just isomorphism. When you use this uh part, will you have an exact sequence A, H, G, G, node H? H G G model. We need that because in my case it's split. The exact sequence you had splits. It's a thing, it's hard when the exact sequence doesn't split. It's easier to split. Questions or comments? Right, then let's thank for the And that's thank you for speaking. So I wish you a good appetite for dinner.
