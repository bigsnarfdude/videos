For the introduction. It's a real pleasure and honor to be here and to be able to speak at this wonderful conference with, you know, friends and colleagues. Senior coordinators. I guess. It's still really nice to be with all of you. And it's a real pleasure and a privilege that I get to be both so I'm going to be talking. Today I would like to tell you about some work that has been going on in my group for over Work that has been going on in my group for several years now, you know, on rigidity and robustness and resilience in cells and tissues, where we focus on how percolation and rigidity in biopolymer networks sort of gives rise to this rigidity and resilience of all these kinds of biomaterials. So, many of, okay, now before I get to my actual talk, I wanted to, this is the most important slide, so before people fall asleep. So, before people fall asleep, I wanted to show this slide. So, I want to acknowledge my wonderful group, especially the people who did actually the work. So, my awesome postdoc, Jonathan Michael, who is here and giving a talk on Friday. And PNC Nguyen, my former PhD student who defended a month ago and is now a postdoc in Missouri, Buffalo. And Lauren Melcher, my other awesome PhD student who's defending next week and then starting as a senior scientist at Pfizer. At Pfizer. So, yeah, and way higher salary than mine. I will not even mention. And then Mike Martin, who has recently moved on to Brandeis. And then Lisa Reynard, who was an undergrad in my group and is now a PhD student with Siri in Chicago. So the people whose names are in Blue are people who did the work. And also collaborators who either inspired this work or are intimately involved in the work. Of course, Ray Robertson Henderson. Of course, Ray Robertson Anderson, Ray Gabe is also this morning, Jenny is also here. And then Pitai is going to arrive some point very late today. And then also Larry Bonassar, Wallace Marshall, Mike Ross, and Sinny Ting. And the rest, again, the names in blue are people whose work I'm going to either mention, either involved in stuff I will discuss or inspired with. And funding sources, of course, without whom we cannot do. All right, so now I was told that I should try to keep. I should try to keep people awake or get them to wake up. So, to start with videos. So, you know, okay, so biology has lots of examples of robust, responsive, resilient materials. This is probably everybody's favorite video of a biological material, right? So, a white blood cell which is chasing bacteria, pushing red blood cells out of its way, and you know, its rigidity, responsiveness, resilience are all very important, right? Are all very important, right? Because it is basically changing its shape continuously as it persistently pursues this bacteria. It can generate forces by doing this. It has to generate forces to do this. It can push the red blood cell out of its way. It maintains its mechanical integrity. This other video is one of my favorite videos of, again, a biological material that's robust and responsive and resilient and maintains its mechanical. Resilient and maintains its mechanical integrity while changing shape, etc., etc. Right? Okay, so hopefully, people have woken up a little more. If you have not, then two more videos. I mean, only social videos, but no more cat videos, unfortunately. She's not my video. Okay, there is some gap between my talking and talking. So, not exactly biology. Not exactly biology. Well, synthetic biology is biology, right? So, again, an example from synthetic biology of a robust, responsive, and very resilient material. You can't really kill it, right? This other video. Synthetic biology and synthetic reality. This other one is a different type of terminator. Does anybody know what this video is showing or what this is? I mean, I will tell you later on. This is. I mean, I will tell you later on more about it if you don't know now. Generation of hydra or something to see? Okay, we will let it be a mystery so that you have to stay awake until I come to this part of the talk and then, you know, like, whatever, shed light on this mystery, what this video is. Okay. Alright. So now. Okay, alright, so now. Okay, so what, so a lot of the work I do basically has to do with trying to understand what is at the root of the robustness, the sort of adaptive, the tunable properties, and the resilience of materials, right, in biology, especially soft materials in biology. So these are my two favorite examples and things that my group has been working on for several years now. This is the cytoskeleton in the front of the book. Cytoskeleton, the front of the book called Cytoskeleton by Pauler and Bowman. And this is the extracellular matrix of soft tissue-like cartilage. Now, the common thing about both of these materials is that they are made up of disordered network-like structures, right? And so we can study their mechanical response using the framework of rigidity percolation. And I will talk briefly about that. These materials also have inhomogeneous phase. Also, they have inhomogeneous spatial structure, right? And they're often made up of composite materials, i.e., multi-component materials, where you might have, for example, two networks, you know, sort of with different physical properties that are sort of interconnected and are interacting with each other. So, I want to first briefly talk about this, the first point, right? So, there are several experts in... So, there are several experts in this room on rigidity percolation, but I still want to give a very brief introduction. So, rigidity percolation and rigidity percolation phase transition specifically has to do with a mechanical phase transition. And to illustrate it, I think it's easiest to illustrate it on networks that are sort of built on lattices. So, here I'm showing you a lattice-based network. This is based on sort of a Kagome lattice, and I have diluted some of the bonds in this network. Some of the bonds in this network. So, anytime you have two bonds that are sort of next to each other, when you have a series of bonds next to each other, like this one, this constitutes a fiber or filament. So the stretching elasticity of a fiber like this will be the sum of the stretching elasticity of the individual bonds. And we also say that any time you have a hinge consisting of two bonds, which is initially making one hundred eighty degrees, that if that angle changes, then you know that costs energy. Changes, then you know that costs energy. So there is also a bending which it kills these guys. And anytime two filaments cross like this, we are constraining their sliding. So they cannot slide on top of each other like this, but the rotations do not cost any energy. So these are some of the basic assumptions. Okay, so I have this very dilute lattice-based network. If I try to shear this network, it's so dilute that it's not going to be able to transmit or transfer mechanical forces. You'll measure a ZOC homogeneous. So I add some. Zochia modulus. So I add some more bonds, floppy, add some more bonds, it's still floppy, still you will measure with Zochia modulus. More bonds, more bonds. Now you'll start seeing some rigid clusters, you know, and you might even have connectivity percolation. But if you shear it, if it still gives you a zero share modulus, you don't have rigidity full scale in it. Then at some point, what will happen is you will have a rigid cluster that's well enough connected that now it can. That you know, now it can transmit mechanical forces throughout the network. And if I try to shear it, I'm going to measure a non-zero shear multiplication. And we say that the system has gone through this mechanical phase transition, which we call this rigidity perpetual. So if I want to show in a sort of a diagram, often what we use, the kind of plots we use to study where this phase transition is taking place, is we show the normalized shear modulus as a function of the probability. As a function of the probability that there are bonds in the network. And here I'm showing data from theory and an effective medium theory and here from simulation. This is for a triangular lattice-based network, by the way. And normalized shear modulus is essentially normalized by the value of the shear modulus when you have a completely ordered network where all the bonds are there. And you can see that for both these cases, you know, at this value of the probability of occupation of bonds, the shear modulus. Of occupational bonds, the shear modulus goes from having a finite value to having a value close to zero. We say that, okay, now this is where this mechanical phase transition is to take place. So, a lot of us have worked on this for a number of years. Fred and I have done some work. Xiaoming and Chase and Fred and Tom have a lot of really fitted work on this. So, you know, so I'm going to be brief. Now, I'm not going to go into detail on this. So, now, what can these kinds of frameworks So now what can these kinds of frameworks be useful for? So Ichai, I, and Jonathan is also involved in this and actually did the simulations for this work. So and Ichai is going to talk about this in great detail on Wednesday, so I'm not going to go into detail again. So one of the things we can do is we can take this rigidity percolation framework, combine it, so we will have a collagen network, which is our percolating network in this case. But we know that in a tissue like cartilage, in addition to collagen, you also have the You also have proteoglycans, you have hyaluronic acid, etc. So, we can think of those things as constituting a background gel. So, then with this kind of a model, we can basically map the composition of collagen and these other materials to the mechanics of the tissue. So, here I'm, for example, showing a representative, you know, what the basically collagen plus agriculture networks look like. So, in this case, you know, we have. So in this year, we have a lot of collagen, basically, sorry, we have very little collagen, no aggregant, a lot of collagen, no aggregant, very little collagen, aggregant, a lot of aggregant, and a lot of collagen, a lot of aggregant. The dots, the circles here are data from experiments. The solid lines are from Jonathan's simulation and fitting of data. And then once, you know, and again, I will not go into detail too much, but essentially, you But essentially, you can use this experimental data and then simulations and fitting to sort of you know get these curves and then you can sort of expand or extrapolate these guys to generate the full surface, right? Do you account for the swelling induced by the I don't want to steal his thunder, so I am just going to give you glimpses of what what are these like what is this framework good for, right? Why should we use this? And then you know, once you have that, basically you can have a composition-based model that can map the concentration of collagen and mixed permel or aggregate in mixed permel to the shear modulus in Pascals. And you know, these are the lines from like the data from experiments. From like the data from experiments, but now you have this full surface, right? So we can predict: you know, if you had like your cartilaginous disease tucking along different directions, the surface will help us predict what the mechanical properties will be along those other lines, right? And this could be, you know, a framework not just for cartilage, but other kinds of soft tissues where you have a you know collagen and some you know proteoglycans and other things. And again, Etai will talk in great detail about this, and I don't want to steal his thunder, so I just. I don't see his thunder, so I just wanted to give you a glimpse of this. Okay, so the next part is that these networks can be highly inhomogeneous, right? And so, which means that, you know, you don't have like the distribution, the spatial distribution of fibers is not everywhere the same. And the reason is that the way these networks are made, either in the cytoskeleton, but especially in the ECM, right? Because ECM, remember, is made by cells, and cells are not homogeneously distributed throughout. Not homogeneously distributed throughout. So then the network that's made, and even the network when it's degraded, is not going to be homogeneous, right? So what will happen when you have spatial correlation? So here we sort of drew inspiration from a paper that Emmanuela and Jiaomeng wrote for colloids and we basically use similar principles to sort of construct correlated filamentous networks, right, where you keep the bond occupation probability sort of fixed and then you can change the degree of correlation. And then you can change the degree of correlation, and you can get networks that have these clusters of bumps. And Jonathan will talk about this in great detail on Friday. So, I again don't want to steal his thunder. And the main thing is that as you increase the degree of correlation more and more, you can imagine that you will have these connectedness in the network with fewer number of bonds, and you can have a connected path for mechanical force transmission with fewer materials. So, initially, the percolation threshold. So, initially, the percolation threshold will shift to this direction, i.e., you can have rigidity with less material. But if you increase the degree of correlation too much, that's not good. Then you end up with diminishing returns because you might have very connected parts of the system, but then they are disconnected by means. So, that's also not good. So, you can see that the percolation threshold, if you look at it with the degree of correlation, that sort of has this re-entrant behavior. Showing here the same thing. Behavior. Showing here the same thing, but now in terms of the log of the normalized shear modulus. And once again, you know, Jonathan will talk about this in more detail, so you'll see more of this on Friday. So your P is the number of connections? P is the number of bonds that are, the fraction of bonds that are occupied. And then C, basically the correlation. Yeah, like I might even have let me see if I took it out or I reconstruct these things. No, I took it off because as you decrease correlations, you get more rigid until you break percolation. Is that clear? No, so as you increase correlation, right, you can get percolation with less and less amount of material initially, right? The point where it starts, the shear modulus goes from zero to non-zero. Modulus goes from 0 to non-zero, it will initially decrease to smaller and smaller values of p. But then you can come to a point where you know c is so much that let's say you have two big connected chunks, but then there is no connection between them. So that is not good. So you will end up in that kind of situation. So moderate to hypercolor, like moderate amount of, sorry, correlation is good, but too much correlation is not good. And Jonathan will have a lot to say on this, you know, he has looked at a mechanical He has looked at a mechanical length scale that sort of arises in the system, and I don't know how to describe this quantity. Okay, so then the last part, the last feature, last but not the least feature of these kinds of networks is these are multi-component composite materials. And we heard from Ray in the morning a lot about composite materials in the context of the cytoskeleton. So basically, they can have interacting networks or interacting filamentous systems with very different. Filamental systems with very different properties. And that is also really important. We think that is very important for their robust, resilient, and responsive properties. So to study, and this I'm going to talk about in a little bit more detail. So to study these kinds of composite material properties, the simplest model we could think of is a double network in two dimensions. So you have two interacting filament networks, and this is two. Filament networks. And this is 2D. So they are both sort of, they are not exactly on top of each other, slightly staggered. And they're interacting with each other via Wikipedian strings at midpoint of bonds if the corresponding bonds in both networks are present. And you can have two stiff networks, two stiff or semi-flexible networks in the sense that the networks cost both energy to stretch, energy to both stretch and bend, or you could have a one-stiff network, one flexible network, which is an example I'm showing here. Flexible network, which is an example I'm showing here, where you know the filaments in one of the networks will cause energy to stretch and bend, in the other, it only causes energy to stretch. Or you could have two flexible networks, right? This is just an example. And so here I've chosen, you know, with cartilage in mind, let's say a stiff network that represents collagen, a flexible network that represents hapmatin. The stiff network, like I said, it costs energy to both stretch and bend. The flexible network, it costs energy to only stretch. The Ps here you see are the oxygen. The P's here you see are the occupation, the probability of occupation of a bond. So if P is 1, a bond is there. If P is 0, a bond is not there. For stretching, there is only one P because the stretching of a fiber is the sum of the stretching of your individual bonds. For bending, you have P P because you have like, you know, for a hinge to have bending, you have to have both bonds with a hinge B there. And these are the rigidities normalized, like non-dimensionalized appropriately for stretching and bending. For stretching and bending, and for the flexible network, you only have the stretching part, and then this is again the weak Hookian connection between the two networks. So, once we write down these different energies, we can sum them up, and then we can apply whatever type of deformation we want to apply, whether it's shear or compression or extension, etc. You know, minimize this energy and try to find out things like stresses, shear moduli, again, and so on and so forth. By the way, please feel free now. By the way, please feel free. Now that I have gone over the stuff that Itai and Jonathan will talk about, feel free to stop me and ask questions. I just didn't want to answer questions that are their questions. In this model, the two networks are independently interpenetrating, but they don't bind to each other. They don't touch each other. They only interact with each other at the midpoints. Yes. No. Midpoints may. No, midpoints, meaning midpoints of the bonds, not at the nodes, right? At midpoints of bonds, if corresponding bonds in both networks are present, because they have different probabilities, like they are drawn from different probability distributions. So Jonathan is working on 3D models of various networks, and we will have three-dimensional results generally, but everything that I will talk about today is To be so, excuse me? What are R and S? R and S, I'm just showing the two filament system. It's basically the undeformed bond length and the deformed bond length, right? So this is the equilibrium length of the bond, right? Sorry, not undeformed. And this is, you know, right now, whatever is the current bond area. This is for the stick network, this is for the flexible network. So I just choose. Okay, by the way. Okay, but both of them are stretchable. Yeah, okay. All right. So again, here we started out by looking at the normalized shear modulus as a function of bond occupation probability. And what we are looking at is, again, we apply a very small shear, so less than 1%. And we look at this. And as you would expect, both the threshold of percolation, rigidity percolation, as well as the modulus depend. Percolation as well as the modulus depend on both how much material is there in the STIP network and how much material is there in the flexible network, which are the different colors. That's because, you know, as you like, there are constraints coming into the system from both the STIP network as well as the flexible network. So it makes sense that these things will depend on both. But one of the things I want to point out here, which is important for biomaterials, is look at these two lines. These are dives to the eye that I've drawn here. So this first dashed line is at a place where the Is at a place where the stiff network is just above its rigidity perpellation threshold. So now, as you add more and more material to this flexible network, you can see that you can change the modulus by several orders of magnitude by doing that. In another, the reverse way to think about it is if you were in a part of a tissue where the stiff network is here in its phase space, it's just above its percolation threshold, then if you dissolve material from the flexible network, Material from the flexible network, you can have your shear modulus can decrease very, very like dramatically, right? And your thing can sort of soften quite a bit and pull up. But if you're in a part of a tissue where stiff network is very rigid and far above its rigidity threshold, then no matter what you do to the flexible network, this doesn't really change very much. And so again, depending on if in your tissue or your inner cell, You know, if in your tissue or inner cytoskeleton you are here, right, then modulating or changing amount of material in the flexible network has a lot, you know, is much more impactful than if you're here. Okay, so this is more about the rigidity and how you can sort of tune the mechanics of these kinds of network-like systems. But I also wanted to talk about resilience. Okay, now before I go to resilience, one other example. So, Ray, already again. So, Ray already again, Ray talked about this in the morning, so I will not spend too much time. So, you can take these kinds of a double network model, but instead of a stiff network and a flexible network, you can have like both networks are stiff or both networks are semi-flexible. So, for microGP and actin, you can also add contractility to one of the networks, right, by saying that you know, you have like horse-dipoles that will contract the bounce in your network if you know a motor is there, etc. And then you can sort of get sort of this. Sort of get sort of this kind of phase space for you know depending on what is the fraction of actin versus mitrotubule you have your system or you know how much motor what is the motor concentration you can generate what these configurations would look like you can find out what would be the the you know shear modulus these networks would have like we showed in the morning right so you can also use these kinds of networks to predict uh not the dynamics but uh you know basically not time-dependent properties right because there is no Not time-dependent properties, right? Because there is no time in the system, but at least the shear modulus and configurations, you know, what the structures would look like for these actin microtubule plus, you know, myosin planking systems. Sorry, turned off. There is nobody else on Zoom, so if I accidentally turn off. Okay, so now you know what this movie was, right? So. Viva's right, so this is sort of my favorite single-celled organism. It's tentor su, yes. The reason it's my favorite single-celled organism, there are multiple reasons. One, because it's quite big, it's one millimeter. B, two, is because it's blue, it's blue, it's cerulean in color, so of course. And it's mechanically very, very robust, right? So the thing is, if you, this is why. So, here, what you're doing is you are basically injuring it, poking it with a Engineering it, poking it with a needle, but the cytoskelly, the cytoplasm, it doesn't really fall apart, and the cytoplasm, you know, flowing away or something, it retains it, right? And if you chopped your stentor into multiple parts, if your stentaur had, so it had a big macronucleus that sort of spans throughout the cell and it also is polyploid, right? So if it has some part of the nucleus, some of its genome, and some of its genome, Of its genome and some of its cortex, your individual chopped parts of stentaur will become a full stentor. We don't really understand why it can do this, how it's keeping track of which organelles have gone missing and now it's regenerating those things. Also, the fact that it's not losing its cytoplasm, right? And it's, you know, so it's A, it's very resilient to wounding. A, it's very resilient to wounding, and B, it's also, you know, if it's wounded, it's very good at healing and regeneration. And we don't really understand why this happens. The other thing I should point out is the cytoskeleton of Stentor looks very different from our cytoskeleton in the sense that microtubules are the sort of main players. There, you have bundles of microtubules called cane fibers, and actin is not that big a player, and instead of That bigger player, and instead of the contractility is coming from myanins and not motors. And then biochemical processes and signaling is also quite big. But, anyways, so this is one motivation. The other motivation for looking at resilience is, again, articular cartilage. And, you know, once we reach our 30s, we don't make any new cartilage anymore. So, for the remaining decades of our life, our cartilage has to sort of be there and work for us, right? So, it has to be really, we are a practical. It has to be really very crap resistant and very robust. So, again, you know, why? And you can see here, if you made a notch in a cartilage and if you tried to stretch it like this, it doesn't propagate like, you know, fall apart like a brittle material, but it rounds up like this, the bottom pulls up like this, right? So again, for cartilage, this double network model that we have, we created a notch and we applied strain and incrementally stretched it up to 70%. Up to 70%, and we allow bonds to break and buckle for our networks. Broken bonds are broken forever, buckle bonds can come back into circulation if you remove the compression. And with that, what we find is that we look at two specific cases, again, when the stiff network is just above the rigidity threshold and the stiff network is far above the rigidity threshold. In this case, in both cases, initially, as you strain it, the amount of stress the network can bear will. Amount of stress the network can bear will increase as the network sort of you know stretch stretches out and aligns along the direction of the strain. But then at one point the bonds will start breaking and buckling and you will start seeing softening and failure. The main thing to notice here is for the case where the stiff network is just barely rigid, if you vary the amount of material in the flexible network, then you know both the maximum stress as well as the strain at the maximum stress change for your trip. We'll look at this in a little bit more detail. In this case, Little bit more detail. In this case, the maximum stress changes somewhat. The strain at which you get this maximum stress doesn't really change very much, right? And this is, again, more clearly shown here. I'm just showing the maximum stress as a function of the amount of material in the second network, right? When the stiff network is at, you know, 60, it's just above its rigidity threshold, and here it's far above its threshold. And here I'm showing the strain at maximum stress. And here I'm showing the strain at maximum stress. So, what's happening? For maximum peak stress, as you add more and more material to the second to the softer network, you are reinforcing the system more and more and more. So, of course, the maximum stress or the peak stress will go up in both cases. However, for the strain at maximum stress, when your stiff network is just marginally rigid, right, then you know, by adding more and more material to the flexible network, you are To the flexible network, you are reinforcing it, but you are also suppressing low-energy deformations and rearrangements, right? And so, the strain at which the thing will sort of start falling apart is going to be smaller and smaller because of the suppression of the stonic line of emissions. So, then it goes down like this. But when your stiff network is super stiff already and super dense already, it's already very dense and very brittle. It doesn't really matter what you're doing to the second network. matter what you have done to the second number. It's just from the fall apart. That's what's shown here. So this is for P1 equals 80% and P2 equals 60%. This is for P1 equals 62% and P2 equals 60%. So here you can see that the propagation of crack is sort of more gradual. This is basically what you would see in brittle fracture. So there is this tug of war between whether you want You know, whether you want, you know, like, if you want larger load-bearing capability, you would want more material. If you want, you know, extensibility, then, you know, you want to make sure you allow non-affinity arrangements. So the main take-home messages is that percolation of rigidity sort of helps to organize and modulate network mechanics in biopolymer networks, in cells and tissues. And if we have a moderate amount of structural correlation, and you will see this in more detail on Friday, it can allow these networks. On Friday, it can allow these networks to achieve rigidity with less amount of material, but too much correlation will give you diminishing returns. And composite networks are built-in mechanisms for tunable mechanics and resilience. And if you want to design a material that's both robust and resilient, what we would want is we want to have combined materials with different strengths, you know, different strong points. We want our networks to be percolating, like rigidly percolating, but we don't. Rigidly percolating, but we don't want them to be too dense, right? Especially if they're too dense, then we will end up with a brittle material, right? So we have to balance out those things. And depending on which one we want more of, load-bearing capability or extensibility, we can vary how much material there is in the secondary lifer. And we also, like I pointed out earlier, should allow, we want rigidity percolation, but we also want to allow, you know, non-affined rearrangements. We also want to allow our sort of You know, our sort of basically the defects in our system being spread out, et cetera, et cetera. So, I have one or two minutes or no time. No time. Okay, so I have no time, so I will just take one, I will just show one slide. And so I'm going to leave tomorrow, so I will maybe not have a lot of time. But I can answer questions tonight and tomorrow morning. But Ray is going to be here, and Jenny is also going to be here. So they are both very intimately involved in this project. Very intimately involved in this project. And you can answer all the other questions, all the questions that I don't get time to answer. So, now what another way of getting these kinds of resilient networks is to combine substrates like biopolymers or other substrates with biomolecular circuits, which will allow assembly and disassembly sort of in a programmable way. And to do that, what we are trying to do is combine these kinds of biopolymers with circadian rhythm proteins from cyanobacteria, Ki ABC, so microbes. So, Mike Rust is also very involved in this project. And the idea is that, you know, these cyanobacteria, CHIABC proteins, they will sort of form these kinds of complexes rhythmically over this 24-hour cycle. And if you, you can, we can sort of make one of these chiBC proteins, KiB specifically sticky by coating it with biotin. We could coat also your biopolymers with biotin, and then these can act as cross linkers. And then these can act as cross-linkers, cross-linking in the networks. And then, you know, when they fall apart, the network will also start falling apart. But networks are super messy. So this is a very difficult, complicated phase space to do this. So we thought as a proof of principle, we will first do this with colloids. So this is reported in this paper. And then Ray and Jenny can tell you more. And what we found is that, you know, based on how much we, how, what fraction of How what fraction of our CIVC proteins we have made sticky, you can get different types of behavior. You can get, you know, no cluster formation for the colloids, sort of largish cluster formations, and things that are intermediate. But we don't see oscillations, right? Like, you know, things form and dissolve, form and dissolve. And the reason for that is that the connection between colloids via these cross-linkers, it's multivariate, not monovalent. So if like there can So, if like there can be multiple bonds connecting a pair of half, right? So, even if one bond dissolves or goes away, there might be others that are still there, right? And then, before everything goes, can go away, new bonds can form. And so, right, so I guess that's sort of but combining these kinds of substrates with biomolecular circuits or these kinds of circuitian rhythm proteins is another way to get resilience in our system. That's all of this. All of this. Back to my acknowledgement slide. Thank you for your attention, and I'll take any questions you can. Great. So, you know, you're talking about this, there's a balance between connectivity and heterogeneity in a lot of different systems, at least as a lot of our experiments. And I'm just wondering if you've thought about, is there some kind of universal parameter that Like a universal parameter that could all the data could be scaled by, so that you can get like data collapse. Yeah, I mean, ultimately, you do get data collapse. So, the whole point, because this is a fish, yeah, but you get data collapse like in your simulations. I'm saying, like, if I took that data path, like, how do I translate that to, say, I did this, like, non-monophonic dependence on kinesium concentration because of this balance between like and rigidity. Right. And then, like, you should use other kind of support experimental systems. Like, how would I do that? I guess if you want to be a data, so in in. To be a data collection, so in theory, like in simulations and theory, if you know, for simulations, if you're working on a large enough system, you should be able. I am not showing you any data collapse here, but you can collapse that data. I mean, we have collapsed the data. Juming has, we have, you know, in various papers, you can see that data collapse. But in experiments, I think the parameters, like you don't have P in experiments, right? So, one of the things you can have is connectivity, right? If you can have some proxy for a connectivity parameter in your experiments, that could Parameter in your experiments, that could be your x-axis. Modulus, you can measure. The other thing you would have is like an average filament length or something. So, if you have, if you can somehow measure either connectivity or average filament length, that could replace your x-axis. And in the data collapse, again, it's not just going to be P, right? It's going to be how far you are from the transition. It's P minus P C or Z minus Z C. So you'll have to sort of, but there is a way, I guess it depends on what you can measure experimentally, but probably. On what you can measure experimentally, but I think we are ready with that. What is your collapse rate? Well, so the thing is, I will have to do how far is it from the transition, right? And here, normally people look at this transition near what we call the isostatic point, not the rigidity percolation point. I'm getting into the weeds a little bit technical stuff. So it's basically where, you know, if you only had springs and had no bending, right? Springs and had no bending, right? The point where things will go from being rigid to non-rigid, because that's a much more better defined. You can study scalings and everything much better there. But usually, you would have like delta P, whatever your P is, minus whatever your transition point is, that delta P, and then there will be other P factors, et cetera, on one side, and G, and then other things on one side, and then you'll have some scaling, you know, exponents, etc. And depending on your dimensions, and you know, if it's a lattice-based system, what kind of structure are you? It's a lattice-based system, what kind of structure you have, and you'll have slightly different. And I think, again, we can talk more, but also feel free to talk to the, you know, Jean-Françoise and Fred and Jean-Ming, who are all here, you know, and are all also experts from this. Yes. Yeah, so it's really cool to see the two networks and their effects on each other. I was thinking about adding other things like cross-linkers, for example. Things like cross-linkers, for example, or unbelievable proteins. Yeah, so I could imagine you could take your constraint, but right now you're free to wobble in a swivel and just walk back. Oh, so we actually did, Jen Force and I did some work on this a decade ago, where you also have cross-finkers that can constrain the angle. And one of the things that we found in that paper is that I'm actually quite proud of the paper because even though it's in plus one, it has like 60-some citations. But, anyways. Some citations, but, anyways, doesn't usually happen for cross-bound papers. But so, what we found in that paper is that if you add enough number of angle-constraining cross-linkers, you can get the rigidity and connectivity percolation thresholds to lie on top of each other. Normally, the rigidity percolation threshold is different from connectivity percolation threshold because you can achieve connectivity with fewer number of bonds. You will need more bonds to achieve rigidity. But if you add these angle-constraining cross-linkers, then Angle-constraining crossing curves, then if you have enough of them, you can get that. And you also have different exponents, etc. So, what I was wondering about was how would you add that into the problem? So, bundling here would be basically instead of having one, I have one bending rigidity kappa, if you let's say you can have a distribution of kappa, right? That will come in. Distribution of kappa, right? That will come in through the bending rigidity. I mean, that will come in through the persistence length. So, the stretching probably will also change. So, that's one way of doing it. Lauren is doing some simulations that I didn't talk about today with Jose Alvarado, where we actually have bundling and even network formation, which is completely driven by deplete ends, right? There is no physical cross-cunting. But that's again an interesting paper. We are ready to resubmit this, and we'll have a new version on the archive where you have, again, bundles of acting, but you know, and. Actant, but you know, and network morphologies, but completely driven through the patient. So, Patrick, maybe this relates to some of the things that you're seeing now. So, what is the role of dynamics in this? Because basically, in this type of model, either the bonds are there or they break, but there is no internal dynamics of the bound as you break. Dynamics of as you're breaking things, there is no right, there is no rate or anything, but in real life, those things are important, especially when you think of something like crack propagation. You have all of those things. I mean, this was basically a first attempt of a model, but the so there are a couple of different things that we are trying out now, right? One is adding pre-stress, like you know, uh, Vijay had not Vijay, Vivek had pointed out earlier for at least cartilage tissue, you know. Least cartilage tissue, you know, the network is quite pre-swollen, right? So that's one of the things that Jonathan is implementing now. The other thing is having things in three dimensions. That's also important. And the third thing is in the end, you know, writing these down and converting these into, I mean, in principle, this is not hard. The simulations are going to be expensive and will take time. But these are all three things are sort of things that are in various stages of thought process and energy nutrition. Thanks for that much.
