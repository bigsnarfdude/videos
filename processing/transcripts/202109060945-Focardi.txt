Hey, Matteo Ficcardi from the University of Lorenz, and we'll talk about the regularity of singular sets of minimizers for the Moon Fernschair energy. So thank you very much. Thank you, of course, to all the organizers for their kind invitation. And what I'm going to talk about is a joint work with Camilla. Is a joint work with Camilo Deleldis from IAS and Sylvia Guinassi, who was a postdoc of Camilla at the time we wrote the paper. And I'll be concerned with some regularity results on the singular set of minimizers of the Manfred Shah energy. So I will start from the very beginning by introducing the Manfred Shah image segmentation and edge detection problem. Does it work? Do you see the new screen? Because I cannot see what I'm projecting. Okay, so. Okay, so essentially you're given a black and white picture. Omega is a rectangle, and the set of somehow the level of the grays of the object in the picture are encoded by this function g. So say zero is black and one is white. And you want to find the blurred version of g together with the edges of the objects in the picture. And according to one French, you can... And according to one French, you can do it variationally by minimizing an energy depending on couples, K, which is a compact subset of the bar, and U, which is a smooth function outside of K. And the energy you have to minimize is the sum of three terms. Let me start from the last one, which is called the fidelity term, because it's simply the L2 square L2 distance of u from g in a way that's Of U from G, in a way that somehow the output of the minimization process gives you something which is in some sense close to the input. But the main part of the energy is the sum of a volume and the length term. So on one hand, you have the Dirichlet energy of U outside of K because you want to prevent having thin layers of gray to pass from black to white. So high gradients are penalized by this term. But on the other hand, you also want But on the other hand, you also want to add too much fake contours in a way that you can lower the energy. And so you also somehow penalize the presence of the contours. Okay, so given this, of course, it's a variational model, you try to follow the direct methods, but you soon realize that the presence of the length term is really an issue. And this was solved, at least it was at the time the model was introduced. The time the model was introduced, and this was solved by different approaches. I want to mention, in particular, the one by Georgi Ambrosio, who somehow introduced a weak formulation of the problem in the subset or in a suitable subset of the space of functions with bounded variation. So, naively, you look at 2k as the set of discontinuities of u. This is why the Georgi coined the term free discontinuity problem because the discontinuity are free. And in this new space, And in this new space, the weak formulation actually enjoys all the good properties in a way that the Tonelli direct method work. And then by some mild regularity properties of the set K, and in particular I'm referring to this Al-Force type regularity, you can actually prove that the weak minimizing couple is actually strong minimizing couple. So you really have a strong minimizer of the problem. Minimizer of the problem. And what you're really interested into is the regularity of the cap order. Of course, outside of K, U will be harmonic. So what you're really interested into is the regularity of the set K. And usually what you do in regularity issues, what you do is you take a little ball, you look at the infinitesimal behavior of the minimizing couple around the point X. So you pick a little ball BRX. Little ball BRX, you perform for you this kind of translation and dilation. This corresponds for the set K to introduce this set Kr. But then if you remember in the energy, we have a bulk term and a length term, and they scale differently. So to balance their scaling, you have to pre-multiply U by this factor here in front. And then somehow you tailor expand your energy in terms of R and in terms of the new couple URKR. Terms of the new couple URKR as follow as written down here. And you look at these two terms. Okay, so concerning the fidelity term, because G is in L infinity, by maximum principle, the minimizer has the same L infinity bound. And what you realize is that this term is a big O of R. Instead, thanks to the previous Alphorse regularity that I wrote down and another somehow easy bound that you can find on the full energy. That you can find on the full energy, you can prove this term here is a big O of one. So the fidelity term is higher order, and I will drop it from now on, simply because what I claim is that if I understand the regularity theory for local minimizers, that is minimizers of the sum of the Dirichlet term and the length term, up to compact perturbations, by some perturbation argument I can recover also a regularity theory for minimizers of the formulation. Theory for minimizers of the full energy. Okay, so I will drop completely the fidelity term from now on. Okay, it's a variational problem, so we can look to necessary conditions, and you have two kinds of variations that you can perform. What I call outer variations, which are obtained by perturbing u by some infinitesimal compactly supported vector phi phi, and you get this equation. Or you can also move the set K. Move the set K and this is done by perturbing the identity by some infinitesimally by some compactly supported vector field eta and you get this equation here. So I'm not going to discuss them in details. What I want to tell you is how these equations rewrite in case you know a priori that K is smooth. So in case a smooth graph, say, you can perform some integration by parts, and what you can prove is that the first is And what you can prove is that the first system, the first equation, sorry, is telling you that U is harmonic out of K and satisfies Neumann boundary condition on the set K. While the inner variation, again by integration by parts, gives you an equation which relates the curvature of the set K and the jump of the square modulus of the trace of the gradient on the set K itself. So it's a really nice variation. Really nice variation equation which contains both the geometric information on k and the gradient of the solution. Okay, we come back to these variations later on. But once we have necessary conditions, we look for possible candidates for local minimizers, and people found some couples. So, first of all, the case of harmonic functions in which the set k is empty. Then we had the Except k is empty. Then we had the pure jump configuration in which k is a line and u is locally constant in our two minus this line. Then we had the triple junction configuration in which k is a propeller, that is the union of three half lines meeting at the end point with equal angles. And again, u is a piecewise constant in R2 minus the propeller. And then finally, we have this crack tip configuration, which essentially Configuration in which essentially you take the real part of the complex square root, and the set k say is this the positive real axis, and you have to pre-multiply by this precise pre-factor square root of 2 over pi. This comes from the inner variation, this pre-factor here. And of course, then you can rotate it, translate it, and change signs, and still it's a cractive configuration, which is a possible candidate. And indeed, actually, Alberti Bushite tended. Actually, Alberti, Bushite and Almazo proved that the first three couples are local minimizers, provided the radius R is sufficiently small. If R is big enough, then they are no longer local minimizers of the malforential range. Instead, in a very remarkable paper, Bonet and David were able to prove that crack tips are actually global minimizers of the energy, meaning that they minimize the energy compactly in every ball, essentially. Ball essentially, and there is actually a conjecture by the Georgi telling you that up to say rigid motions, this is the only possible global minimizer of the Manforce-Scha image. And this conjecture is actually connected to the main conjecture of the area, which is the Man-For and Schae conjecture, which is telling you that the set K has a very precise structure for the locally minimizing counter. So K is the locally finite union. The locally finite union of at most countably many C1 injective arcs. Let me underline the fact that the arcs are supposed to be C1 up to the end points. And you have only two possible singular configurations for the set case. So either you have a loose end, or if two arcs are meeting, they have to meet in an end point, and actually there is a third arc meeting there, and the arcs are forming equal angles. The arcs are forming equal angles. So essentially, if this conjecture is true, what you can say is the following: that if you pick any point in K and you take a sufficiently small ball, either the set K looks like to a diameter of the ball, and this is the pure jump configuration that we have seen, or the formation of it, or the set K looks like a radius, and this is again, it looks like to the crack tip. It looks like to the tractive configuration, or the set K looks like a propeller, and this corresponds to the tricho junction configuration. So we have seen all these possible, all this possibility in the explicit examples. And what regularity theory does is to establish some partial converses of these statements, as we will see. So let me start with the first result, which was proved by Ambrosio Fusca and Pallara. Fusk and Palara. Here I stated the two-dimensional version of the results, and what they prove is that you can find a relatively close subset of K, sigma, which is H1 nu, and outside of which K is locally a C11 arc. Actually, it's even more regular. And what is nice about the result is that they give you an epsilon regularity statement. So sigma is identified as the subset of points of K for which some points. Of points of K for which some quantity has to be above a threshold, the universal threshold. And the quantity you are looking at is the sum of the scaled Birdley energy of U and some one-sided Hausdorff distance of the set K from lines. So the scaling factors are in front of these quantities because you want to make the quantity scaling invariant. And if you change variables, essentially, this corresponds to the To the Declay energy of the function UR, the scalings UR I wrote down some slides before, and this is the scale mean flatness of the corresponding set Kr. Okay, and David was actually able independently and contemporarily to prove in two dimensions that the set sigma is actually even smaller. It's not only H1 null, but it has Hausdorff dimension strictly less than one. Okay, so. Okay, so let me tell you now to let me try to couple the Manfred-Shah conjecture or to rewrite the Manfred-Schacht conjecture in terms of this result by Ambroso Fusk and Pallara. So what I do is to split the set sigma, which is a set of singular points in the singular set of the function u, as a mutual disjoint union of three subsets. The subset sigma one is the set of points in sigma. Sigma 1 is the set of points in sigma for which the scale Birdli energy is infinitesible, and then, of course, the scale mean flatness, let me call this term here as mean flatness, is not. And the set of points for which the opposite happens, so the mean flatness is vanishing, but not the scalability energy, and the rest. So the third set, according to the Manforscher conjecture, should be empty, but we don't know anything about it. We know something about the set sigma one and sigma two. About the set sigma 1 and sigma 2, as I will tell you in the next slide. So, let me also, what I will do in the next slide is also to justify the names triple junctions for points in the first set and partly crack tips for points in the second set. So, concerning the first set, I want to state a very beautiful result by Guida Vido, which is again an epsilon regularity result. It's an epsilon regularity result, analogous statement of the one by Ambroso Funsk. Of the one by Ambrosio Funsk and Pallara in the case of propellers. Essentially, what they prove is that there are two constants, epsilon and C, such that if you are given a local minimizer and a point in K for which if you pick there is a ball centered in that point for which the scaled energy and a one-sided Hausdorff distance from propellers is below a threshold, then actually in a ball of comparable radio, In a ball of comparable radius centered in Z, the set K is a smooth diffeomorphic image of a propeller. So really, at points satisfying this condition, the set K looks like a propeller, at least infinitesimally. And actually, what you can prove to justify the name for the set sigma one as triple junction points, there is some compactness argument which gets rid of the second add in the Than in the epsilon regularity statement. So, really, if you have a point for which this a singular point, sorry, for which the scale-reclaimed energy is infinitesimal, then the set K is a C1 diffomorphic image of a propeller. So it's a very precise description of the set around the points, of the singular set around points satisfying this condition here. Okay, so instead about the set sigma two, we know something. Know something still by a contribution by Dida Vida, Boné and David, who were able to prove that if you fix epsilon naught, you can find a parameter threshold epsilon such that if you are given a local minimizer and in around the ball in a ball centered in a point of in a point of omega, the set K is in Ausdorff distance, a scaled Ausdorff distance, satisfying this condition here. Satisfying this condition here for some radius of the ball, then actually you can find a point in a ball of a comparable radius and a smooth parameterization gamma such that K can be rewritten in the ball BR over 2 centered in Z as follows. So essentially, this theorem is telling you that under this condition, the set K is a smooth connected arc. Then they have also. Then they have also some regularity estimates on the derivative of gamma. So, here I wrote the one for the first order derivatives, but there are analogous estimates for the higher order ones. So, what this theorem, though, is not telling you is whether the arc is C1 up to the tip or not. So, in the case of the cracked tip, you have precisely a C1 regularity up to the tip, but somehow. Regularity up to the tip, but somehow a spy, a very slow turning spiral is compatible with these regularity estimates. And in the language of geometric measure theory, what you're missing is the uniqueness of the tangent cones at the cractip points. So this is what we started to study with Camillo some years ago, and this is what we finally proved with Silvia last year, taking inspiration from an analogous result proved by Anderson. Proved by Anderson and Michali. So essentially, what we are able to prove is that under the assumptions of David results, so if you know that you have a local minimizer and you know that this quantity is below the threshold and say for convenience that sigma is the horizontal radius, so you know that you are a smooth connected arc up to the tip. Actually, K is even better. You can prove that it's a C to alpha graph whose A graph whose curvature is vanishing at the tip. So, in particular, what we prove is that the second possibility is rule out, and really, somehow what you see is in the blow-up limit, a rotation and translation of this configuration in particular. Okay, so let me also tell you that our proof works more generally for critical points of demand for chaff. Critical points of the Manfor-Sha functional. I mean, couples satisfying both the outer variation condition and the inner variation condition. But in this case, we have to assume that we are under the conclusion of David result. So we have to assume that we know that K is a smooth connected arc up to the tip. So what we miss is an analogous statement of Bonandavid result for critical points. But if we are under the conclusion, But if we are under the conclusion of the theorems, still we can derive the same conclusion. That is, K is actually a C to alpha graph with vanishing curvature at the tip. Okay, so what I'm going to do next is to give you a flavor of the proof of this result. Here I have written all the main steps of the proof, and I will try to give you somehow. Somehow, an idea of each of them. So, the first step is actually not needed, but it's very convenient for what the computations are concerned. So, rather than studying a critical point uk, we consider the harmonic conjugate of u. And this can be done if you look at the outer variation. This is telling you that the rotated gradient of u is actually curve-free in the sense of distribution. Curve-free in the sense of distributions. And then you are able to find a potential that is a H1 log function in saying V1, which is harmonic out of a K and satisfying this condition here. You can even prove that this function is holding continuous. It is constant on each component of K, and it's unique up to the addition of constants. So this is true in general for every critical. General for every critical point, but in our setting, the k is a smooth connected arc, so we can adjust the constants in a way that w is zero on k. So the advantage is now that if you remember when I wrote the outer variation in case k was a smooth graph, this was telling you that u was harmonic above k and satisfying non-man boundary conditions on k. Morally, what we do now looking at Morally, what we do now, looking at the harmonic conjugate of u, we have an harmonic function which is satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions now on k. And this is very convenient for the computations. Okay, so this is the first step. The second step is to follow a very beautiful idea by Leon Simon when discussing the uniqueness of tangent cones for minimal. Uniqueness of tangent cones for minimal surfaces. What we do is the following. So assume that we have placed the tip in the origin of the unique bolar. We change variables. Essentially, we pass two polar coordinates. And we also again reparametrize the distance from the origin with this negative exponential here. So we introduce now two new functions, theta of t, which is the parameterization of the The parameterization of the set k computed in this negative exponential, and then we take this function f, which is simply the rescaling of w. This corresponds to r to the minus one half and these two r, the rescalings that I introduced at the beginning when I dropped the fidelity term. And then at each time I also change phase in a way that the set k now is somehow managed. Now is somehow mapped into the positive real x. So I'm unrolling the spiral essentially. And here I've written the harmonic conjugate of the real part of the complex square root. And actually, I've written the rescalings of that function, which is this function here. So what we do next is to rewrite both the necessary conditions, so the equation satisfied by any critical point. By the critical point in terms of these new couples theta and f. So, for instance, on the first line, you find the outer variation equation. And here, I have already separated the linear part from the non-linear terms. So, here we have the Reclaim boundary condition satisfied by W on the set K, which now simply rewrites as follow. And here I have written the inner variation, so the equation on the curvature. So, the equation on the curvature. So, on the left-hand side, we have the curvature in terms of theta, now the curvature of k in terms of theta. And on the right-hand side, there is the jump of the square root of, sorry, of the square modulus of the gradient of W through the interface. And finally, somehow, if you write down the weight result in terms of David result in terms of theta, Boneda Wid result in terms of theta and f, what you can prove is that provided you choose epsilon naught sufficiently small, whatever, if you have fixed sigma, delta and k, you can prove that theta and c k norm and the distance of f from the imaginary square root is small. Okay, so what we do next, okay, what we want to prove is that C2 alpha estimates C2 alpha estimates for the curvature at the tip. So essentially, what we want to prove is a decay estimate of, say, some H1 norm of theta exponential in time for t going to plus infinity. Okay, so what we do first is to linearize this nonlinear system for theta in zero and for f close to the imaginary square root function. So, what we do is essentially So, what we do is essentially more generally to consider a sequence of critical points. So, we rotate the angles in a way that theta j of zero is equal to zero and let the parameter epsilon naught in the Bonedavid result go to zero. And then we consider delta j, which is the distance in h2 of fj from the imaginary square root and of the h2 norms essentially of theta j, go to zero, and we rescale the functions and introduce these new couples vj and Introduce these new couples Vj and lambda j. And what we find is that somehow, thanks to the essentially the first equation here, you have some hidden compactness. So we can prove that we can pass to the limits on the couples Vj lambda j and find a couple V lambda which now satisfy a linear system. So here on the first line there is the linearization of the outer variation condition. outer variation condition written in terms of f and theta so the linearization is this equation here so here i have the declay boundary condition here there is the linearization of the equation on the curvature and here i keep track of the fact that the angles were adjusted in a way that in zero the equation so the the angles were zero so here is where more or less camillo and and i were stuck uh about And I were stuck about five years ago, but then taking inspiration from the paper by Anderson and Michaelian that I mentioned before, we realized that somehow there was something else that we could do. And we realized that there is actually some other condition that you can linearize. Let me say something like that. So essentially, what we realized that we were not We were not taking all the pieces of information that we could from the linear variation because we have only linearized the equation on the curvature, which is equivalent to the linear variation in case you know that k is a smooth graph, but in our situation it is not. So k has a singularity at the tip. So the equation that we derive for the curvature is only a consequence of the inner variation. There is something more that finally we call the singular inner variation. That finally we call the singular inner variation, and it is in the spirit of what Cabré said before when using the stability condition. What you want to do is to plug into the inner variation equation a field which is not compactly supported. Of course, you cannot do that. You have to argue by approximation. In a way that somehow, if eta is compactly supported, the second line here is zero. So you are back to the inner variation. The inner variation, otherwise, you get some boundary integrals which are the run the ones written down here. And if you choose appropriately the field eta, you have to choose it as a conformal vector field and then specific conformal vector field. You find an identity which linearized gives you this integral identity between V and lambda. And lambda. And really, this integral identity for us is crucial to conclude the argument that we already had some years ago with Camille. So I will tell you why this integral identity is so crucial. Before going on, let me tell you that actually there was already, it was already known one instance of this singular inner variation, and it is a formula which was independently obtained by David and Leger and Madeleine and Solimi. And Madalin and Solimi. And this formula was somehow needed to prove some rigidity results for global minimizer of the Man-Forshaw energy. So, in the end, we were able to embed this David-Legime-Madelein-Solimi formula in a broader family of new variations of which we take advantage to close our argument. So, let me tell you why this integral identity, this var condition, is really. This var condition is really important for us. So we have a linear system, and now we try to solve it explicitly. So it's convenient to split the even part of V with respect to the odd part. So even an odd with respect to pi. And actually, for the odd part, it's even more convenient to consider this function zeta, which is obtained by subtracting from the odd part this function written. This function written down here, because what you can prove is that a couple Vλ is a solution of the linear system if and only if the functions V E and zeta solves these two linear systems written down here. So the fact that zeta is convenient is because now you have an equation here which is lambda independent for zeta. Okay, and so now you try to solve explicitly these two linear systems, and of course it's a matter of a spectrum. And of course, it's a matter of spectral analysis. So, for the first system, it's very easy because you have the second derivative operator, you have in H1, actually on the subspace of even functions in H1, zero, actually, because of the boundary conditions. So you find the eigenvalues, and then you write down by separation of variables the solutions, and you find that these solutions have coefficients in time which are easy. Coefficients in time, which are either positive or negative exponentials. And then somehow you would like to get rid of the positive exponentials. But if you try to do the same for this second linear system, somehow the situation is much more difficult because of this unusual boundary condition, which we found in the literature is called Vensel-type boundary condition. Okay, you can still consider the second-order derivative. You can find a very natural bilinear. Find a very natural bilinear form on the space of odd functions, but this bilinear form is not an inner product, which makes the second-order derivative self-adjoint, but this bilinear form is not an inner product. Though you are able to find a Hilbert basis with respect to the usual H1 topology, and this Hilbert basis is made of eigenvalues for the second-order derivative, but there is an extra. The derivative, but there is an extra function which, when you write down the solution in terms of separation of variables, variables give rise to a very slowly decaying solution in time. And this is the enemy for our purposes, because we want to prove some estimates in terms of lambda, which are exponentially fast decaying in time. And we were not able to get rid of this solution until... Rid of this solution until we found this integral condition that I called var. Once you have the var condition, you get rid of this slowly decaying solution. And we have still to face the problem of considering the exponential, the positive exponentials, because the solutions corresponding to the values of the second order derivatives here give rise again to either positive or negative. Again, to either positive or negative exponentials. Okay, and to take into account the different exponentials, what we are able to prove is what we call a linear three-annuli property. So essentially, we are given three time intervals, which in terms of distance from the tips corresponds to three annuli. And we can cook up a functional which morally is given by the square h2 norm of lambda and the square h2 norm. The square H2 norm in space of V integrating in time, which satisfy the following property. So, what we do is comparison between the energy in two intervals. So, if the energy in the intermediate interval is sufficiently bigger than the energy in the first interval, actually what it happens is that in the third interval, the energy has quantitatively grown. Grown with respect to the energy in the intermediate interval. So essentially, this is telling you is that if it's telling you that if this condition is satisfying, you are growing exponentially. This is what positive exponentially in time. This is what will be the end of the story. So before doing that, let me tell you that we are able to export this linear 3-annual property into the non-linear setting. Into the nonlinear setting. So now we consider solution fθ of the nonlinear system. The functionality is essentially the same. Of course, we have to consider solutions of the nonlinear system which are in our linearization regime. And what you can prove, so here I've shifted the time intervals, and what you can prove is again that if the energy in the middle interval is sufficiently bigger than the energy in the first Efficiently bigger than the energy in the first interval. In the third interval, the energy is quantitatively bigger than the energy in the intermediate interval. So now we can say, okay, we can iterate this estimate here, because what happens is that either this condition is never satisfied, if it is never satisfied, you get by iteration that the energy in iteration that the energy in this interval kt k plus 1 t is exponentially smaller than the energy in the first interval or at some point for some k0 this first inequality is satisfied and then it will be satisfied always be satisfied and then what is it it is telling you that if it is satisfied so for some k0 actually the energy now is growing exponentially in time so we have really a dichotomy which distinguishes Dichotomy which distinguishes the presence or not of the positive exponential in the energy. But in our linearization regime, essentially the second alternative is not possible. So this is not possible and what you have proven is that you are always satisfying the first inequality. So essentially, this estimate here is never going to happen. So always the opposite inequality is true. And by iteration, you get the energy in the case. you get that the energy in the kt k plus 1t interval is exponentially decaying in time. Next, you use the coercivity property of the functional to prove that somehow you have an exponentially in time decay estimate for the H2 norm of theta and then you play with the with the regular somehow with the Regulate somehow with the fact that the solutions of the linear system has an exponential precise exponential decay in time to prove somehow that you can adjust the time t, the interval t, in a way that you can find the t and delta for which you get uh an estimate like this for the uh c one norm on the r on the of theta dot on the on the interval k t k plus one t. kt k plus 1t so you get that this c1 norm is decaying in time exponentially fast so if you rescale back essentially and you write down the curvature in terms of theta and dot and theta dot dot what you have found is that the curvature at the tip is decaying like some power of the radius of the distance and The radius of the distance, and this is precisely what you need to prove the C2 alpha irregularity of the set K up to the tip. And then, of course, by some more work, you can also prove that the set K is a smooth graph up to the tip. So, I think I'm done, and thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mateo, for this very nice talk. Let me ask if there is any question in the audience. Okay, maybe one. Can we get anything on this type of problem in 3D case, or do the gem become too complicated? Do the gem become too complicated in that case? Okay, there are some regularity results concerning the result that I quoted by Ambrose, Fusca, and Pallara actually holds in any dimension. Holds in any dimension. Of course, there is a different estimate on the singular set. And there is still an analogous result in three dimensions. As the one by Gita build. So if you are close to either a minimal cone, which is either the union of three hyperplane, hyper half planes meeting at the edge, forming equal angles, you have still a similar result. But for the tip, there is no result at all, like this. And what about if you take a power different from two? Different from two on the cradle, for example. Okay, there are some. I think, so I think the, I am, I don't remember precisely, I have to confess, but I think there is a some partial regularity result by that, similar to that by Ambrosio, Fuski, and Pallara. So it's not very rigid concerning this volume term. But all the rest or the detailed analysis of the set K is no longer available. Longer available. So it's very rigid in some sense. Right. Is there any other question from the audience? If not, let me thank you again very much, Matteo. And we will resume at eleven. At 11 Montaigne time. So we have a break of about a little more than half an hour, I think. And so see you after the break. I stopped recording. Yes, thank you.
