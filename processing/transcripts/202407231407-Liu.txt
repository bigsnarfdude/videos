Okay, thanks very much. It's my great pleasure to be able to present here. Sorry that I couldn't make it in person, got sick from a trip, so don't want to spread the germ to Canada. But really appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak here. I think thanks to Xian's wonderful talk, I think he set up the context really nicely. So I don't really So, I don't really need to introduce TWAS to this audience, but just want to mention that a central question in statistical genetics now is to link GWAS kits to the target gene. A lot of times, you can be right by linking it to the nearest gene. But a lot of times, since the genome is folded, so the target gene is not really the nearest gene in linear distance. A lot of times, it could be folded and the genes that are. Could be folded, and the genes that are being regulated are the ones that are closer in 3D genome space. So that complicates a little bit the techniques that we employ. But now we have this EQTL database that links genetic variations to the gene expressions, and they do the analysis like they would do with the GWAS. You know, this offers us a powerful set of tools. Powerful set of tools and allow us to rigorously link genetic variations to the target gene they regulate. I think Xian already talked about this. So TWAS is a very, you know, very powerful approach, very popular, which can allow us to link genetic variations to target genes using a two-step procedure as shown online. So there are numerous approaches. So there are numerous approaches developed in the past few years. The approach usually starts with making predictions for gene expression levels. So that's where the variable selection techniques are directly applicable. So you can apply approaches like LaSoul-based approach based on variable selection or more powerful. more uh more powerful uh like non-parametric uh regression bayesian regression or you know approaches like group la so like at most that uh borrow strands across different tissues to make the prediction predictions more accurately and there are also methods that not only look at genetic variation but look at annotation information which allows us to better prioritize predictors and allow us to improve the prediction accuracy by prioritize Prediction accuracy by prioritizing variance that is more likely to be functional. So, another source of useful information we can incorporate is what we call the 3D genome information. So, genomes are organized in a highly structured way in a 3D space. So, those 3D structures, 3D genome structures are highly conserved and play very important roles. And by technologies that are And by technologies like 3D genome confirmation capture, you can assay in a high throughput way the 3D genome organizations, and we can know which part of the genomes are closer to each other in a 3D genome space. And we can incorporate those information to define the regulatory regions and incorporate those informations to allow us to prioritize regulatory variants of importance to predict gene expression levels. expression levels. So we came up with this relatively straightforward approach done by the work by our student Boom. So the idea is fairly simple. So we start off with a set of, you know, two, you know, two set of predictors. One is what we call the essential predictors, which are the ones that which are the ones that are overlapping epigenetic. Overlapping epigenetic annotations. And also, the non-essential predictors are ones that are not overlapping. And we try to distinguish them by assigning slightly different penalties. So we have what we call this mitigation parameter. So this parameter allows us to assign a lesser penalty to the central predictors, basically allowing them more likely to be retained in the model. To be retained in the model when we apply this shrinkage and variable selection. And we can choose different values of the mitigation parameter, the regular tuning parameters, and also the window size that we can define using either the linear distance from the gene or the 3D genome-based windows incorporating the genome confirmation information. We can choose these tuning parameters via standard procedures like NASIC. Standard procedures like NASID cross-validation, which allows us to select the set of tuning parameters that give us the most accurate gene expression prediction accuracy, gene expression prediction. So this approach originally developed, it was developed for individual level information. But as we can see from GWAS, the largest data set usually comes from consortium studies. That usually comes from consortium studies, from which we only usually only have available summary statistics. So it's very important to extend the ideas to summary statistics. And also the single-cell EQTLs also becomes available, which, you know, from which we can isolate not only the regulatory effects that are broadly prevalent in all cell types, but also the regulatory effects that are specific. Regulatory effects that are specific to certain cell types. So we came up with this idea of ESPRESSO, which extends the idea of promise. So the difference is that ESPRSO can be utilized to summary statistics. So LIDAW lead the work. So the formula, the loss function is the same. The main challenge when we deal with summary statistics is to estimate the true. Statistics is to estimate the tuning parameters. We can no longer do things like NASIC cross-validation while we only have some reliable statistics. So we came up with this idea called a pseudo-variable selection, which allow us to select tuning parameters without having to rely on individual level data. So this is very similar to the idea of knockout in FDR control in statistics. So basically, the idea is The idea is to come up with a set of pseudo-variables, it's a set of null variables that is not associated with the outcome of interest. So we simulate, we generate them based upon the same covariance structures as the original, the real predictor. But since it's simulated, we know it's not really associated with the outcome. So if we can vary the tuning parameters, and since we know these set of variables are not Know these set of variables are not associated with the outcome of interest. We want to vary the tuning parameters to make sure none of these variables are selected. So we can choose the tuning parameters that allow us to retain the most real variables, but retain none of the pseudo-variables. So those are the tuning parameters we end up choosing, and those are the ones that we will use for subsequent predictions of gene expression levels. So this approach. So, this approach works very well. So, we did some real data comparisons. So, we compare the medium R-square, which is the prediction accuracy measured by the correlations between the measured and predicted gene expressions. So, expresso are the variable that the method we come up with. The PBS is pseudo-variable selection. So, we compare them with a few alternative methods. Most of them are extended. of them are general uh extensions of uh uh you know the genetic rescore methods uh isdpr duration process regression um prs csosam pumas and algebra2 are all prs methods adapted to making predictions on gene expression levels and this is the pruning based upon a period of threshold of 0.01 and 0.05 so as you can see i express all As you can see, expressal consistently yield higher prediction accuracies. We can also compare the accuracy based upon the fraction of models, genes, where the predicted and measured expressions are strongly correlated. In this particular comparison, Expresso also outperforms alternative methods, which shows our work is useful in terms of improving prediction accuracies. And we also look at the model. And we also look at the model end up being selected. Remember that we can choose the models based upon the ones defined based upon linear distance and the ones based upon the 3D genome distances. As you can see, overall, the linear distance-based windows still got selected a lot of times, but on average, the 3D genome-based windows got selected half of the time, meaning that incorporating 3D genome information would be very helpful. Would be very helpful. And also, the mitigation parameters allow us to assign lesser penalty for essential predictors. And what is the mitigation parameter we end up choosing? The ones that are assigning lesser penalties got selected a lot of the times. And the mitigation parameter without mitigation here, the value of one, only got selected around 20% of the time. It shows incorporating annotation information is helpful. Annotation information is helpful for us to predict the more accurate prediction expression levels. So, we apply this to a set of autoimmune disease, which is my main interest of my group currently. So, there are 14 disease, which are highly genetically correlated. We primarily focus on lupus, which is a disease that we study a lot in the group. So, in terms of the In terms of the applying this to GWAS data sets, the method not only allows us to improve the prediction accuracy, but more importantly, allow us to identify a bigger number of novel loci and also a bigger number of known loci compared to alternative methods, meaning that, you know, especially for known loci, we know it's more likely to be true. So being able to identify a bigger number demonstrate the improved power for The improved power for the R method. So, what is the advantage of looking at single-cell EQTLs? So, we look at this comparison based upon the results from whole blood TOS and also the results based upon cell type-specific EQTLs. As you can see, we rank the genes based upon the effects on whole blood. You know, the middle region are the ones. You know, the middle region are the ones that are not significant in whole blood TOS, but are significant in cell type level TOS. As you can see, the genes in the middle region tend to have very heterogeneous effects across different cell types, meaning that these set of genes are more likely to be missed if you're using bulk tissue for TWAS, but will be likely to be picked up by. Will be likely to be picked up by cell type-specific TWAS. So we identified a few genes, including the cytokine receptor CCR1 genes, which is known to be very important to stimulate immune cells. And there's ample evidence suggesting they could be very important for arthritis in mouth models. And we show them, I will show them, we demonstrate them in human TWAS. Human TWAS. Another example is the platelet growth factor receptor gene, which is also very important for cellokine interactions. And it has been shown to be associated to be relevant for SLE. And our results link them in human as well. One question we seek to understand is: can we actually use the TWAS results to inform the drug development? Inform the drug development. Obviously, we do not love drugs directly ourselves, but we can see whether a drug may be repurposed, which can be a very cost-effective procedure. So we utilize two complementary approach. One is to look at can the molecule, drug molecule consistently reverse gene threshold for disease in a disease-relevant cell type. The other approach if we look at is whether a particular drug target pathways are enriched with disease-associated genes. With disease-associated genes. Taking this two-complementary approach would allow us to identify which drug molecules may be repurposed. So, thankfully, we have this CMAP database that systematically categorized how the molecules modify gene expressions in cell lines. They did the experiment across nine cell lines, mostly cancer cell lines, and allow us to examine how the model. How the molecule changes gene expressions in a very systematic way. And so we wanted to look at which cell lines may be relevant for us. So we wanted to look at which cell types are the most important. So we look at the cell type enrichment for SLE, for example. We identified B cells as a cell type that most enriched with SLE HIDS, which is very consistent with the biology. Consistent with the biology. And also, we wanted to look at which cell lines are most relevant, most similar to B cell. So, we look at these kinds of cell lines in black color and the disease cell types in red color. Remember that B cells are the ones we identify to be relevant for SLE. And we have this Hype G2 that cluster together with B cells, meaning that this cell type may be the most relevant cell type to understand the gene. To understand the gene expression signatures related to B cells. So, this is the cell type we will be using for drug repurposing analysis. So, how do we look at drug target enrichment? So, we can look at the z-scores from TWAS, and we can also encode the genes and pathways in the indicator matrix. If the gene implicated in TWAS, implicated in TWAS is part of a particular pathway, the indicator variable is one and it's zero otherwise. So we can do this multivariate regressions and we can see whether a particular pathway are enriched with TWAS hits. So this is a very similar approach to magma where we were extending it to perform enrichment analysis in TWAS. So we can do this for drugs. So, we can do this for drug target pathways. So, we look at a number of drugs where the gene expression signatures are profiled in the CMAL database. So, we identified a number of genes, and you can see you can use the tau score, which measures how consistently the drug may be reversing the gene expressions. The lower the tau score is, the more relevant the drug may be for curing the disease. maybe for curing the disease. And also the asterisk are the ones that are showing the drug target enrichment results. So we identified a couple of drugs. One is metaformine for type 1 diabetes. And metaformine has been shown to be effective for insulin resistant type 2 diabetes. But here we show that it also can be very useful for decreased glucose concentrations. Manadon is Manadong is a drug that is implicated for arthritis colitis, arthritis colitis. But we also show that it's as a vitamin K drug, it is very important to mediate the immune responses and very relevant for UC treatment as well. So finally, you can, we want to show quickly that using the cell type aware drug repurposing type 1, the cat. Drug repurposing pipeline, the cuttery, allow us to identify drugs with consistent lower tall score values and also showing stronger results in drug target enrichment analysis, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of drug repurposing analysis. So with that, I conclude by saying that we develop a useful approach to integrate cell type-specific EQTLs. Cell type-specific EQTLs, which allow us to identify drug-harvages that may be missed by bulk EQTLs. And also, the cell type-aware drug-repurposing pipelines can allow us to identify drugs with lower TOP scores and stronger drug target enrichments, which, you know, these drugs remains to be seen in practice, in animal models, in experiments, whether they're valid, but from the computational aspects, it seems to be more. Aspects, it seems to be more relevant. So, with that, I want to thank my collaborators, Laura Hara and Nancy Olson, both of whom taught us a lot about biology and genomics. And most of the work here presented are done by my excellent student, Lida Wang. And I want to thank my group and the funding support as well. Thanks very much, and I welcome questions.
