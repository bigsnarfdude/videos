So, welcome everybody again. It's a great pleasure to have it all here. Thanks for the topic. It's also a great pleasure for me to introduce the third speaker of the conference, Arnold Pakura from IPO, who is going to talk about N-LaPlus systems with anti-symmetric potential. All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks to the organizers for having me. Yes, so I would present first. Yes, so I will present first of all a joint work with Dorian Martino, who is like a PhD student, soon almost done with Paul Laurent in Paris. And I want to talk about something which are critical points. Motivate from geometry, I will explain this, but really all we can do is analysis. So I will start with the theorem and then I will explain a little bit why one could care, why one thinks it may not. Here, why one thinks it may not be applicable to anything with meaning. But okay, just to, I will define everything later, right? So, what I want to look at is really analysis, or what we can do is really analysis. So, it's about the P N La plus. Again, there will be some geometric motivation at least a little bit later. We have the N La plus, so divergence of grad U and minus 2 grad U is an anti-symmetric matrix omega times. Symmetric matrix omega times, well, this guy repeated, grad u n minus one. Um, and this omega is anti-symmetric, it's in some not really LP space, it's a Lorentz space. I will define it and kind of give a little bit of motivation by this, you know, what this means. But let's say it's an LN, a little bit better than Ln. There's a curl condition on this omega, which I wrote here as like a zero order, zero difference derivative order curl. Order curl, pretty strong condition, but it's natural once you assume this. So, this is not really a condition, it just comes out of this. And the statement is: if you have a solution in this PDE, right, which is in W1N, so it may not be continuous, it's actually continuous, right? So it's like a very tiny improvement of regularity for PDEs. The main point is this anti-symmetric term, right? Or this anti-symmetric potential, if you want to call it that way. If you can write a very If you can write a very similar-looking guy with all these conditions where, well, omega is not anti-symmetric and log log1 over x is the solution. Log log1 over x is the standard counterexample in W1n, which is not continuous and that appears as counterexample to many geometric PDEs that are at this limit of continuity. So screwing with the anti-symmetry kills the regularizing property of this PDE. Property of this PDE. So, this is one feature. And it comes out of the theory, as I will explain, of n-harmonic maps. This is the motivation. We cannot do anything with n-harmonic maps, but kind of we were motivated by it. So, I want to start with the harmonic map theory that leads us to this kind of system where we may or may not care about it, and then talk about what we actually can do and not do. All right, so let's forget about N. Let's go to more. Let's go to more geometry. So, harmonic maps is simply, I assume that most are familiar with this profound. Let's do it. You take a map from, say, M-dimensional set into a manifold. M is like a manifold, usually closed smooth for all matters and purposes. Smooth manifold, think about the sphere. And here we usually are you play them because the domain doesn't really play so much role if you talk. Play so much role if you talk about regularity. Okay, and so you have a side condition. All the maps that you consider go into this manifold. So when you look at the Lagrange equation, you see some non-linearity out of this Lagrange multiplier kind of thing. And one way to write this is that the Laplacian, the first variation of the Dirichlet energy, is zero in the sense of the tangent manifold, target manifold. So this is what the Laplacian of U is orthogonal. Plausion of u is orthogonal to the tangent plane at every point of the target. And this is like saying, well, it's zero in the sense of the target. Easiest example to have in mind, one dimension in the domain that's a geodesic. It's a weird way of writing the geodesic equation. Maybe not this very interesting case. The other one is: okay, say m is always compact, just for simplicity and smooth, but you could take formally at least m equals the Euclidean space. And there's no condition here, and then you just. And there's no condition here, and then you just get harmonic component-wise harmonic functions. Also, nothing really interesting in the sense of relative theory. So, the interesting case already is kind of really the target being a sphere. Or a little bit more interesting, this is what we are not able to do, is like a target where you have a sphere and a little bit of a bump, not a fully round sphere. And then, of course, you can classify or very easily rewrite this equation. The tangent plane to the sphere at a point is simply Here at a point is simply orthogonal to the point itself, right? And then you have like a reformulation that I wrote down on the next slide. So these equations can be written in a more point-wise sense without some orthogonality in this way. So generally, you see the second fundamental form, right? The projection into the tangent, orthogonal to the tangent plane. Or in the sphere case, it becomes particularly nice. You have Laplacius U grad U squared. And I want to look at this from the P perspective. And I want to look at this from the PDE perspective because all we can do is really PDE, right? We cannot do anything about geometry. So, in one dimension, there's no problem. This is an ODE, and you know, it's sub-critical, and so you just bootstrap to regularity. So, I don't want to talk about this. Now, in two dimensions, this equation as a PDE becomes interesting, right? And the reason for this is if you just take like Heidelberg-Zygman theory, so you just take growth on both sides, what you see is that this log log 2 over x is the standard count example to equations of this form. Two equations of this form. Well, again, if you take absolute values, right? So if you have plus u equals red u squared, both sides in two dimensions have kind of the same integral regularity, I don't know, weight, right? And so you have counterexamples to smoothness. So you find solutions to such equations which are non-smooth. Okay? So from PD perspective, if you want to talk about regularity, there must be something interesting happening here for this equation. Happening here for this equation, which doesn't happen here, right? Because you have to have some cancellation. Because from the growth perspective, this PDE is bad, right? It has singularity, it creates singularity, it lost no singularity. In two dimensions, also you have like a solution to this equation, which is actually a geometric solution. This X over mod X, the hedgehog, right? You just tug it in. It solves this in some sense with the minimizer, but in two dimensions, it's ruled out because it has infinite energy. Okay? So in Okay, so in 2D, there is like a very crazy solution to this, which rules out regular gravity, but it's ruled out just by the assumption that you want to have finite energy. So in two dimensions, something is at least cancelled. Once you go to higher dimensions, domain, right, higher dimensions x of mod x is a real to God solution to this equation. It's actually minimizer. And so you cannot assume, or you cannot hope for solutions to such equations in three or higher dimensions to be continuous because x. To be continuous because x over mod x is not continuous. Right, so two dimensions is quickly the case. In three dimensions, you can talk about half regularity for minimizers. I don't want to go into this, but if you look at the PDE, the PD is just not regularizing. You have solutions for this equations, which are nowhere continuous. So, I want to focus on the critical dimension only, where essentially the geometric solution is ruled out. Solution is ruled out right by technicality, okay. And now the question is: well, what you know, this is very classical in the 1990s, right? So what is special about the PDE here that does not appear here? And of course, it's some cancellation, right? So something cancels for this PDE that doesn't cancel here, because this has non-smooth solutions. Well, here we can show that all the solutions are C infinity. Solutions are C infinity. All right, and this is a diff curl, right? And this is the rough history, of course, very shortened, right? This is the 90s. Solutions to such equations are smooth. This is a law first for the sphere, then for general manifolds. And then, in like a more absurd sense that I will introduce by Reverend 15 years later, solutions to these equations are always Lipschitz. And even more generality that I want to introduce later. And the reason for that. Later, and the reason for that is so there's something better about the right than about the left, and it's a diff curve, right? And this is due, I'm not quite sure about the history, but my understanding is this is Chathard discovered this conservation law. So once your solution to this equation, all the signs are wrong, by the way, right? It must be minus sign somewhere, I don't care. So this sign is important, this sign here is not. All right, so once your solution to this PDE, you can check this is equivalent, this is direct computation. This direct computation to that you have like you know a conservation law, the diversions of something is zero, right? It's direct computation because you have a lot of cancellations, right? You have grad ui, grad uj, this kind of cancels here. And if this guy hits this, you have the scalar behavior, scalar factor from zero itself, so it can swap. So the first observation, which I understand is due to Shatan, but I don't know, is that this equation can be rewritten in divergence form, and then the second observation. Divergence form and then the second observation due to Illinois is that you can add this guy, you can find this guy on the right-hand side of this equation. Right, this is a simple trick. You just add this guy, uj grad ui, you sum over the uj's, and you use that uj is orthogonal to the sphere, and the derivative of something is tangential to the sphere, so you have cancellation. And now you have that the Laplace of U, maybe with a minus in front, doesn't matter, is actually a div curl turbine. And that's enough. And that's enough. We had this W12 scale, so B of O, and this slight improvement here is enough to kick you over the border to get into continuity. Right? Because now we have this result by Kotman Laws Mega SMs. If you have a diff curve term, which kind of would add up to L1, right? So you have the divergence for your fun F, the curve 3G, and you multiply them, and they're both in L2. So they should be in L1, but actually they're not in L1, but they're in the Hardy state. They're also in L1. But they're in the Hardy space, they're also in L1, but they're particularly more in the Hardy space. Um, and the Hardy space is kind of harmonic analytic, the kind of the replacement for L1, where Cardon-Sigmund theory still works, right? And so, for example, what works is the Laplace of Us in the Hardy space, the second derivatives are in L1. This is wrong if the Laplace of Us in L1, right? This again, same example, log log2 over X counter example. Um, two dimensions you and W21, then two dimensions if you're. In two dimensions, if you're W1, you're continuous, right? And that's kind of the kick, a little bit of improvement in the PDE that leads you to continuity of solutions, and then you can bootstrap, right? Then we can just differentiate the equation and bootstrap to regularity. All right, so moral of the story seems to be somehow a diff curl for this harmonic map type of PDEs, at least in the sphere case. We only look at the sphere case here. Well, the diff curl saves us and kind of moves us from this critical W12 into the continuity range, and then the PDE starts regularizing. All right, so div curl is important. Now, if you want to look at the general PDE, so like the second, you find the second fundamental form instead of just the U. Here you kind of can try to do the same trick, right? So you just rewrite this thing, the second fundamental form has like awesome analogy properties. Of some analogy properties, so you can add and subtract things, but you lose divergence-freeness. Okay, so you can rewrite this in some form, but then you have no reason to believe, I assume it's always wrong, that this is divergence-free. So you don't have, or you might be afraid that you don't have a diff curl. Elar solved this with like a moving frame technique. And kind of a different way to see this is this argument by Riviere. Instead of looking here at this divergence. Instead of looking here at this divergence-freedom of this guy, it's not divergence-free, that's it, he observed that what we still have, more than a square of something, a notation, an anti-symmetry of this guy. We call this omega, and this guy is anti-symmetric in these components omega ij. And now there is this gauge theory, the Ulnbach gauge or the Coulomb gauge, right? That kind of comes, I think, from Young Miltz at some originally. Which essentially says if you have an anti-symmetric potential of this form, I mean, this is the analytic form of the formulation, then you can make it divergence-free in a certain sense. Anti-symmetric potentials are related to divergence-free quantities. In this sense, essentially you can rotate this omega and you add this P transpose where P is an orthogonal map in the same energy class as this omega, right? Energy class as is omega, right? Grain of P is as good as omega. So P is in W12 in our case, and it's a rotation. And then this guy is divergence free. And funny enough, if you look at the PDE, when you rotate the PDE with this P, so it's kind of rotation. Well, it's essentially a moving frame. If you rotate the equation, we find exactly this divergence free term now on the right-hand side. And originally the grain of U, which is curved free. Originally the grain of u, which is curved three, of course, times a little bit annoying term which doesn't matter in two dimensions, right? So you get a diff curve term times something which is w on two and l infinity. Okay, and this is still enough for regularity, right? So you don't have really an honest to God diff curl term, but you have diff curl terms times something, which, you know, it is not too bad. And so this is enough to get regularity, right? First, continuity, then again. Continuity, and then again, you can just bootstrap. You still have some Haley space time something. Okay, you can also rewrite this further and get a conservation law since we cannot do any of this what I want to talk about. I will skip this. But essentially, this is what you can do. So, this is kind of the regularity theory for harmonic maps. So, if you're in the sphere case or very Lie group case, like very round target, you get an honest to God diff curl term, and then you essentially have a Hardy space or whatever you want to use. A Hardy space or whatever you want to use there, like use like diff curl theory. In general, my default case, you kind of use like a rotation of the PDE and you get still a diff curl term time something, or you work a little bit harder to get a real conservation. All right, and then you get your continuity. And once you have continuity, that's all you need to get, since we're creating PDE, to get, well, whatever you want. And now, once this was done, I mean, learn stuff already, people started to move. People started to move, well, who can debate why? To n-harmonic maps. So the idea is just take the two everywhere and replace it with n. Okay, search replace in your tag file and you get this. So you get the integrated u to the n, and now you go from an n-dimensional domain, you focus on the m equals n case, right? Because you want to be critical into a manifold. I mean, nothing changes, right? You just replace this guy everywhere, right? You just put this guy everywhere. The gradient u to the n minus two appears. The grain u to the m minus 2 appears at the first variation of this guy. And this variations didn't change, right? So this is still orthogonal to the tangent plane of the target. Nothing changes there. Have a little bit of propaganda why you would care, could care, right? First of all, this is a conformally invariant variational functional in n dimensions, right? But maybe this is geometrically more reasonable to look at as the Dirichlet energy, but I can debate it. I look at this, I mean, because all we can do is analysis. I claim I look at this. We can do this analysis. I claim I look at this for analysis reasons, right? So, analytically, this becomes a very non-linear operator. I mean, this is a really weird PDE, right? So, because it's non-linear here in the main order, it becomes tough to work with it. But okay, well, either you take those reasons or you don't. This is what we do. So, well, you try to do the same things. Clearly, nothing changes. Do the same things clearly, nothing changes, so we just do the same, right? And this is what people did pretty shortly after Lorenz work, it was in the 90s, right? You have like three groups that I'm aware of that got the same result. If you have an n-harmonic map into a sphere or a V group, you have your regularity. Okay, and the proof is exactly the same, right? It's an adaptation, you have to observe something, obviously, but it's the same proof. It's the conservation law, and you write it down, and it works. So, clearly, this shows. It works so clearly, this should work for any manifold, right? So, you write down the RevS system, right? Again, it has the same thing as before, you just add this guy everywhere, right? And you can rotate things, but this is where it stops, right? So you can only do the sphere case, you can do nothing about regularity in the non-spherical case. So when you take the sphere, you take a very small, tiny bump, epsilon large, you can choose the epsilon. We don't know anything. Okay? Why? Okay, why? Because diff curl doesn't mean anything here, right? So, for example, if you have this sort of system with like this anti-symmetric matrix coming out of the second fundamental form, you rotate, you get a diff curl, no problem. You have a diff curl times this guy. And you're screwed. Because diff curl times cycle rotation is a pretty nice operation. But div curl times grad mu to the n minus 2 doesn't have any meaning. It doesn't regularize, it doesn't have any Hardy space. Regularized and have any hardy space to it or not. So essentially, the story stopped here. We can do spheres, we can do Lie groups, but we cannot do anything else. There's also a version of this H system that I don't really want to get into. We cannot do anything really because we don't really know what we do with a diff curve system, even if it's a real Jacobian, times anything. This kind of destroys, well, everything. Well, everything because Carlo-Sigmund theory doesn't already work that well with this operator. And well, so the question that you could one could ask ourselves, right? This is kind of the leading question here, is, well, what does it tell us really that this guy's diversion theory doesn't seem to mean anything, right? Okay, so okay, so we can look into some observations, right? Into some observations, right? I mean, we cannot do anything, so we try to see what, well, some here, observations. Okay. So again, omega is this rotated P transpose grad P plus P omega P transpose thing. What do we know if this guy is divergence free? Well, okay. So one observation that you can have that many people had, nothing yet new, right, is that, well, usually the omega comes out of the second fundamental form. comes out of second fundamental form, right? So it's second fundamental form applied to grad U. So it's actually of this type, right? It's almost curl-free. Not diversions free, but it's almost curl-free, right? Almost is debatable, but almost curl. So what does this mean? What does this tell us? Almost curl-free in the sense doesn't tell us anything because there's this grade u n minus two term that destroys everything. But curl-freeness means, well, the actual meaning. Well, the actual meaning of curl-freedom, almost curl-freed, means if you compute the curl, we get a product of two gradients. One should be a curve, but doesn't matter, right? So we get a product of two guys, fair enough, and this guy is an ln2. Okay, that's not very cool because that doesn't help us any, right? We know that the derivative of something is an ln half. The guy itself, best thing you kind of have, is an ln. All right. However, so this is the tiny observation you can make is. Is the tiny observation you can make? Is if the derivative of something is an ln half, you actually know that the guy itself is not an ln half, it's in an ln, it's an ln comma n half, where this is a Lorentz. So there's a tiny improvement about a function whose, in this case, second derivative is an ln half over a function whose first derivatives is an ln. And this is at the scale of these Lorentz space, well, coefficients. Coefficients. All right. And so this is an observation, and I want to now introduce these Lorentz spaces. And I don't think this definition is useful unless you know it, right? Essentially, Lorentz spaces is a way of integrating functions which is a little bit finer than just the LP spaces. It includes the LP spaces, but it does it a little bit finer by looking at superliable sets of the function. This is the formal definition, right? So you integrate up a certain rearrangement. Up a certain rearrangement, the decreasing rearrangement of the function with a certain weight, and you have now two coefficients: the p, which is really the L P norm, and then a secondary weight, which is Q. All right. Okay, you can do that. And I claim that either you know what this means or this definition is not really helpful. So, here are the main properties of Lorentz spaces, the numerology that we care about. They contain the usual LP space, and LPP is the usual LP. PP is the usual LP. Okay, so whenever we have LPP, we just look at the LP, vice versa. And now they have an ordering. So they are stronger and weaker ones. And the statement is the smaller the exponent, the secondary exponent, the stronger the assumption is. So LP1 is a strong assumption, LP is a normal assumption, LP infinity is weak LP. That's a very weak assumption. They are all at this LP scale, but this is a weaker assumption to be in L P infinity. Weaker assumption to be an L P infinity than it would be an L P one. So if we have a PE, we would like to show things are an L P1 and maybe we have to use that thumb thing as an L P infinity. All right, so this is kind of the order and this typical example we have in mind that we all know is kind of this x to the negative alpha guy, right? If alpha is less than n. This is a no L P space on Rn, because locally it's integrable of some L P and then outside it's integrable of some other L P, right? But it's exactly Lp, right, but it's exactly in this weak ln over alpha space, right? So, this is the example I have in mind of a function which is not an LP space but in Lorentz space. And the part of this function is that this is the kernel of the Ries potential. So it is when we kind of take Sovolette embeddings, right? This is the guy we see. Okay, and now we have the two inequalities that we always use. Paulus inequality is just what you would assume. These are interpolation spaces, so there's no surprise here. The product. No surprise here. The product is just behaving as estimated by the two guys, and these behave just like the Holocale, as they should. The somewhat, maybe, at first, surprising result is the convolution inequality. And well, the first just behave as always, right? This piece, they behave just as they would with convolution. But the point is, these are interpolation spaces. So all the other guys behave still like Holder. Yeah? It should be always. One question: it should be always in the Lorentz space on the left, Q1, Q1. Um, where? Ah, yeah, that should be Q1, right? The I should be the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Signs are wrong and also sub-indices alternatively or indices. Yeah, yeah, but you're absolutely right. Right? But so the point here is that the secondary, this weaker exponent, behaves still in the broader sense. Behave still in the Palder sense. And that's very good if you multiply with these guys, because that's what the solar fembling is about. And so, for example, if you have a divergence preterm, right, then you can write, this is just a Hodge decomposition, right? So you have that this guy says divergence form because he chose to put long pages. Then divergence doesn't do anything. And the rotation, well, this is the risk potential of order one. I write it in the fraction of a plus. Write in the fraction of a plushie. It's essentially the convolution with this guy, we have here one minus n. And this guy, we said, is an L and Ha. So since we have the secondary convolution law, we see that this guy now, the secondary exponent, doesn't change at all. So instead of being that this omega p, which should be an ln, since we know something about the derivatives, we get that it's an ln in half. All right. So. All right, so when we have this curl, right, we not only get that actually it's divergence-free in our setting, we also get a slight, I mean, it's a ridiculously slight increase of LP properties. Now, is that useful? No, not at all. All right, but there's some motivation that we thought this might be helpful. It's not, but well, it's this one, right? So this is always done by doing some. Right, so this is always done by doing some injury in the scalar case. So when we go into R1, QPD has nothing to do with geometry. And it's not really written, but it's essentially follows from the arguments in the vectorial case, but like a more recent thing, and it's really what we use, which is the following. If you have our n la plus system and you know for some reason that this guy, omega, no anti-symmetry, no curve, nothing, just this guy is an LN1. One, then you get that solutions are continuous, even dipshits. Again, I will always talk about continuity because that's what we care about, but you know, you always get a little bit more. All right. And as I said, this is the result we needed. I mean, the result we have to adapt it, it didn't work, but in principle, this is what we need, right? This factorial paper by Pussy and Vinjo. So, what we have seen now, if we rotate our system, we get an increase. We get an increase in the Lorentz scale of this omega. The Coulomb gauge improves this guy. And the idea was, can we use that? And as I said, the answer is no. This is what we can do. So we have the Pilar class, rotate, and we get that this is a little bit better. Now, there are two things which are very annoying. First thing is, this is not LN1. First thing is, this is not an LN1, which is the smallest possible, yeah, not possible, but you know, it's very small scale. This is Ln and H. Unless N equals two, but we don't care about any of this because there are other techniques to deal with it. And this is N and one. So that's one thing we immediately fail with this argument. The other one is the NLA plus is very susceptible in the vectorial case to distortions. So if you rotate something, you're screwed. Essentially, Screwed. Essentially, the way I understand it, there is kind of a structure which is called this Ulnbeck structure, Ulnbeck type, that essentially means that you can look at this analog function component-wise, then you can view with it. If you rotate here in the target, you're out of this Umbeck type. So you don't have any theory, right? Regularity theory essentially felt. C1 alpha is not known. All right, so we have two problems that we cannot deal with, right? First, we have Right, first, we have to rotate the equation in the end divergence free die and have some improvement at the Lorentz space scale. And second of all, the rotation screws is everything, right? So, the rotation screws everything, and we don't really get a good Lorentz. So, as analysis people, we just change the assumption, right? And this is where we leave any geometric meaning, but well, we get something analytically, at least. So, this is the statement we can prove if this anti-symmetric. Proof if this anti-symmetric guy, this is the first slide, right? So, if this guy is an LN2, strong assumption, right? Certainly, geometrically not motivated at all. And the curl is an L and one. Now, this is not really a condition. If you assume this structure that the omega is the second fundamental form times the gradient, this is immediate out of the first assumption. All right, so this is just to make it analytically closed without any geometric assumptions. So, if the curl anti-direction. The curl, antiderivative curve, is in this ln1, then, well, the solution to this equation regularizes. And again, right, once you drop the anti-symmetry, you have all these conditions. The log log to a x guy will satisfy this, and the curve will be zero, and you know, you have no continuity. So, essentially, the best we can do is that we get something like a regularizing property of anti-symmetric potentials for the N-log class. antisymmetric potentials for the NLAR class, which are somehow non-trivial. I hope, I claim, I don't know. And now, this is one point. Now, there's a little bit of propaganda again, right? There have been, since nobody can do anything for like general manifolds or even tinily distorted very round manifolds, right? There have been a lot of partner results, which are something like assume that u is not in w1n, but assume it's in wn half, 2. in w n half comma two then you have regularity right all these results are a subset of this at least all the results i'm aware right this assumes no further integrability or differentiability except at this lorent space scale for this on right and this implies all these results at least that i'm aware of um that assumed like higher differentiability or anything just because of sobliff embedding right and you can extend this to the age system but i don't really want to go H system, but I don't really want to go into this, and you get a similarly bad geometric result, right? So it's purely analytic. Now, how would we want to prove this result? Well, I mean, essentially this few times. So we use this gauge, this rotation. We still, I mean, we make this use for the weight maps, by the way, very similarly, right? So for the weight maps, you don't use really diff curl, you use really just. curl you use really just gross properties of dip curl right so um anyways so the if you doesn't it so you use this gauge right um that rotates the equation to make this omega divergence free and essentially you get that um well everything behaves like omega right the rotation the gradient of the rotation behaves exactly like result and now use hotch decomposition so you say either we care about this Either we care about this divergence guy, which is zero, so we don't care about it. And we look at the curl guy. In the curl guy, we have two curl terms, right? This one is a different curl term. You can take the curl, it's gradient times something. And this guy, we assume that the curl behaves better. And so we get, well, the curl of this guy behaves very nice. And this guy is now, because it's a product of two ln half, two guys, it becomes an ln half, one guy. And this implies One guy, and this implies we cannot deal any at all with anything about the divergence, but we know that this expression is now ln1. So the strongest kind of the limit case of these lnq bases, if you don't want to go with no one. Okay, so that's the idea, right? We rotate the equation and then we now, with these extra assumptions, which have no geometric reasoning whatsoever, pure PDE at this stage, we get at least that this side becomes into ln1. comes into LN1. So that's immediate, right? This is just a little hotch. So the result that we have to show is once we have a rotated equation and we have an LN1 potentially here, no anti-symmetry, nothing needed, right? Then the solutions are continuous, polar continuous, probably Lipschitz. Okay, so this is what we have to show. This is kind of immediate out of like watch decomposition. It out of like much decomposition. All right, so we have to prove this, right? Now, how do we prove this? It's very easy. Very, very easy. Well, okay, this guy here's an L1, right? So by standard colour sequence theory, you would assume that the L1 norm here controls the Ln prime norm of this guy, the Ln prime norm. The ln prime norm, a weak ln prime norm, and now you have this n minus one term which you take out. So you want to have this, you assume you have this inequality, right? The ln infinity norm is controlled by the l1 norm of this guy. Again, if n equals 2, this is exactly true, just how to school theory, right, the level case, the weak L1 to whatever embedding. So this inequality should be true. So, this inequality should be true. And then it's very easy. Then we get the Ln, the weak Ln norm to the power n minus one is controlled by this. Now we look at the L1 norm of the right-hand side. We see again the weak Ln norm times the LN1 norm, because this is the scale that we have for a holder sending block. Now, if we are LN1 on small scales, this is very small. And so we have a decay estimate up to some cutoff R, right? We have that the weak Ln norm has a decay. That the weak Ln norm has a decay on small balls. This can be iterated, and we have holo regularity because we have the LN scale, which is at the BMO scale, and you know, we're a little bit better than BMO, so we are holding it. So once we have this chain of inequalities, we are done. This is trivial. This is a problem. Well, this, you know, this is the main problem we have to solve, right? Because this inequality is known if this P is an identity. Again, this P destroys the Ullenbeck structure. This P destroys the Ulbeck structure for this PDE. And so this is not known if P is even, well, if P is holder, it's probably easy to show. I'm not even sure about that state. Because again, this P doesn't deal with derivatives, it just rotates the vector. And that's exactly what's not allowed for this Wuhlenbeck structure. Okay, so all we have to focus on is this inequality. Essentially, all we need is that L1, which That L1 with this PDE controls this weak LN norm to the right power. Powers will be always fine. Right? And again, the paper that we looked at was this Kusimin-Jonah thing. So they had some argument for P identity, just for the N La plus, and then it can be extended to this Unbelievable structures. You essentially compare this with a harmonic approximation, n harmonic approximation, and then you get pointwise estimates. Get point-wise estimates. But again, we may try, I mean, maybe we're just incompetent, if possible, right? We tried to adapt this argument, but we essentially failed, right? Because the enharmonic approximation we cannot really show. So again, I emphasize that we cannot do it. Maybe this is doable. We just went through the argument and, well, we failed at several points. Nevertheless, it's as you will see, we came. Will see, we can get this inequality, right? So, we get that the weak n-norm is under control by the L1 norm plus okay, lower order guys plus a small factor times the weaker. Okay, this sort of inequality, if you solve this PD, right? We don't care about geometry anymore, it's just about PD. All right, what do we use? Well, the point is, this doesn't work for the P-lab class, to my knowledge, right? For the generic symbol. For the generic general situation of the PDEs that like Uzi and Jonah look at, this doesn't work. At least, I don't know how it would work, but we are at the W1n scale. So we are very, very close to continuity. So essentially, what we're going to do is we wiggle. We wiggle so that test functions go into the continuous world. And since we are doubling one n, we can wiggle. And the wiggling is this Ivaniate stability result, which essentially. What she says, she says, well, if we wiggle, we want to wiggle the test function. So maybe you want to estimate the n minus epsilon norm, and then you will see expressions of this type, the gradient of u times the gradient u to the minus epsilon. And the idea is that you can say, well, if epsilon is zero, this guy is a gradient. If epsilon is not zero, this guy is pretty close to a gradient. And the way you can encode this is that you say, well, you do Hodge decomposition. This is that you say, well, you do Hodge decomposition, you say this guy is a gradient plus an error term. And what you get is that this error term is small. This is not a point-wise inequality. This is just, you know, a hand-wraving idea. The curl term not only is less than whatever should be here, but you get the factor of epsilon because essentially this power is, well, this is like one of the arguments, right? This complex interpolation. This power is essentially holomorphic. So the dependency on the power is holomorphic, and somehow you. The dependency on the power is holomorphic, and somehow you get from this that you have an epsilon dependency on this. Okay, so as epsilon goes to zero, this guy vanishes at a certain rate. And the point is, well, epsilon can be very, very small, fixed. We want here one half, we want something very small, but we can say that it'd be one over one million, right? So we can choose the epsilon so that this modulus of epsilon is small enough to get us here one hour. That we are happy with. So we can fix. Things. So we can fix an epsilon so that this is a very small number, which is good for our curves. Right? And then the point is: okay, then we kind of do a brute force comparison of a gradient UMAP, which solves this sort of equation, to a really enharmonic map. Okay, so the grade of UMAP solves this sort of equation. This sort of equation, then we say it is not too far away from a really n harmonic map with precise estimates. Okay? And the points that we get here, something with the right-hand side and some lower order term. Right? And yeah, once you have this, once you have this, I mean, this is all you need, right? Because harmonic math behaves very nice. You have the C1 alpha kind of regularity. C1 alpha kind of regularity estimates. And now you can compare two things. Essentially, you write this in terms of these sharp maximal functions. You have iterations, you have covering arguments, and you control sharp maximal functions in terms of the maximal function of f. And well, essentially, there's a Reese potential of the maximal function of F. And this gets you to this sort of result. I have extra slides on this, but I will, right? So, this is just covering now once you have such an inequality, plus the properties of Plus the properties of n-harmonic functions. So I skip this, but this is what we then get. Okay, so we have this such PDE. We now get that we can control the weak LN norm in terms of the PDE. And now we just, well, now we just write down the whole inequality and we get our decay estimate and our decay estimate and space. made and all you can estimate and just by localizing right it's not just cutoff function business gives us the regularity that we want and this implies as i outlined before immediately this this order result all right good now back to geometry right so what does this mean again this is a pd it has no meaning actually but okay so what is the result and it's to my knowledge is the result and it's to my knowledge the the you know it includes all everything we know previous which is outside the sphere case or the round case is if you're an n harmonic map and for some ridiculous reason you know that the grade of u is in this ln2 there's no reason to hope for that hey eventually i mean n-harmonic maps are continuous i believe that very strongly so this eventually will be true but there's no reason to you know hope for that result to know that right why would we know that That, right? Why would we know that? But well, then, if this is true and this analytic condition is true, then we are continuing. Now, observe, if n equals 2, that's a trivial result. There's no L t2, it's just L2, so that's not really a condition. So in two dimensions, we get the old result. In higher dimensions, we get an extension of the old result with this weird caveat. So it's somehow an honest extension of the two-dimensional case. Now again, if you assume, for example, that u is in w n h comma 2, this is satisfied, right? So this includes all these higher derivatives in some L P space results that I'm aware of. Now still, there's no geometric justification to assume that, right? It's a pure PE result. Well, that's how we can do it. All right, I stop here. Thank you very much for the attention.
