University of and you will tell us about UGT for W star hybrid groups. Thank you for the introduction and thank you to the organizers for the invitation. So this is a project with Jones Kipan, Beniso Sin and Bin Sun where we study certain groups that are not W star superrigid but where they are up to a unique obstruction. So I'll tell you more about this in a second. So we've talked a lot about W star superrigidity in this conference. The idea is how much can we remember from How much can we remember from the group out of the group fundamental algebra L of G? There's two extreme cases: the case of ICC aminable groups, where they are isomorphic to the hyperbient one factor, and the cases of W star supergiity that came through a lot of work. And the first examples came in the paper of Johanna Pop and Vass in 2010 in the form of some generalized spread products. Well, we want to see what happens in between these two extremes. There's a lot of different properties that can be remembered. Of different properties that can be remembered in between. We might not remember a lot of things, but there's results on remembering a product structure or a free product structure. And for instance, what we will be looking at is trying to remember as much as possible in the non-superrigid case. So let's remind us what a MacDuff factor is. That is a 2-1 factor that absorbs the hyperfinite 2-1 factor tessorially. So we call these groups that have a We call these groups that have a MacDoff group fundamental algebra W star MacDuff, just because MacDove groups were, the name was already taken. We say that MacDuff W star super rigidity is when L of G isomorphic to L of H implies that H decomposes as G times an aminable ICC group or A equal to A. This is the most rigidity that we can get out of a W star Markdown group because L of G for a W star Markdown group will be S or to L of G times A for will be SORF to L of G times A for any ICCMA. So how will we get to these groups? We will look at infinite product rigidity. So infinite product rigidity is when you have a sequence of groups and when you take their infinite direct sum, the group fundamentality of that infinite direct sum must remember that the group decomposes as an infinite direct sum and it must give us an isomorphism between Give us an isomorphism between the factors. And then we get an extra A because it's an infinite sum. It's going to be MADOF if the factors are infinite. So the simple remark is that if we take W star super rigid groups that also satisfy this infinite probity, their infinite direct sum is going to be a MacDove W star superrigid group. And the way that we will, the type of groups that we want to. That we will, the type of groups that we want to put here are going to be the red-like product groups of Diffane, Yano, Sin, and Sun, and the ones that are WSR Super Eagle. And we want those because we want to use the property D that they have. So Hui and Adriana have already talked a bit about these red-like product groups. And remember that they come as a non-split extension of a group that has a normal subgroup that is direct subgroup. That is direct sum of copies of a base, and the quotient is a group that acts on the indexing set of VC. So we can also see it as a two-cocycle twisted semi-direct product. And now that Co-cycle, the alpha in there, can be a bit mysterious and we may not have a lot of control of them. But what we will do is, I mean, what we have done is we can control that Co-cycle. We can control the support of that two Cocycle. Of that tucocycle, so there is uniform length. And in that way, we can define an array on these types of red-like proto groups. And then with this array, we can go into the machinery of deformation rigidity, precisely using the Gaussian deformation. And we can also make an interplay between this Gaussian deformation and the tensor-led deformation of Aden. And through these tools, we can extend some. We can extend some results from infinite product rigidity that already existed from work of Kiffan and Ulier. And putting this all together, we can take that, yeah, so the way that we obtain these groups that are real-like products with bounded tucocycle is through geometric group three methods, some quotienting techniques with hyperbolically embedded subgroups, and then Groups. And then, well, our result is that every relatively hyperbole group that emits sufficiently deep 10 humans has a quotient in this class. And then specifying this A and B, we can get it to be doubled star superigid. And we can do the infinite direction and we'll get MacDub double star super rigid. Thank you.
