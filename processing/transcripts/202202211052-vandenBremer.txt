Yeah. Okay, go ahead, Tom. Oh, right. Okay, I thought I was waiting for a. Yeah, good. All right. So I was waiting for the chair. There you go. Well, you already introduced yourself at the start of the whole show. You don't need an introduction. Hi, everyone. Exactly. Hi, everyone. So, I'll speak about, as the title says, the unsteady Ekman-Stokes dynamics, and I'll explain what all of that sort of means in a moment. And in particular, I'll speak about the implications of these words for the wave-induced drift of floating marine litter. This is some work that was actually mostly done by PhD students, now postdoc, Christopher Higgins, co-supervised with Jacques Evanest, who's present also today. Who's present also today? And it was work which was then taken further by an undergraduate student, Jake Cunningham, who has worked on the second part, namely the wave-induced marine litter simulations. So what I'll talk about today, I'll start by means of by giving a little bit of background. I'll introduce something that's familiar to quite a few, but perhaps not everyone, the Eckman currents, and I'll explain what Stokes Rift are. Stokes rift are. I'll then show rather briefly, in order to not get bogged down in too many equations, still giving a flavor of the type of work we're doing, so-called Ekman-Stokes equations, perhaps what we call the Ekman-Stokes equations, leading to what we call the Ekman-Stokes kernel, which is a way of simply basically a method, simply calculating wave-induced drift with the effects of the rotation of the Earth included. I'll apply that to some Boyd data to see. Apply that to some buoy data just to see what it all means in the real world. And then I'll look at some simulations of real marine plastic in the ocean, which I'll then also sort of compare to field data collected by a number of people present in the audience today. So starting with a bit of introduction. So the first bit of introduction has been known since Ekman in 1905 that wind-driven currents at the surface of the ocean are actually oriented not in the direction of the wind. Actually, oriented not in the direction of the wind, but in a direction at 45 degrees to the right of the wind direction, depending on which half of the earth you're on, turning into a decreasing spiral with depth. So in particular, if you look at the picture on the right, you see depth on the vertical axis and you see velocity with two components, u and v, and you have a wind here in the x direction, so the direction of u. And what you see initially, or at least the wind, would lead to a transport in this direction if there weren't. Direction: If there weren't rotation of the earth, if there is rotation of the earth, what you actually get after a long time is basically a velocity vector that is at this at this angle. And if you follow it down, it takes the form of this spiral. And the other different lines are sort of as this builds up over time. So, this is the well-known Ekman spiral, and it basically includes the effect of wind stress at the surface, the fact that you have The fact that you have the fact that you have some viscosity, turbulent or laminar, which prevents shear, and the fact that you have some rotation. So the simplest way to think about this problem is some inertial or some unsteady term on a velocity vector here, capital U, with these two components, a rotation term here. This is using complex notation. So I is here to do. So I is here to deal with the orientations, and then some term that is basically the double derivative of u with respect to z, all sorts of subject to some boundary condition at the surface. So that's one part. So that's Ekman dynamics, and it's taught to undergraduate students. The other part, also taught to undergraduate students, is the Stokes script. So this I'll illustrate not by equations, but by a picture from the Alpha. By a picture from the album of fluid motion. And this picture shows what it doesn't show that there are these periodic surface waves here present. And what it does show is the long exposure images of fluid particles in the words of Michelle. These are then, I suppose, traces, perfect traces. They don't have their own inertial dynamics. So basically, these little particles, tiny, tiny little particles, basically follow the Follow up, uh, follow the ground and velocity of the fluid. And if you look at deep water waves, they're perfectly sort of spherical orbits. But if you look at slightly steeper waves and particularly look close to the surface, you might be convinced that these don't close. And there's ample evidence of this, but this is perhaps some nice visual evidence that there is a drift from the left to the right in the direction of the waves. And this is also well known. One can study this, and indeed, if one understands surface. One understands surface waves. I'll play a little video. One can actually understand this as the sort of Lagrangian particle dynamics arising from Eulerian velocity. So you have a Eulerian velocity, for example, associated with the wave field, but you evaluate this at different positions. And as you can see here, an initial position and then some time varying position. So if you do that, and I'll play a little video. Just come out of the cursor and play a little video. So on the right, you see a little video of X and Z positions. X and Z positions. You see the free surface of the wave here in blue. You see the still water level here, as Z is naught, and you see a particle. And then I turn on time. You see the different waves. So you see these, I think, what are actually spherical orbits. And you see that there is a slow drift from the left to the right. And you can also come at this through the perspective of some perturbation expansion in the steepness. And what then you can show is that there's this quantity. Can show is that there's this quantity called the Stoics drift, which is basically the steepness of the wave multiplied by the steepness of the wave squared multiplied by the wave celerity. And it varies exponentially with depth. But what's important sort of for this talk, I think, that so this is this limit of this very small tracer that Michel identified, in which I'll be operating for the purposes of this talk. If I just go and get my cursor back, is that we're interested in the Lagrange. Is that we're interested in the Lagrangian velocity, which is always going to be the sum of Eulerian velocities and Stokes drift. So when we people speak about Stokes or people speak about surface wave-related transport, people tend to focus in on Stokes. And we make an argument, or we rather re-emphasize an argument that, of course, you also have to think about wave-induced Eulerian velocities. And those would typically arise at the second order in any perturbation expansion. So they sit here as this U2, and those will be. Is this U2, and those will be the ones we'll focus upon. So, this talk will be about Eulerian wave-induced velocities, and in particular, we'll call these Ekman-Stokes velocities because they are related to Stokes, because they ultimately get their forcing from the waves, but they are Ekman related in the sense that they require the rotation of the Earth and they require some understanding of viscosity or turbulent viscosity. So, just to sort of recap some classical results without issuing any new. Results without any showing anything new. If we think about the Stokes drift, so this transport from the left to the right, it was Ursul who in the 1950s, a long time ago, showed that actually, if you consider a perfectly periodic wave and that's a regular wave, and you consider this in a rotating frame, and there must actually be what he referred to as an anti-Stokes flow. So, this would be a Eulerian flow, which would be completely equal and opposite to the Stokes rift and would indeed cancel it out. So, Hasselman explained this type of. So, Hasselman explained this type of contribution a bit better. He said you have to understand this in terms of the Curiolis-Stokes forcing on the mean flow. So, the mean flow is now this Eulerian flow we might be interested in. So, if you think about this, it's all at the level of mean, so wave average type of terms. What we see, the twos here, you can sort of forget about it's the order of the perturbation expansion at which all of this sits. You have an unsteady term, you have an inertial term. You have an inertial term, F cross this velocity. You have perhaps a pressure term, and then you have a Stokes Coriolis forcing that is well known. And if you then are willing to ignore horizontal pressure gradients and also more traditional Coriolis components, then what you get is you get a cancellation basically. If I add this on, and you don't get a cancellation, but you actually get a Eulerian flow, which The Eulerian flow, which is actually consisting of, if you copy the original notes from the Hauselmann paper, or a sea of undamped inertial oscillations. So if you have a time-varying Stokes drift, so you have a big wave field, the waves build up and they become smaller and larger, so the envelope of the waves grow and decay. Then, associated with that, the Stokes shift also grows and decays, and that creates a forcing to this rotating C, and that's then. C and that's then you have to sort of sum those up over time, and you have this C of undamped inertial oscillations, and that's the sort of classical result in this area. If we think about this a little bit more properly, if we think about this at what happens at second order in steepness, or what are the relevant governing equations, we actually have to also think not just about the F term, which we've already included, but also about some term that prevents infinite shear. Infinite shear. And then, and at this point, I'll sort of rush because I want to show some results rather than show you too much of the mathematical framework. But just to get you a flavor, you get an equation set which we and I think maybe a few others call the Ekman-Stokes equations. And what they are is, if you complex notation, so just focus on the terms and just sort of understand the physical meaning. But there are this complex notation here, the two horizontal components. Here are the two horizontal components. This just allows us to write things down a bit more simply, but just focus on the term. So we have the unsteady term, we have a term with F, we have a term that prevents shear, a diffusive term, and then we have the Stokes-Correlist forcing. This all has to be solved subject to boundary conditions, which is the traditional boundary condition at some depth. The flow is zero. And then there's also a wave stress boundary condition. So there's a stress of the surface. So there's a stress of the surface that arises not from the wind, but from the presence of the waves, and this has to be included. One more thing I think I'll say, which I think is important about this wave stress, this kind of brings in a third effect. So the first effect being the Stokes effect, the second effect being perhaps the Ekman effect, and the third effect, which sort of combines the two effects, but is something called a boundary layer streaming. So if I have no. A boundary layer streaming. So if I have no rotation, but I have a surface wave and I have viscosity or some sort of boundary layer, I'm allowing for a boundary layer, then of course there is another classical result by Longbert Higgins saying that in that boundary layer, I would get some streaming, a Eulerian mean flow, a Eulerian transport that arises over a thin boundary layer, a wave-induced boundary layer that has a thickness. I can compute from the wave frequency, according to longer taken. According to long rotating. So, this gives rise to additional transport, and this must also be taken into account. It means that the flow is not irritational close to the surface, so there's vorticity and the interior actually feels a stress. If I add all the arrows there, basically I have this idea of a number of different layers. So I have a very thin boundary layer, then I have a set by the viscosity and the frequency of the waves, then there is a Stokes type. waves, then there is a Stokes type layer set by the inverse of the, set by the, by basically the wavelength or one over two times the wave number. And then I have a layer that is basically an Ekman type layer. And these three layers play a role ultimately because of the three-dimensional numbers I sort of have, or maybe more. So if I recap that sort of fairly hand-wavy argument, is that I have the Ekman-Stokes equations and the And the argument we make in one of the papers, one of the two papers I'm presenting today, and this is work that Jacques has made very, very significant contributions to, of course, to realize that this is all very simple and you can actually solve this equation using Laplace transforms. Without giving you too many of the details, I'd like to give you the understanding that there is now this sort of product which you might implement in an oceanography model. And it's this idea. Oceanography model, and it's this idea that you can do relatively simple operations that take into account these physics that I have described. Knowing the Stokes drift, I can then compute what we call the Ekman-Stokes flow. So the Ekman-Stokes flow is this Eulerian wave-induced flow that arises because I have a diffusive term, because I'm not allowing for infinite shear in this boundary layer, and because I have rotation, I have to update this calculation. So, what we then have is a solution. So what we then have is a solution and in Laplace transform, so we have we have it in Laplace using Laplace transforms and I think I'll skip the final bullet point. So what we have is basically this understanding that we can compute this new flow in the same way that lots of people, you can find download on the internet fields of the Stokes drift that people have computed with different wave models. We can use that data basically. Can use that data basically to compute the Ekman-Stokes without running a fully coupled ocean model. We can do a simple computation of this Ekman-Stokes velocity. And basically, it involves an operation, basically integration in time using a kernel, which we've called the Ekman-Stokes kernel, which takes into account a number of the effects. So let me speak about this kernel and let me give you some physical intuition about what it all means. So the first term in there. So, the first term in there is an Ekman spiral term, because the waves, like the wind, they impose a stress on the surface. So, that would be an Ekman spiral type term. And the second term is a Coriolis-Stokes term from the additional forcing in the equation. So, one from the boundary condition, the other from the changed equation, and those are the two terms. Let me make that even more intuitive. Let me plot that. Let me take two limits first. So, when I take that kernel and I neglect viscosity. I neglect viscosity, and then I actually get the kernel reduces to a term like this. And what you might realize is that this is basically the Hasselmann result I started my talk with today. So basically, I have to do a kernel convolution of whatever is the Stokes shift, however it varies in time, with some infinitely lived inertial waves. And when, on the other hand, I neglect the Coriolis forces, then I can recover long. Then I can recover Lombard Higgins's result: that what I have is not something that oscillates, but actually something that decays, as you could see here. And this is the boundary layer streaming. So the fact that in a boundary layer, wave-induced boundary layer, I can have additional transport. So what does this all look like? So I have a picture here of that kernel, which I have to multiply by the Stokes Drift or the Laplace transform of the Stokes Drift and then do the convolution. And do the convolution. So, what this shows is the spiral basically is an inward spiral. So, over time, things decay and become small. And what basically you see here, if you like to use the same terminology as Hasselmann, it's a sea of damped inertial oscillations. Right, so let me make that a lot more intuitive by showing you some pictures. So, these are pictures of a Gaussian storm. So, we've created about a 48-hour storm, and I'm Storm and I'm showing you on the top pictures of the velocity as a function of time: the velocity in the x-direction, the velocity in the y-direction. We're interested not in z, there is no z here, or if there is z, but there's no significant velocity in this direction. And here, u is basically the magnitude of those two components. So, what you see here is that we force with the stokes drift in the x direction. So, here you see these wave roses. And what all you have to basically understand is that you see lots of colour. Understand is that you see lots of color, it's the direction where things are in with some boxes here, which denote the magnitude. Basically, the velocity in the Stokes rift is all in the x-direction. You see it build up and you see it decay. And what then results is in blue is the Ekman-Stokes velocity that is basically initially opposing and then forms these oscillations. So blue and red are on top of each other. So I see these damped inertial oscillations. And of course, these inertial oscillations. And of course, these inertial oscillations don't just have an x-direction, they also have a x-component, they also have a y-component. You can see that here. So, altogether, then, if I start my simulation, or start my understanding of wave-induced transport by just having something in the direction of the waves, the actual Lagrangian velocities over this 160-hour timeframe, they will look a lot more directionally spread. They will look a lot more in different directions and also different magnitudes. And this is going to be important. But predominantly, you see here in this plot here. You see here in this plot, here you see that there is something close to a 45-degree angle between the two. So you can have wave-induced transport at an angle to the waves. Okay, so let me make that a little bit more realistic still by considering some wave-boy data. So we consider this is just a hypothetical exercise. We're not comparing to field data, but we just take some boy data and we compute from that boy data in the Stokes drift. So we take a boy somewhere in a nice location, nice league closer. In a nice location, mostly because the Boy data is publicly available to us. And then we perform numerically this Ekman-Stokes convolution by basically taking the Stokes drift and convolving over it in the time domain using our kernel and using the discrete three-hour time slots that this data, the Stokes drift, both its magnitude, which we can compute, and its direction, which is available to us from the data set. And we compute it. And what you see, what you get is, so these are now some plots which are completely analogous to the plots. Which are completely analogous to the plots I've previously shown you, but not a nice Gaussian storm, but something much more complicated. So you see the Stokes drift here in black to start with. It no longer has just an X direction, it also has a Y direction, and you can see indeed that there is likely actually some information in multiple directions ongoing. So in this storm, so we sort of abstract away from this. We pick a main direction, we pick a main wave number, and we perform our calculation. What you could see here is in red. Could see here is in red is the final Lagrangian velocity, so the sum of blue and black, and in blue is this Ekman-Stokes velocity. And you see, indeed, that you can get opposite velocities initially, and some oscillations, and also velocities in normal directions, and a much more rich pattern in terms of directions associated with this wave-induced transport. And this then is sort of what we're trying to think about. We're trying to think about is this now not the velocity but the actual result for transport, which is what we think ultimately matters in terms of the application of this research. So, using the same colour conventions, you can maybe focus just on the continuous lines, forget about the dashed lines, and the numbers you see plotted here are the number of hours. So, you see X and Y, so the particle always starts here at the origin, and basically these are different columns, are different times. The columns are different times, so you just look at one column and then look at the other. And then what you also see is different values of our estimate of the turbulent viscosity. We use a laminar viscosity model, but we take a value representative of a turbulent upper ocean, a layer of 10 to the minus 2 or 10 to the minus 3 meters squared per second. And what we see here is we see the Stokes drift in this direction. And then again, this in blue, the Eckman Stokes. In blue, the Ekman Stokes, and in red, the McGrath. So, what we get is basically very, very different transports. And you can see it. I think you can see it. Well, you can see it in the different cases. In all cases, in this case, I think it's most obvious that the transport can almost be in opposing directions. I mean, the blue and the black resulting in a red transport that is not a 45-degree, but close to a 45-degree angle. Right. Right, so let me move on to some application of this work. I say it's a work in progress, it's under review now. So, in this work, we actually follow what we think, as an Victor owning Casili Onius, some really, really nice work on with lots of contributors from Fan Sabia's group who will join us tomorrow. Really nice work performing ocean-based virtual particle simulations using a Virtual particle simulations using a framework called parcels. And basically, what this framework does is it's not ours, it just takes any velocity field on any spatial grid and it calculates the Lagrangian trajectories, and it does so in a really, really fast way. And what Victor Onink and others have done, many others have done, is a lot of these simulations, they've done it with non-wave-driven currents, so acronym and geostrophic currents, and they have also added to it stokes drips. And our only contribution. Strips and our only contribution in this paper is to add to all this the additional wave-driven Eulerian current or this Ekman-Stokes flow, this new missing piece that we argue must be added to the Stokes rift in order to get the correct picture. Some might argue that some of that wave-driven Eulerian current that we compute is perhaps already in some of these non-wave-driven currents, depending on what source you take them from. But I'll abstract away from that for the convenience of my presentation. For the convenience of my presentation today. So, we take the same databases as Victor Oning has taken in his paper. That's basically the starting point. So, this paper here. And what we do is we use this. I won't go through all the databases, but glob current databases where all this information is taken from at the spatial and temporal resolution that it is available. And we use this using relatively long time series of a number of years to compute. Of a number of years to compute an Ekman-Stokes field using our kernel. And one important thing we have to do in our work was idealize. So we started with basically one constant to describe the laminar viscosity, which was meant to sort of be a proxy for the term viscosity. And the first thing we do is we just pick a value which we think is not so bad. So, not so bad. This leads to problems near the equator, and we basically reduce the viscosity to the molecular value in that range. And the second thing we do is we use the Meli-Yamada turbulence model, so we're a very simple turbulence model that gets us values of the turbulent viscosity, the vertical turbulent viscosity, which are given in the plot here. And if you look at the ranges here, you know, the values between 10 to the minus 2 and 10 to the minus 3, although we strongly abstract away from the proper vertical structure, gives us at least some. Structure gives us at least some reasonable value. So we use both these approaches, approaches one and approach two. And so I'm going to show you the results. And you'll have the Stokes drift here. And can I get my cursor? Get my cursor back. So you have the Stokes drift here, and then what you have on the left is the constant viscosity, and on the right is this Melium-Martin model. There's really no need to look at. Model. There's really no need to look at the differences, so just focus on one. Basically, we have the Stokes drift, we have our wave-driven Eulerian current or our Ekman-Stokes current, and then we have the Lagrangian current as the sum of the top and the middle panel. And in red, I have the observations, because some screens might even be too small to show this, is that the wave-driven gyres in the subtropics, they reduce the dispersive effect of the Stokes drift. So this was a finding of the Stokes drift alone. And we show that there's less deflection. And we show that there's less deflection and more anti-Stokes flow at high latitudes, and actually a deflection away from the poles at high latitudes, which was a result of the Stokes. I'll make all of this a lot more clear. In the next plot, so this is a plot that shows the accumulation patterns that result from a number of years, I believe about 12 years of simulations of virtual plastics. So these are first put in with a uniform distribution and then left to evolve with real. Then left to evolve with realistic currents and Stokes drifts. And the picture basically prior to this work were panel A and panel B. Panel A were the accumulation patterns without any wave effects. So you have the strong accumulation in these gyres. And then One came along and added the Stokes drift and said, if you add the Stokes drift, actually there's much less dispersion in these gyres, much less accumulation in these gyres. Sorry, the Stokes drift actually disperses, if that's the right. Disperses, if that's the right word, material away from the giants. Then we come along and we add the wave-driven Eulerian currents with one or two as the way, so this is the melee-yamada and this is the constant viscosity, so it just doesn't matter which one you look at. And we see we return very much back to the original picture, panel A, because there is now actually a lot stronger accumulation in gyres, and all this transport towards the poles is at least significantly reduced. Significantly reduced. And you see, there is a difference between the different viscosity models, which goes to show that how you model upper ocean turbulence is important. You can't just get away with our very, very simple model. This panel then, and I should look at my clock, is another partial simulation, so a simulation with the zoning framework, which shows interbasing connectivity. And again, non-where. And again, non-wave driven, non-wave-driven plus Stokes, and then our two different contributions. And what this shows is the original position is where the colour is drawn, and then the final position in terms of the basin, which you can see here, is shown. These are not so easy to really understand unless you have half an hour, but you see there are significant differences in the Arctic comparing these different formulations. And you also see across the equator quite a lot. Across the equator, quite a lot of difference. I'll make this little bit more clear. So I'll tell you what this table is and then I'll show you what to look for. So this table shows the interbasing connectivity. So it's basically the percentages of particles showing both their origin and their destination, basically where things come from when you find them in certain basins. And what you see is n is non-wave driven, so this is no wave effect at all. N plus s is Effect at all. N plus s is just Stokes drift. And then E1 and E2 are two ways of modeling these Edmund-Stokes flows. So it's late, certainly it's late for me. So let's just focus on the important, some it's early, I realize. Let's just focus on the important conclusions. So Owen said more cross-equator transport due to the Stokes drift, which I think is a very important result. So I'm by no means detracting. So, I'm by no means detracting from this. And we then show actually, if you think about this, okay, that's another Onink result. So, Indian Ocean is also better connected due to the Stokes Drift. This is basically just the Stokes Drift. And Onink also said more transport to the poles due to Stokes Drift. We then say, I think, oh, okay, right. So, we then say, so what we then say is that if you basically look at all these conclusions and you go from the left to the right, we say that lots of these effects. Right, we say that lots of these effects are actually reduced. So, more cross-equator transport, if we include the Ekman-Stokes effect, that effect is no longer as strong. Indian Ocean being better connected, if you move to the right on the blue circles, that is no longer as strong. And more transport to the poles, you can see quite clearly, is no longer as strong as you go to the right here. So you see increase and then decrease again. So basically, the Ekman-Stokes is basically a modulator, if you like. A modulator, if you like, of lots of the effect of the stove straw. One more graph, and I think with this I should probably end. It's going to be another horrendous graph to get your head around, but this is an attempt to see which of those models is somehow best. We're very grateful to Cara, Lavin Law, and Onik and Van Sabi, and lots of collaborators who I think have contributed to a data set that Cara. To a data set that Cara Lambda Law collects. And this data set gives us a way to estimate the density of particles in different oceans as a function of the latitude and the longitude. So the black line here is the observation, and the red line is the non-wave driven. So this is no wave effect at all. Then the green line is the stopes drift, and the blue and the yellow are sort of, what's the right word? What's the right word? The sort of luxury versions of wave-induced transport with the Eckman Stoke flow included. And looking at the clock here, I don't have much time, so I'll draw your eye to the panel for the North Pacific zonal mean. And what we show here is that if you want agreement with the data, then perhaps I say quite clearly, having these slopes drift on its own is not actually improving, but making worse the agreement that having wave-driven U.S. Having wave-driven Eulerian currents included makes things look a little bit more reasonable. Right, so let me wrap up my presentation today. I'm already overrunning ever so slightly. Surface waves can drive Ekman-like flows with the additional effect of Coriota-Stokes forcing. We show with a simple convolution integral that we can compute to leading order this Ekman-Stokes flow, and we show it can actually significantly change drift of floating objects. Change drift of floating objects. It's sensitive to the value of viscosity. It generally sort of opposes, in a loose sense, the dispersive behavior of Stokes drift and the cross-equator and polar transport of Stokes drift are reduced. And perhaps there is some improved agreement between models now when compared to observational data. What we don't do in our work is we don't think about broadbanded spectra, so we don't, our stokes drift is very, very simply computed as the stokes drift of a monochromatic wave, and that can lead to errors. Chromatic wave, and that can lead to errors. We don't have a complex model for the eddy viscosity, and that might certainly change things. We do not take into account spatial variation, which I think is not going to change things significantly because we do take spatial variation into account in terms of these calculations, just not in our simple reduced form, closed-form results. Of course, other effects like stratification and background flow and stabilities and the risk dynamics of the upper ocean. And the rich dynamics of the upper ocean wave-driven boundary layer are going to probably change a lot of these things, but this is our small contribution to our understanding of what might go down there. And I think with that, I should probably end my presentation. Thanks so much, Dan. That was very deep and broad all at the same time. Thank you so much. Now, if you weren't able to absorb everything that Ton just spoke about, Victor. Just spoke about. Victor Onink is also going to be one of our speakers later in the week, so can perhaps follow up. But that said, if there are any questions of Tom, we've got a few minutes before we'll head to our theme discussions. I was so deliriously taking notes that I'm stuck. Kathleen. Hi, would you mind going back to the last slide that you didn't have time to really go into? Yeah, yeah. This slide here. So, yeah, looking at that, the bottom slide that you were talking about, is it fair to say that the constant turbulent versus the melirmata actually, yeah. Actually, better? Actually, in all of the slides. Right. I think, I think that's so. If you look at this just for the whole audience, so I guess the story goes that if you started with the red line, right, no wave effects, then you added Stokes Drift, it becomes a little bit worse. And then if you add the blue line, the agreement perhaps becomes better than the yellow line. I think there is a little bit of variation that you might also obtain by doing a Also, obtained by doing a constant stokes drift, constant viscosity calculation with a different value of the viscosity. So, I think in this case, it turns out to be a little bit better, but given the, I mean, I don't think I would draw that firm conclusion just yet. It seems that it's not a firm conclusion. Yeah, I mean, it will, yes. Different circumstances, it would change it depending on. But I think at least it's a slightly more realistic model. More realistic model, and it seems to do. So now I should say this right: it's the Meliyamada model, which is actually slightly more sophisticated. So it's the yellow line. It's basically the simple, simpler model that does better. Yes. Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, I'm fishing for that answer because when I calculate currents, I'm the counterpart to the global product. So I'm Oscar currents in the US product versus the globe current. And so I think. And so I just, you know, was fishing for that because I use as simple as possible. And so it's always nice to see that I don't have to go to the, no, not that I don't have to, but it's nice to see some evidence that it's not ridiculous to have spatially varying but constant in the vertical eddy viscosity is. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm glad we were looking for support as well, because then it's easier to sell our model. But I think, yeah, there might be a little bit of evidence. There's probably a lot more richness in this. There's probably a lot more richness in this problem that would prevent you from drawing that conclusion firmly. But quite. A question from Nimish. Hi, Tom. Really insightful talk. Thanks very much. I think I missed some order one results in what you said. So there are these three layers of transport, right? The streaming. Transport, right? The streaming, the stokes, and then the Akman. And then are all three equally affected by the rotation, are you saying? Or is it just the Ackman? Yeah. So I think there's three layers where basically you can, based on three processes, namely rotation, Stokes drift, and the fact you have a diffusive term, you can compute three length scales, right? One is basically having a surface wave. Having a surface wave and a surface wave and some viscosity that leads you to a sort of wave-driven boundary layer thickness, you have without any, that's without without rotation, right? And then you can have just waves, which gives you the traditional e to the two or e to the kz dec. So one over the length scale of the wave gives you another, one, the length scale of the wave gives you another scale, and then you have rotation. So I think the point is that you can. So, I think the point is that you combine all three, and then you can think about this in terms of three length scales, but it's all three you need. Yeah. And so the fact that the transport isn't necessarily in the wave direction, that's true for all three processes. So in the Stokes Drift itself, the transport is only in the wave direction. If you have the Stokes Drift plus the boundary layer streaming, so no rotation, it is still in the wave direction only. It is not just Stokes drift, but. Not just Stokes Griff, but also Eulerian velocity now. And if you add the third rotation, then things start to become, as is perhaps intuitive to many, in a different direction. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Very good. Thanks again, Tom. So we are right on schedule. I think after all these interesting talks and so much to absorb, the plan is we. Absorb. The plan is we will meet in Gathertown and start to set up our discussions in just five minutes. Again, to remind you, when you arrive, if you can go to the planetary group discussion room and then you can chat with some people and then we'll start getting the discussion going. You can look at this Google Doc here and see that I've already populated quite a bit with my notes. Hopefully, I did so accurately of the various talks. Accurately of the various talks this morning. Anyway, so we will gather and start chatting in about five minutes. See you soon.
