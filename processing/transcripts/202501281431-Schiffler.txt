Yeah, um first of all I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to talk. I will so maybe I should say first, I am not in mental theory, I'm not a geometer. I kind of got interested in this problem because it was related to classical. Because it was related to cluster algebra. I'm working on cluster algebra. So I want to present a kind of different approach to the Markov numbers, which is a combinatorial approach. I'll give you a combinatorial interpretation of Markov numbers as by the knowledge here of a certain set. And yeah, so let me, this is a report on results from a joint paper with Kim. From the joint paper with Kyung Young-li Lee Lee, who is here, Sher Paju, who's one of the organizers, from 2023. And so here's the main result. So, oh yeah, this is more visible, right? This chalk than what I wrote before. Okay. This is the harder moral chart. So, this notation, this will be the mark of. So this notation, this would be the Markov number at the point QP in C square. Here I assume that P is smaller than Q and that relatively prime. And so then you can. So then you can think of it as points in the square and the plane. And yeah, this condition that p is not equal. It means that your points are in this area of the plane here below the diagonal. And then what I want to do is to look at lines. Binds So y is Ax plus B. It's meant to be a straight line of slope A. And then on this line, well, you may have several of these points BQ and Then there's a question we're wondering is what about the order of these of the corresponding Markov numbers increasing other decreasing? What can you say about it? So here's the theorem. These white dots are a lot of numbers. With X. With x, if the slope is at least negative 8 over 7 approximately negative 1.14 or v I'll increase strictly Strictly decrease x if the slope is smaller than equal to negative 5 over 4, which is approximately negative 1.25. Sorry, what do you mean by a mark of number at a point? Oh, this is the labeling uh using the Using the fairy tree. And I just see this PQ as a pointer QP. Thank you. And so increase with X means if you go this way, these numbers become bigger. And C, so there's this gap here, and as you can imagine, Match meet this gap, but it's neither. So there are slopes. So in particular, you're saying it's decreasing? Minus one would be here, right? So increased. Increased. Minus one is bigger than this number. Minus two. Well, I'm thinking of minus one. That's what these two it is. No, no. That's uh Eigner's second or third conjecture. But in between, you have slopes for which the Markov numbers are not monotonous. Right, so there are certain lines when you go, you increase x, you increase the Markov numbers, there are lines where you do the same, then you decrease the Markov numbers, and then there are some where the behavior changes along that line. And the corollary of this Are the three Eigner conjectures? So these conjectures apply to the slopes a equal 0, a equal to infinity, and a equal to negative one. Okay, so then Let me make a couple of remarks. First, the eigenvalues here were also proved by Baguisque, Belantova, Tavernal, and Vouillon. At the same time, and there were maybe four days before us on the archive. us on the archive for the Eigen conjectures using combinatorics of words and then shortly after that by next shade alcoholic geometry and then so that's remark one and remark two Jonah strengthened the theorem Yeah, so we could only deal with rational numbers and then we chose to have these special kinds n over n minus 1 or n the other way around. And so there are some limit slopes. This is not sharp, you can make the slope bigger, you can make this slope smaller and still have the same behavior. And Jonah found these slopes. Yeah, which I won't write down as slopes. Maybe I should also say also Min1 sometime later. So Jonah has this McChain approach and Mina1 use our approach to show this as well. So before telling you the combinatorial behind this, maybe let me first say what does it mean for uniqueness conjecture. Yeah, I'm not proving this one into words. So you have your point QP here somewhere, and then you have these two lines, and five over four. So and then the theorem says that everything That everything over here, the Markov numbers here are smaller than m p over q and everything on the outside they are bigger than M here but Than m p over q. So if there's a Markov number, if there's a point for which Markov number is the same as mp over q, it must lie between these two lines in this gray area. I guess here it is a white area. And at least this is a bounded area because here you will hit the line x equal to y somewhere and here you get the line y equals zero. The line y equals zero. And then you can think about well, how many possibilities are there. So, first you can count all the lattice points in there, but then there's on top of it, on each of these lattice points, you have these conditions again because you want them all to be equal to the same QP. So it's a corollary. We find a bound on A bound on the multiplicity, so they are at most 5q plus 4p plus 44 or 54 errors points. This is a bound in terms of P and Q. I'd say this bound doesn't take into account that we actually want these to be relevant. That we actually want these to be relatively prime. That would bring it maybe some, I mean, fast than this. So, yeah, so this co-prime condition is not considered in this. So, one could maybe make it smaller. I'm sorry, before you refresh, so in your part C of the theorem, you say that there exist slopes in between the two. Did you say that? Did you say that these were the optimal slopes that you could like? No, the optimal slopes are not rational numbers. They are a log in the numerator, a log in the denominator. Okay, so you know this experimentally? No, John approved it. Oh, okay. So how does that compare to the one I John I explained yesterday? More than John I explained yesterday from complexity. Well, I assume the the the the one with the two-thirds is better, right? Yeah, the q q is on the order of n uh and n is on the order of uh we were just thinking about it looks like log log n, right? Yeah, that was it. This is worse. This is like log n. I think that the relation is yesterday it was log of the Markov number, the knock, the Markov number is exponential in the variable. So I think the two-thirds is better. The improvement is the exponent. Two-thirds, yeah. I think so too. Does this configuration relate to the geometry of this machine union? Of this machine is one I mean norm one ball in fact not a space I mean that yeah you use the the norm ball to get the sharp slopes Okay, so let's then talk about this combinatorial approach. Yeah, so this is coming from just arguable theory, but yeah, I will. I will not really use. So, there, in cluster algebra, many people have contributed to find combinatorial formula for the cluster variables. And I will just present to you the combinatorics and not the cluster variables themselves. So, let me do an example. Let's say. Let's say M three or five one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three. So this is 0.53, this is zero. And let me first draw the straight line here. You can think of this as a geodesic in the once-puncture torus from the puncture to the puncture. But I want to rather consider the castophilic path below it. And this looks like this. And this looks like this. Kostoffel path is a lattice path, so you're only allowed to go to the right or up by one unit at every step. And so on top of it, this is the maximal lattice path below the diagonal. You can do this for any lattice point. It doesn't have to be co-prime coordinates, actually. But every step I go I go right, unless I could go up. But here if I would go up, I would cross the diagonal so I don't do that. And here I go up because I can't. I'm not going to go right. And I have to go right twice as well. So, whenever I can go up, I go up, otherwise, I go right. And so let me draw the same thing here again. Same path. But now I want to construct something else. This is called the This is called the snake graph. Yeah, this graph consists of tiles. Is this visible in red? Not as well. Not as well. Not better? So, tiles which are graphs with four vertices and four edges, and they have square shape, and the side length is one half units in each step is one unit. And I will cover um this lattice path with tiles. Lattice path with tiles. So you have a a graph that's three tides in this direction and three tides five. In this direction, and three tiles, five tiles, three tiles, three tiles. And so, of course, you have probably noticed that there's one missing here, and there's also one missing here. This spot here is empty. So, I'm not starting at 0, 0, I really start at 1/2 0, and I don't stop at. And I don't stop at this point.53, but one half below the snake graph I associate to this point five three so in what sense is it a graph? You mean it's a what you see are the edges and the where they meet are the other vertices We view it as a graph, like a okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, just interesting. And then from cluster algebras, we know that this Markov number, mp over q, is the number of perfect matchings of this class. So the perfect matching is a set of edges in the graph such that every vertex is instant to exactly one of the chosen edges. If you an example in the smaller picture, this one has 400. This one has 433 perfect matchings. I don't want to draw them all. Let's do M12 instead. M12 is 5. And so here the stack graph looks like this. And so it has 5. So it has five perfect matchings. The first perfect matching you can choose is these four edges here. So I'm not drawing the edges that I don't choose. The perfect matching, every vertex is covered exactly once. Then there's this one. This one. And then I can do all the vertical edges. Edges. Finally, I can use. And these are all perfect images. There's XMP5. You see, so this is a combinatorial interpretation of the Markov numbers in the sense that it realizes the Markov number as a cardinality of a set that you can compute explicitly. That you can compute explicitly, and it has additional structure because you see, I can think of this as a post-set where I have to know what is the maximal element, but then you see I can make a little rotation here of these two tiles. The horizontal ones become vertical, and here I can do the same. If I do it on one side, I can do it on the other side, and then at the end, I can do it. On the other side, and then at the end I can rotate the two that the central tile matching here. So it is not only a number, it's a number with a certain structure. Is there a structure to triples in the hub? Yes. Yeah, you have to look here in this picture what, yeah, so this diagonal term. So this diagonal determines uniquely the triple in which it is maximal. And it's given by the point, by the lattice point that is closest to the diagonal. If my picture is correct, it would be this one. I'm not sure if I draw the picture. But if it is, let's say this is the closest, then you have here two other straight lines, which are geodesics as well. And this is the mark of the area with one half of that term. But can you read off the treatment from the structure of the special set? This is quite a big no you would need to know where where to keep this information Is there this determinant or Kirchoff formula for computing the number of matchings with graphs? Yeah, it's fine. So that's that's gonna be the determinant of a kind of a Going to be the determinant of a kind of a tridiagonal matrix. Yes, you can do it that way. There's also the continued traction you can associate to this. That's useful. So let me tell you how to get the continued traction. So I'm coloring the corner tiles, including the last one, and each of them contributes a two. Then contributes a two. So these corner tiles, each of them contributed to. And then in between you have certain edges which are not part of corner tiles, and each of those correspond to a one. The continued fraction, the numerator of this continued fraction is the Markov 1. Did you say, is the answer to Alex's question, if you just know the Markov number, then you'll know the lattice, you know what the lattice must look like? No. If the uniqueness conjecture were true. So in the cluster algebra, you have uniqueness. So if you look at the cluster variables, the uniqueness conjecture holds for cluster variables. But you specialize For cluster bases, but you specialize, and then so that you instead of having a Laurent polynomial, you just have the number of terms with multiplicity in the numerator. That's where you lose uniqueness. Well, we don't know. So, yeah, so this if you give me any Markov number, I I would need to realize it first as the snake graph. Okay, so each corner produces a two. And then once you have done that, there are some interior edges which are not part of the corner tiles. So here you have these two. Here, all the interior edges here are inside a corner tile here as well. And then this one is interior. And the very first one is exceptional, it's not interior. First one is exceptional is not interior, but I still have to consider each of these if you're a one. Other questions for that I said you don't need this condition that five and three are relatively prime to do this construction. And if you you if you take something If you take something which is not relatively prime, then I think this is related to the Markov companions, as in Laura Springburn's work. So, I don't, I mean, this is a question, maybe. This is a question, maybe. It looked promising during the talk. I computed some examples, but I don't know if that's true in general. I guess my time is up. So one thing I want to mention is there's also another graph you can form here by adding one tile. By adding one tile at the beginning and two tiles at the end, and then blue very first and the very last edge is called an end graph that denotes it by G P over Q bar so that you still have here a continued fraction. You still have here a continued fraction which is obtained by adding a 2 in front of it for this extra time here at the end. And it's a periodic continued fraction. And so this gives rise to a quadratic irrational and gives rise to a La Count number. And yeah, so if P and Q are relatively prime, then you have this map of Markov of Markov's map of M P Q to Lange number, which is line number. So geometrically, what you do here corresponds to, in the torus, moving your geodesic away from the pointer and making it closed. Tori, it corresponds to band graph. And so, maybe the last thing I would like to mention is some more open question. You can do this for any levels path. Let's say below the diagonal. And in the same way, you construct In the same way, you construct the slip graph, so now maybe here you didn't go up, maybe you went further here, and then up, and you still cover everything with tiles. You can do the same construction for any lettuce path. Call it W and then you can do these two things. You have MW, the number of perfect match names, you have LW, this launch number associated to it. Then you can Call this here f, although it's not a function in general, because there are certain lattice pads which have the same number of perfect matchings, but not the same Lagrange number. But if you restrict this to the Christoffel pads, and this is a Markov's function, but it's a generalization of this Markov function. So in a way the fixer endpoint than the Markhorf number is in a way a limit of all these lattice paths. And you can ask many questions. I don't have time to go into details, but for example, you can ask what part of the Lagrange spectrum you obtain this way. Fixing your endpoint or not. Not to actually talk yet. Thank you very much. Is there one last question? Could I ask a question? Yeah, that's very interesting. My question is: you didn't indicate what the source of your proof of the Agna objection is in this setting. In this setting, but what do you get it from? Increasing one of the coordinates and the other coordinates makes the function increasing. And what's the source? So the matching is the Markov number. Yes. So what's the source? In the other proof, the source was the convexity. What's the source here? Yeah, so we use this approach to define a distance function in the plane. So you take two points in the plane and In the plane, and you draw the straight line between them, and then in the same way, so imagine you just translate everything to 0, 0. In the same way, you can define a snake graph, count the number of perfect matchings, and this is our distance between the two points. This is not a metric, it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. Nevertheless, we use it. This distance function satisfies certain relations. Satisfies certain relations that you can think of scale relations. You have two geodesics that cross, and then you can smooth them in two ways. So that's our essential tool to compute this distance function. And then the rest is planar geometry arguments. Thanks. So so it's probably quite close. It may be a translation from one group to the other, no? From one to the other? No? Yeah, well, I don't understand the exchange approach, so otherwise, I'll be happy to say yes or no. We get to the same results. This music is specifically related to the complexity. Let's thank God once more. So here we're using the software calculations.
