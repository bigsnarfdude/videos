Let me start by thanking the organizers for putting together this wonderful conference and the fact that people from all over the world can easily attend because of the Zoom. There's this advantage. And thanks for giving us this opportunity to present our work here. So of course, my talk will be followed by the work of my close collaborator, Anupam. So there will be probably some overlap. There will be probably some overlap. So, I've tried to keep short in the talk. I've tried to keep some of the things out. Hopefully, that will be covered in that one. Okay. Okay. So, in the cover, you see kind of the list of the works which I will principally be discussing about, though not everything in great detail. Some of them are quite recent, and including within this conference, Anupam is speaking, Gavin has spoken, and a lot of work I'll describe is. And a lot of work I'll describe is with in close collaboration with one of the students at UCL, Ryan Marshman, and also one postdoc, Marco Toros. So they played important roles in the work that I'll describe. So outline is I start with just with the motivation. So the motivation is to find out that this Newtonian interaction that we are familiar with from a long time ago, whether it's actually quantum. Actually, quantum. Okay. And I should classify, I should, I mean, clarify that by Newtonian interaction here, I don't mean the historical Newtonian interaction, which is action at a distance. So this is Newtonian interaction in the sense of orders of order, the strength. It has the same form as the Newtonian interaction, but it is the one which is causal. It's after relativity. So here is where probably it links with one of the themes of the workshop. One of the themes of the workshop, so it's the causal version of the inter-interaction, or the kind of inter-interaction which could arise if you just took standard quantum field theory and treated gravity as a quantum, weak quantum field in a background and found out what the interaction would be to the first order. So that kind of neutron interaction. And that neutron interaction, whether it is quantum, okay, that is the target of the. target of the of the of the of the experiment that I'll propose okay now of course when I'm talking about something in quantum I should I should tell what it define set my criteria of what is classical okay and and I will regard any non-classical ET as quantum okay I understand that many of the audience here think more broadly okay so all non-classical it is need not necessarily be quantum okay there could be something beyond quantum but what I mean Beyond quantum, but what I will loosely say any non-classicality to be quantum, okay. And then I'll spend a little bit of time clarifying that quantum matter, okay, quantum matter means quantum fields, including energy, everything, and classical gravity can only supply you with local operations and classical communication. And this we know from quantum information, it's a two-line proof, yeah, one-line proof that you cannot entangle using that, okay. Using that. Then I will describe our proposal in schematic terms and place some order of magnitudes. I'll describe a little bit of history of how it differs from what had happened before that. And then I will go through the experimental challenges to the order of the time that is allowed. And if time permits, I'll also say. Time permits, I'll also say that why building this kind of device is generically a fruitful endeavor. Okay, so the end point may be verifying the quantum nature of the Newtonian gravitational interaction, but that does not mean that on the way we don't have benefits. Okay, so this is what I'll try to also briefly allude to. Now, of course, an important open question is whether gravity is quantum. And the natural inclination for people, mainly those coming from more main... Mainly those coming from more mainstream gravity, perhaps, the natural inclination will be to test old quantum mechanics. Okay, so energy level quantization, for example. But if you want to test that, the numbers are ridiculously low. So you have kind of one nano Kelvin change in temperature, okay, of if a single graviton is hitting a device. So this is extremely difficult to detect. And that too you will need an antenna big enough to receive that. Big enough to receive that. Another way might be, as people have done in electromagnetic theory, is to take corrections to the potentials. So you go to the second order, third order. So you have H bar dependent corrections. Again, these are ridiculously small for gravity. We'll have computed them, but they're very small. So somehow, because gravity is weak, if we are to do something effective in an experiment, we have to live with the Newtonian interaction. So we have to use the Newtonian interaction. Okay, so we have to use the Newtonian interaction, otherwise, there's no chance in any experiment, any foreseeable future. Okay, so how can we cleverly exploit the Newtonian interaction? And there the solution is, like because we came from quantum information side, is let us test for a different aspect of gravity, okay? Entanglement conveying ability. Okay, so this is what I'm going to speak about. Is what I'm going to speak about. Now, just as a backdrop, I would like to mention how we do, you know, how a popular way of doing quantum gates in quantum information. So you have two qubits, typically superconducting qubits would interact this way, and you can use a long microwave bus as the exchange, as the bus. And typically, how they interact is by creating virtual photons in this bus. Creating virtual photons in this bus. And it's a long idea from Hiroshi's time. He feared reactions to an empty cavity and is the virtual photon exchange in the empty cavity, which led to their interaction. So there the photon does not appear at all in the final is like an effective interaction, but happens through the virtual exchange. And the same thing is the main angle people try to use to make superconducting qubits interact. Superconducting qubits interact. Obviously, this will not work at all if this intermediate bus was a classical bus. So, this is exactly the philosophy that we will be using. And in the backdrop, think also of this fact that actually any electromagnetic interaction that between two charges in empty space is also in the end the same thing, right? Because we don't have an explicit cavity bus, but we have the vacuum. So it takes place through that kind of. It takes place through that kind of virtual exchange. So, we want to really compare this situation: whether gravity is really like the other interactions, like the interaction, the EM or the weak force or the strong force, that they happen through exchange of virtual particles, okay? Or whether it is something completely different. Of course, gravity is qualitatively, as we know, has many qualitative differences, so that possibility we cannot. Possibility we cannot give up already. But there is a very good, effective description of gravity, exactly like the other forces. Okay, so with the exchange of a spin to a particle, okay, through virtual excitations, virtual, the exchange through virtual excitations of the field, that you have the Newtonian interaction. And what we are going to check is whether it is that kind of mechanism which is working, or if you had a classical Or, if you had a classical exchange, okay, how do we show something classically? So, this is my cartoon for classical. Okay, so you have a continuously observed system, it's like a classical. So, the observation does not change the state of the system is classical. So, this is why I've used this cartoon here. So, we want to find whether gravity is of the left kind of form or right kind of form. Okay. Now, we need to introduce some one. Introduce some one definition and one assumption, okay. So, first of all, uh, let me actually go down to the definition first. Okay, so we are talking about quantum and classical, so we should define what we mean by classical. Okay, so this is the definition, okay. So, we define a classical field, okay, but we define in presence of allowing the freedom for quantum matter, okay. So, these j's are shown in inside kets, okay, so the j depend. So the J depend is the quantum other quantum fields or quantum matter. Okay, so they can perfectly be in gets or density matrices. They are described quantum mechanically. But corresponding to each state, gravity has a classical description. So this is the definition of quantum matter and classical field. So the matter may be quantum, but field has to be classical. Of course, we allow for fluctuation. Of course, we allow for fluctuations. We allow for fluctuations on purpose to emphasize the point that fluctuations alone are not quantum, right? Because you can have classical statistical things. So quantum is fluctuations in more than one basis, right? So we are taking here, we are allowing for various probabilities for various quantum matter states and corresponding classical states. So this is our definition of classical field. Of course, I should say what I mean. Feel, of course, I should say what I mean by classical state is everywhere in space-time it has a unique value. Okay, so the is a number, okay? So, that's that's just as we think of classical M field, okay? It's a number at every point, three, six, you know, six numbers at every point. Yeah, so here, here it will be, you know, the tensor number at every point, okay? That many numbers. Now, that is the definition of classicality, okay? Very standard textbook definition as we learn classical feed. Definition as we learn classical field. And then we should make one assumption. This assumption, of course, is coming from the locality of interactions in nature. We know interactions in nature are local, all interactions we know about are local. So that locality we are incorporating into our hypothesis, and that locality essentially comes from relativistic causality. So in some sense, we are using the relativistic causality. The relativistic causality, okay. So, this means that we need a mediator to inter enact an interaction over distance. Okay, this is why I said we are not trying to prove the quantumness of a historical action at a distance-Newtonian interaction. There's nothing to prove there, okay? There's no intermediate field, okay? But we need an intermediate mediator once we come to relativity, okay? Because you need, you know, you cannot go at a distance without a field in the middle, okay. At a distance without a field in the middle, okay. That's as simple as that, okay? Because interactions are local in nature, okay, or quasi-local. Okay, I mean, we might allow some smearing or some very small distance non-locality, but over the distance at which we are separating our apparatus, you need to have the locality. Now, after following this, it is very straightforward to show. I mean, this slide is really for people not coming from quantum information, okay? Coming from quantum information, okay. So, as I said, that we are allowing local operations on the system from this locality. Okay, so what does local operations mean? Yeah, it can have local limitary evolutions, you can have local measurements, tracing away some part that is generically encoded in things called positive, completely positive trace-preserving maps. Okay. And then you have classical communication because of this field. Communication because of this field, I say it is always a C number, as a number, not simply C number, real number, collection of many real numbers. Okay, so when you go at a distance, you can only do classical communication. So you can generally do local quantum operations and classical omission can always be represented in this way, and that takes initially separable states, keeps them separable. Okay, it's just a two-line proof. Okay, so essentially, establishing. So, essentially, establishing entanglement will be not possible in this scenario where you have quantum matter but classical fields. So now I go to the schematic experiment, which shows that you can create, well, it shows the criteria, the scenario you need to create and test entanglement due to the gravitational interaction. Of course, in our maths, we will not use the intermediate field. Use the intermediate field explicitly. It is, you know, the effective interaction is what we will use, which is the Newtonian interaction, because the maths will be same. But we cannot forget that from relativistic causality, you have to have the intermediate field doing that. And then we are going to make inferences about that intermediate field. So what do we do? We create a superposition of left and right, left and right of two masses, okay, with distance delta x. Okay, with distance delta x's, okay, and the centers displaced by d. Okay, and then what happens is because of the different distance for these masses, okay, say for example, when the masses are closest, okay, then as you know, gravitational interaction is the interaction energy is inversely proportional to the distance separation. So it's the fastest evolving phase over here. Okay, so these different components, LR, L. Components LRLLRL and RR will evolve at different rates. Okay, simply Gang's law, E by H bar. Okay, this is the frequency. Okay. And that's going to result take L common. Okay. L plus R, the relative phase between that. And if you take R common, the relative phase there are not the same state. Okay. As soon as they're not the same state, unless these both these phases. State, unless both these phases are zero, this is not the same state, which means it is an entangled state. And in fact, it is a maximally entangled state when they sum up to pi. Now we are going to make an important assumption that suppose consider the scenario when these closest approach is much smaller than the superpositions created. So L plus R is a special superposition of a mass. R is a special superposition of a mass being here and there, another is a special mass being here and there. We are considering the you know the astoundingly difficult limit here, but you know, just for simplification, that when this separation really is much larger than the closest approach, okay, that simplifies things. So you have only one dominant phase between R and L and no other phases dominating. Also allows you to see the full strength of effect. When it is comparable or less, you don't see the full strength of the entire living effect. Strength of the entire living effect. Now, of course, how is this closest approach restricted? That is something important. The closest approach, you cannot bring them arbitrarily close, okay? At least not without a screening. The matter of screening, I will not cover in my talk, and I hope Anupam will cover that. I have a few slides in the end. If it is not covered enough, we can go into that in the discussion section. Now, let's just think of the two relevant forces. Suppose you have neutral masses interacting, still, there's electromagnetic interactions between them. Even if you don't have any charge multiples, anything inside, there's still electromagnetic interaction between them. And that is because that is the Casimir interaction. So it is the interaction between vacuum fluctuation introduced dipoles in both the masses. So that will always be there. Now, if you take their Okay, now if you take their strengths, you see you don't have too much freedom. Okay, it's fundamentally an electromagnetic and a gravitational interaction. It depends on mass Planck square and the density of objects, you know, density of objects also you have some limits. So typically what you end up with that you have to go 200 microns apart, at least without screening, to keep the Casimi force about a tenth of the gravitational one. So there's no chance if you have one micron, for example. One micron, for example, okay. So you have to have this large distance. Okay, of course, with screening, you can reduce this substantially. But assuming that kind of 200 micron separation, okay, and still taking this delta x to be like half of that 100 microns, so I am now taking in the other phases as well. Okay, you can substitute and see that you will have about a hertz frequency of evolution of this phase. Frequency of evolution of this phase, so about a hertz frequency of entanglement. Okay, so in one second, you will get a maximally entangled state. Okay, if you took what people, what I learned from my colleagues that they can do is trap microspheres. Okay, so you can trap microspheres and you can create superpositions of microspheres. And then about in a second time, you will get this kind of phase. In fact, here, what is happening here, one can say that gravity can. Can say that gravity capital G is generally pretty weak. So, what's happening here is that the Planck's constant h-bar sitting in the denominator is amplifying this phase effect. If you want to see a classical effect through gravity, like acceleration of mass towards one point or other, that is very, very small. And that's actually independent of the mass of the object which is falling towards it. However, when you amplify this effect by the H-bar. When you amplify this effect by the h-bar in the middle, it becomes like a one hertz observable in one second. Okay, now, just a little bit of history here, okay, that just to say what are the developments that we have done on over past ideas in what I presented. Okay, so first of all, there was this conference in Chapel Hill in 1957 when Feynman and others were discussing. And others were discussing about whether gravity is quantum. And then Feynman said that gravity must obviously be quantum, which can be tested in the following kind of experiment, where he took a mass with a spin and put it in a superposition. And then he told what about if another mass moves one way or other in its effect. Okay, then to describe the combined situation, you have to use quantum mechanics. you have to use quantum mechanics, quantum amplitudes. That's the word he used. Now, obviously, here, so what is the situation with that kind of thing being a practical experiment is, first of all, a second mass will move at 10 to the power minus 16 meter per second square acceleration towards one center or another. So you cannot just use that classical acceleration to really entangle. Classical acceleration to really entangle two masses in practicality. So you have to use this phase development. So that is one of the points that I made previously, the previous slides. And the other thing Feynman was unclear about, obviously he meant some kind of property of two objects that you have to measure. But it turns out to be entanglement. So quantification of entanglement. So this is what is another development on this kind of. On this kind of idea. Now, we should also say that why some, if you might want to make your work easier, try to do something lesser. Can something lesser work? Okay. The single mass interferometry, some people might argue, if you believe that a mass here creates a curvature centered here and a mass here creates a curvature centered here, and that principle still holds when you're in superposition. Still holds when you're in superposition, okay. Then, with those assumptions, one could probably say that a single mass interferometry is enough, okay. But the my problem okay, that's great. Okay, how do you know that gravity was at all involved in such a situation? Okay, the other thing is people have previously suggested to use the stochasticity, left or right, okay, that if mass is left, it centers gravity to left, mass is right. Left it centers gravity to the left, mass is right, centers gravity to the right, and randomly a mass moves left or right. Okay, but that is again classical stochastic field. Okay, so you have to prove quantum, you have to use more than one basis. And then the other thing is you have to use phases because that's this, you know, m squared effect. Okay. Now, the other thing is there are ideas of using a smaller mass and a larger mass. But my point is that if you do the hard work of creating superpositions and really achieve Superpositions and really achieve these things. Why do we not use two of them? You have a M square effect, right? So there's no point in using one smaller mass and one larger mass. You can create superpression, you can create subversion, you can create two of them, right? Anyway, so we need to create this thing, large mass, large splitting, and long duration superposition. A second is a very long duration for these kind of things. Now, typically, you create superpositions. Typically, you create superpositions using a beam splitter, right? That's the most traditional way of doing it. Okay. Why does it not work for large masses? Obvious. Okay. So, because a beam splitter is nothing but a tunnel, a barrier, right? You have partial reflection. Okay, so but you cannot have barriers for big masses because of this obvious thing. You have just this becomes ridiculously small. So you cannot even hope to create a bump and have a beam split a large mass, okay? A lot of this micron size. Okay, so you have to use some internal ancilla, okay? Internal ancilla, okay, to create this kind of splitting. And this is what we have been suggesting for a while, but the true things we are just getting at. So you see a couple of 2021 papers. Okay, one was mentioned by Gavin the other day, and one we have recently done with a student Marshman. Okay, there are some precursors here also that essentially use turn garlock effect. Okay, the broad idea is you create a spin inside a microscope. Create a spin inside a microscopic macro, like a microsphere object in an up plus down state, and then use this gradient field to split it up. Okay. At appropriate times, you use flipping switch to break, turn, and then bring, you know, re-accelerate back and then come them to, you know, together. Okay, so this is called stern-garlak interferometry. Okay, has been done with atoms. Now, how will you do the actual experiments? You will let parallelly two things fall from two tracks. Parallelly, two things fall from two traps. Okay, do the standard interferometry on each side with a modified stage where we will map electronic spins to nuclear spins. Then they don't see any magnetic fields and they just fall parallelly across each other for a time. Okay, that is the second. If you have that and you repeat all that algebra that I showed now with this combined system, so L and R are now replaced with L up and R down, and you just repeat your maths, a nice magic happens. A nice magic happens, okay? That these masses are now together, okay, but the entanglement that grew between them is automatically mapped into an entanglement between the spins, okay. Now, entanglement in spins is what we are habituated to testing from quantum information, so by spin correlations. So, we just measure this thing called an entanglement weakness, okay. Now, so exactly, this is showing the thing at the end of the experiment. What you'll do is you will measure the spins embedded in these two masses to verify. Embedded in these two masses to verify this entanglement that happened actually between the masses due to their gravitational interaction. Okay. And even when you have decoherence, what are the things causing your decoherence are so anyway? So that will come to it. But in presence of decoherence and for a small phase, okay, weaknesses can approximately be, I mean, this is a full expression, but approximate expression is that you need the phase effect to dominate over the decoherence effects, okay, as simple as that, okay. Okay, as simple as that, okay, and the decoherence effects happen due to blackbody radiation and atom scattering. Essentially, either of these, if they reveal the position of the object, then you're gone. Atoms have such short de Broglie wavelengths, a single atom hitting will tell whether the mass is left or right. So we need to decrease the pressure. Similarly, blackbody emission, many blackbody photons emitted will gradually localize the position of the mass. So we have to cool the system. Okay, so we need these. Okay, so we need these temperatures Kelvin and 10 over minus 16 Pascal. Another form of noise is this relative acceleration noise. So you have random accelerations due to external masses. Because this is an incredibly sensitive device, even a 10 to the power minus 40 meter per second square acceleration can cause unit phase change. Okay, that's a problem. So we have recently seen how you can do that. So you find fight, kind of you fight. Fight kind of you fight using Einstein's equivalence principle. Okay, you can say if we fight Einstein with Einstein's belief that gravity is classical, but we use the equivalence principle, so we put everything, the whole experiment in a freely falling lift, then all these external accelerations just go away. You are, of course, still left with the finite size effect, which is the curvature effect that we have to handle. And you are left with jitters from atoms bumping off that container. So you have to have a draw. That container, so you have to have a drop tower with a very low pressure. So, hopefully, that more details will be there. Anupam's talking this. I just also mentioned that if you could create exceedingly large superpositions, okay, you could also detect gravitational waves compactly on a tabletop, not tabletop really, but in a sufficiently meter-scale device. So, you need things like nano-crystal masses, but meter-scale supervision held for one second. Held for one second. It's very challenging in current technology, but if you can overcome that, this is the spin-off of things on the way. You already sense accelerations very good on the way. So I think that's all I had to say. This is the list of things we have done on this area. We have some more recent works also on QBAIDs and stuff. So I don't go into those details, but yeah, so I can address some questions maybe now. Thanks. Thanks for your attention. Okay, so let's thank Sagaro questions. Okay, maybe I can ask the first one then. Are there other candidate theories that make different predictions for the amount of entanglement? Like, can you rule out things? Because here, as I understand, you're working in this weak field limit, and so we're sort of testing. And so we're sort of testing this theory, but are there going to be other theories that maybe predict different amounts of entanglement or that we could rule out? Yeah, I think the kind of theories you can rule out with these are theories where gravity is classical. So there are some quantum classical hybrid theories. I don't know their full status under the situation of Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance where Or diffeomorphism invariance where quantum classical combination makes sense, but I would like such theories to make sense because otherwise, what would be the use of this? Okay, this would be useful if quantum classical hybrid theories cannot be ruled out by logical, you know, logical. But I'm not knowledgeable enough in these theories. Okay, however, you can view it also in another way. I mean, even if such theories were not there at all, you just believed in. Okay, you just believed in relativistic quantum field theory in a weak field limit, then this would still be a verification of the gravity is following that. And actually on the way to this, not this experiment, but on the way to this, much before you will be ruling out things like collapse models, which are also a version of quantum classical, where kind of the localized is gradually becoming classical kind of theory. Classical kind of theory. So, those will be, those are impediments on our way if they are actually there. But we are not assuming any of those theories. So, they will get ruled out on the way to building such things. That's good. That's good. Rob, I see your hand. Yeah, thanks. So, I have two questions. One I asked Gavin earlier, and the other is a bit related to what Alex said. So, the first one is, Said. So the first one is: Don't, in order to do this properly, don't we need to understand the gravitational attraction between these two small masses at these distances without searching for entanglement? How well do we understand that? And then the other is, suppose if you don't see entanglement, then of course it's clear. But if you do see it, how do you know it's gravity and not some inhomogeneity in the electromagnetic field or something? In the electromagnetic field, or something? Okay, okay. So, both very good questions. Okay, so maybe I'll address the latter one first, okay, because it's the most interesting answer there. Okay, so essentially, you have to be clear of systematic effects, right? So, suppose there are some electromagnetic multiples hiding inside, which we have not found out, but they have to be the same from run to run, okay? So, random effort. To run, okay. So random effects cannot entangle. You know, random effects will create some phase in one run, some other phase in another run, so we'll not manifest it as a as a phase, right? So it will be more manifest as a decoherence, right? So if we are getting a very, so we of course we have to eliminate systematic effects, like some unknown fifth forces or some other, you know, things if we are systematic. Since if we are systematic, if we are close enough to have Casimir, but you see, we will make sure that Casimir is either screened or we are far enough, and any unknown forces, such as any say, action-induced force or something like that, that we will get rid of just by the distance. So, we know Newtonian gravity to be very well tested over these 200 microns or 100 microns distances with screening. 100 microns distances with screening is 10 microns, but even that is well tested, though what is not tested is for smaller muscles. Okay, so one would probably have to have a good knowledge. So unless there is something new coming in from smaller mass sources at 10 microns distances, we can be sure of it in other ways in the classical experiments when we test those forces. Though there is a caveat, if the force strength is so low that you probably have to do a quantum experiment. So low that you probably have to do a quantum experiment to test that in the first way, like an interferometry of one mass near another. And what was your first question by now? I forgot. Well, just how well do we understand? I forget how heavy these masses are, but how well do we understand the classical gravitational attraction between masses this small at these distances? At that distances? Don't we need to do that? Exactly. No, I think there's the future window, Reggie. Yeah, so it's a very good point. Reggie, yeah, so it's a very good point. So, there's definitely a window there for this scale of masses. Okay, what I say this for this scale of distances, we know there isn't anything else because we are then sufficiently separated. But for this level of masses, there may be something else. So, that is the kind of experiment should be done before. And it has not yet been done, right? Is anybody doing it? No, no, I think, yeah, Marcus is the person doing these things. Uh, he's the person doing these things, but he hasn't gone down to micron-size muscles yet. But, but, yeah, so you'll probably hear in his talk. Yeah, he's going down the scale, right? Um, so maybe we can have one more quick question from uh Samari. Yeah, so so it's going to sound really naive, but I'm not sure I fully understand in what sense you use the term quantum gravity. And of course, some of us mean something by it. And I understand that what you're looking for. I understand that what you're looking for is how gravity, you know, so maybe just some clarification on that terminology. I'm sure you've been asked this question many times, but yeah, sorry. No, no, no, it's absolutely a valid question. Okay, so I should find that outset, we are almost redefining what we mean by quantum gravity, right? So, so in some sense, I mean non-classicality of, I mean, of course, everyone redefines what, so, so, of course, we do not. So, of course, we do not say that we want to detect gravitons, like gravitons of a gravitational wave, something like that, okay? Because I already said that that is extremely difficult. One doesn't have any near future chance of detecting that level of thing. So, what we are detecting here is the entanglement conveying ability of a system, which is a kind of non-classicality. So, it's a quantum. It's a quantum nature of gravity rather than quantum gravity. Okay, so quantum nature of gravity in the sense that it can, the gravitational field can exist in superpositions. Or if the gravitational field does not satisfy this being a classical number at every point in space. But you're not talking about, sorry, you're not talking about the gravitational field being superposed. You're talking about these two masses. And I don't see any field theory. I don't see any. Any field theory, I don't see any of that in the constructions. I'm not entirely sure where those concepts are coming in. No, so not explicitly. So, so it is coming in at this level that when you have the, so this picture, okay, so when you you can explain the Newtonian interaction through an intermediate field, an intermediate exchange. So, some excitation of the intermediate field, okay, but even normally you need a Even normally, you need a field to explain the neutron interaction, and so that is what we are assuming. Okay, so we are going, so it's an assumption within our thing that because of relativistic causality, you cannot assume the neutron interaction to be like action at a distance. So, under that situation, we are doing it, but we are doing the maths by directly using the Newtonian interaction, which is derived from this philosophy. So perfect. So good. Yeah. Great. So let's thank Segato again and our quick movie. And we add.
