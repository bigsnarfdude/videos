Okay, so we'll talk about from an anomalous to classical diffusion in a non-linear detection. Thank you, Oscar. Okay, first, thank you so much for the invitation and for the introduction. invitation for the introduction i'm very happy to give a talk in this seminar even virtually and as already said today i will talk about this work this a joint work with jeremy locimin with university of luxembourg and the title is from anomalous to classical diffusion in a non-linear heat equation here's the plan of my presentation first i will My presentation first, I will introduce the equation which I consider in this talk. The main idea of this equation is to model some anomalous diffusion process in physics or biology or see. And the main idea of this equation is it considers the fractional Laplacian operator. So in the second part of this talk, I will give you a definition and Give you a definition and a few properties of this nice operator. And then, in the third and the main part of this talk, actually, we are interested in the following equation. What happened with the fractional appliances moves to the classical one? And moreover, how fast this fractional applaution can move to the classical one. Okay. Okay, so in this talk we shall consider the following parabolical reaction diffusion equation where use the solution of this equation. The diffusion term is given by the fractional fashion operator in this part of the equation. Let I will give you a precise definition of this operator. And moreover, the reaction term is given the reaction term is given by this non-linear term where eta is a fixed vector on the space and moreover we consider the full non-linear equation i means the parameter beta is an integer larger or equals than two so the main motivation of this kde is given by the fact we have a lot of We have a lot of models involving the fractional apparition operator. For example, if we set the parameter b equals to 2, we have the following equation, we recover the following equation, which is a generalized Burger's equation, is a very useful equation in some computational turbulence, more precisely, to model for some anomalous turbulence. Some anomalous turbulence diffusion problems. On the other hand, the larger values for the non-linear parameter V are also motivated by this kind of models, more precisely when we are interested in describing some anomalous growth of molecular dynamics. So in these few examples, we have two main ideas. The first one, as already said, the As already said, the anomalous diffusion process is mathematically given by the fractional Plaza operator. And moreover, these words, which are not mathematical works, strongly suggest that if the parameter alpha is close to two, then the solutions of the fractional model behave as the solutions of the classical model when considering the Model when considering the classical plastic and operator. So, our idea is to study in a rigorous way what happened with this fact which is experimentally suggested in these previous works. So, let me introduce you the fractional Laplacian operator. For this, I will just recall the classical one. Call the classical one. This is a second-order derivative operator. And moreover, it is well known that it is a homogeneous operator of order two, given by this formula here. Moreover, another well-known fact on the classical Laplacian operator is that if we study the action of this operator in the full variable, we can find that the two. That the two times derivative in the special variable are given now by the multiplication by this sample in the fuller variable. And this is the main idea to introduce a fractional version of this operator, which is the easy one. Actually, if we want to give a definition of the fractional Parisian operator, first in the Fourier variable, we are going to substitute this sample by this sample here when the parameters are. This sample here when the parameter alpha belongs to the interval 0, 2. Here we have a first definition of this fractional derivative given by the parameter alpha. Obviously, we have a definition in the spatial variable, which is given by this formula here. Here, this expression is concerned to measure the To measure the fractional regularity properties of the function phi. And here this limit means the principal value. But here we have an interesting remark because if we get back to the definition of the classical Laplacian operator, we can see this is a local operator. However, the fractional version However, the fractional version is a non-local operator in the sense that we are considered the integral of the wall space. So this is one of the main difference between the classical and the fractional operator, this fact that the fractional partial operator is a non-local operator. And moreover, we can see that this is also an homogeneous operator, but now Homogeneous operator, but now of the order alpha. It's a from the mathematical point of view, there are two different operators with different properties. Okay, so in the main part of this talk, as already said, we are interested in studying what happened with the fractional Laplacian moves to the classical one. And for this, we'll get back to our equation. Get back to our equation where for each value of the parameter alpha, we get a corresponding PDE and we shall denote by u alpha the corresponding solution. And the idea is to study what happens with this family of solutions when the parameter alpha goes to 2. Intuitively, if we set alpha equals to 2 in this equation, we shall recover the classic. Recover the classical nonlinear equation. So, our problem is to study in a rigorous way this convergence in some functional spaces. Okay, for this, let me tell you some previous related work on this problem, on the study of this convergence. The first one is a linear case, which is a study on. Case, which is a study on bounding domains. This is a work of Picary and Hernandez Atamaria, when they consider the following linear equation. Here, I emphasize we have a linear equation because this source term does not depend on the function u. And moreover, here we are working on a bounded domain. And then, using this fact, using the fact that The fact that we are in a bounded domain, they can use some compactness arguments to show that the solutions of the fractional problem converge to the classical one in the weak topology of the space L2. Here we have the space L2 in time and also in the spatial variable. Another interesting related Sorry, they also study from the numerical point of view convergence rate, which is given to the expression 2 minus alpha to this power one half. Okay, another interesting related work is given by Julio Daniel Rossi and his collaborator. In this case, they consider the following non-local problem. Problem, which is actually more technical. But the main idea of this equation is that it shares the same scaling properties as the classical one. It means here the diffusion part is given by the convolution with this kernel, which is given in this formula here, and where the function G is as mode readily as. G is a small readily symmetric symmetric function. Moreover, we have similar assumptions on the kernel G in this non-linear term. But the main assumption of this work is that the Fourier transform, sorry, here is the lyrical hat, in the Fourier transform, the main idea is that the Fourier transform or this kernel G Kernel G actually verifies this property here, which is the same that verifies the sample of the classical expression operator. In other words, the fuller variable, this expression actually behaves as the sample in the classical Laplacian operator. And with this main assumption, the authors can prove that Can prove that the solution of the fractional problems converts to the classical one, in this case, in the strong topology of the space L2. However, if we recall we are interested in studying this problem in the case of the fractional Lafassian operator, we cannot use all the theory developed in this previous work because our equation does not share Our equation does not share the main scaling properties as the classical one. So, this is the main difference between the fractional fraction and the classical one. We have different scaling properties and we cannot use all these resources. On the other hand, the sample of the fractional applaution when the parameter alpha is smaller than the alpha. Alpha is smaller than 2. Obviously, it does not verify this main assumption here. This is another main difference to our case. So to study this convergence in the case of the fresh analyplant, we need to use a different approach. So what is our idea? We're going to consider the initial value problem. The initial value problem for both the anomalous diffusion and the classical diffusion given by this equation. This problem has been well studied in some previous works. So let me tell you about the main result on the well positions. If we consider an initial data belonging to the space L1, then we can prove that there are Can prove that there exists a unique global in-time solution which belongs to this functional space. Here we have a soft legal space, so we have a Lirgain of regularity on these solutions. So in our study, we start by the revised version of the well posness, which we shall use later. We shall use later. And then in our first result, we're going to consider both the diffusion case and the classical one when the parameter alpha is equals to two. And moreover, we shall consider an initial data belonging to the space L1 as the previous theorem, but also belonging to this sub space HS, where the parameter S is larger than the dimension over 2. Over two. We are able to construe a unique logo in time solution belonging to this functional space, but moreover, this additional information of the initial data allows us to prove that a strong regularizing effect, and actually we are able to prove that the solutions became C infinity in the spatial variable, C1 in the time variable. C1 in the time variable, and also they solve the problem in the classical things. And with this first result, within the framework of this first result, now we are ready to study the convergence problem. So, what is the idea? We're going to consider a family of initial data belonging to this space, and we shall then And we shall denote uα the corresponding solution for each corresponding PDE according to the parameter alpha. On the other hand, we are going to consider this initial data for the classical case, where 2 means that we are considered the classical Laplacian operator, and here we have the corresponding solution. Here, Here, as the solution belongs to this Sovald space and also using this well-known Sovald van beating, then the solution belongs to the L-infinity space. So we are able to study a uniform convergence. More precisely, our main result reads as follows. We're going to consider a parameter gamma. Consider a parameter gamma and we assume that the family of initial data converge to the initial data in the classical case with this convergence rate, which is given by the expression 2 minus alpha to the power gamma. And then we fix a time positive and we are able to prove a little epsilon, which is a little. Epsilon, which is a little constant, such that and also a constant which only depends on epsilon the time t, such that we have the following estimate. Here we can see that the solutions of the fractional problem converge to the classical one. And moreover, we are able to measure the convergence rate, which is given by the following. Which is given by the following expression, the maximum between this expression, 2 minus alpha to the power gamma, and this one, 2 minus alpha. So what is the idea in this expression here? Let me tell you a few words. Essentially, we can see here that the convergence rate of the solutions is given by a competition between these two terms. More precisely, More precisely, if the parameter gamma is smaller or equal than one, then we have that the maximum between these two terms is given by this expression. And in this case, the solution of the fractional problem converges to the classical one with the same convergence rate as we assume for the initial data. However, if the parameter gamma is larger than one, then the maximum between these two is the same. Maximum between these two expressions is given by the second one. And in this case, it is interesting to observe that the convergence rate of the solution actually is smaller than the convergence rate we have assumed for the initial data. What is the idea of the proof? In order to prove this result, we have considered the my solution. Consider my solution of this equation for both for the classical case and for the fractional case. If for the classical case, when we have the fractional La Pacian operator, my solution writes down in this formula here, where the function H is the well-known heat kernel. And moreover, in the classical case, we have a similar structure for A similar structure for the Mike solution where here the kernel key is the amber spouse transform on this expression here. So our main idea was to study first a sharp convergence of the fractional kernel to the classical one. More precisely, we have the following estimate. So what is the idea? What is the idea? How can we prove this estimate? Here, the norm in the space h2 to the power minus s is given by this formula here. And then the main idea is to fix a time t and a variable c and consider this function where the parameter alpha. the parameter alpha is our variable. And then we can prove that the difference between these two terms are given actually by this formula here, which is the same expression that we define in this estimate above. And once we have this main estimate, we are going to consider the difference between the fractional Between the fractional solutions and the classical one, and we are going to study separately the linear terms and then the non-linear terms. Moreover, we shall use the following estimates, which is not so difficult to prove. And then here, by splitting the linear term in this way, we can find actually this expression, the maximum with two. Expression: the maximum between these two. The first one is given actually by the convergence rate we have assumed on the initial data, and the other one is given by the previous estimate, which is actually the convergence of the fractional kernel to the classical one. On the other hand, we also are able to estimate the non-linear The non-linear terms. This is the hard part because here we have the parameter beta is as large as we want. But finally, we can estimate this expression by this formula here, 2 minus alpha. And by ethering these two estimates, we recover this expression, which is the convergence rate for the Which is the convergence rate for the solutions. Here, as I already said, we work in the L infinity space. So we can prove a uniform convergence. Also, a punctual point Y is the convergence. And also, we are able to study the convergence in another L P norms in the following corollary. Corollary. More precisely, we are able to estimate the difference between the fractional solutions to the classical one in this LP norm in time and LQ norm in space, where in this case the convergence rate is given by the maximum between these two quantities as the previous theorem. But here it is also interesting to observe that the convergence rate is also The convergence rate is also driven by the parameter q in the lq norm in the space variable. The p norm in the time variable does not play any role in this in this convergence rate. Maybe an interesting case is when we consider p equals to q equals to 2, and then we recover this convergence rate, which was Rate, which was numerically studied in some previous works, actually in the linear case. And this for the non-linear case, we have the same convergence rate. Okay, that's all. And thank you so much for your attention. Thank you, Oscar. So, any questions? Oscar, so any questions or comments? I wonder if at some point in your slide you fixed the regularity to have global existence like S greater than M over 2, I remember well. Actually, the regularity, no, we have a global existence even if the initial data belongs to the space. data belongs to the space L1. This is the classical result for this type of equation. But the regularity of the solutions is not well known. So here we assume this additional condition of the initial data to improve the regularity of solutions. Actually, we need to improve the regularity of solutions. We need to improve the regularity of solutions in order to control the non-linear term in these estimates here. I didn't write down the word estimates because there are a lot of estimates, but in order to control these terms here, we need a more strong regularity of solution. This is one reason why we consider an initial data also belonging. An initial data also belonging to the space HS. Do you think you can slow it down a little bit the regularity? This is a good question. Actually, I don't know if the regularity is the optimal one. Because here, in order to prove this main estimate, which is the converter. Estimate with the convergence of the fractional kernel to the classical one, we need actually this weight in the Fourier variable in order to study this term here. So I think in this sense, maybe this kind of regularity where S is larger than the dimension over 2 is the optimal one in order to study this. to to study these these these estimates in the for the kernels okay and and also i don't know but maybe i'm not sure if you are interested in this problem and proposed you but also is it maybe it is interesting to consider the case where alpha approaches to one and see the convergence no because if alpha is No, because if alpha is less than one, you can have blow-up. This is a very, very good question. Actually, we have considered this case, but by using these tools, we are not able to do this study in the low regularity case when the parameter alpha goes to one. So for us, this is still an open and interesting question. Thank you, Carla. Thank you, Kim. Any other question? I have some. Could you show the statement of the main theorem? The main theorem. So, if you change the assumption that you have in the coverage rate for the initial data, right, if I understood correctly, any coverage rate that you have in the initial data, it will be there in the maximum, right? It will appear, for example, to output to the colour kernel, you will appear exactly like this, right? So, if you replace that with other type of convergence, it will appear in your conclusion. If you appear in your conclusion, it will be always the maximum between the rate that you put in the initial data and two minus half, right? Yeah. Yeah, because here we have the same convergence of the initial data, and this another term is given by the convergence of the kernels, which is given in these by this estimate here. So we can always create examples that the solution. That the solution converges like different from the initial data, like you said in the conclusion of the data. Yeah, this is one of the conclusion if the convergence, if the initial data has a fast convergence rate, because here the parameter gamma measures the convergence rate in the initial data. And actually, if gamma is larger than one, If gamma is larger than one, here we have the convergence rate of the solutions does not follow the convergence from the initial data. So maybe this is the more interesting remark in this sense. And another question is about the epsilon that appears in that epsilon that alpha is greater than one. That alpha is greater than one plus x, right? Do you have any? Yeah, this is actually relates to the previous question because if the parameter alpha is close to one, we have some quantities which we are not able to control. So this is why we need the parameter alpha must be a little larger than. A little larger than this is of the main reason why the case when alpha goes to one is still open for us because we don't know how to get rid of this condition. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So, any question or comments? So, if not, let's think. Thank you. Thank you very much. It was a good time in Canada. Thank you. Thank you.
