My thesis, and it's also based on joint work with Richard, who just gave a very nice talk, and Matthew Burke. So I'll just get started here. So we're kind of a couple days in now, and we've seen a few different classes of kind of examples of tangent categories. Um so uh and they kind of fall into a few different families at this point. Um so you have one it's kind of like a generalized category of smooth spaces I'll just put and you can see this. So you can I kind of move you can have manifolds, but you can move to a different base ring. So manifolds over a base ring. So there's a good bone. Uh so there's a good book by Wolfgang Bertram on this let's just do some dashes and then you get uh into these sort of like you know models of SDG like face bases And then there's also these models coming from differential linear logic. So either like you take the co-Kleisley category and get a CDC or you take the co-EM cat, the co-Eilenberg Moore category. The Co-Eilenberg-Moore category, and you get a tangent category. So that's a result of LeMay, Cocket, and Lucian Wright. And as a third class, you can kind of just pick out these sort of structures in a tangent category. And these, you know, are usually with a kind of a point-wise tangent structure. So you can just think of this as, like, you know, a diff a vector field. A diff a vector field or a differential bundle, for example, where really you kind of apply the tangent functor and you know there's some canonical flips in there to you know bring you know the tangent maps to like the right level, maybe. So I Um so uh I was kind of uh kind of doing some work in uh Lie theory and I I is I kind of uh I think there's a couple of like pretty new models of uh tangent structure there. Um and uh yeah, so but I'll just leave this up so yeah there seems to be some pretty Some pretty so in this talk, yeah, sort of two new models models coming from Lie theory and they're going to be pretty different than these point-wise tangent structures and And it's also just kind of a little fascinating because these things have been getting used in mechanics for quite some time now. Lie theory. So the first thing is Lie algebroids. So these are often thought of as like a many object Lie algebra. Object Li algebra. But kind of starting from, you know, Weinstein sort of proposed to think about these as a context for Lagrangian mechanics. And that really turned into a pretty successful line of research. And, but actually, if you go back kind of 1905, Poincaré already sort of did this maybe 70 or so years before Lie algebras were really introduced, kind of already did this using a Lie algebra action. And so this is going to be kind of an interesting tangent structure because, and I should really point out, Martinez and Fusca, who recently did a PhD at Toronto, have really developed this incredibly well. It's really interesting because a lot I'm going to kind of give this tangent structure, and I'm not really going to be able to work with concrete Lie algebraids. We're going to move to this other setting called involution algebraid that makes everything a lot simpler. But if you look in the literature, you'll see that a lot of these things that are developed are really pragmatically introducing Lagrangian mechanics to a new setting and kind of giving you a lot more power. Setting and kind of giving you a lot more power to solve things. It's not sort of just abstraction for the sake of abstraction. And one where I haven't spent as much time with sort of the developments in mechanics, although there does seem to be there, but Lie Grupoitz has a similar sort of tangent structure. And it's really actually kind of using the Lie derivative. Kind of using the lead derivative from groupoids to algebraids as a tangent functor. And hopefully I'll time this out so I can sort of have that make sense. Okay. So, what is a Lie algebraid? So, so this is really this is what a this is what a differential geometer. Geometer, what some differential geometers would call a generalized tangent bundle. And, you know, maybe the word we should be inserting here is operational. So if I think of, you know, thought bubble, so if I'm thinking of Tm as being the derivations of C infinity mr, so the smooth functions from m into. So, the smooth functions from m into r, I take the derivations of that ring of functionals. People, you know, in smooth manifolds, finite dimensions, this is a perfectly reasonable definition of the tangent bundle. And if you were generalizing this, well, what would I do? Well, the first thing, I want to generalize the additive structure and all that sort of stuff. So, I'm going to have a vector bundle. Have a vector bundle that I'll call Aπ M and I'm gonna just switch to stick with differential bundles because they are the same thing. Okay, so that and so the derivations of a ring is Derivations of a ring is always a Lie algebra, right? So I'm going to ask that this is a Lie algebra, that these sections of pi. So people write that with this big gamma. Right, so that means we have a Libracket. But derivation, we also want this to kind of act like the derivations. Like the derivations. So, what we also ask for is an anchor map anch A to T M so this is going to be linear. And so that this satisfies what you'd call the Leibniz law. So we're going to say So we're going to say that I have f. So f is a smooth function, right? So I'm going to have f times x and y here. And because we have the anchor, we can form this map. So f x. I might get this mixed up. X. I might get this mixed up. I hope I don't. Times Y. Oh, wait. I should have the other way. I, yeah, sorry. I just completely screwed this up. F times XY plus it is FY times x and what this fy is is defined using the anchor and if I was just gonna draw it out I'm I start with oh what's that I have my M and then I do my Y into A then I anchor it I anchor it into Tm and then I do Tf into TR. And we remember that R is like this differential object, so we can we can trivialize it and we have this other map out of it you can call p hat and that's r so this is like it gives you a directional derivative that sort of behaves nicely with the With this algebra, with this Lie algebra. And so this is kind of, it's a generalized tangent bundle. So this is kind of what's used as a setting for differential geometry. And I'm not going to talk about morphisms of these things because morphisms Are horrible. You know, you either have to do some sort of embedding into the category of differential graded algebras, or you need maybe a choice of a covariant derivative, or you have, you know, the original definition uses this kind of decomposition of vector fields in a very complicated formula. But kind of either way, like these are horrible. Kind of either way, like these are horrible. That's a horrible notion. It just doesn't work very well at a categorical level, kind of to the extent that it's a bit of a proof just showing that these things compose. So I was going to give you examples. So there's the tangent bundle. Right, um, just using the normal uh bracket, right? Uh, there is um yeah, uh, a Li algebra action, and this is just whenever you have any. And this is just whenever you have any sort of Lie algebra morphism into your gamma. Just a bit of notation that kind of gets used. It's Oly algebra morphism into chi of n, like that set of vector fields. So and so this and this is kind of like what So this, and this is kind of like what where Poincaré showed that you can sort of replace chi of m with some algebra g for kind of classical mechanics. And another class of examples is if I start with a groupoid S T into N Into m there's an identity section e. I can take this pullback t dot g down into t dot m cross g so I'm going to p oh wait that's t s on the left and p on the right and here it's zero e and uh And we just get an A. And so we can kind of see how we get an anchored bundle here. Where we have T dot T, so we do the target for the anchor. And this is kind of source constant vector fields. And And yes, and so these are kind of like your major examples of Lie algebraids. And so I want to give you a tangent structure on this category. And I've already kind of avoided talking about morphisms. And so the way, kind of like the way Kind of like the way I've been looking at these is sort of based on this project that I originally started with Matthew and now Richard has been a part of is using involution algebraids. So yeah, so instead so Uh we're going to look at involution algebra and this is a very kind of similar thing and so it's there's a few shortcomings in this definition of Lie algebra so. So the first thing is it's sort of defined, defined using kind of sections, which means it's not going to be like a terribly algebraic thing. So it's not ideal in that setting, in that sense. And then also, it uses the base ring. Base ring, which is not ideal. And, you know, also, like, even forgetting very kind of nitpicky requires negatives, right? So, kind of at first glance, this isn't really this definitely. This definition doesn't really work in an arbitrary tangent category. Yeah. So instead, we're going to kind of look at We're going to kind of look at algebraids. And so I'm going to start off. So, this the first part of the structure I talked about was, or the second part was this anchor map. So, I just want to start off with an anchor map. So, we call these a differential bundle. Anchored bundles, yeah. Anchored bundles, yeah. And kind of the metaphor is that so an anchored bundle is to a involution algebra, an involution algebra. This is uh the same sort of relationship as. Sort of relationship as a reflexive graph and a groupoid, and yeah, a groupoid. So the definition is kind of as stated earlier, but let's just make it a formal thing. So it's a triple. It's pi A to M It is Xi and M to A and it is lambda A to T A. So that's a the first three give you a differential bundle. And then I'm also going to ask And then I'm also going to ask for this anchor map. And so that I'm just going to say pi psi lambda, all right, differential bundle. And the second thing is that anchor, this anch map. This ink map written with rho is linear. So I'm going to have A T A that's pretty small. Let me just make this a bit bigger. Right. Right, t dot ank, and here's just ank, lambda, and this is L. So this is a linear morphism. And there's a few bundles that we care about. So they're called prolongations. So I'll talk about the first prolongation. So I'll call it L. The first prolongation. So I'll call it LA. So we call these LA and L squared of A. And from what I can tell, these were introduced by Martinez. And what we do, so LA is, if I just write it out, it is the pullback of the anchor map along t dot pi. And if I, I'm just going to drag this over and kind of I'm just going to drag this over and kind of draw this out a bit more because you can see that this will have two linear structures on it. So the first thing is this sort of pullback, right? So I have TA, T dot pi here, and here's Tm, and here's ank. So this gives you that Finsler bundle. That Finsler bundle pullback structure, right? So this would give you a lift A ankh T dot pi T A and the lift here is going to be one cross C of T lambda. So it's going to be kind of, well, this is a differential bundle, right? This T pi. So it's the pullback of that differential bundle. So it's the pullback of that differential bundle. And I'm going to move this over again, because now I'm going to have to draw a bigger diagram. So, but there's also, we can look at this as a pullback in the category of differential bundles, right? So here I have p down to a, I have p down to m. So this is certainly a linear morphism. This is certainly a linear morphism there. Once again, pi down to m. That is linear. And this is p of pi 1 here, and that's down to a. Oh, this is equality. And so down here is pi. And then this is equals, because you know, equals holdback, you know. equals holdback. That's just how that goes. And so this different bundle you have is A ank T dot pi T A and it's lambda cross L and because that's the lift of this guy and the lift of that guy. Yeah, so these are kind of the two linear structures. So I'll just write Linear structures. So I'll just write that thing up here again. And for the third prolongation, because that would be a much bigger diagram. So I'm just going to write it out here. So I'll do L squared A and I'm going, it's going to be this pullback. It's A ank T dot pi. T A ank T dot ank t dot ank t squared pi t squared a and the the lifts here are it's the same pattern so it's lambda cross L cross L it is one cross C of Of T dot L cross C of T squared oh whoops no sorry C T lambda and this is T L and then this last one is one cross one cross Cross C of T dot C of T squared lambda. Okay, and you might notice a bit of a pattern here. So, and I'm going to talk about this in a bit. And if I were to kind of give a bit of a metaphor following on that sort of reflexive graph thing, I would graph thing. I would think of like this L of A, that's like my bundle of composable arrows in a graph. And L squared of A is like, you know, three, is three composable arrows. So let's just put it, L A is kind of like G target source G and L squared of A. Squared of a is like g target source g and this is going to be in a few ways because this is going to be enough to define our composition or in this case an evolution and this is going to be necessary to kind of give our coherence so you know if you were doing a groupoid you would need or an internal category you would need this for your associativity axiom and we're going to Associativity axiom, and we're going to need this for one of our axioms. How am I doing on time? Okay, no, that's good. I might not get groupoids, but I'll definitely get involution algebraids. So, an involution algebra. Okay, so we. Okay, so we start off, and we have an anchored bundle, and it's pi A to M xi lambda. And let's just remind you with the type of this. It's A to T M and it's equipped with a morphism. And sigma, and it is from L A to L A. And I should really like make sure like this thing was definitely Matthew's intuition. He had this idea of equipping kind of an anchored bundle with an involution map. An involution map and seeing if we could kind of build Li algebra's head of there. And it just kind of has ended up being a really spot-on intuition. So let's go over some axioms. So the first thing, well, it's an involution. So sigma of sigma is the identity map. Map. Okay. Um two. We have sigma. Um I'm gonna do it like this, L A, and I'm going to do lambda. Doesn't matter which way I do this, right? L A so this is So, this is linear. And so, that also means that when you kind of, so it just sort of flips the two lifts, right? It also involves involutes them, you know, it's an involution flip. Okay, and you know, because that means we can avoid talking about addition. So, three is unit. Um unit, yes. Um, I didn't name these other ones, but uh, linearity. Let's do it like that. Okay, so if I do sigma of xi of pi. Of pi comma lambda. So this pairing map, let's just draw the diagram. So if I do a xi pi lambda and then I do sigma that's just equal to xi pi o t a And then four is kind of what's the target axiom. And this is sort of forcing this anchor map to be kind of a morphism of involution algebraids. And that's saying that, let's see if I can draw it. So if I do L A. I do LA and then I do sigma, I get to LA, and then I pi one and I get to TA and then I ank t dot ank to get to t squared of m this is the same as too far T A Uh t a I'm just gonna pi one ank right away t dot ank and I'm going to apply the the canonical flip there so that means that this involution kind of maps down to the flip when you do these anchor mappings and five um we uh have the yang back Have the Yang Baxter. So, or like, you know, MacLean's Pentagon equation. And I'm going to write it out this way. It uses L3, though. This is kind of putting the equality of two maps from the third prolongation to each other. And how this goes is, I'm just going to do six. I'm just going to do sigma cross C one cross T sigma of sigma cross C so this would take in my L A and this takes in a T squared of A and this just takes in an A and this takes in a T of L A. So this is kind of it is a well-typed thing although Thing, although I'm not putting in the subscript to my kind of fiber product notation here. And yeah, so I can space there, so I'll just look this up. So this is the Yang-Baxter equation. So you might see. Baxter equation. So you might see this is really generalizing like the kinematic tangent bundle, like the tangent bundle axioms from tangent categories, right? So it's very much in the same spirit as the original axioms of a we algebraid, in a way. So, and so kind of proposition or I guess theorem. Proposition, or I guess, theorem. We can see some things this fixes, though. We don't need a ring, we don't need negatives. And I didn't tell you what a morphism is, but I think you can maybe guess it in the sense that it's going to just be a structure preserving morphism. It's going to be a linear map that preserves the involution, the anchor map, and the involution. Let's just, I'll draw that. Let's just, I'll draw that. So we would just do f cross t dot f to L of B. This is just the definition of a morphism. So it's kind of, it's really an essentially algebraic sort of thing in that sense. And kind of one amazing thing is that I don't think I have the time to get the proof for yet. So I will just go. So theorem. And this is really where Richard kind of stepped in. And actually, very similar to what Richard just talked about is how you would prove this. So you get an isomorphism of categories between Between Lie algebroids and smooth involution algebraids, but this isn't so this so I want to get to a tangent structure and the thing I'm going to do is I'm going to give a different Do is I'm going to give a different way of looking at information algebraids now and respectively Lie algebraids. And so recall the V algebras. So it's nice. We've seen them a couple times now. So V algebra is V algebras, V1 algebras is the free tangent category. So it's a strict, it's a symmetric, strict monoidal category. The symmetry isn't strict, but the monoidal tensor product is. So we have, you know, so observation given an anchored bundle. We can kind of make we can associate a span to each Bay algebra and this is a little This is a little. What does this mean? It means that I can take, you know, I had this anchored bundle, but I can also regard it as a span from m to t of m and because I have the uh The you know, let's do a sub n to t sub n of m pi to the n maybe. I can sort of compose these together because I have the tangent bundle, right? So, what I can do is if I have sort of the span, so So, this is just my basic span for, you know, my generator, like W sub n. If I have the spans for U and V, so I'm going to call it like the prolongation of U pi U M ank U T to the U.S. U. t to the u of m and I'm going to have to move this down a bit well what I can do then I can compose it with the span for v which is defined in the same way but the span composition doesn't quite do that so I'm going to take t to the u of pi to the v so then I have t to the u of To the u of L V A then I have T to the U dot T to the V of M okay, and then I would take this pullback, and that is my L U V A and this this new thing, this new span is my This new span is my pi uv ink uv. So you would just sort of repeat this process and you would do it for every V algebra. And so given an involution algebraid. Ah, we get spin morphisms. And I'll just do you know a couple here. Right? So for the projection, let's say. We get a span morphism like that. And similarly, let's go to the involution now. So we would have L of W W A A so m and here is t squared of m t squared of m and l w so we keep the equality on the right here. So down here, so this is just the usual prolongation. So I would put Prolongation. So I would put sigma there, and by the target axiom, because this is angh of pi one C but and you do this for the rest of them, rest of the structure maps, but kind of the takeaway We get we get this the the maps for a struct a tangent category P zero L plus and C and they're closed under tensor tensor composition Tensor composition, kind of matching kind of the right coherences for V1 and kind of transverse limits. So the involution algebra induces a functor, a tangent functor. A tangent functor. So it's an enriched functor A alpha V1 to C and furthermore furthermore 845 bins. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, sorry, I'm just finishing. Yeah, so sorry, I'm just finishing it now. That means the category of involution algebraids in C is a full subcategory of V1 into C. So that is tangent functors and tangent natural transformations such that A preserves tangent limit and L. And alpha, the tangent natural transformation part is a Cartesian natural transformation. So it's a each naturality square is a pullback. And so this implies that involution algebraids in C has a new tangent structure. Given by precomposition and this is the one that agrees with mechanics on OB algebraic. Unolly algebraid. So then I just would cut, you know, kind of a conjecture is if you're if you can axiomatize Lagrangian mechanics in a tangent as a kind of a structure in a tangent category, you should be able to recover this formalism for Lie algebraids as a special As a special case, using this tangent structure. Okay, so thank you. I went a few minutes long there. I got a question, if nobody else does. Have you sort of, I might ask you this before, have you sort of told people working in algebraids about involution algebraids, like these two people I mentioned in the beginning, Martinez and Fusca, and sort of. Tinez and Fusca, and sort of pointed out this alternative theory of the algebraids? No, this all kind of happened during the pandemic, is kind of when more progress started happening. And I guess I haven't been reaching out to people as much as I should. I guess, I mean, you and Matthew had worked out involutional, I mean, the basic sort of basics of involutional algebra is a few years ago, wasn't it? But I guess you didn't have the full equivalence between involutional. You didn't have the full equivalence between involution algebraids and the algebraids at that point? No, that came from a note Richard sent us. And then we found this work by Martinez, who kind of showed how you construct the involution from a Lie algebra. So that seems like it was in the air already in like sort of 2007. Oh, do they actually have that kind of exactly the kind of structure you described here? Exactly, the kind of structure you described here? They have the involution, and they have shown that you preserve the involution if and only if you preserve a morphism, if and only if you're a Lie algebraid morphism. I mean, does that mean that they now see that as a preferable view of Lie algebraids, these evolution things? That is not the impression I get. What is that? You know, I get the impression that. That, you know, it's really easy to write these pullbacks down as a category theorist, but maybe if you're solving a system of, you know, some modeling of system of mechanics, I don't know if they have the same experience. I think things get very complicated. But the fact that the morphisms are so much easier to work with. The fact that the morphisms are so much easier to work with, that's got to be a point in their favor, I guess. But that's again, maybe the morphisms are less important than the structures themselves sometimes for non-category theorists. Yeah, I think they do use these as like a context for mechanics. And I don't know I've only seen like morphisms of Lie algebraid come up in like some very like hard stuff like with like these Poisson sigma models. With like these Poisson sigma models, which are apparently some sort of field theory thing that I don't understand. But that's like one of the only sort of examples I've seen of people talking about these Lie algebraid morphisms. Would it be possible for me to ask a question, John? I didn't think. So just as a note on the previous question, so it should be noted that Martinez and people. And people don't have the converse implication, right? They're not aware of that having the Yang-Baxter equation implies that you actually have a Lie algebraid. So it's the equivalence that, you know, and they have this extra structure without the Yang-Baxter equation. So, right, so a question for this talk, though. Would it be possible to describe what this tendrant structure looks like on grib weights? On groupoids? Oh, um, yeah. So what groupoids kind of how it looks is that I have, if we remember this pullback, kind of that defines the Lie algebra cross g t g. Um P T S P um zero e uh so actually one one kind of intermediate step is just let's do this as an equalizer. So we'll just do tg and it's t dot e of s t g and it is zero of And it is zero of p dot g it's the same thing. Um so I would just go into sdg so a representable setting, but we get this object so we can let's go into vase spaces, I guess. So we get if we're So we get, if we're in sort of groupoids and V spaces, we get that this object. So I being the arrow groupoid, and then D being kind of the discrete groupoid, that's just D. So I is the peg groupoid, yeah? I is, yeah, it's this. Or is it just the space? It's the floating. The space, it's the floating arrow. Oh, it's just an arrow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I would do the same kind of push it. Uh, so I'm just going to call it e to the s cross d and across zero of bang i cross d and I get a push in, a co-equalizer that's partial. And you can show that, so one kind of partial represents A and two partial cross partial represents L of A and partial cross partial cross partial reps L squared of A. Squared of A. Okay, is it so partial as the sometimes the pair groupoid on D? Yeah, I have no idea what this thing looks like. If it is the pair groupoid, that would be fantastic. So this partial represents the Lie derivative functor, but it ends up being, it is itself. Is itself an infinitesimal object? So it would give the category of groupoids a second tangent structure that would sort of correspond to taking as my base space the Lie derivative, and then my total space would be the Lie derivative of the arrow groupoid. Groupoid. So that would send.
