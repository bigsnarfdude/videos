This is basically the first time I go out of my house in the last three months, so it was like a a big it's a big adventure. Very happy to be here. I'm going to talk about the theory of motion groups, which is also the title of one of the seminal papers introducing motion groups in the 70s. We are going to be a bit of an overview of A bit of an overview of how they were born. Basically, we can divide the literature of motion groups in two big chunks: one happening in the sixties and seventies, and another one rebooting it after 2010, but mostly in more recent years. We are going to see two incarnations of motion groups that you probably are familiar with, rate groups, semi-break groups, and then we are going to see. And then we are going to see what's been done recently, so more recent development, and where are we going with the theory of motion processing. As I was saying, we start with some history and so I'm going to do a recap of what happened in the 60s and 70s. Everything started from this observation by Fox. Art in Britfield. Art and braid theory can be considered as the motions of points in a plane. I'm sorry, it's written very small. I was thinking of a bigger screen. If you can't read, I'll protest. I'm going to read it back to you. Of course, Fox was not the first to think such a thing. It's something that's I suppose everyone has always thought about great groups. About grade groups. But he was the one that thought that it was interesting enough, as a sentence, to give it to a PhD student and tell him, well, generalize this. Or at least, I don't know the people. Maybe North American people here know the humanistic side of this story better than me, but this is how I imagine it happened. So David Dahm, a student of Ralph Fox, wrote a thesis entitled A Generalization of Break Theory. On the generalization of break theory. In here, he develops a first general framework, a theory of motions with compact support of one space in another space, meaning for this to be as general as possible. Dam never published papers out of this thesis, and as far as I know, he went on to have a successful career in computer science. However, the implant in his thesis was And in his thesis was set once his thesis was out. And another student of Fox, Deborah Gosmy, in 1972, brought his work further on. First, she published a paper where she revisited Dam's results and also constructed some more proofs where she gave the presentation. She gave the presentation for the motion groups of N and linked and knotted circles Cn in R3. So, a group whose elements encode the ways we can move a bunch of circles in a three-dimensional space. And then, in a second paper, she gave more results on motions of Taurus Ninx in S3. So, already from the fact that one of her papers was in R3 and the other one is S3. Papers was in R3 and the other one is in S3, we can gather a sense of what is one of the main things that we encounter working with motion groups. They are such an intuitive object. Everyone can think of how something inside something else. And as it often happens with this kind of intuitive things, the derivative is in the details. And there are a lot of And there are a lot of details. About Gosmith's work, Hilden, a couple of years later, wrote: this group, meaning the group of circles in R3, is quite close to the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of R3 with respect to Cn at place output to the identity. And in modern terms, this is what we call the mapping classroom. And Hilden is the next person that got interested in motion groups in this line of research, just three years later than the first of Gaussnit's paper. He gave generators of two subgroups of the group of original preserving homeomorphisms. He was working with like a curse groups actually, of the sphere with two encounters. And the homeomorphisms that he was considering were those that admit He was considering were those that admit an extension to a three-ball with a number of arcs embedded in the three volve, in the three-volve, with endpoints that are bounded by the punctures on the sphere. So you can imagine that having these arcs embedded constraints somehow the motions that the endpoints can do on the sphere, the armatures can do on the sphere. While he works in terms, While he works in terms that we would say maping class groups terms, he also gives ways to associate motions of certain means to the elements of the groups he was studying. All these works were in the topological setting, so everyone is considering homomorphisms up to here. However, parallel to the first paper of Golzmit, Battenberg published another paper. Published another paper that was heading again implanting on Dante's work where he was reformulating everything in terms of diffeomorphisms. So he reconceives the motion group in the differential category, proving that for some specific case, and in particular for R3 and Cn, the two motion groups are isomorphic. We will see that this makes our life easier when considering. Easier when considering look-break groups, but it's not something that we can hope to have in general. Okay, so now that we have some background on how this thing came to exist, let's see some more precise definitions. A motion of a compact sub-manifold N in a manifold N, M, is a path Ft in the group of homeomorphisms with compact support of M, such Support of M such that F0 is the identity on M and F1 preserves globally the position of N, meaning that every connected component, like N will go back to itself, but connected components might be, for example, permutant. A stationary motion is a special motion that is such that That is such that f of n is equal to n for all t. So here have an example. The picture is maybe not super clear. We have n to be the trephoid knot. We take it to be in R3 and we take the motion that slides the trephoid knot on itself. And of course we have to imagine that R3 all around is moving together with that. Then we can define the motion group finally as the group M of M and N. Okay, now I realize that M and M for two different things is not a great choice of letters. It's the group of equivalence classes of motions of N in M, where two motions are considered to be equivalent if the composition of one and the impact of the other are homotopic relative to L points to a state. 12 points to a stationary motion. So, what we have just said with words is that the motion group of M and N is the pi 1 derivative first homomorphism of the homomorphisms with compact support of M with respect to the homomorphisms of the pair. Um we recall that in general the homomorphisms of the pair preserve orientations on the ambient uh manifold, so on M. Manifold, so on M, but not necessarily on M, and we take the identity of M to be the base point. So one tool that we are going to use very often when we talk about motion groups is that we can, like, having it defined like that allows us to consider the norm-exact sequence in of Motopy groups. And this is the chunk that we generally look at of that sequence, because it includes both the Includes both the motion group and the mapping class group. And we will see that for specific cases, when we can describe some groups in there, we can actually manage to get shorter sequences that in convenient places, for instance, to allow us to use Johnson's method to write group presentations. This is one of the, like I just put it here as one of the powerful tools that we use. The powerful tools that we can use when looking to describe motions. Another important property proved both in Dam's thesis and by Gonsmi is that if we have two sub-manifolds that are ambitious topic in M, then we get isomorphic motion groups. This is another important tool because it allows us to take somewhat messy space and, for instance, put it And for instance, put it in general position when it's possible, or like set it up in a way that we can handle it. And a specific part of what I was saying earlier of that long exact sequence that we will use in two settings later, so I will just say it now, is that when we take the big manifold to be m, then this sequence that you see here is exact. Okay, so. Okay, so another very powerful tool that we have speaking with motion groups, every time that you see a word involved in motion groups, people will be looking at this is Damsmo Morton. So let's assume now that M is non-compact, although even when M is compact, we can have an equivalent construction. But just for the moment, just to have a picture in mind, let's take it like this. Then we can see that every motion. We can see that every motion is equivalent to the motion that fixes a point outside of this manifold that is being moved. And the Dance homomorphism is the map going from the motion group to the automorphisms of the pi-1 of the complement of N in M with base point that fixed point that we just saw. This is very Is very fascinating. It's very powerful, it allows us to do lots of computations in practice, and on a conceptual level, it's just induced by the natural action of homeomorphisms on the pi 1, of a stase. So very interesting that it turns out in several cases to have interesting properties, and we will see that it can be easy to describe that space of protomarks. So, okay, the first Okay, the first example of motion groups that we will see, just for a sanity check, we started from bread groups as inspiration for motion groups. Let's see that general machinery descends back to break groups. I assume here everyone is super familiar with bread groups, but I don't really know lots of people here, so I just wait for a small recap. I would just give all the definitions of the braid groups. Definitions of the brain groups, just what ones that are somehow involved in this talk, plus the one as an abstract represented group because it's the faster most recognizable one. So the brain group BNSTRN can be defined as an abstract representative group where we have artists' presentations, for instance, with a family of n n minus one generators, sigma n, uh, sigma one, sigma n minus one. sigma 1, sigma n minus 1, and the final relations where two generators commute if their indices are far enough and have the brain or master relation when they are next to the other. And this presentation can be represented diagrammatically with this kind of elementary diagram. Now, as Edio Verdell there taught to me many years ago in a master's course, Many years ago, in a master's course, working with group presentations is often very tricky. So, we often consider the breakgroup in another way, as, for instance, the pi 1 of the configuration space of endpoints in a disk. Moreover, we can also consider them as the mapping class group of a disk dn with n marked points in its interior. And we can define it both. Both we can define it with homeomorphisms. So we take a homeo plus here to say the homeomorphisms that preserve orientation on D and that preserve globally the marked points N and preserve pointwise the boundary of the disk D. Portion this by the connected component of the identity in T. And this is the definition of the phi zero of the group of orientation preserving cell phomomorphisms. Preserving cell phromomorphisms of D of preserve normally points in the interior of the disk. So for this specific case we are very lucky because on surfaces taking homeomorphisms or lithiumorphisms in this uh setting gives us the same uh group, the same mapping class group. So this is something that is used when proving things about, for instance, when proving Things about, for instance, when proving the equivalence of the definition of the break group as mapping class group or as part in the contribution space, this is something that is used. Not all settings are this lack. However, what can we see is that the mapping class group of the brain group on here we take and to be more general, not necessarily the discussed we did before, generally generate. Coincides with the motion group. And this is kind of expected, having seen how we constructed both things and having seen that long exact sequence of omotic groups, it still requires, we can prove it like cheating, going into injecting our elements into group node automorphisms and saying seeing that they go to the same things and so on. But if you want to prove it like really with the two definitions, like really with the two definitions and not using anything else around, then it needs some checks on using embedding spaces. However, we see that motion groups and mapping class groups are so related. In the context of rate groups, we have already before formulated motion groups an incarnation of Down's homomorphism. And this is And this is Arten's representation. So, this is also something that you probably are familiar with. It describes the natural adaption of isotopic classes of homomorphisms of the disk with n marked points on the fundamental group of the disk with those points removed, which is the free group on n generators. And the action is, in this case, is very easy to visualize and to describe. Visualize and to describe. We can expect this to be true also in the case of loop rates. Who knows how far this extends though? Let's see the second incarnation of motion groups that we are going to talk about, which are loop drake groups. So the looper group at the end can be defined again. I'm going to give just now some more definitions here because maybe the looper group is a little bit less known. I'm going to make a big list of informal definitions and later I'm going to see in details the definitions that we are actually wanting to work with. So we can describe it as the mapping class group of the three ball B3 with respect to With respect to an n-trivial link Cn, where again we are taking homeomorphisms that preserve orientation on the body 3. This is a notion introduced by Bitzweiss and Kranz. We can also define the loop-break group as a fundamental group of a configuration space, and in this case, it will be the configuration space of M circles in R3. And this is something that has been introduced by Brandon and Hatcher in 2015. By Brandon and Hatcher in 2013, we can define them as a certain group of automorphisms of the free group on n generators that are such that they send one generator of the free group into the conjugate of another generator or its inverse. And this is a group that has been considered in the literature by Meck Cool, Sabushkina, Fenner, Maniur, who just Fener Maniro, just to say a few loops that appeared a lot in the literature, even before anyone spoke about motions of loops or like saw it in some sort of topological geometrical way. Another definition that we can give for the loop-break group is again an abstract presented group where we have a family of generators that by use of notation we call exactly as the brain. We call exactly as the braid generators because they play the role that braid generators play. A family of generators that are called one row at n minus one, and again here the name is to suggest that they behave like the symmetric group generators. And then a third family, tau one, tau n minus one of um involved generators. Involutive generators. And also, here, if you're familiar with virtual welded diagrams, you would know that we can describe this presentation in terms of basic diagrams and great randomized moves. One observation, what I'm calling here loop break group in the literature is often called the extended loop break group. Here it's more like this. Here it's more like this is like the bigger version. We are allowing more motions Namely, we allow our circles moving around to flip by 180 degrees in the space just to have an idea of what happens here that does not happen in the restricted loop rate group. But this is the natural group that comes when we consider our motion group. Are Bosch cost? A very brief question. By symmetric relations, you mean involved in this plus break. Plus great. Yeah, exactly. And then the last way that we can define the break groups, and I will not go into that at all because it involves a lot of fixing details, is as grade diagonally S1 pen psi in a four-dimensional space. And the reason I'm saying it without giving more information to Without giving more information, just because you know, classical grade groups, it's easy to see them as curves, monotone curves in a cylinder, and it was to say we can imagine something like that, of course, in have something that is really a generalization on all levels. So, just to be a little bit more precise, when we say that we can define the Lubrane group as a mapping task group, what we mean is that we take the group of homomorphisms. We take the group of homeomorphisms of P3 with respect to the surface Cn that fix the boundary of B3 pointwise, fix the Cn, the surface setwise, meaning that we allow them to change position by the end of the homomorphism, and receive orientation will be free. We also introduce P-homels, the group of pure homeomorphisms. The group of pure homeomorphisms because this is something that is often used when doing technical proofs. We are not going to embark on some large technical proof here, but it's good to know that one of the tools that one needs to have in their pocket is that, in case of emergency, use pure groups. That does not apply when there's a plane crash or something like that thing, but you can try. So the group of So, the group of pure homomorphisms are exactly as the group of first homomorphisms that we just saw, but in this case, we preserve connected components of Cn. So each component goes back to its original position. And from there, when we take the pi zero of these two groups, we get the precise definition of Looper groups in terms of marking class groups. Okay. Okay, so also here, as for the break groups, it's not hard to prove that this is isomorphic to the motion group as we define it in the first part in general terms. Again, if we don't want to inject these groups into automorphisms groups and go around the problem somehow, if we want to prove it directly, there are some results about embedding onto spaces that need to be checked. That needs to be checked. But I think it's fairly convincing just by the language that we are using and the way that we are defining these groups that these two are the same. Then the other definition of loop-break groups that I'm going to look at in detail is the one as configuration spaces. And here we are changing a little bit our formalism. So in this case, we take Cn on We take Cn, well, the C I change the indices of the circles, sorry, a bunch of Euclidean, meaning round, unordered, disjoint, and in circles in the interior of the three-volted three. And we define the configuration space Rn, R like rings, uh to be the configuration space of n circles in V three that are Euclidean and make joint as the to them. Ask the two of them. This ring group is being introduced by Brendan and Apscher in 2015. And also here we can take the pure version of configuration of spaces where we ask for the circles to be ordered so we know which one is the first one and we can distinguish two different configurations. Different configurations when the circles are not in the same order. And taking the pi one of these two configuration spaces, we have the ring group and the pure ring group. So next we are going to see how, just to give an idea of how these two definitions of Loop Ray groups are equivalent, and we will start to have an idea why working with motion groups in particular case. Working with motion groups in particular cases, so fixing a specific submanifold in another manifold becomes more and more difficult when we go further from gray groups. So, oh, well, one important thing, for the ring groups we just took Euclidean round circles, while for the Macquielda group we took topological circles. So, we could have the impression that we were working with very different beasts. In fact, there is this result very Result very heavy involved result by Vernon and Hacher that says that the inclusion of the configuration space Rn into the configuration of all smooth trivial links of n components R3 is a homotopy equivalence. So when we take the pi 1, we have isomortic spaces. And this allows us to work with brown circles that we can control better rather than working with action. Working with actual trivial links. And the tool that they use, a key to prove this result, is defining separating systems. So ways to enclose, to take a link, a smooth link, however complicated you want it, and enclose its components into separate balls. And then they find a way to simultaneously shrink these balls. Shrink these balls as to separate our components in what is called the separating system. And that way you can decompose your learning in simpler parts where you can compute each one of them and then find a way to put them together. And this is interesting because it's a configuration space idea of projecting and extending groups and which corresponds to an idea. Which corresponds to an idea we find also in Gosmik thesis where, to prove results about the loops, she was doing extensions and projections of motion loops. So we kind of have tools with a similar flavor in two different languages. And we can prove that the pi one of the configuration spaces and the mapping class groups are isomorphic. Isomorphic. And to do this, key, what I was saying, that we see how working with specific motion groups can be quickly more involved than when we are in the brake setting, is a result of Battenberg that proves that we can take the topological and the smooth mapping class groups, and in this specific setting of the three or B3 or R3 and the collection of circles, then they are isomorphic. And without this, it would be much more complicated because on the side of the configuration that we have circles, on the side of the mapping class groups, we have topological circles, and sending one into the other just using homomorphism is not enough. And once we have that, you mentioned. Quick questions. You mentioned before the space of smooth engine so that the general copies of the S1 topology of diffeomorphism of diff of P1 CN which contribute? Is it weak topology compatible with topology? Usually use compatible topology. So essentially subversive So that's diff B3 includes as a subspec of omelet? Maybe discuss that. Sorry. Yeah, well, with the omorphisms, I know how to handle things. With the zippomorphisms I'm a bit more unsure of what to say. Because none of these references actually says this explicitly. That is true. Yeah, that's one of the tricky points. However, um For this point specifically, I mean Wattenberger paper is quite involved too, so we rely on it. This allows us to then go on in the same way that we prove the equivalence in the setting of grade groups. So we define an evaluation map, and if you're not familiar with the proof of Berman of configuration mapping class groups, Mapping class groups doesn't matter. If you're familiar with it, you see that you find local interior fibrillation, you can write the same kind of exact sequence of homotopy groups, and then conclude with a commutative diagram exactly as in the case of breakgroups. However, if you didn't have that point proof by Wackenberg, you would not be able to do that and think. You would not be able to do that and things would be more complicated. So, then a word about dumb homomorphism in this setting. Again, we can define that homomorphism and we can describe the image in a very easy way. So, for instance, if C is just one unknotted circle in R3, then sending the movement. The motion group in the group of the pi1, the R3 minus the circle, get to just the three group on one generator, which is taking the automorphisms of that, it's just a Z2. And Gosnitz proves that this is an isomorphism. So this allows you to give a very, very simple presentation of the motions with just one circle. You can visualize it, like if you have just one circle, the only thing that you can If you have just one circle, the only thing that you can do is to flip it and flip it over, and you're back to where you started. Just to give an idea again, these things are all very intuitive, and it can be very dangerous to have these kind of thoughts. And then, for when we take Cn to be a collection of circles, she proves that Lam homomorphism, at this time we go to the automorphisms of the free group n elements, is injective. Is injective. So we can go and look at the image, and this working with the automorphisms will give us a way to describe the motion group of the circles. In fact, that's her main result in the first paper, the theory of motion groups, that she says that there is an injective map from the Lupre group, as we call it the Loopre group. We call it the Dubre group into the group of automorphisms of Sn, and its image is the subgroup of permutation conjugacy automorphisms, which are the automorphisms of the form that send one generator to the conjugate of another conjugator or its inverse. Remember, what are the conditions for RAID automorphisms? Here we are asking something. In something less somehow. And moreover, she gives a presentation, she gives just generators, not a presentation, in terms of these automorphisms that I will call here with the same letters of the generators I gave in the presented group, because, as you can imagine, one can prove that things go exactly where we expect them to go. To go. Then, to have an actual presentation also with the finding relations for this group, this is a result of Sabushkina in 1996, and Fenner, Rimani, and Roork found the same result going through a more diagrammatical way. Okay, so up to now, just to make a roundup of the techniques that come into play when we That comes into play when we work with motion groups. The first thing that we notice is that we use a lot that long exact sequence in homotopy groups. And for each case where we are, we use ad hoc techniques to simplify that sequence and get the exact short sequence that we want to have. Uh then uh dumps homomorphism has anticipated as very powerful tool that helps to give generators an eventual representation. Separating systems in another setting is another important technique that has appeared and that allows to simplify the configurations that we are working with. And up to now, all the examples that we have seen. All the examples that we have seen happen to have doable computations in the group of automorphisms where the homomorphisms go. If we are unlucky enough to take a sub-manifold and a manifold whose group of automorphisms is not that easily describable, then we are in a pickle. So, we can say in some sense that these techniques do not scale well. We don't have Well, we don't have much hope to take a more general pair of spaces and just hope for everything to go as in the very group. So here we are going to see what happens actually when people try to take more general objects. And this is what happened in the reboot of motion groups. So after So after 2015 mostly, even if there is also a paper from 20 to 2009, people have tried to take other kind of submanifolds, not just spikes or loops, and describe their motion groups. Or use motion groups as a tool to describe some other things around. And we can try also to see if the techniques that we've just If the techniques that we've just listed are used again, if something new appears, and what might be needed if we want to have that general theory of motion groups that Fox initially anticipated. This is going to be very lucky for all of you because many of the authors of the papers that I'm going to cite are in the public. This is also quite unnerving for me because I'm talking about people's work in people's space. But hopefully But hopefully, feel free to correct me if I'm saying something extremely stupid. Or even my stupid. Be kind though. So the first paper that is a bit like comes a bit earlier than the rest of the reboots, motion group paper, is a paper from Paolo Beningelli and Alice Catabriga from 2009 on the hidden ray group. So we said earlier. So we said earlier that Hilden introduced some kind of groups related to motion groups, the Hilden groups. In particular, what we did, we said a ball with a trivia system of arcs here in the pictures A1, AN embedded in the ball with endpoints on the boundary. And then considered the map that goes from the Py04. Goes from the Pi zero of the home of the mapping cross group of P3 and the system of R, to the sphere with the endpoints. And the image of this map is the hidden group. So in his paper, besides going presentations for this group, he also associates motions of certain beings to the elements of his group. What Beninger and Tabriga did was to add genus so they were not living anymore on the sphere, they were working on. Anymore on the sphere, they were working on a handle body and did the same kind of construction on a handle body and described again associated motions to the elements of their groups. In this paper, we have like I think the first modern explanation of how to connect mapping class groups and motion groups. So there's a really neat paragraph about this. And yeah, Robert was saying, Yeah, Robinson was saying, oh, Lucia, it's very lucky that you have the outdoors around, so if some of these results get you interested, just talk with people. Then, in Anosu, they were still working, like following from Hilden, so in a topological setting with homeomorphisms. On the other hand, in 2012, Jennifer Wilson wrote a paper where she made chromological computations. Comological computations on the pure blue-break group or the pure string motion group. And in her case, what she did was to use diffomorphism. So she descends from Wattenberg's line of research. However, she could prove that in some settings things still were able to go from the topological and the lithomorphic set. She did a big, big She did a big, big work of the homological computation in this case, and together with Alex Sucher work and people around there, is still like one of the main bricks in that sense. And of course, she uses terms of momorphism. Then, in 2016, again, Paulo Benin, Jerry and Nabuna considered the brain group of a necklace. So here they were moving. Here they were moving Euclidean circles that were linked to a core, trivially not. So, necklaces kind of gives you the idea, you can see the picture. What they do is they go over an exploration of the relationship between configuration spaces of points over an anodus and configuration spaces of Euclidean circles in this kind of position. And they prove that. And they prove that the pi 1 of these two configuration spaces are related. The pi1 of the configuration space of the n components necklace is isomorphic to the pi1 of the configuration space of n points over anonymous quotient by the square of itself there. So here we can notice another new tool that is coming into play working with the motion groups, which is mixing different motion groups. Mixing different motion groups of different objects, leveraging one motion group to have information for another. And also, they use dumps homomorphism again. So, this is really maybe we can vote on the side that it's the most powerful tool when working with motion groups. And moreover, in this work, we study representations of this kind of motion group. Then, in 2019, with Felicikamada, In 2019, with the Felici Commander, we decided to do again the trick of mixing different objects, but in this case, not using one group to leverage information on the other, but actually having two different kind of sub-manifolds interplay one with another. And we know the presentation for the Loopery groups, where we have a trivial link in a three-dimensional space. We set out to compute a group presentation for the motions of. Presentation for the motions of a Nage-trivial link, which is a link where we have n components that are trivial and another n components that are hot links. So the strategy that we found was first to work with Euclidean circles, and this comes from the ideas of Prentil and Acture, and also to do ring motions first. Ring motions first, so simplify the kind of motions that we are looking at. Ring motions means that we were allowed to shrink circles, dilate, rotate them, but they have to remain Euclidean throughout the motion. The idea we had was that to use the tool of Gold Smith of doing extensions and projections of mapping groups. Of many map interest groups, because we know what are the motions of different parts of such a kind of link, and then we have to understand how to put them together. So, our first step was just to consider the ring hot fling. And you remember maybe that we said that the COSMIT proves results about Taurus links in S3 and hot fling such a link. However, we wanted to remain in R3. We wanted to remain in R3, and Gaussmit results do not pass from S3 to R3. For a question of a certain kind of rotation that one can simplify in S3 and we cannot do the same thing in R3. So we had to come up with another strategy to understand how to treat the hop link and we went with very, very With very, very ad hoc techniques, and that cannot be generalized to all Taurus links. Just as the first step. And then, once we studied that, we added one ring to the configuration. And one ring, we know how it works. You can just flip. It's a zip true. So our first result was to describe the ring motion group of the hop fling, saying that it admits a presentation with a generic. Presentation with the generators that you can see here in the picture. So, when you can exchange the components of the hoplink and you flip the whole hoplink by 180 degrees. And we didn't use nothing new, we use projections and include extensions of the mapping groups, considering first one ring in an ambient space where the other ring is removed, and then Ring is removed, and then understanding how to put them together. And with Damps homomorphism, again, we found a shorted sequence that is in a convenient place, and with that and Johnson's method to write a group presentation, we managed to write the presentation. Since we were looking at very specific objects and in a three-dimensional space, it also got convenient to understand and simplify relations in the presentation to transform. In the presentation, to translate them in terms of rotations, matrices of rotations in R3. And then, once we had that, we added back in the picture one circle and looked at how these two can interplay with another. And again, this gives us a short-exact sequence where we can apply Chancellor's method and remanufacture. Chancellor's method, and we managed to write a good presentation. That we already see that it's not as nice as the loop rate group. We start to have like a few generators and 15 relations, and it's just one component circle with one hop link. So we can imagine that we are if you are going to use more complicated, more general links than this kind of small techniques that are some on San on the specific link might not generalize. So we stayed there. We just stayed with one loop and one half. The problem remained and they were all round. The problem got closed a few years later by Rachel Boyd and Craig Bregman that took a different approach. They went more of the Brendan and Hatcher approach of configuration spaces and trying Of configuration spaces and trying to define a separating system. They actually speak in terms of unparameterized embedding spaces of split links and they carry out the study of homotopy types exactly in the same way that Brendan and Hatcher do for rings. And the key is that they generalize the separating system to a split link. To a split link, which was not trivial to do at all. I mean, there's been discussion among people that work with these kind of objects before 2022. People did say it's not possible to generalize separated systems. There are so many things that don't pass through when you have things that are linked one with the other. But they managed to do it in a very, very elegant way of increasing things into both. Way of introducing things into balls, and with that, they describe a semi-direct product structure on the motion group of the split link. So, it is not the big part of their paper, but as a corollary, they actually also close the problem of the HTML link, because this semi-direct product structure is not like it's not immediate to go from there. It's not immediate to go from there to a group presentation. Take any link, oh, well, then with some work, I write the semidarity product structure, and then easy, I write a presentation. But for specific cases, such as for HTTP Linux, that is possible, and they did that. So we are almost to our day, and we can start wondering where we are, what we want about function groups. Since we've seen that more general objects we take and still. We take are still general objects. We've gone through split links. It's not nothing too crazy and too complicated. But we would like to find a set of techniques that do not heavily depend on the characteristic of the pair sub-manifold manifold that we are considering. And all these new works on motion groups that have come out have all been very, very specific to the cases, except the one on embedding, so it went a little bit further. Went a little bit further. And the very last work that came out in these motion groups reboots is the one by Fiona Kiteska, John Fran Martins, and Mon Martin, where they make a complete change of language of how we talk about motion groups. So from motion groups and mapping class groups, they move to motion group points and mapping class group points. Since it's Since it's an entirely different formalism, I will not go into the details what they do, but you have at least two of the authors in here and a third one probably connected virtually during some of these workshops. So plenty of occasions to ask for questions. The heavy work they do is to build the machinery, what is a motion groupoid, a mapping groupoid, and to study their applications, to go back to see. Applications to go back to see if, in specific cases, we find the loop break group or other motion groups and mapping class groups that we know. And then we describe the relationship between motion group coids and mapping class group voids, giving conditions for when this can be isomorphic. So, there's a number of advantages of this kind of approach. Namely, it opens the way for a study of a unified wave. For a study of a unified way for motion for studying motions, we can avoid having super adoptive techniques. Their relation between the two objects allows to transport results, questions, and leverage, like if we know something about the mapping has group, to the motion group, for example, as well. Moreover, you can apply these structures to structures that have partial compositions, but where we cannot have all the group theoretic conditions. And this also allows us to have natural techniques to factor motions into compositions of simpler motions, and this would bypass. And this would bypass the issues having more and more complicated separated systems to, or to have more and more complicated ways to do projection and extensions of motions and to tackle more complicated settings. So this was 2023, so basically yesterday, and this is where we are. So this kind of sets the way of where we are. So, this kind of sets the way of where we should look at. But in any case, we see there's so much more that can be done. We see that the theory is quite ramified. So, people went in different directions using different formalisms. And every time you find some new result, you can look at it from different points of view. You can look if it makes sense in terms of automorphisms. You can look if it makes sense in geometrical terms. For some results, you can look. For some results, you can look if it makes sense in a physical setting. So, you are at the same time in a context that is growing, but it's not purely a tree. There are cycles in this kind of bigger picture of what we are doing with motion groups. So, you can always know if things make sense or not. So, I think I will leave you with this, with knowing that we are going towards more general ways going towards more general ways of thinking of motion groups and but there are a lot of questions that are still uh to be tackled with this. I just make a very quick comment. In the original paper of Art on Great Groups, he did not define a breakgroup, he actually defined a great group point. The mapping class proof is actually a return to the origins. That's interesting. We got it wrong for 100 years, but eventually we are coming to our sense. Yes, emotion is certain annotation. So to occasion, you speak about the study of representation theory. So in what perspective would all like these homological representations that are not These homologic representations of the multi-class groups are more like the related setting? It's more in the like physical inspired representations. I think you can ask directly Fiona. Maybe talk about it quite a bit. So you want to look for a presenta representation of such includes, you need to know about. I know about something about the structure of this and you are always talking about our presentation. Well, because that was what we were going with this talk, how to give some presentation to motion groups. Of course, on all the objects that we introduced, there are more results describing case by case different kind of. My question is now from the presentation. Are you favoured to review based products? In some cases, to two groups with a different presentation candidate uses morphic or not. Two groups of this, the same class. You mentioned many groups. And so you have two groups of the same class with a given percentage. with a given presentation. Are you able easily to tell you that there are issues? In some cases, yes, but you generally don't use presentations to do this kind of things. So generally, well, dump homomorphism sends you to groups of automorphisms where it's easier to check if the groups are isomorphic or not. So for all of the groups that we've seen, there's not just like we're giving a group presentation. Like we're giving a group presentation. We know that it's hard to work with group presentations. We also give a wealth of other information about it, how to send it to automorphisms when the ampsomorphism is injective, so what kind of automorphism we are looking at. For instance, well are you able to detect some interesting family or normal subgroups or if they are synthetic products or Direct product or? Well, I think the the the group where more is known, but you probably know all about this, is break groups. But in that case, we are not really passing through properties of motions. The hope is that for other motions, we might be able to have that kind of theory that we now have for brain books. Questions? I had just a curiosity question from the commentaries here. So you mentioned the work of Boyd and Batman who managed to give it it. It takes time to write. Time to write down in terms that, as we've already seen, like with fewer components, you immediately have lots of relations. But it's also fairly straightforward. From their corollary, you just start writing any kind of presentation. It's not badly behaved, nasty presentation. It's not something that It's not something that, as far as I understood their paper, is not something that we can hope for every split link to have such a presentation coming from that structure. And is the presentation again for the HCP is very different from yours? No, no, it's not. We actually can pass from once. Yeah. Other questions? Other questions? Let's echo again.
