Okay, so right, so first I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this conference, actually already two years ago. I'm very sorry I can't be there in person. Well, but I can still. I can still, that's great. And hopefully, in the future, I can come visit in person sometime. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. I want to tell you today about some lessons I've learned from trying to teach an honest quantum mechanics course. Um the standard textbook postulates for quantum mechanics are actually quite baffling and ambiguous and in some ways play wrong. But solutions, these problems are well known and for the most part are incorporated in the standard quantum mechanics as it is actually practiced by people in the field. So the postulate People in the field. So the postulates are treated a little bit in quotation marks, but this hasn't actually been translated into the textbooks. So here I will review the most glaring defects of the textbook postulates and the solutions to almost all of them, leaving open only a small number of genuinely unresolved and or contradictory. And or controversial issues. Now, to be honest, I have to say I'm a bit shy about presenting this for an audience that includes experts in quantum foundations, just precisely because most of these things are well known. So I'm telling you what you already know. The talk will progress from the more uncontroversial. More uncontroversial to the more controversial. So, so in the later part of the talk, I hope you can find something that's interesting or at least you can disagree vehemently with. So, let's first quickly review the textbook postulates of quantum mechanics. So, the first postulate is that Is that the Hilbert space postulate that says that the states of a physical system are represented by normalized vectors in a Hilbert space? In fact, that all of the normalized vectors in a Hilbert space are states of the system. Here I will ignore super selection rules. And it has a second part as possible that says that the state space, the union of two systems, Space, the union of two systems is the tensor product or the state space of the individual systems. Okay. A second postulate says that an isolated system evolves unitarily and differentiably. So the state evolves by unitary differentiable transformation. And therefore, according to the Schrodinger equation, Or according to the Schrodinger equation with some self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator. Okay, so these actually we will say very little about, but the remaining postulates deal with measurements and we'll say something about those, less satisfactory. They say to each measurement on a system is associated a self-adjoint operator on its state space. State space. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the corresponding observable. If the system is prepared in an initial state psi, then the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue lambda is the norm squared of the projection of psi on the eigen subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue. And finally, there's the projection postulate, which says that immediately after measurement, the state. After measurement, the state of the system is the normalized projection of the initial state on the eigensubspace corresponding to the measured value. Well, so what are the problems with these postulates? Well, one problem which you can call who is an observer is the following: there are two types of time evolution defined. Defined in these postulates. There's the time evolution, the continuous, linear, and deterministic time evolution defined by the Schrodinger equation. And there's the discontinuous, non-linear, and stochastic evolution associated with measurements that corresponds to a measurement. Okay, so. Limit. Okay, so the postulates do not indicate when each type of time evolution is applicable because it doesn't indicate when something is a measurement. It's true that when a system is being measured, it's not isolated. So you could say, well, the unitary one applies to isolated systems, but then you can make an isolated system out of the measuring of the system. Of the measuring of the system object system and the measuring apparatus, and the measurement evolution is still not unitary in that case. So there is, in fact, an ambiguity. Now, it's reasonable to suppose that an interaction is a measurement when one of the interacting parts is an observer. But then the question is: who qualifies as an observer? Only you. Only you, the listener or the user of quantum mechanics, all people, all animals, perhaps also computers are observers, or perhaps any physical system at all is an observer. The postulates don't say, so there's an ambiguity in the evolution. The postulates provide no indication. So, the second problem is that the postulates provide no indication as to how the observable operator corresponding to a given measuring apparatus is to be found. Okay. The measurement process, according to these postulates, is not governed by the Schrodinger equation. So, knowing the Hamiltonian. So, knowing the Hamiltonian of the joint object plus apparatus system seems to not be relevant, doesn't seem to help in understanding how the apparatus and the measured system, the object system, will interact. But on the other hand, when you actually design an apparatus, well, there's a certain element of Well, there's a certain element of pure trial and error, but there's also an element of modeling, planning, where you make a model of how the apparatus interacts with the measured system so that it measures what you're interested in. So, in fact, the postulate completely ignores a very Ignores a very important aspect, or it doesn't seem that according to Postlitz, quantum mechanics doesn't allow a very important aspect of actual scientific practice. Okay, a third problem is that the probability postulate and the fifth one and the projection postulate do not hold for real measurement. Do not hold for real measurements. Okay, so you made some postulates, which are supposedly fundamental laws of nature, but in fact, you can very easily find examples where they don't hold. The first example of where the projection postulate doesn't hold is a photon that is recorded by photographic plate. In the process, it is consumed. So at the end of the measurement. So at the end of the measurement process, it's not true that you have the original, have a photon in the measured state at the photographic plate. The photon is gone. Okay, so the projection postulate does not hold in this very common case. The probability postulate can't hold either. The probability postulate claims that if the system is The system is prepared in an eigenstate of the observable, then with probability one, with absolute certainty, the measurement should give the corresponding eigenvalue. But no real apparatus will give any particular result without probability one, no matter what the state of the system being measured. Being measured. There will always be some probability that the measuring apparatus, you could say, doesn't work properly and gives something else like dark counts and all these things that are always present in real experiments. So, postulates five and six could apply to a class of ideal measurements. In fact, Measurements, in fact, would define a class of ideal measurements that can be realized only imperfectly. But then the second problem that we don't know how to model measurement processes means that we can't even know whether our measurement apparatus is close to being ideal. Close to being ideal, except by pure trial and error. Okay, so finally, there is a less obvious but important issue. I think the first three issues, I think as issues in the didactic presentation of quantum mechanics, are important issues, but probably you're getting a bit antsy because you know perfectly well how these things are resolved. The fourth issue is an issue that. The fourth issue is an issue that actually doesn't bother. I've never seen a student bothered by it, but it is a very serious issue. And that is what does probability of obtaining, what does the probability of obtaining a certain measurement result actually mean? Okay, so quite a bit can be said to clear up these issues, and here we will begin to say it. If you have questions, stop me. Okay, so solutions. Let's start with problem one. Who is an observer? Well, a reasonable answer is you, the user of quantum mechanics, and whoever or whatever you can deputize to be an observer. So let me explain this. First of all, First of all, what I just said already that we're going to be able to do is to make sure that we're going to be able to do that. The system composed of the composite system made of the object and the Made of the object and the apparatus in a measurement is an isolated system. That's essentially by definition. I simply throw everything that the object interacts with, the object system interacts with during the measurement into the apparatus. I consider it all part of the apparatus. Okay, so being an isolated system, it ought to evolve unitarily. If we didn't know this was a measurement, but let's suppose it is a measurement, then in fact, we can still model this or reproduce the evolution that the measurement postulates say that it should have by a unitary evolution followed by wave function collapse. Okay, so the um So let's study first this or look at this unitary evolution. The initial state of the object system, I'll call psi, and it can be expanded as a sum of its projections on the eigen subspaces. Eigensubspaces corresponding to the measurement results. So it can be written as a sum of theta n, where theta n is the projection of psi on the eigens subspace corresponding to the measurement result n. So that's the initial state of the object system. The initial state of the apparatus, we will suppose, is what we'll call zero, and it is a state in which the memory is blank, ready to be written on. Ready to be written on. Okay, so what's the evolution, this unitary evolution that models the evolution of part of the measurement evolution? Well, we can specify it since it's a linear evolution, we can specify it by saying how it acts on the It acts on the components theta n of the initial state, on the eigen components along the eigen subspaces of the observable. So theta n times zero is mapped to u times theta n times zero. And that, and here we're specifying the evolution, is theta n times Is theta n times n, where n is an apparatus state in which the memory content is not blank, it's n. It records the measurement result. So what this evolution does is if it receives the object system in an eigenstate of the observable, then it maps the memory from the From the blank state to a state in which just precisely that measurement result is recorded in the memory, and it leaves the eigenstate of the observer or the initial state of the object unchanged. Okay, so certainly when the initial state of the object is an Of the object is an eigenstate of the observable. This describes completely the measurement evolution as defined by the measurement postulates, including the projection postulate, but it leaves the state, the eigenstate of the object system the same, unchanged. Okay, so, but in general, this isn't enough to reproduce what What the measure, what the dynamics according measurement dynamics according to the measurement postulate. In general, this unitary evolution has to be followed by wave function collapse. So let's suppose now this unitary evolution, consider the unitary effect, the result of applying the unitary evolution to a superposition psi of the Psi of these eigenstates of the observable. So u acting on psi times zero gives a sum, well, a sum of these results, the results of acting evolution on each component, theta m times zero. And the result is theta m times m. Okay, so this is the, so the result. This is the result of acting with this unitary evolution on a state psi times zero, with psi any object state, is a superposition of what you can think of as memory eigenstates. These are states in which the memory has, each one of these states is a state in which the memory has a definite value recorded. Okay, and what wave function collapse. And what wave function collapse does is it collapses this wave function to any one of these memory eigenstate components, theta n times m, with a probability which is the modulus squared, or the norm squared of the theta n, which is the same as the norm squared of theta n times n, because n is a normalized vector. Normalized vector and here, well, this is wrong with wrongness p should be a pi for the projector, but it doesn't matter. And of course, actually, it doesn't collapse it to just the projection of the state on the memory eigensubspace, but rather to normalized projection. So we have to divide by the norm, which is just the square root of the probability. Square root of the probability. Okay, so I hope this wasn't, well, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. If it is, it's just because I didn't tell it so well, but hopefully, of the measurement evolution. Let's see now. Let's see now. Oh, what have I got here? Problem with my internet connection. Okay, so let's see how this can help us to identify who can be an observer. Okay, so usually a measurement is really a chain of consecutive measurements. An example is the Gerlach experiment. So, a spinning particle with a magnetic dipole moment passes between two magnetic poles and the magnetic, the direction of the magnetic dipole moment determines how far the particle is pulled toward the North Pole or. Toward the North Pole or pushed away from it. And so this interaction with the non-uniform magnetic field has the effect that the direction of the magnetic dipole moment is recorded in the displacement of the particle transverse to the Transverse to the particle beam. So, this is the displacement acts as a memory of the observed, let's say, the direction of the magnetic dipole moment. Well, then the particle gets to a photographic plate, and then the position of the particle is recorded as a mark in the photographic plate. Okay, second act of measurement. Then the photographic plate is examined, and the position of the mark on the plate is registered in the retina of the observer. And then finally, the position of the signal in the retina is recorded in the memory in the brain of the observer. So there's a whole series of steps. Okay, each link in this chain can be modeled either as a unitary evolution of a composite object plus apparatus system or as a measurement to which the measurement postulates apply. So the question becomes: which link should be treated as a bona fidelity measurement according to the postulates? Okay, equivalently, in which of these successive interactions does the way Which of these successive interactions does the wave function collapse? The point where it does is called the Heisenberg cut. So it is assumed always that at least the last, well, not always, but it is assumed that at least the last link in which you, the ultimate observer, become aware of the result can be treated as a measurement. So that's one. So that's one possibility, but it's a little bit awkward because it means that you would have to model as part of the object system all of the apparatus, right? Not just the magnetic dipole moment of the particle, but also its position, and also the photographic plate and the process of examining the photograph. The process of examining the photographic plate and even what's happening in your eyeball. So that would be well, correct, but really very difficult. But the Heisenberg cut can be moved without affecting the probabilities of the outcomes to, in fact, to any link in the chain, provided that all later links in the chain, that all links that come The chain that all links that come are closer to the observer, let's say, or correspond to a posterior measurement, and that in all later links, the unitary part of the evolution, the first step of the object plus apparatus system is of the special form diamond, which I had defined here in this. find here in this in this transparency here okay and and a second requirement in each step only the memory of the previous step is measured so it makes a measurement of the memory of the previous step but not of correlations between the object system of the previous step and and its memory okay um In that case, it's easy to show that it makes no difference to their final outcome, either to the final state or the final probabilities, which is more important, perhaps, whether you consider that a wave function collapse occurs in this step or not. Okay, so. Okay, so this is called the Heisenberg Cut because Heisenberg emphasized it and Fluman improved it. So the memory in any link that can be placed after the Heisenberg cut can be treated as an observer. That is, it can be deputized to the ultimate observer. The overlays of the ultimate observer. And as I said, Stunderlach experiment: if you could take each of these steps, had an ideal measurement interaction so that the unitary part of the evolution takes the form, the special form that we defined. Then, in fact, you could just take the particle position as the memory, and the only object, the object system could. Object the object system consists entirely of the spinning particle, which is, of course, what you do when you in all examples where you treat measurements of spinning particles in undergraduate courses at least. Okay. Okay, so that's what I mean, but that the that the observer is Observer is you and any observer you can deputize. In fact, or any other system you can deputize. It also you can require a little bit less. You cannot require that the form of the interaction be exactly the special form. It doesn't matter if the projection postulate fails in some links. So you can generalize the form of the interaction a little bit without changing the. Without changing this result. And in fact, depending on what measurements are admitted, additional systems can also be deputized or treated as observers, because if they collapse, the state does not affect the results. So in fact, we started with just one observer, but there is, as long as you don't measure certain things, you can, without any penalty, consider a ton of. We consider a ton of other systems as observers. Okay, so right, so that was the problem or a solution to the problem of who is an observer, an observer. Now, the third problem was that the probability of evolution. The probability and evolution of the state in real measurements didn't correspond to the postulates five and six. So, what can we say about this? Well, so the problem is that usually measurement interactions with microscopic systems are not of this special form that we define. That we define, this diamond that we define. Okay. It's simply this is a special form, and when you make a measurement, you just interact. You can try hard to make it as close as possible, if that's what you want to do to this form, but you won't probably manage it altogether. Altogether. So let's consider instead of just measuring where which consists of a unitary evolution of the special form followed by a wave function collapse. Let's consider that the unitary part of the evolution is just any interaction. We'll consider what just call any interaction between Interaction between an apparatus with a memory and an object system, a measurement. And well, the state of the object system will have some influence on the memory and that will tell you something about the object system. Okay, so So, well, consider now u, this unitary evolution, is just any unitary evolution. So it takes the initial state psi times the state in which the initial state of the apparatus where the memory is blank to u times pi times zero. And this state Well, we don't really know what it is, of course, in any particular case we couldn't, but we can always expand it using an orthonormal basis of apparatus states. Okay, and these orthonormal basis states are labeled by n and k. n is the memory record corresponding to this operator state. Corresponding to this apparatus state, so these are, if you like, memory eigenstates, and k just labels because there's general many, many such states with the same memory record, k just labels all those states, orthonormal states with the same memory record M. Okay, so we can always take this state here of the result. Here that results from the unitary evolution of the initial state of the object plus apparatus system. We can take this resulting state of the object apparatus system and expand it as a sum of these apparatus basis states times coefficients which are object system states. This can always be done. And it's easy to see. And it's easy to see since the evolution is linear, this expression is linear in psi. So you just have to show that theta and k are unique, and that's very easy. And then they have to be linear in psi as well. So they have to be some linear operator a and k acting on psi. K acting on psi. Okay, so this is just a description of a result of any interaction between the object and the apparatus. Now, suppose that the memory is read by an ideal measurement by an additional further observer, or equivalently simply that the wave function collapses, then the result n. Result M, memory record that is obtained, is obtained. Okay, so when it collapses, the result M is obtained with probability. Well, it's the probability of it's the norm squared of the component. Component of this state in the memory eigen subspace corresponding to the memory value n. So that's just the sum over k of the theta n k's, of the norm squared of the theta n k's. And this in turn, using this relation between theta n k and the initial state of the of the object system, can be written. We write it as the standard range of between psi and a and k dagger times a and sum over k. Okay. And the corresponding final state is this projection on the memory eigenstate. Because this measurement by an ideal observer is ideal, so it satisfies the projection postulates or simply because of the way we define collapse. So then the final state is the complete. Is the component of this state in the memory eigenstate with memory value n and normalized. Michael, you have to wrap it up, please. Is there a question? No, you you have to wrap it up, so it's finishing in a few minutes. So it's finishing in a few minutes. Let me just turn up the volume. I realized I don't really hear you. Let's see. Chat, maybe you're writing to me. Oh, of course I agreed to be recorded. Oh, five minutes left. Okay. Okay. Oh, my time is up. Yes. Please, could you please wrap it up? Could you please wrap it up? Oh, wrap it up. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, um, right. So, um, well, um, so these expressions are placed costlets five and six expressions are n and The measurement result and the and the final state, the postulate and the projection postulate, and the fines generalized measurements theory. Theory and this applies to real measurements. Define what's called, as you must have recognized by now, a positive operator-valid measure. They can be, or you can find interactions so that they are any set of positive operators which sum up to one. And these positive operators replace the projectors on eigensubspaces that are used in ideal measurement theory. In ideal measurement theory. Okay. So the problem two dealt with with observables so the problem. So, the problem was that we didn't know how to define an observable corresponding to a measurement apparatus. Well, the preceding theory solves most of the problem two. It determines the statistics of measurement results from the Hamiltonian of the object plus apparatus system. It doesn't tell us what the observable operator corresponding to a measurement. A measurement is, but that's easily done. The observable operator is defined by the expectation value of the numerical result of the measurement. So if the numerical result, the numerical value associated with the measurement value n is lambda n, then the expectation value is just the sandwich of the state psi of the up of the operator a, which is the sum over measurement results, of the value. The value associated with the measurement result times this positive operator mn. Okay, so this is the observable operator and the expectation value function as a function of the state. It's just a sandwich of this operator between psi and psi. The numerical values associated with Associated with the measurement results are freely chosen labels for the measurement results. A priori measurement results are not numbers. For example, to describe positions on the surface of the earth, one may use names like Paris, Montevideo, or Oaxaca. Numerical labels are useful because they make mathematical relations between observables possible. If latitude and longitude are used to Latitude and longitude are used to label positions on Earth, then the clock time of sunrise can be expressed as a function of these. Okay, so here I was summarizing what we have so far. Let me just go to the last problem and address that. So, probability, what does probability mean? Probability is often defined as long-run relative frequency in a series of trials. This is how probabilities are measured in experiments. But with this definition, if I have a result one, I say the probability of this result is one-sixth, and this is a statement about infinite sequences of measurements and therefore completely useless because there are no. Completely useless because there are no infinite sequences of measurements. Now, so what can we do? This frequentist definition doesn't actually tell us. I mean, it's an empty definition. You can use it as a setting in which the Kolmogorov axioms are realized, but you can't connect it with real experiments. Now, in practice, the problem. In practice, the probability predictions of quantum mechanics are, in fact, used all the time and they're tested and sometimes falsified or in the sense that the Hamiltonian was used to calculate them, it turns out to be wrong, things like that. So it can't be a hollow or empty statement, probability statements. So all we have to do to get a good definition of probability is just to look. Probability is just to look carefully at what actually is done. If one were to obtain the result one in each of a thousand successive throws of a die, according to the frequentist definition, this does not contradict that the probability of one is one-sixth, because a thousand is much less than infinite, infinitely less than infinite. So you can always imagine that the sequence. Imagine that the sequence of measurements, if you were to make them, would continue so that ultimately long-run frequency is one-sixth. But in practice, if you did throw a die a thousand times and get one sixth, get the value one in each throw, then this would actually lead you, would undermine your confidence in the hypothesis that led you to. Hypothesis that led you to believe that the probability of getting one is one six. Okay, so what's going on here is that we're actually Bayesian-like agents who assign subjective probabilities or degrees of belief to all hypotheses that we entertain and update these according to the data we obtain. If data are obtained that we believe unlikely, assuming a certain Hypothesis is then the belief in the hypothesis itself is lower. I say we're Bayesian-like agents instead of Bayesian agents because a Bayesian agent has a very specific updating rule for their probabilities and their degrees of belief. And it's not clear that people actually use this. In fact, what updating rule people use is a subject of psychological research. Research, but qualitatively, we do this. The statement: I believe the probability of one is of the result one is one sixth. I'm almost finished here. Yeah, this is the last. I won't do the rest. I believe the text means my degree of belief that a relative frequency will be found. Belief that a relative frequency will be found is much different from what is low, hence the zero as leaf. A user of the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics has beliefs essentially of the form of this form, but they're modified to take into account also their degree of. Take into account also the degree of belief and the assumptions that lead to the predictions. So you don't really think that your belief goes to in a in a relative frequency different from the predicted one, goes to zero as the trans goes to infinity because you also keep a reserve and a little bit of skepticism about the hypothesis that led to that probability. That led to that probability estimate, including even of the validity of quantum mechanics itself. This interpretation of probability seems incisive and subjective, but it does capture what actually done. Possible because anyone who finds a run of 10 sixes in throwing a fair die would find this odd. Would find this odd, but how odd or how unlikely they would find it and whether it would lead them to conclude that the die is not fair after all depends on the individual. Well, so I hope there was something. I think I should stop there because you asked me to wrap it up. I was going to go on about some unresolved issues. About some unresolved issues, but I think I can leave it at this point. Thank you, Michael. We have time for one question. Fast, please. Somebody wants to ask from here from the Zoom. Ah, Daniel. Hi, Mike. I'm intrigued by the last comments about probabilities. I think I agree with you, but would you then infer from this that quantum states are just summaries of degrees of beliefs and they should be understood in Bayesian terms, because you can map quantum states. terms because you can map a quantum state to a list of probability assignments for every possible observable and it would seem if you take seriously the really this basic understanding of probabilities it would seem to me that you have to take a Bayesian and some more epistemic like interpretation of quantum states well yeah I don't know quite how to how to answer that I mean Quite how to answer that. I mean, this is, there are a lot of, there are a number of attempts to take the probabilities as Bayesian probabilities. But I'm actually doing something that's a little bit a two-step procedure. The probabilities are still basically relative frequency probabilities, but the state The statement that you think that the probability is, as I said, one-sixth, is a statement about your subjective beliefs about what the relative frequencies will be when you do an experiment. I think that is a real transcription of what people do in practice. So, I'm not really saying that the one Saying that the one-sixth is a subjective probability of anybody. I'm saying it's a hypothesis which people can believe to various degrees. Now, you said something else, really, whether somehow the does this imply that the quantum states are subjective? Well, Objective, well, certainly the degree to which you believe in them is objective. Yeah, I don't know what to say. No, I understand. Okay, good. Thanks. Okay, so I guess, so thank you very much. All right, thank you, Michael. Right, thank you, Michael. Okay. We're going now to start the break. We'll start in half an hour.
