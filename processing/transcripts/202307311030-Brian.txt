Okay, so here's my unnecessary visual aid on the first slide here. This is how you partition the real line to three Borel sets. Or you can do countably many. That's also pretty easy. But once you get to uncountably many sets, the question becomes a little bit different. Uncountably many sets, the question becomes a little bit more subtle, or at least it can become a little bit more subtle. I suppose if CH halts or something, then it's not a very interesting question. Anyway, I'm going to, since I don't have a direct answer to the question, I'm going to turn it into a definition. I'm just going to define, there we go, the Borel partition spectrum to be the set of all cardinals such that we can partition the real line into that many Borel sets, uncountable cardinals, since all the countable cardinals are pretty easy to deal with. Deal with. Okay. Another question we can ask along these lines is: instead of just Borel sets, what about even nicer, even simpler sets? You can't partition the real line into more than one open set. That's because the real line is connected, right? So if you had it partitioned into more than one open set, then one of the open sets and the union of all the others would give you a disconnection of the real line. You can't have that. So the simplest possible sets you can partition the real line into are closed sets. And there's an interesting Closed sets. And there's an interesting theorem that goes way back to Schierpinski, which says that if you have a partition into at least two closed sets, then automatically it's uncountable. I'm not going to sketch the proof of this for you, but I encourage you later. This is a really good one-beer problem. It's kind of fun to figure out how to do this. And your hint is that the proof actually uses the bear category theorem. And what he shows in modern terminology is that if you have a partition into at least two closed sets, you actually get at least. Into at least two closed sets, you actually get at least the covering number of the meager ideal many sets. Okay, um, so we're going to turn this question into a definition too. The closed partition spectrum is just all the cardinals such that you can partition the real line into that many closed sets. All right. And so, what can we say about these two sets of cardinals? Where on the, you know, well, on the spectrum from sort of completely arbitrary, it just depends. Of completely arbitrary, it just depends on your model of set theory. To it's pretty much determined by ZFC. Where in between does the truth lie? That's what I'd like to know. So here's what we can say about it. A few facts. Fact number one, an obvious observation maybe. The continuum is in there. Why? Because we can take the real line and partition it into singletons. Okay. The same is true for the closed partition spectrum. I'm going to actually table that one for a while. It'll come up again at the end of the talk. We're going to talk about the Borel partition spectrum for now, though. Partition spectrum for now, though. So, okay, partition the real line into singletons, and you get continuum many. This is also the maximum value, at least if you assume the axiom of choice, which I always do, you can't partition the real line into more than continuum many sets. Under AD, I think you can partition it into more than continuum many Borel sets. That's kind of interesting, but also kind of tangential to what I want to talk about. All right, second fact, Aleph One is in the Borel partition spectrum. Borel partition spectrum. The easiest way to say this, and also maybe the earliest using the earliest theorems way to see this is by looking at the early days of descriptive set theory. So Lusin and Scherpinsky were exploring analytic sets that are non-Borel. They showed that there are analytic sets that are non-Borel. Furthermore, every such set can be partitioned into Aleph 1 Borel sets. Maybe the theorem in its more usual form is that you can write it as a union of Aleph 1 Borel sets. Write it as a union of all of one Borel sets. But if it's not Borel, that means in that union, you really need all of one different sets. So if you just order them in type omega one, you take each set minus all the previous ones, you get all of one different Borel sets, and that's a partition. So, okay, partition the real line into two sets, analytic and co-analytic, partition each of those into all of one Borel sets, and there's your partition into all of one Borel sets. Yep. Yes, but that came later. Well, I don't think so. I don't think so. 1908. We almost the result I have equals. Yeah. Okay. See, I'm still trying to sort out the history here. So I talked about this in Vienna in November, and I attributed the result to Hausdorff. And Cy Friedman raised his hand and told me, No, no, no, you have it wrong. It goes, it's Lusen and Sierpinski. It has to do with analytic and co-atalytic sets. I think it's the other way around. There are two camps. I'm just going to say, Lusen. Camps yet. I'm just going to say Luzen Schierpinski and Hausdorff are going to share the credit on this one. All right. Some combination of those guys figured this out. So Hausdorff, you know, I guess maybe it came earlier. It sounds like it came earlier in this, 1908. Okay. Didn't you write a whole article about the history of this sort of thing at one point? Okay. I'll take your word for it. Yeah, I believe you. I believe you. All right. So 1908, Hastor figured this out. His version of this is very nice because it shows you not only you can get Olaf Juan Berel. Because it shows you not only you can get Olifone Borel sets, but you can get the complexity very low, uniformly bounded. So it's not arbitrarily high in the hierarchy or whatever. That's pretty cool. Much later, Fremlin and Shella figured out that actually F sigma delta is the best you can do. It's consistent, that you cannot partition the line into LF1 G delta sigma sets. This again actually has to do with the covering number of the Meagher ideal, by the way. So their result, maybe phrased a bit more precisely, says that you cannot A bit more precisely says that you cannot partition the real line into fewer than covering number of the meager ideal many g delta sigma sets or g delta sets, those are equivalent. Okay, third fact. The Braille partition spectrum is closed under singular limits. So if you have a singular cardinal and the spectrum is unbounded below it, then it must include that cardinal. Because I like to include pictures in talks, I'm going to include a picture that shows you how to do this when. How to do this when the cardinal has co-finality omega. So, what you can do is you can chop the real line like this. You have omega many pieces that look just like copies of the real line. So, if you have a sequence of cardinals all in the spectrum, then you can put a partition into that many Borel sets on each of these intervals, and then just slap those together. You get one big partition. I guess you have to include what's pictured here is the red set as well, and that adds one extra set. The red set as well, and that adds one extra set which is closed. And so you get a partition of the right number of sets. If you're curious, by the way, when you have larger co-finality, of course, you can't get intervals like this. But what you can do is you can essentially get copies of bare space or canner space inside some sequence of members of some partition. And so then you just chop each one of those appropriately. So it kind of works the same way, but doesn't make for a good picture. All right. All right, this is the list. This is what we know. There are three facts that we know about the Borel partition spectrum that we can prove in ZFC. So, what I would like to tell you next is that we can prove that there's nothing else that remains to be proved, right? So, the way that a theorem like that could go in theory is that I could have some set of cardinals that satisfies these three constraints, right? So, Aleph 1 needs to be in there, it needs to be closed under singular limits, and something like this. You know, something like this, and I can force that set of cardinals to be my spectrum. If I could do that, then that would mean there's really nothing else to be done here, right? That would sort of close the book on this problem. I can almost do that, but not quite. So here's the theorem. Here's what I have. I'm going to start with a set of cardinals, and the punchline of this theorem, which I haven't revealed yet, is going to say, you know, we can force C to be the Borel partition spectrum. So what requirements do we need on C in order to make that happen? Well, requirement number A. Requirement number A. Yep. Requirement number A is that the set of cardinals needs to have a maximum, and that maximum needs to satisfy this property here. This probably is something that looks familiar. This just means that it's possible to force that cardinal to be the continuum. If it doesn't satisfy that right there, you can't turn it into the continuum anyway, so it's not a valid candidate for the top of the partition spectrum. So this A here, this is a necessary requirement. Any set C that you can force to be the spectrum. Set C that you can force to be the spectrum must satisfy this by property one on the previous slide. Similarly, here, Olive 1 needs to be in there because we're going to force it to be the spectrum without collapsing cargoes. Okay. Third thing, closed under singular limits. We need that to be there too. So these last two conditions are the two conditions that keep me awake at night. These are the conditions that I don't want to be there, but they're kind of hard to get rid of. So condition D, if we have a If we have a singular cardinal with co-finality omega, and it's in the spectrum, or it's in the thing that we're going to make into the spectrum, it's in the set C, then its successor has to be in C as well. Okay, most of what I'm going to talk about today is related to this fourth condition here. We'll return to it. And then there's this fifth condition that I really hate, C is countable. Okay, so this is really just an artifact of the proof. And well, it's bad. Well, it's bad. I don't like that that's there. But already, even with that condition E, there, we have a lot of leeway in what we can force to be the Borel partition spectrum. So if you'd like to have it be the case that you can partition the line into all of n Borel sets if and only if n is a power of 17, I can rig up a model of set theory where that happens. So it seems pretty arbitrary, but maybe not quite. All right, there's an improvement to this theorem. All right, there's an improvement to this theorem, which is going to be published at so the maximum is going to become the continuum in this extension. Sorry, I don't think I understand your question. Could you repeat? This A is equal to the stochastic, so that that would be. Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, yeah, it's only I'm only looking at the olive n. So if there are unboundedly many n's, you could make the spectrum into that set plus alpha omega and alpha omega plus one. Okay. All right, we can get rid of the accountability requirement. This is joint work with Farah that we haven't written up yet, but I intend to at some point in this. I intend to at some point in this decade, hence the date at the top. Basically, the proof looks pretty similar to what was done before, but instead of adding a partition of the real line for each cardinal in C, we add lots and lots and lots of them. And somehow this magically makes the post set a lot more homogeneous and enables us to do just a better kind of argument. We no longer need C to be countable. So, yeah, we could close it. That's someone else blowing it. Okay. All right. So, you know, what does this new version buy us? Well, it buys us, you know, making the spectrum uncountable. It also answers a question that was left open by the first theorem, which is whether that singular there is really needed in part C, right? So it's closed under singular limits. Maybe it's just a closed set of cardinals. It turns out it needn't be. So if it's consistent that there's a regular limit cardinal, Consistent that there's a regular limit cardinal, then it's consistent to have a regular limit cardinal not in the Borel partition spectrum, but everything below it is, for example. Okay, oh, and I should say, by the way, I didn't include this on the slides, but there were some results by Harrington, by Arnie Miller. Yeah, I think mainly just those two, kind of sort of in this direction before any of this stuff was done. So Miller showed that the spectrum can be arbitrarily large, so it can include any given. So it can include any given set of cardinals, but he didn't try to really argue that any cardinals were excluded. Harrington came up with an argument to exclude cardinals, but he excluded everything between Aleph One and some target for the continuum. So this is me trying to selectively exclude cardinals and selectively include other cardinals. But their work certainly factors into this work as well. Okay, I'm not going to talk a ton about the forcing argument that proves this theorem, but I do want to. Argument that proves this theorem, but I do want to give you just some small idea of sort of what lies at the center of it. So here's the bare bones basic idea. Given a subset X of the Cantor space, which we can all think of as the real line for now, we're going to define a postset as follows. So conditions in the postset look like this. It's your standard thing where you have a working part and a side condition. In the working part, we have a finite tree. Having trouble pointing at it. Having trouble pointing at it. Well, you can all see it right there. It's a finite tree. So we have this finite tree. And I built the tree up to a particular level. So it's not allowed to be taller in one spot than another. So it's a finite tree built up to a particular level. And then the side condition is going to consist of some finite list of reals in the set X. And the finite list of reals in the set X have to have the property that when we look at the tree, the restriction of those reels need to be part of the tree. So they can't. To be part of the tree, so they can't be part of the excluded bit. And the working part essentially, or sorry, the side condition essentially constitutes a promise that when we extend, we are not going to do away with those bits of the tree. So an extension looks like this. We're allowed to keep building the tree, but as I said, we must keep building it along those reels that we've already promised. We can, of course, keep building it along in other spots as well. Oops. Didn't mean to do that. There we go. Didn't mean to do that. There we go. And we're, of course, allowed to add new things into our side condition. Now, one thing that you might notice with this postet, there could be reels in X that are supposed to go into one of these excluded neighborhoods. You know, there could be a reel that branches up through here, for example. It's impossible for me to add that reel into my side condition. I've already, you know, based on what my working part is doing, I've already sort of decided that reel is not going to end up as part of this. Going to end up as part of this tree. So, what does this tree give us? Well, when we look at the generic, we get a full subtree of 2 to the omega, and it contains some, but not all, points of x, right? There are some points that we decide at some fixed stage to exclude. They stay excluded for all time. But if you look at accountable power of this postet, then a finite support power, then by genericity, in some coordinate, you can always take any given point of x and stick it into that. Of x and stick it into that tree's coordinate. And so they all get included in one of these trees eventually. So, you know, what a generic for the countable power gives us is countably many closed sets whose union contains all of x, but no points of the complement of x that are in the ground model. This is just a genericity argument. If you have a point in the ground model that's not in x, then generically at some stage, you're going to exclude it from your tree. Because unless it gets included in your side condition, at some point it gets excluded from the tree. Condition, at some point, it gets excluded from the tree. So the situation looks something like this. We have this small set of reels, the ground model reels, and some subset X of those reels. And what we're doing is we're adding this F sigma, B, that when you look at the ground model reels, it's going to meet the ground model reels in precisely the set X. Now, at the same time, we're adding loads and loads and loads of new reels. But as far as the ground model reels are concerned, we have a lot of control over where they meet the ground model. I should also say, I didn't put this on the slide, but this part is. Oh, I should also say, I didn't put this on the slide, but this posted is older than I am. I didn't come up with this. I think the first I ever saw it was in some work of Arnie Miller, but I think Arnie attributes it to Solovey, but I don't think Solovey really came up with it. I think he just did something very similar. I think Arnie's just being modest. So I'm going to go ahead and say this is Miller's post-et. Anyway, unless yours contradicts me. No? Okay. All right. So the post-et used to prove the theorem essentially. Post set used to prove the theorem essentially uses this post set, lots and lots and lots and lots over and over and over again. So you can imagine with this post set, what you want to do in order to build a partition, say, of size all of two. You start with all of two disjoint Borel sets. Maybe you add a lot of reels first and you just use Olive two singletons. That's fine. And then what you can do is you can add an F sigma that hits every other reel of the ground model, except for the things that are already put into your partition. And then, you know, when you do that, you get lots of new reels. When you do that, you get lots of new reals, and they're not in any of your partition elements again. So, okay, you do it again. You add a new F sigma that hits all of those new things. When you do that, you get some new things, but you just do this iteratively. And after omega one steps, you've come up with a partition. So you can get a partition of size aleph 2 that way in omega 1 steps. And that's really the key is being able to get partitions of any given size where the size that you're getting does not depend on the length of the iteration, because what that means is that with a single Because what that means is that with a single length omega one, or really any length iteration that you like, you can get partitions of all kinds of sizes. And so that's all you really do. The tricky part of the proof is arguing that certain things get excluded. And I'm not really going to say anything about that except that it's an isomorphism of names argument. If you know what that is, great. If you don't, I'm not explaining it. All right. Why am I not explaining it? Because what I really want to talk about here is item D. All right. So this is the theorem right here. I've rewritten it. Right here, I've rewritten it with E just deleted instead of crossed out. And so we have these three conditions here that we know are necessary for the set C we'd like to turn into the spectrum. And then this fourth condition that annoys us, because this is the one thing we don't have a ZFC theorem that tells us that has to happen for a set of cardinals we want to turn into the spectrum. So what do we do with that? What can we say? Well, this is where the story, in my opinion, gets a little more interesting. So it turns out that we don't have a ZFC theory. out that we don't have a ZFC theorem that tells us that condition is necessary, but we do have this theorem, which is proved in ZFC plus this anti-large cardinal axiom. Zero dagger does not exist. So assuming that zero dagger does not exist, if you have a singular cardinal with cofinality omega and it's in the spectrum, then its successor must also be in the spectrum. So you do have this necessary inclusion of the successor of singulars of cofinality omega, at least assuming this axiom, zero daggers not exist. Daggers not exist. I know it's one of the more obscure large cardinal axioms, so I'll remind you what it says. So the statement zero dagger exists is this large cardinal axiom. It's kind of like, well, I think I, yeah, okay. So it's kind of like zero sharp, except instead of telling you things about the model L, it tells you things about these models L square bracket mu, where mu is a normal measure on a measurable cardinal. And so saying zero dagger exists is kind of transcending. Is kind of transcending the statement that there is a measurable cardinal. But even though, in some sense, it's much stronger than saying there's a measurable cardinal, it's also weaker than saying there's two measurable cardinals. So I tend to think of it as pretty close to saying there is a measurable cardinal. So it's roughly that order of strength. In consistency strength, it's between one and two measurables. So we're going to corollary it to the theorem, right? If you have, say, omega, or really any cardinal of countable cofinality in the spectrum, but its success or not. Spectrum, but its successor, not, that means you do have inner models containing measurable cardinals. Okay. What I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is sketch a proof of this because I find the proof of this to be, first of all, kind of interesting, but second of all, I like how it brings topology to bear on this question that seems at first very set theoretic, maybe not a whole lot to do with topology. So the proof is a bit topological, and I want to sort of sketch how it works. Of sketch how it works. So, one thing that is a major ingredient in this proof is these postets here. So, postets square bracket kappa to the omega ordered by inclusion. These are something you very well may have seen before. We talk about subfamilies of this poset being co-final if they're just co-final with respect to the partial ordering. So, that means that for every countable subset of kappa, you have some member of the family that. Some member of the family that includes it. There's also this notion of being kurupa. So being kurupa means that for every countable subset of kappa, if you look at the restriction of your family to that set, then you only get countably many things, right? A priori, you should get lots of things. So if A is countable and you look at how this giant family of sets restricts down to A, you could get continuum many things, right? It could be the whole power set of A. So being Kurupa is sort of the smallness property when you restrict. Of this smallness property when you restrict down to any given countable set, it doesn't look too big. So, we have a bigness property and a smallness property. We're going to be interested when they work together, when you get cofinal Kuropa families, families that are both at the same time. Sometimes, you know, you could argue that no one cares about the Kuropa property if you don't also have co-final. But I'm separating the two into two separate definitions for a reason that will hopefully become apparent later. So, anyway, an example of a co-final. An example of a co-final family would be the whole postset. Okay, that's easy. An example of a Kurupa family would be some countable subset of the postset. That's also easy, but like I said, not very interesting. Co-final and Kurupa is what we want. I'm going to give just one example of that because anything of higher cardinality is kind of hard to describe. But for kappa equals omega one, we have an easy example of a co-final curricula family. So if you think of omega one as the countable ordinals, and you just look at initial segments, then the Initial segments, then the set of all those initial segments is both cofinal and curupa, right? The restriction to any countable set is going to be countably many ordinals, and then eventually you go beyond, and it's just the restriction is everything. Yeah. Okay, so here's a theorem by Tador Jovich. So if we have a cardinal between Aleph 1 and Aleph Omega, then there is a cofinal Kurupa family. He proved this using the He proved this using the walks on ordinals technique. It's not a super easy thing to prove, but it is a ZFC theorem. Once you get to aleph omega, it's no longer a ZFC theorem. You need to assume some sort of extra firepower in your axioms. And square does it. So if we have square lambda holding for every singular cardinal, you know, I didn't write this, but actually you only need it holding for singular cardinals of countable co-finality for what that's worth. But if you have square root singulars, then you get co-final curiper families on every single Kurupa families on every cardinal. Okay. Oh, and if you get one, then you get one of minimal possible size. In fact, you cannot have a Kurupa family that's any bigger than this. So whatever the co-finality of Kappa to the omega is, that's the size of your Kurupa family. Okay, for our proof, we want not only to have these co-final Kurupa families, but we also want them to have minimum possible cardinality. This is another place where zero-dagger comes in. So assuming zero-daggeragagagagagagagger Another place where zero dagger comes in. So, assuming zero dagger does not exist, then first of all, we get square root singulars. And second of all, we get this statement here. So, the cofinality of square bracket kappa to the omega is equal to kappa if the cofinality is uncountable or kappa plus if cofinality is countable. This is the minimum possible value for the cofinality of the postset. If kappa has co-finality omega, then there's a diagonalization argument you can do to show that this square bracket kappa to the omega. This square bracket kappa to the omega cannot have co-finality kappa. It must be larger. So essentially, what this says is that this poset for any kappa has the minimum allowable cardinality. This statement, by the way, this equality here is known as Shelley's strong hypothesis, or it's equivalent to the normal statement of Shelley's strong hypothesis. Okay. So in particular, and this is really the form in which we're going to be using zero daggers not exist. Using zero daggers does not exist. So, if zero dagger does not exist, then what happens? Well, for our purposes, what happens is that whenever you have a singular cardinal of cofinality omega, then there's a cofinal Kurippa family and it has size kappa plus. That's what we want. So I'm sort of showing you what goes into determining all of this and who's responsible for all of these deep theorems. But ultimately, what it boils down to is when I say zero diagram does not exist, what we really want is there's a cofinal Kurupa family. There's a cofinal Kuropa family on kappa of size Kappa plus. Yes? Is it a few? So it can charge him, but it's not a nobody knows. So I just use a profile who wouldn't profile the because that's a mouthful. Yeah, I could have phrased it that way. Right. I figured that zero dagger does not exist. So. Not exist. So for me, that was the sort of strongest inconsistency strength large cardinal axiom that's recognizable, but I could show implies what I want. So that's how I chose to phrase the theorem. But you're right. A more optimal phrasing would be to say that if square lambda holds at singulars of countable co-finality and the Shella-Strong hypothesis holds, then, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah, actually, I heard a story that at one point, Bill Mitchell visited Saharon and they tried to determine the existence. To determine the exact strength of Shell's strong hypothesis. And apparently, Bill thought it should be zero, or something, I think, a little bit stronger than zero dagger, but that's not published, but somewhere in that neighborhood. And Shella thought it should be essentially like SSH, a Mitchell, a measurable kappa of Mitchell order Kappa plus plus, which is the current best known upper bound. And apparently they each thought the other just, you know, wasn't working hard enough. Just, you know, wasn't working hard enough to make it. But it seems a very tough problem to determine the exact strength of this, and it's an open question. Okay, so this is not the theorem from the earlier slide. This is a different theorem that actually I knew about. So all the unattributed theorems are things that I've proved. So I proved this several years ago without really thinking about the Borel partition spectrum. I was interested in this sort of thing in its own. Interested in this sort of thing in its own right, but it turns out that it's very relevant to the Borel partition spectrum. And this is where the topology starts to come in. So when we think about the Borel partition spectrum, one of the things that bears on this is these very, very large metric spaces. So if you read the statement of this theorem, we have a discrete space of size kappa, where kappa is going to be some cardinal, I almost said large cardinal. In this context, that's not really accurate, but it's going to be a big cardinal, right? All of omega at least. So we have this really big uncountable cardinal. So we have this really big uncountable cardinal, and we raise it, we take a discrete space of that size, raise it to the omega power. We get some sort of completely metrizable space that's kind of like the bare space, but an analog of higher weight. And this is somehow relevant to this question about partitioning the real line into Borel sets. So what this theorem says is that we can partition that space into kappa plus Polish spaces. I'm going to show you how that goes. So using the assumption that zero dagger does not exist, remember for us right now, Dagger does not exist. Remember, for us right now, that's just a stand-in for the assumption that there is a co-final Kuruppa family with size kappa plus. So we're going to call that family F. And what are we going to do with it? Well, first thing we're going to do with it, we're going to well-order the family. It doesn't really matter what type we well-order it in. We're just going to well-order it. And then for everything in the family, we're going to define the set x sub a. So I'm going to take something in my cofinal Kurupa family, raise it to the omega power. Now remember, A is a subset of D in this context. D is a discrete space. Context d is a discrete space. So a to the omega is a copy of the bear space, right? It's a countable discrete space raised to the omega power. We have the bear space here. It's also a closed subspace of d to the omega, right? Because A is closed in D. So we have this closed copy of the bear space here, and then we just remove some stuff from it. We're going to remove from it all of the b to the omegas such that b becomes before a and are well ordering. Okay. Oh, I think I already said this. So, yeah, a to the omega is a copy of the bare space. It's a closed subspace of d to the omega. So, what we're doing here, if I could argue that the a to the omegas of this form cover the bare space, it's kind of like what I alluded to earlier. When you have a covering and you'd like to turn it into a partition, one way to do it is just to well-order your covering. Then, from each thing in your covering, you subtract off all the things that come before it, right? That turns a. Things that come before it, right? That turns a covering into a partition. That's essentially what we're doing here, right? So if the A to the omegas cover D to the omega, then the X sub A's will partition D to the omega. So let's argue that they do. Okay, let's argue that they do. This is a cover of D to the omega. Why? Well, it has to do with this cofinal property. So look at a point in D to the Omega. We're going to think of the point as a function from omega to D, and this function has. D and this function has a range, right? It has some countable range, all of the x of n's. Just look at what it does in every coordinate. And because f is co-final, there's going to be something in f that covers that countable subset of d. And what does that mean? It means x is in a to the omega. So now, well, that's it, right? That means we have a covering. And that means that when we look at the x sub a's, we have a partition, right? So if you look at the least a such that x is in. least a such that x is in a to the omega, then that least a least with respect to our well ordering, the x sub a is going to contain that point. So every point gets into one of the x sub a's and only one, because all later a to the omegas you subtract it off. Okay, so we have a partition of d to the omega. It has the right size, by the way. There's actually a little bit of extra argument that goes into showing that, and I'm waving my hands. I'm going to skip that bit. So notice what we have here. Notice what we have here. It appears that the X sub A's here, we should have Kappa plus many of them because they correspond to members of our cofinal corrupt family, which had size Kappa plus. Some of the X sub A's could be empty, though, right? I mean, there's no guarantee that A to the omega doesn't just contain old points. And if that happens too often, we might end up with a partition of size strictly less than kappa plus. You can argue that that doesn't happen, but I'm skipping that part of the argument. Okay, so this is a partition. It does have size kappa plus. Partition, it does have size kappa plus. Why is it a partition into Polish spaces? Okay, well, remember, each of the a to the omegas is just a copy of the bear space. And we know that if you have a subspace of the bear space, it's going to be Polish if and only if it's G delta. So we have a copy of the bear space, and we're removing some stuff from it, right? That's how our definition works. What I would like to argue is that we've removed countably many closed sets. Now, on the face of it, that doesn't really seem to be true, right? We've removed these b to the omegas. To be true, right? We've removed these b to the omegas where for all the b's that come before a, there could be lots and lots and lots of those, or well, ordering is very long. Um, but this is where the Kerpa property comes in, right? So you remove all these b to the omegas. Now, of course, if you're using members of b that aren't in a at all, those points are going to be irrelevant. So we might as well remove not b to the omega, but b intersect A to the omega, which means we're essentially looking at the restriction of stuff to A, right? The restriction of stuff in our family to A. The restriction of stuff in our family to A, and the Kurupa property tells me that there are only countably many such restrictions. So even though it looks like we might be removing lots and lots and lots of things of this form, we're actually only removing countably many. And each thing that we're removing is closed in d to the omega. So we do end up with bare space minus countably many closed sets. And that's Polish. That's it. Each X sub A is G delta, hence Polish, and we're done. That's the lemma, the lemma that I labeled as a theorem, because it was a theorem before. As a theorem because it was a theorem before I realized it was really just a lemma. But now we're ready for the other theorem, the main theorem, the one I wanted to talk about, right? So, this main theorem, okay, assume that zero dagger does not exist. If we have a singular cardinal with cofinality omega and it's in the spectrum, then so is its successor. Why? What does that have to do with these large metric spaces? Okay, well, let's suppose we have a cardinal like that, and let's suppose there's a partition of the reals into kappa Borel sets. What do we do? URL sets. What do we do? Well, first thing we do is we say we don't really like the real line very much. Let's talk about the bear space instead. So the real line, if you take away the rational points, then you get a copy of the bear space. The irrationals are homeomorphic to the bear space. Taking the rational points away from some partition of the reals, you know, maybe countably many of your partition members go empty after that, but you still get a partition of the same size because kappa is uncountable. All the sets in the partition are still Borel. So, okay, we have a partition of the bare space in the kappa Borel space. Partition of the bare space into Kappa-Borel sets. What do we do with it? Well, the thing that we do with it is we multiply everything by the bear space all over again. So we take our partition, multiply everything in it by the bare space, and then multiply the base space, the thing we're partitioning also by the bare space. Now, bare space crossed bare space, that's just the bare space all over again. So what does this accomplish? Well, it means that each of our partition elements, each of these Borel sets, is nowhere sigma compact. Sigma compact. Why does that matter? Um, well, Lusen and Susilin popping up again. Though I might have spelled Lusin differently this time. Oh well. Lusen and Susilin popping up again. Every such Borel set is a continuous bijective image of the bare space. So now what do we have? Well, we have, I think I actually wrote it on the next slide. Yeah, there we go. So what we have is essentially kappa many continuous bijection. Kappa many continuous bijection bijective images of the bear space. So by viewing those kappa many functions as just one big function on kappa many copies of the bear space, what we really have is a continuous bijection from d cross the bear space to the bear space. Okay? And now what? Well, now for the real trick. Here's the real trick. It's kind of a diagonalization argument. We raise everything to the countable power. All right. When we do that, including our function, right? We raise our function to count. Including our function, right? We raise our function to accountable power. We get this diagonal mapping here, which just does f to every coordinate. And what do we get? Well, what we get is a continuous bijection from this space here to this space here. But, and this is an exercise in angle king, so sort of, you know, standard topological arguments, that space on the left, d cross bare space to the omega, that's the same as d to the omega. It's homeomorphic to d to the omega. The omega, it's homeomorphic to d to the omega, bare space to the omega, that's the bare space all over again. And so, what we really have here is a continuous bijection from d to the omega to the bare space. Why is that relevant? Well, Lucin and Susslin again. Oh, well, okay. First, our lemma slash theorem. So, our lemma slash theorem, that domain of that function capital F, the domain can be partitioned into kappa plus Polish spaces. And one interesting fact about Polish spaces. One interesting fact about Polish spaces with continuous bijections, the continuous bijective image of a Polish space is Borel. Okay, the continuous image of a Polish space might not be Borel, it might just be analytic, but if it's a bijective continuous image, it's actually Borel. So, what we get here is just by taking our partition of d to the omega into Polish spaces and pushing it through this continuous bijection, that should be a capital F, my mistake. That right there. That's right there. But by pushing our partition through this continuous bijection, we get a partition of the bare space into kappa plus many Borel sets. If you don't like the bare space, if you want to go back to the original definition with R instead of bare space, that's fine. Toss in the rationals. Now we have a partition of the real line into kappa plus Borel sets. And that's it. That's the proof. Okay. I want to point out that sort of the structure To point out that sort of the structure of this proof, if you tease it apart, you get something a little bit more. So, kind of what we showed, assuming square, actually, much less, right? Square at singulars, which is nicer. But assuming square, what we get is that if you have a partition of the real line in de Kappa Borel sets, then you get a continuous bijection from dt omega to r. And from that, you get a partition of the real line into this many Borel sets, right? So, without the Shellist-Strong hypothesis, just knowing The Shell is strong hypothesis, just knowing square and the existence of these co-final Kurupa families, we already get this information. This is interesting because for many cardinals, it may be true that kappa is equal to that co-finality there. This is true, for example, for all cardinals less than aleph omega in ZFC, and it's true for many cardinals above aleph omega, assuming SSH. I mean, it's true for all cardinals of uncountable co-finality under SSH. So this is nice because if you look at that, well, now we have... Because if you look at that, well, now we have this three-way implication where this and this are saying the exact same thing. And so that means they're equivalent to the thing in the middle. So under this assumption that kappa is equal to the co-finality of square bracket kappa to the omega, there's a continuous bijection from d to the omega to the reals if and only if kappa is in the Borel partition spectrum. So somehow this question of the Borel partition spectrum is related to the question of which metric spaces map onto the real line via a continuous bijection. Via a continuous bijection. I don't know if you've ever encountered that question before, but it is an old question. It goes back to a Scottish book entry of Stefan Bonach from 100 years ago or something. And you can deduce other things for it. It's not just these d to the omegas. You can say, for example, if you have a Bonach space of weight less than ol of omega, then there's a continuous bijection from that space onto the closed unit interval, if and only if kappa is in the Borel partition spectrum. So somehow the Borel partition spectrum. Spectrum. So somehow the Borel partition spectrum is related to this idea of continuous bijections from bonic spaces to compacta. Okay. I told you I was going to come back near the end of the talk. We are near the end of the talk now. The closed partition spectrum is resurfacing now. What can we say about the closed partition spectrum? Well, the closed partition spectrum, it turns out, doesn't really provide us with that much new stuff. So, a theorem is that the closed partition spectrum is really just a final segment of the Braille partition spectrum. So, the Braille partition spectrum looks how it looks. At some point, you hit a cardinal where you have a partition real line to that many closed sets. And from then on, the two spectra just completely coincide. That cardinal is denoted A sub T. You might have seen this cardinal before in a different context. It has many equivalent definitions. The A sub T has to do with one of those equivalent definitions. Has to do with one of those equivalent definitions. So you can define a sub t to be the minimum size of an almost disjoint family of subtrees of two to the less than omega, where two trees are almost disjoint if they overlap finitely, and the family is maximal if it, you know, if there's no branch of the tree that's not contained in one of your trees. So you can define it in terms of trees. That's where the a sub t comes from. It looks like the almost disjointness number, but with trees. Okay. It also turns out it's the minimum. It also turns out it's the minimum cardinality of a partition of the real line into closed sets or compact sets or F sigma sets. All of these turn out to be equivalent. They're the same number. They're the same spectrum. And the Borel partition spectrum, or sorry, the closed partition spectrum is just the Borel spectrum from AT onward. Okay, why is that so good? Well, that's so good because we've spent a lot of time and effort figuring out what we can say about the Borel partition spectrum and what we can't say. Say, you know, because of consistency results, we know we can't say about it. And so now, pretty much all of that applies to the closed partition spectrum as well. We know this must be true. We already knew this must be true because singletons are closed, but okay, fine. We know it's true anyway. We know it must be closed under singular limits, right? Because it's just a final segment of a set of cardinals that closed under singular limits. Assuming zero dagger does not exist, we know that this is true, right? If you have a cardinal in the closed True, right? If you have a cardinal in the closed partition spectrum of countable co-finality, then its successor must be in there too. Notice the thing about Aleph 1 is missing, right? So, Aleph 1 must be in the Borel partition spectrum. It's consistent that it's not in the closed partition spectrum. I guess I'd attribute that to Scherpinski. He didn't really phrase it that way, but that Olive 1 doesn't need to be in the closed partition spectrum. Because his proof from 1918 shows that really you can't have a Really, you can't have a partition into more than covering the number of the meager ideal many sets. And it's proved pretty early on in the days of forcing that that number can be big. So we'll say that's Cherpinsky's theorem, that you don't have to have Olaf 1 in there. So using forcing, we can make the closed partition spectrum look however we like. Okay, now I want to bring you back just in your brains, not on the slides, because I don't want to do that much clicking. But remember that post set that I. But remember that post set that I showed you that we were using to build these partitions? What it was really adding were these F sigma subsets of the real line, right? So we started out with maybe a ton of singletons, then we tacked on some F sigmas, and we got our partitions that way. Now, I mentioned how the closed spectrum and the F sigma spectrum, you could call it, are really, they're provably identical, right? So, what this means is that our forcing argument actually shows us how to build partitions of any given size of closed sets. And what's more, I talked about how. And what's more, I talked about how the length of the iteration doesn't really matter, right? The length of the iteration just needs to be any cardinal of uncountable cofinality. It turns out when you do this, that cardinal of uncountable cofinality ends up being AT. You can't give it countable cofinality, however, because then at the limit stage, if you try to do an iteration of countable cofinality, you're going to end up with all these extra reals that never got put into any partition element, right? So we need the uncountable cofinality to make sure that we capture everything. To make sure that we capture everything in our partition. So, using forcing, what can we do? Well, pretty much all of the arbitrariness that we could build into the Borel partition spectrum, we could do the same for the closed partition spectrum, minus even the requirement about having Olif1 in there. However, we need to add in this extra requirement. I only know how to do it making this A sub T have uncountable co-finality. If you want that to have countable cofinality, I don't know. Good luck. All right. So this brings me. All right. So, this brings me to my last slide. So, my last slide contains three questions. The first one is probably obvious, right? This question is sort of just beneath the surface throughout all of the talk. Is it consistent relative to some large cardinal axiom that you can have, say, aleph omega in the spectrum and aleph omega plus one not in the spectrum? I don't, I phrased it this way. I don't really stick on the aleph omega. If you could get any cardinal of singularity, of co-finality omega. Of cofinality omega in there and it's success or not, I would be very, very interested to see that. I honestly don't know which way this is going to go. On the one hand, it seems plausible to me that there's a forcing construction I just haven't been able to think of yet, where starting with some cool combinatorics given to you by some large cardinal axiom, you can force this situation to happen. Maybe that's true. Or it might also be true that this is the sort of situation where something interesting happens at a singular cardinal that you can prove. Singular cardinal that you can prove using something like, you know, zero sharp doesn't exist or zero dagger doesn't exist, or maybe there's a more sophisticated argument that proves it outright. Some maybe PCF theory is involved. I honestly don't know. If it is involved, I would be likely not to see it. So that's the only reason I'm suggesting it. But anyway, I decided before coming here that I am pretty much stuck on this question. I have worked on it. I've tried to figure out how to do that forcing construction. Figure out how to do that forcing construction from all sorts of different large cardinal hypotheses, and I can't seem to make it work. So I've thought, okay, it feels like the right move anyway. I'm going to say that anyone who, by the end of this conference, has any ideas that seem like they might lead to a viable answer, we don't have to have all the details worked out before we leave, but if you think you have an idea for how to solve this thing, then the prize will be a bottle of Mezcal. So, yeah. In fact, all three of these questions. Yeah. In fact, all three of these questions, it's the same offer. So these are all questions that I feel stuck on and I don't know how to proceed. If you think you know how to do it and you can convince me that maybe you're right, then you can have a bottle of Mezcal. One bottle for each one? Yeah, you think you're going to solve two of them? Or all three? I'd be very happy to buy you three bottles of Mezcal if that's the case. Yeah, it would be well worth it. All right. Here's the second question. Is it consistent for A sub T to F cofinality omega? Now, I am aware of your. Now, I am aware of York's paper, maybe some of the rest of you are too, where he shows that A can have co-finality omega. And so, my first thought in attacking this question was, of course, to try to dig into that paper and see to what extent did the techniques there carry over to the AT world. And the problem with it is, it's a vague sort of way to phrase the problem, but I'll do my best anyway. So the problem with this idea seems to be that it's a lot easier to force almost disjoint families than it is to force these partitions. Families than it is to force these partitions. So, as I indicated earlier, to force a partition into Olif omega closed sets, right, we can do it, but I can only do it with some sort of iterative procedure. I can't force it using finite conditions all in one go, for example. With almost disjoint families, you can force the existence of an almost disjoint family of a given size using finite conditions all in one go. And that seems pretty important to my understanding of your proof, anyway. And so it Your proof, anyway. And so it doesn't seem to me like those techniques carry over, at least not in a straightforward way. No, I don't I don't think it's not straightforward. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that because it's certainly yes, that's true. Yes, there are two powerful carbons which are small independent, but which are consistently below covering the quarter. Yes, you're right. It is above T. Okay. I mean, maybe a very certainly not a smaller one. Maybe a glass. Maybe a glass of Mescalth confirming my suspicions about the problem. It seemed to me for a little while that some kind of diagonalization argument could maybe, I don't know. For a little while, I was convinced that it just can't have cofinal omega, and that's a theorem of ZFC, but I'm no longer really convinced of that. Or if it is true, I don't see how to do it. In a similar problem, it's similar. Yes, very similar. Also, you can't get these independent families with, at least there's no known way to get them with finite conditions. No known way to get them with finite conditions, right? You sort of have to iterate to force independent families of a given size. Yeah. And actually, interestingly enough, there is a theorem. Well, okay, so there's been a lot of work done on the MAD spectrum. So instead of the Borel partition spectrum, you have the MAD spectrum, the set of all sizes of MAD families. And I think Cella and Spinus have written sort of the definitive paper on this. And for that question, you can have, without any large cardinals or anything like that, you can have, say, Oliphant. Cardinals or anything like that. You can have, say, all of omega in the spectrum and all of omega plus one not in the spectrum. So, this result about getting the successor automatically if the universe is close enough to L or whatever, it doesn't work in that context. But again, at the crux of the proof seems to be this forcing with finite conditions mad families of various sizes. And so, without those finite conditions, something certainly goes wrong with that sort of proof. And it provably does not directly lift to this context. Yeah, similar problems here. Yeah, similar problems here. Okay, the third question is not related to anything that I've talked about, but it is related to this kind of stuff. And it's a very interesting question, and I would love to see it solved. So basically, what happens with G delta sets, right? So I mentioned that if you look at compact or closed or F sigma, you get the same partition spectrum no matter what, right? For G delta, you get provably or consistently, it's provable that you can consistently. It's provable that you can consistently get a different spectrum. That's what I meant to say. All right. So the G-delta spectrum doesn't need to include all of one, so it can be different from the Borel partition spectrum, for example. I mentioned earlier this result of Fremlin and Shelley. They showed you cannot have a partition of the real line the fewer than covering number of the meager ideal G delta sets. So, okay, it's different from the Borel spectrum, at least consistently. It's different from the closed spectrum, at least consistency, consistently. This is a result due to Arnie Miller proved with the Proved with the invention of this thing called Miller partition forcing, if you're familiar with that. Oops. Hold on. I'm not ready to thank you for listening. Yeah. There we go. But what the Shella-Fremlin paper leaves open is whether there's always a partition of the real line into covering number of the Meagher ideal many G-delta sets. So if the covering number of the Meg ideal is Aleph 1, then the answer is yes and kind of obviously yes. So here's the proof. We don't even need to write anything down. It's that easy. We don't even need to write anything down. It's that easy. If you can cover the real line with all of one meager sets, then, okay, you know, expand them all to meager f sigmas, break them apart into meager closed sets. You can cover the real line with all of one closed nowhere dense sets. What do you do? You line them up in order type omega one, and you partitionify, right? Take each one, remove the things before it. You have a closed set minus countably many closed sets. It's G delta. And you get all of one distinct things. Maybe you get lots of copies of the empty set along the way, but because... Copies of the empty set along the way, but because they're all meager, you can't cover the real line by any initial stage. So you do get all of one, you know, actual things in this partition. And so that's that's pretty easy. And that proof completely breaks down as soon as you go beyond omega one, right? If you try to line things up in order type omega two, then of course you might have problems removing more than countably many closed sets. Who says you get a G delta? So anyway, this question just seems really tricky. And I think it's a very interesting question. What is the minimum size of the partition of the reels into uncountably many G delta? Of the reels into uncountably many G deltas. Now, thank you for listening. Well, thank you, Will. Any comments, questions, solutions? You didn't solve it already, did you? So when you wrote the Miller forcing You said that you use a mixed iteration. Can you tell us a little about that and why you don't just use a finite support iteration? Right. So where the product comes to me is so proper. So the product comes in in two different ways. So first of all, if your set of cardinals C is more than just one cardinal, then what you want is you want to be adding lots of partitions simultaneously. So let's say Partitions simultaneously. So let's say our iteration has length omega one, just for concreteness sake. Well, if I want a partition of size all of three, then I need to start with maybe all of three singletons and then flesh that out into a partition. But I also, if I, let's say I also want a partition of size all of five, well, then parallel to that, I'm going to start with the size all of five, maybe, you know, group of singletons and turn that into a partition. I want to do these simultaneously, not say one after another in a longer iteration. One after another in a longer iteration, simply because I need my postset to be very, very, very well behaved. So, this has to do with the way that cardinals are excluded from the spectrum. So, if I'd like to exclude Olive 2, for example, it's this isomorphism of names argument. Like I said, I'm not really talking much about that. But in order to make that kind of argument work, what you need is a postset with lots and lots and lots of automorphisms. And so doing things side by side like that seems to give me more control over that sort of thing. To give me more control over that sort of thing. And actually, Vera's innovation, the way that we were able to get rid of the countability, was by using not just adding one partition for each cardinal side by side in a long iteration, but adding loads of them. So it turns out if you add, you know, whatever max C is, for example, just add Max C many different partitions of size Olive 2, somehow that makes your Postat much more automorphism-rich and it allows you to do away with only having countably many things in your spectrum. But doing all of these things. Uh, but doing all of these things simultaneously and only iterating out to a certain length is basically just so that my postset looks very nice and I'm able to mix it up in all the ways that I need to be able to mix it up. Okay, could you please put the last slide on? The question slide? Some idea for the first bottle of mascot. Excellent. So I think what could work comes from some technology that we have discovered for successors of singular cardinals. Successors of singular cardinals, you start with a supercompact kappa which has been prepared for laborized. Okay, okay. So now you are going and then you make it so that this kappa is in the spectrum of the borel, which I think might be automatic. But let's say it is there. Now you iterate doing two things at the same time. You make sure that kappa plus is not in the spectrum of Is not in the spectrum of the borel. And you, at every step, diagonalize a, you have this Kappa supercompact, so you have a measure on it. So you diagonalize this measure by one set. So you add one set, destroys that measure. Now you do this cofinally many times in, you know, you do this some large number of times. Now you take these sets that you have used as diagonalizations, they actually generate. Diagonalizations, they actually generate an ultrafilter, a measure on this. But this measure has a very nice property that when you're now going to do prickly forcing using this measure, what happens in the prickly extension is controlled by what happened before. Because somehow this prickly extension is sort of almost like a union of the prickly extensions that you would have had with those filters that you have destroyed. Okay, so prickly extensions. Okay, so prickery extensions, though. That makes me think that kappa is still a measurable cardinal after the first. Yes, but we haven't finished yet. Okay, okay. Okay, because it needs to be below the continuum. No, that's because we are. No, but look. Okay, so let me finish my scenario. Yes, I think you're right. Maybe that's a problem. But the scenario is now to make this kappa to be of cofinality omega. Yeah, tricky forcing. Okay, how you dealing? Okay, how you deal with the continuum? I don't know, you might need to add at the same time kappa many quarters or something. Yeah, but then the property that kappa plus wasn't in the spectrum would be preserved. Why would it be preserved? Because of the way you've arranged it in idea. Okay, so this is not a this is not a bot of mass calm. But it could turn into. Okay, I just wanted to tell you about this. Yeah, well, that's that's your comment about the continuum is also something that is difficult with the sector. So your closed sets, let me go back. So you were willing to drop out the rationals and, of course, partition bear space. And of course, partition bare space. So, but that the reason you could do that is because you're not interested in the structure of your closed sets, and they're all wildly generic. So, I'm wondering how wildly generic they are. So, if you think about this exercise in transfinite induction, which says you can take three-dimensional space and partition it into unit circles, can you do that with less than continuum many or more generally? Less than continuum many circles? Yes. No, because each one meets a line and only Each one meets a line and only at most two points. Right. Okay, but good. All right. But I was going to ask more generally. I mean, can you say something about some small family of closed sets that you will use, let's say, shifts of or something to partition? Or is this always going to be the case? Yeah, that's a good question. I think I see what you're getting at, and I have tried to think about it, but I think I'm not sure. But I think I'm not sure. So, when I add, let's say I do a length kappa iteration to add these closed sets, right? And I start with some number of singletons in the background. I do a length kappa iteration. Even if I'm not explicitly adding a partition of size kappa, I'm going to end up with one anyway. So in the extension, those kappa sets that I'm adding to my initial family of singletons or family of disjoint Borel sets, it's going to end up sort of accidentally giving you partitions of size kappa. Accidentally giving you partitions of size kappa. That's, I think, all I can say in that direction. So these generic sets do end up tracing down onto certain well-chosen copies of the bear space within the real line. They end up tracing down to partitions there too. Uh-huh. Okay. So they're not quite, I mean, they're obviously not isometric or anything like that. They're going to be, yeah. Right. Yeah, they're kind of all over the place. Yeah, they're kind of all over the place. I mean, when that tree is generically growing, it kind of, you know. So, without, yeah, but without that tree, there's nothing. The point is that you're adding more generic partition elements to the partition than you actually set out to do, is what you're saying. Yes, I think, yeah. Any more questions or comments? You may have said this, but what is the complexity of the sets you get in the main result? With the forcing? With the forcing, yes. F sigma. F sigma, okay. So basically for F sigma, the spectrum is the same as for Borel. In my forcing extensions, yes. So for F sigma, the spectrum is the same as Borel past a certain point. Sporrel past a certain point, right? This AT cardinal. So the closed spectrum and the F sigma spectrum is the same. So, you know, it's once I realized that, I wasn't too disappointed about, you know, only being able to force them to be the same. It would be an interesting thing, though, to be able to get sort of a simultaneous arbitrariness in the two spectrums. So, what I don't know how to do, but I think it would be very interesting, is to force sort of an arbitrary constellation. Sort of an arbitrary constellation of you have some weird-looking set of cardinals that are in your Borel spectrum, and then AT is up here, and then you have some weird set of cardinals after that. Currently, all I know how to do is get two cardinals, Aleph One and some arbitrary cardinal that I can choose, that are in the Braille spectrum but not the closed spectrum. That's a good question. I think F sigma delta. Yeah. Sigma delta. Yeah. And essentially the way you do it is you just, so all of one you get for free. And so if you force Martin's axiom to be the second cardinal you want, or if you force Martin's axiom plus the continuum is the second cardinal you want, you can prepare a indestructible, sort of like a CCC indestructible partition, where when you do, you know, then you make the closed spectrum as arbitrary as you like using that theorem, you still get a F sigma delta partition of that size. But yeah, it would be very nice to know that the Berelt spectrum can look very weird below AT and still ATV big. I don't know how to do that. Okay, no, thanks. Thanks. Anybody else? So let's have coffee. We have 10 minutes for a coffee break. So let's make a 20-minute coffee break and we'll start at 11.10.
