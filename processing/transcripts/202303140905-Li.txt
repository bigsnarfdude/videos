Today I'll be sharing with you about some new discoveries on K-rings of matroids. So first I want to express some thanks for all of you to be here. And another thing I want to say is thanks for all of your work. During the past few years, I pivoted towards Metroid during the pandemic and all of your work really, really brought me one of the greatest joy. Brought me one of the greatest joy during the real time of isolation. So, yeah, it's a great pleasure to see you in this finale. So, this is going to be a joint work with Matt Larson, Sam Dane, and Nick Profit, all of whom are all here. And the archive is listed here. So, since this is early in the This is early in the morning, so if you feel like you want to take a slow or something, let me just briefly summarize what we're talking about. So, recall that yesterday Chris told us that there is this isomorphism between the pairing of the prometheohedral variety to the charing of prometheohedral variety. And it turns out that we can actually generalize this to arbitrary choice. So, this is the story that I will be telling. That would be tough. But let's back up for just a little bit and look at a more general assembly of varieties. So, if you have a smooth projective variety over your favorite fuel K, it might carry something like a vector bundle. So, in my head, I have this doodle on the left. And you can form something called Grotendek group of the vector bundles on your variety X. On your variety X. It is generated by isomorphism classes of vector bundles. And you model by the relations the class of F minus the class of E minus the class of G, whenever the vector bundles F, E, and G are forming short exact sequences like this. And so now we want to turn this into a ring. So what we can do is we can set the structure. We can do is we can set the structure sheaf or the class of the structure sheaf as our multiplicative identity. And we can also give it some multiplicative rule by taking the product of two classes to be the class of the tensor product. And you can check that because tensor product, taking tensor product, preserves exact sequences. So the relation originally that you did Originally, that you did in the free abelian group definition is fine. So this gives you Groton-D K-rings of vector bundles, but alternatively, you can also look at the object that's called K-rings of coherent shapes on ice, which is given by this very similar definition, but a very But a very classical theorem by Hilbert, that's called Suzy G's theorem, basically implies that the smoothness condition that we imposed upon x at the beginning tells us that the Groton-Decay ring of vector bundles and the Groton-Decay ring of coherent sheaves coincide. So we'll just denote both of these things as A of X. And in the talk, I might be saying a coherent shape as an A coherent shape as an element of my k-way, and sometimes I might say a vector bundle as an element of my k-way. Sorry, I was just gonna tell, oh, it used not to focus on the sites. It isn't. The camera we used for some time ago was just focusing on you and not the sides. But it seems low. Okay. So so this is. So, this is somewhat of a mysterious object, and in fact, people have been interested in it. So, three people, Hitzper and Riemann and Rock, was thinking about this object and came up with a very beautiful theory on it. So basically, what they declared is that there exists an isomorphism between these two structures after you tensor with Q coefficients. And this isomorphism is exactly given by the term. Is exactly given by the turn character. So let me just recall for you what the turn character does. So basically, the line bundles, so it takes a line bundle to the exponentiation of that line bundle, of the first turn class of that line bundle. So what you get is this formal sum of first turn class raised to various powers divided by that power factor. So, recall that we would like to go from the K-ring to our coefficient ring to get some invariant of our sheaves. So, for example, if you have your vector bundle or coherent sheaf, you can take something called the Euler characteristic. And that's defined to be the alternating sum of the dimensions of the sheaf cohomology. And on the right-hand side, And on the right-hand side, yesterday we also have seen many, many times that there exists a degree map from the Chao ring of your variety to the coefficient ring Q given by push forward to a point. So the content of Purtzburg-Riemann Rock says more. It says that if you want to compute the Euler characteristic of your favorite vector bundle, it's Vector bundle. It's usually hard to compute, but alternatively, what you can do is you can send it over to the Chao land, Chao-Ringland, via this churn character and compute its intersection number with this tog class, which is defined to be the top class of the tangent bundle of this variety. Okay, so this is sort of general for smooth projective varieties. For smooth projective varieties, let's just take a look at our favorite example maybe T2, or at least my favorite example. I don't know about you. So let's see how this works. So let me just directly declare that the K ring of P2 is exactly this ring. So it's generated by O of 1 and modulo the relation that when you tensor the That when you tensor the structure sheet of a generic or hyperplane, three times you get zero. So that's the only relation that I have in this K-ring. And on the Chowring side, I have one generator, which is given by a generic hyperplane, and that hyperplane intersected itself three times, also vanishes. So that's also the only relation that I have. And so what does the churn character do? So the churn character will want to take the generator O1 to the other side. Generator O1 to the other side to 1 plus the first string class of O1 plus the first string class of O1 squared divided by 2. So how does this commuting diagram work? So if you take, it's enough to see monomials. So the Euler characteristic of a tensor power of your O1 turns out to be a binomial coefficient. Turns out to be a binomial coefficient n plus 1, which is 2. Or I can write it like this. And Chris also reminded us that this is some lattice point counting in this m dilation of the convex hull generated on E1, E2, and E3. Space of dimension 3. And so the commuting of the diagram is given by now. The diagram is given by now computing the degree of first the churn character of our tensor power of O1 and then intersecting with the tot class which I have given you on the right hand side and you can check that indeed these two identities are equal and let me just remark that if you don't intersect with the right hand side what you get is sort of a normalized or down normalized Normalized or down-normalized volume of the same complex body. So it's sort of intuitively that true that, like, when you count the lattice point, more often than not, you're not going to coincide with that volume. But to make this directly, you can adjust that volume on the right-hand side by intersecting with something else. But also, as Chris said, in general, so this. Chris said, in general, so this red bracket is pointing out that this top class here is sort of simple, but in general, it's kind of hard. And of course, also work. But even though it's hard when we can look at our favorite varieties, and for example, Permuto Hedra variety, so it is going to be the torque variety associated with the Permuto Hedra. Associated with the permuted hedon. So in n equals to 3, I have drawn it on the right-hand side. So let's recall a little bit of the construction. So we have a permuted hedge variety given by inverted blow-offs of p to the n minus 1. And the pi denotes the blow-off map. And I also have yesterday a linear space living inside K to the E, realizing. Realizing whatever matrix, and then I can suck the projectivization of this linear space into P to the M. When I look at what goes into the corner of this diagram, it exactly gives me the wonderful variety of L. So why am I talking about this? Just to recall for you yesterday what we learned from this paper BST. This paper BST is that for Permudo-Hetrib variety, there exists a replacement of the isomorphism data that sends the structure sheaf of this wonderful variety to the class of the wonderful variety or the class of the Bergman band of the matriarch, if you want to think about your chau ray as elements whose elements are sub-bands of the Kermi matrix. So in order to make this diagram commute, we can also use our new replacement of the churn character, but we will need to replace the top class with something else. And what is that something else? So in the construction of my wonderful variety, I have this p to the n minus 1 on the left-hand corner, lower left corner, and that thing has a vector as a line bundle. Vector as a line bundle O1, which I can pull back via this pi. So I get pi, I have a vector bundle now on my permuted hedge variety, and I take the first chunk class. So that will be the alpha. And that will be denoted as my alpha, and I intersect the image of whatever vector bundle that I have with this polynomial in terms of alpha and take the degree. And the result will make this. And the result will make this diagram connected. So, so far we have been sort of recalling. So, the burning questions after learning about all these is what about the carings of the wonderful variety? And in fact, this is sort of what brought my collaborators and I together. We were curious whether we can think about. Whether we can think about the carrying of these varieties that haven't been thought about. And also, we want to see if it depends on the underlying nature solely, or does it depend on the realization? But from experience, we expect that it doesn't. And then the third thing is, can we even be greedier? Can we even prove a Husburg-Rimer-Rock type of theorem for arbitrary matrix? And so the goal of this talk is to give affirmative answers to all of these. Answers to all of these. But in order to give performative answers to all of these, let me just say a slightly different definition of the wonderful variety, which I think Chris also mentioned, but let me just say it out loud. So not only it can be constructed via what we have seen as a convenient diagram, we can see it as the wonderful compactification of a hyperplane arrangement complement in a single projective space. In a single projective space. It was given in 1995 by Decontrini and Purchase. So here is a little cartoon that I have. So on the right-hand side, I have two spaces. On the lower, downstairs, I have a hyperplane arrangement. And the hyperplane arrangement sort of intersect not very nicely, meaning they don't have something called simple normal crossings. So I would like to modify the boundary of the complement. Of the complement, hyperplane arrangement complement by blowing up sort of excessive intersections. That's sort of a cartoon image. But the first question that came into mind when we started studying this is that so this wonderful variety actually does not afford a tortoise action to make it into a GKM-ish variety, which will which was the main. Which was the main setup or one advantage in the VST paper, where in which enables them to do the torso equivariant localization techniques. So here for wonderful varieties in general, we don't have that technique. So that's like one of the main first hurdles that we encounter. So what can we do? Sorry, what do you think? M is oh, in very suddenly I forgot their name. So it basically says your variety of torus action and you have finite torus fixed points and the yeah you have one-dimensional one torus invariant torus over closures connecting so in varieties like this you can apply torus equivariant localizations to study with K-theory. K-Series. BSE is one main witness of that kind of technique. Another one is maybe among others, like Finks-Beyer's paper on KF covariant localization. Okay. So maybe I'll pause for other questions as well. Alright, so it seems like our favorite setting is not available. So we really need to get into the details of the geometry of this wonderful variety. So let's do that. Let me give you a slightly different but equivalent definition of this. So, and then on the right-hand side, I'll do a running example, which is the example that provided that cartoon that I drew at the beginning. So, first, let's start with the vector space. So, first, let's start with the vector space over configuring field k. So, here, on the example, I take L to be K to the third. And, okay, now let me provide you a hyperplane arrangement denoted by curly A. And it's a finite set of hyperplanes living inside of my L, intersecting exactly at the origin. And I will call the indexing set E. So, here on the right-hand side, the So here on the right hand side, the projectivization, I will draw the projectivized version. So the projectivization of a three-dimensional space is a P2, and the indexing set will be the number one through four, and the hyperplanes are indexed by one through four, and they lie down in my plane exactly like that. So for each subset of the ground set E, I would like to look at the intersections. I would like to look at the intersections of the hyperplanes indexed by elements in S. And then I will call the rank of this subset the dimension of the quotient space of my total space modeled by the intersection space. And a subset of my ground set is a flat if it's maximal among its rings, on its ring. On its red. So let's not worry. Let's do this very slowly. Let's look at the picture on the right-hand side. So intersection of the line 1 and 4 has dimension 0. So I model that 0-dimensional space by my total 2-dimensional space. I get exactly two-dimensional. So that means the set 1, 4 has rank. The set 1, 4 has rank 2. And then, if you try to give it another element, that will increase its rank. So, indeed, 1, 4 is maximal amounts rank. So, 1, 4 is in fact a flag. And so, you do the same game. In particular, you can try like 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, and then it's rank 2 elements instead of a rank 3. And then I have denoted for you the flats that showed up in the hyperplane arrangement. I also put them into a lattice of flats, which are probably more familiar to you. And if you like graphical matrix, here this is actually a realization of this graph that I sometimes call spectral. Cost of batch or martini, depending on what you like. Okay, so now this plane, P of L, I can map it to this very big product of projective spaces where each factor is the projectivization of the quotient space L mod the intersection L associated with that flat. For every single non-empty. For every single non-empty flight. And this is a rational map because you can see that it's not defined on those intersection spaces. And now we can say that our wonderful variety WA is exactly the closure of the image of this map, taking L of E L. So equivalently, as I said, what does this taking closure do? Picking closure do, it actually modifies the boundary of the hyperplane arrangement complements so that it becomes a simple normal crossing supervisor. So, this surgery can be alternatively done by doing iterative blow-ups of my projective space at projectivization of the LF for F of rank R minus 1, and then strict transforms of P of L F for flats of rank slightly lower. Of rank slightly lower, and you terminate this process when you hit rank one after your rank one process. So this is the doodle that you get after you try to blow up the zero-dimensional flats, namely the rank two flats. Can I ask a question about that? I'm having a tiny bit of trouble remembering all of the notation. Is the picture on the bottom that has like a script? Like a scripty A pointing to it. Is that the same thing as PL? Or is PL shown in this picture? PL is the plane. Okay, PL plane. Yeah, parallelogram. Yeah, and then A, squared D, A, is the hyperplane arrangement. So the data of the four lines and the data of their intersection. Map with the arrow, is that just like the idea? Like the friction, the identity map first. The map, the vertical. Okay, so the arrow is the iterative blow-up map. Oh, I meant the dotted arrow at the top. That's just yes. So that's putting your PL into those factors. I had a similar question. So when you put a dotted line, it means that that map is not defect everywhere. Yes. So in particular, it's not defined in those uh projectivizations of the linear spaces. Oh, for the optimization of the building of spaces. Does the dots mean that it's like defined almost everywhere, or is it just a limitation of what it does? It means that it's a rational map. Okay, so by definition, we see that this wonderful variety sits inside of this product, so let's call this inclusion I. Let's call this inclusion I. And what we want to do in our proof is that we really, really want to anchor the geometry of the wonderful variety using this inclusion, using the geometry of this big product. So here is how we first, here's how we proceed. So when you have an inclusion map like this, you can think about the relations on the relationship between the carings of these two varieties and the chowring of these two varieties. And the chowring of these two varieties. So the inclusion map actually induced a chowring map and the K-ring map, like this, that's called ISDAR for reusable completion. So now, if we can really understand what these four objects are, maybe we can cook up some sort of maps for the downstairs objects and hopefully prove that that's an isopropyl. But we don't know how we do that yet. But let's try to understand these objects. Understand these objects, and then we will come up with something. So, the first thing that we can think of is that for every non-empty flat, I get a projective space. Let's start from their projective spaces are their chow rings and k rings are better understood. I even gave you an example before, so let's take a look. And in fact, we can define this ring isomorphism that's slightly different from the turn character. In particular, it sends the structure. It sends the class of the structure sheaf of a generic hyperplane to the class of the hyperplane. And in fact, you can check that for any arbitrary element inside of your k-ring, when you take the Euler characteristic, you in fact just get the degree of this new zeta map intersected with the polynomial in terms of generic character. This is really correct because I mean the hyperplane cube is zero, but the structure shift cubed is not zero. One minus structure shift cubed is zero. Sorry, can you repeat? So the relation in the case here is that one minus the class of OH, Q, or to the n 0, n is dimension, or dimension project space. 1 minus that n q 1 minus that n cubed is 0. It's 1 minus 0 minus 1. Which cubed is 0. So are you sub h of the structure sheet rather than the yeah, so it's 1 minus 2. Yeah, it's the same. Yeah, sense. Sorry. Okay. Happy with that. Alright, so we agree that this on a single projective space, this is fine. And this actually gives us hope, like we can do this on a single space. us hope like we can do this on a single projective space and we can now maybe connect the dots in this picture. And the first step further we want to take is that because these projective vectors are all smooth and projective, so we can use the Kuhnett formula and say that the towering of the product is just generated by the hyperflames given by each factor divided by their own relations. And on the pairing side, we have a similar theorem because each factor Similar theorem because each factor is also smoothed and projective by a paper by Anderson and Ping from 2013 that there is also a Klinus formula on the K-ring, and the K-ring now looks like this, the K-ring of the planet. Okay, so now from the off-stair objects now have a map between them, going from the left to the right, by simply taking the tensor product of all of the zeta maps of each factor. Of each factor. And what does this map do? It simply takes any linear combinations of the structure sheet of hyperplanes to the linear combinations of the generic hyperplanes. Okay, so now let's go downstairs. We really want to understand these two objects, but actually we have a better grasp on the right-hand side, the charing of wonderful variety, and I'm sure a lot of you. Bridget, and I'm sure a lot of you have heard a lot about this. So, let me just recall for you. In 2004, so Flagner Yuspinski gave a presentation on this thing, on the chattering of a wonderful variety. It's generated by symbols associated with flats, modeled by these relations. So, whenever you have two flats that are incomparable, their symbols multiply together to be zero. And you also mult out by the linear. Modeled out by the linear combinations of all the flats that contain an atom in the lattice of flats. Okay, and then just maybe also recall, we have a Chow equivalence between the Wonderful variety and the Tori variety of the Berkman fan proved by Eti Pro Signal and Katz in 2018. So in what we want to do next, I want to introduce you, or maybe a lot of you are very familiar with, this sort of very interesting presentation of the Chiao Ring. It's called the Simplicial Presentation, introduced by Backman Spencer, Chris, and Connor. I was told that whenever I know the authors, I should call. I know the authors, I should call them their first names. Do you want the wedge? Oh, do I want the wedge? HF wedge. Yes, so the wedge will mean the smallest flat that contains both of them. So do you want HF wedge G? The wedging is defined on the flats. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, just. Sorry, I'm very slow. What's going on? Where it says HF join H T, yes, yes, yes, you're totally right. Sorry. Okay. Do people get that? So this should be H of F G. Where Y means you take the smallest flat of, that contains F and G. So you mulled out by this relation. Let me just remark that I think in their paper the relations are written slightly differently. They involve some modeous functions. So this is a rewriting that occurred in our paper. Like while we were doing this, they only realized we should rewrite it like this. Okay, so I just want to emphasize this very beautiful presentation, and it'll be a huge benefit to us for the following reasons. So the first offshot is that The first offshot is that recall that our wonderful variety sits inside of this big product, and this big product emits projections to each one of its factors. Let's call the projection map pi of f for a factor f. And on the right-hand side, that projective space carries O1, and I can pull that back all the way back to my wonderful variety, and I will denote that line model as LOF. Flying model as LOF. Why is that helpful? Turns out the symploid generators that's provided by the group of bossers turns out to be the first turn class of this pullbackable one. So this really has a geometric. Okay, I always forget this official presentation as soon as I learn it. So this is telling me, yeah, this is telling me that the generators are given by, like, they correspond to. By like they correspond to hyperplanes, the most generic hyperplane you can think of that passes through LF. Is that what it's telling me? Okay. Yeah, exactly. That's actually involved in randomizations. Okay, so the second option for us is that the intersection theory of these simplio generators are extremely elegant. So here's the statement for their intersections. So suppose we have a multi-set of flats. By that I mean Set of flats. By that I mean I allow repetitions indexed by subscripts 1 through r minus 1. I really need r minus 1 of them to get the right dimension, but I'm allowed to repeat them. So the degree of these simplotial generators correspond to these flats are either 1 or 0. It's 1 if for every index set of the subset 1 through r minus 1, pick your favorite indexing set. Pick your favorite indexing set, and when you evaluate the rank of the union of all the flats picked out by this indexing set, if that's greater or equal to the cardinality of your indexing set plus one, then you're good. You get intersection over one. So that condition, yeah, I'll say something. And otherwise you get zero. So this condition is called Dragonhall Radel in the paper, Possum Cove 2019 paper. Call that 2019 paper, 2009 paper. Okay, so the third option for us is that not only does it tell us what the generators of these child rings are, but also it tells us that if we try to map the generators off stairs from the product of protective spaces just directly to their simplicial generators associated to the same. Generators associated to the same flat. This map is surjective, and the kernel is the annihilator of the classical wonderful variety. The fact about the kernel being this is true, but not very obvious. Okay, so now we know what the right-hand side does. It's given by this map, and it's surjective. And we know exactly what the kernel will do. So now let's. Little bit. So now let's study the left-hand side. So the left-hand side is a bit mysterious to us at the time. Let me just say a few words about how we, there are a lot of technical details, but basically broken down into three pieces. So we really need the condition that the charing of the wonderful variety is torture-free, which I think is proven by AHK in 2018. In 2018. And then we also proved in our paper, we wanted that this pairing of the wonderful variety is generated by long-term line models. And once we have that, we use some point-grade duality to show that indeed this left vertical map is surjective with the kernel that looks extremely like the kernel on the right-hand side, which is the annihilator of the class of the structure sheet of the 104. Where did that vertical map on the left come from? So it is mapping the structure sheaf of a hyperplane arrangement to the sort of the structure sheaf of the vanishing loci of a generic section of the LF. So you can think of this as like the structure sheaf of HF. That's how I think about it. You don't get to choose the vertical graphs. Don't get to choose the vertical maps, right? The vertical maps are induced by the equation. This is a description. It's just an explicit description of the whole map. Okay, okay. Thanks. I'm sorry, this is a stupid question. What did you mean by torsion for the whole? So as a billing group, it's a torsion for your billing group. As for It is true that it is. Why was that something that we did? That's not the case. But it is the charger, but it's the charging of the truth, right? It's not true. Like, take uh the cone over a uh of our con uh over a quadratic surface and remove the tub point. Class group is torsion, class group is of change. Modularized space of genus. Are you all happy with this so far? Great. Okay, so what have we learned so far? We have an explicit description on the maps on both sides. We know what the map on the upstairs is. We also know the kernels of those vertical maps. Then we know that this upstairs map will descend if Will descend if it sends the annihilator of the structure shape in the wonderful writing to the annihilator of the structure shape of the class of the wonderful writing because it takes kernel to kernel. Two vertical maps are all vertical, are subjective. And once the upstairs map takes kernel to kernel, we can let the upstairs map descend. So it descended. So it descended. And the map has an explicit description which takes 1 minus the dual of this LF map to the first-run, the class of the first turn class of this line bundle, which is our symposium generator HF. And that will be the isomorphism that we exhibit for our wonderful, arbitrary wonderful variety. So it'll send the charge. The structure sheet of vanishing looks like any generic session of my LF to the first-turn class of my LF. And because we have proved that on the upstairs map, the Euler characteristics satisfy this equation, so that equation also designs. And then the offshore replacement of the top class, after you got your maps, you realize that that replacement becomes one class. That replacement becomes 1 plus HE plus HE squared plus all the way to HE, R minus 1. So He is the first term class corresponding to the line bundle of the ground set vector. Okay, so let me just remark three things. So, first is that you might have recalled that in the permutahedral case, the replacement was given by a similar polynomial, but with HE replaced by. But with HE replaced by alpha. But here our HE is actually minus alpha. And then the second thing is that it extends to augmented case and also torque variety associated with the birdman of the matrix. And then the third thing is that we generalize the BST paper to arbitrary matroid. So in the BST paper. The BSP paper, we had a torque variety associated to the Boolean Matroid. And we also generalized this paper by Chris, June, and Ahmad on the stellar heater variety, which is also Boolean arrangement before augmented. Both HE and alpha are left. I think HE is alpha, not minus alpha. Okay. XE is minus alpha and alpha. Okay. XE is minus alpha and HE is minus XE. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I started thinking that one when I started saying that one. Yeah, thanks. This really means the title. We're talking about pulling back to the permutahedral variety in order to compare alpha and H. These are on the alpha. Yeah, so the alpha is An element in the Chao Ring of the wonderful writing, not in the Tamil Hero writing. Oh, alpha is quotable. Oh, yeah. Hold back. Yeah, pull back. So this whole Hertzberg-Riemann-Roth type theorem can be extended to augmented wonderful variety, which is introduced by the co-authors. Authors. A group of authors to prove the Dolly models and conjecture problems. So it's a generalization of wonderful varieties, augmented general wonderful variety. And this X sub sigma m is the torque variety associated to work and matrix. We needed that to define intersectional combo. Okay, so that's the three remarks that I have for this. So let me just briefly digress a little bit and talk about my homeland of modularized space of curves. And it turned out there's a beautiful application of our theorem to that kind of objects, those objects. So you can think of something called moduli space of rational curves of n distinct marks. Of n distinct mark points. So these are nothing but just like P1s sort of glued together along some nodal points. And you want those P1s to carry n distinct points. And you also want that the underlying topological space does not have any genus. So for example, when you have three marked points, your moduli space is exactly a point. And when you have four points, your modularized space is isomorphic to P1. The moduli space is isomorphic to P1. So, this modulized space turns out to be a wonderful compatification of something called the braid arrangement component, with a condition which is that you don't blow up all the linear subspaces in the projectivization value, only blow up just enough to get a simple normal quasi supervisor. So, that's called the minimal building set. So, this is done as an example. Done as an example, in fact, Marius Vinsky's 2004 paper. So, another variation that you can do, which is another causal modularized space that turns out to be important in Grubhan-Witten theory, which was introduced by Hassan in 2003. So it's similar construction, but all the mark points now need to carry some weights, and they also need to satisfy some collision conditions. Conditions described by the weights. And turns out this is also a wonderful compactification given by some graphic matroids that you can construct using purely the weight vector information. And then this is proven to be a wonderful quantification by this group of four authors, Cavalieri, Junte, Mark Worth, and Praganathan, in 2016. So this, our theory also applies. In particular, in our paper, we said that we can extend this to arbitrary. Said that we can extend this to arbitrary building sets. So, another closing remark that I have is that we also study something called the snapper polynomial, which is the Euler characteristic of some tensor power of Line models. Because we have provided for you the tools to compute Euler characteristic arbitrary Line models, now you can do that using this isomorphism to send it to the child side and then compute the degree map. And then compute a degree map using intersection theory computed by Spencer, Chris, and Connor. So that gives you some new matroid invariant that turned out to be also valuative. And so my ending question is, I was very fascinated by this kind of behavior. So I wanted to ask what other varieties also observe this kind of phenomenon. So here are two examples. Here are two examples that I wasn't aware of until basically when we were wrapping up this project. So the first thing is Chris, Alex, Matt, and Punter did a similar thing to type B for me the hedge of variety. So these objects have their common torque controlled by delta nitroids. And the second thing is something that appeared before, which is for these delta hetro varieties that also have Varieties that also have some modular interpretations. So all the Hertzberg-Rimach type of theorems extend to these. So I'm curious if there are other tropical linear spaces that can give us this type of sort of k equivalence to tau ring. And I would also want to understand why does that happen? Why does that happen for these varieties that we love better? These varieties that we love very dearly, but not for many others. So I think I'll end there and listen to your questions. I guess it was explicit, it was implicitly going to last, but the whole story looks the aim of it. Yes. Uh, yes. Quick question. When you say this phenomenon, do you mean an isomorphism over Z rather than over Q, or do you mean more than that? Maybe the whole package. Like, there exists an isomorphism over integer coefficients such that a diagram can use helps you can use a compute.
