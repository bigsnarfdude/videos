So that's the title of the discussion session on string phenomenology. Thank you. So since we're talking about string phenomenology, the aim is to connect string theory to the real world. The string theory had started as a theory of strong interactions. It went to a unified theory of nature, then it went back with the ADA CFT. With the ADA CFT as a tool for studying strong coupling dynamics of gauge theories. So the question is, since string theory is also a framework and a tool to study various phenomena, other phenomena, is the the question is is it really this the aim, or it can be really a f a theory of fundamental forces? A theory of fundamental forces. If it is a theory of, that's the aim of string phenomenology. If it is a theory of fundamental forces, then it should describe, it should be able to describe at the same time phenomena in particle physics at short distances and in a early universe in cosmology. So, what is the general So what is the general approach and the problems to solve on this aim? We start from string theory defined in higher dimensions, 10 or 11, if we go to 20 theory. So the first thing to do is to compactify the extra dimensions. This compactification can be done geometrically, studying first the effective field theory in 10 dimensions and then compactified. 10 dimensions and then compactify it, or it can do it at the level of the conformal field theory or superconformal field theory by describing the entire degrees of freedom and work directly in four dimensions. The second issue is the problem of model stabilization. This, as we have, these are fields, scalar fields in four-dimensional. Fields, scalar fields in four dimensions that parametrize the information about the compactification manifold or the parameters. These expectation values are flat directions as long as supersymmetry is unbroken. And these massless, there are massless fields, so we have to stabilize them because otherwise they will be in. They will be in conflict, experimental conflict from long-delayed forces, etc. And also, the stabilization modeling would allow us to compute the low-energy couplings, since the couplings depend on the parameters of the compactification of these moduli fields. The third topic related to this to the moduli stabilization partly is the supersymmetry blade. Is the supersymmetry breaking? Consistent string theory requires supersymmetry, but supersymmetry has to be broken since it is not observed in nature for the moment. And the question is at what scale and how? Is it a spontaneous breaking? Is it a non-linear realization or explicit breaking? And then the fourth big topic is A big topic is to go to model building for construct models, specific models, either for particle physics or cosmology, or ultimately combine the two. So these are some of the topics that have been where there have been a lot of work starting from the early days of strength hearing until today. Another problem that I would like to mention related to connect string theory with observable world is the problem of scales. So we have a standard model of particle physics that describes the three of the four interactions at the electroweak scale. So, the first question is that this electrode scale could be nearby new physics or not, but this is part of the question that successful state models should answer. So, for instance, it could be supersymmetric extension of the saddle model or not. That's related to the unification of fundamental interactions. Then, so that's a scale of particle physics, which of course is very different from the scale of quantum gravity. Then we have a scale of which is associated with dark energy, which in the simplest case is a cosmological constant, although very small. Translate the dark energy into energy scale is a milli electron volt, much different. Much different from the electroweak scale and much lower from the Planck scale, of course. Another scale which is related to cosmology is the inflation scale, which should be somewhere here and which should describe a possible accelerated phase of our universe with a cosmological constant, which is very different from the dark galaxy today. So, and then we have, of course, the string skill the string scale, which I didn't put here in this fact. So this is related to the question of what energy strings may be observed directly. Of course, this depends mainly on the value of the string scale, which historically before 1994 it started. Before 1994, it started to be, it was believed to be the Planck scale for two reasons. First, because the string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, so it's natural to assume that its scale is related to the Planck scale. And second, because the development of string phenomenology started with a heterotic string, where Extreme where the string scale is computed in terms of the Planck scale and it is nearby without energies. After the understanding of string dualities and the connection between the virus string theories, one understood that the string scale is a parameter, is not needed to be tied to the Planck scale. So it can be anywhere in that area. In that area. And then there are physical motivations which should favor some energy regions. So it could be the heterotics scale, as I said, which is computable, it's around 10 to the 18 GV, or it could be the unification scale, the grand unification scale. Or it could be at lower energies, it could be somewhere at the intermediate. It could be somewhere at the intermediate scale related to the specimen breaking, strong CPs, CISO, maybe inflation, or at the end, at the other extreme, which could be at low energies in the multi-TV region related to the solution of the hierarchy problem. So, I'll say just a few words about the high-skill strength scale, which is the most natural. So, the most natural framework is the perturbative heterodic string, which historically, as I said, that's where the string phenomenology started. The gravity and gauge interactions have the same origin. They are both massless excitations of the closed string. So this unifies all interactions. And there have been many models in this way. Models in this way. I would say that the main problematic feature in this approach is the mismatch between the string and the granulification scale. That naturally, the string scale was about 50 times bigger than the grand unification scale. This is, I mean, it's a nice, it's a nice property to be able to predict the unification scale in the context of grand unified theories, which have only one prediction, which is, for instance, sine squared theta. So the heterotic string made the second prediction, which is the string scale, but this mits match with the unification scale needs to be addressed. Addressed. One way to be addressed was invoking large threshold corrections. But then, of course, you introduce an extra parameter and you lose predictability. One way to do it is by going to the strong coupling and identify the M-theory scale with the granularification scale. A few properties of the heterotic string, the spectrum has Allows to have a huge gauge group up to the rank 22. The non-abelian couplings unify at the strength scale, while the sine square theta is a parameter. And if it is forced, it was found that if it is forced to be three over eight within the standard model, then cellular spectrum that are fractionally There are fractionally electrical charge states. This was generic prediction of these models. Moreover, the allowed the simplest constructions, which were orbifers, like calabillas, lattices, free fermions, constructions. All these are simple constructions in which the allowed representations are fundamental. The allowed representations are fundamental for to index at the symmetric tense representations of unitary groups or spinners of orthogonal groups. So these are the right properties to do grand unification. A particular property which was different from grand unification because of this allowed representations is that there was no adjoint, there are no adjoints to break the grand unified groups. And this And this gave two alternative ways to address, to go through this path. One is to start with what I would call briefly orbiful grand unified theories in which the Gaz group is broken by discrete Wilson lines or by proceeding through variations of granulified groups, groups that do not require a joint. That do not require adjoints to break it, such as the Fleet SU5, Patisalam, standard model. These are embeddable in SO10, if you want. And they are not really dynamite because there are always several couplings, but it can be realized with instinctive. So I think that the string phenomenology went pretty far in In with a lot of progress in the heterotic string. Then when the string dualities came and there was the development of open strings and the deep brains gave a different direction of a different way to do synphenomenology. So in this context, in this part, in this theory, this string theory. Theory, string district theory, the gravity and gauge interactions have different origins because gravity are always extensions of closed strings, but now gauge interactions are extensions of open strings, which are different. Closed strings propagate always in their dimensions, while gauge interactions in deep brains are in lower dimensionalities, and they are defined by the hypersurface. Hypersurfaces where open strings end, and the reason is that there are two types of allowed boundary conditions for open strings: either Neumann, where the end of the open strings propagate with the speed of light along the world volume of the d brains, or the disclaimer conditions in which the endpoints of the open strings are fixed and this define. and this define the perpendicular directions of the of the d blanes so the generic spectrum there the building block comes for the coincident d blanes that give a un a unitary gauge group and the end points of the open strings transform in the fundamental or anti-to-fundamental representation. Or anti-fundamental representation, while the UN factor here of the SUN plays the role of a gauged baryon number, which has charts, which has charge plus one for fundamental and minus one, 20 fundamental. So open strings from the same stacks give rise to adjoint gauge multiplets of unitary factors, while open strings between the two Open strings between the two stacks give rise to bifundamentals between the two unitary factors. So, this gives the building blocks of the standard model, which is constructed like this. Also, one can introduce non-oriented strings. Strings, actually, they are necessary for consistency of the theory, in which case one can get also orthogonal or symplectic gauge groups and mattering and symmetric or symmetric representations. Or symmetric representations. So, as I just said, the intersecting brains in general give a new framework which is perfect for standard model building because it contains the building blocks of the standard model. But by default, there's no unification because every stack has a different gauge coupling. So, there's no prediction also from the string scale. Also, from the string scale and the gates couplings are independent. Moreover, making grand unified theories are problematic in the sense that there are no, for instance, perturbative SO10 spinners. If one can have an SO10 group realized, but they don't have spinners which are needed for the spectrum, described quirk and leptons. One can go to Leptons. One can go to SU5, which is possible to construct, but then also with the representations, fundamental or anti-symmetric representations. But then one faces the problem that there is no top Yukawa coupling in the SU5 because it's forbidden by the U1 charts accompanying the SU5, the analog of the value number. Such Yukawa coupling, of course, can be generated by the D instances, but The instances, but of course, the question is why then the coupling is the strongest if you have a coupling that should be generated in this way. So these are the main characteristics of intersecting de-brain models. Then there one could go to non-perturbative realizations like the M-theory or F-theory models, which Theory models, which in a sense combine good properties of both heterotic and intersecting brain models, but they lack exact description for explicit computations, and this is an anticipatory to go far with string phenomenology. On the other hand, intersecting brains and in general, type 1, let's say generic theory of open and closed strings, give rise to a deep brain world of description of Brain world of description of our universe, which allowed a new gave a new direction or also of phenomenology. And the reason is that instead of the heterotic, if you the coupling, these relations that I wrote in the heterotic string, where it was predicted, you can predict the string scale. Now they are body. Scale now they are modified in this way. So the gates coupling, the string coupling detains the gates coupling, but the Planck mass now is not directly related to the string scale. There is an ambiguity here, which is a volume transverse to the standard model brains, let's say. And this volume, if it is large, then this allows to lower the string scale anywhere to the Planck scale up to lower. The Planck scale up to low energies. So that's the brain wall description, which typically has two types of compact dimensions, those which are seen by the standard model and those that are not. And those which are not can be large. So, some of the, I would like to finish with two of the challenges. Challenges that still remain for the string phenomenology. I didn't talk about model stabilization. Hope that somebody else can talk, maybe Luis. It would be nice to implement the model stabilization method that we know in explicit model building, and in particular, the question whether there is a systematics of model stabilization for the heterotic string. For the heterotic string, as we know how to do it in type 2 the brain models. And another big question is there have been models for particle physics that went pretty far and also models of cosmology which were also pretty far and they used the model stabilization. There is an open and interesting question: how to combine Question: How to combine such the constructions in a single model that could describe at the same time particle physics and cosmology. I think that's what I would like to say. Thank you very much, Ignacios, for this overview. Now, I would like to invite Lucy Banez to let us know what he thinks. First of all, thanks to the organizers for inviting me to this meeting and particularly also to Ignacios for his wonderful presentation because then I don't really need to discuss practically much more in terms of technical terms because I think he has given a splendid view of what is being achieved and Been achieved and problems remaining. So, in fact, at the beginning, I thought I was going to present some transparencies and I gave up because Peter told me that he wasn't. But in the end, after listening to Ignatio, I think I may try to flush a few transparencies. You're muted, Elise You're muted. Your microphone is muted. I will ask you to unmute and see whether it works. Let me see what I can do. So do you see my screen? You see a very thin gray line. Yeah, it's vertical gray line. It's not clear whether it's related to string phenomenology. Your screen is compactified vertically or something. And now? Still seeing. Still the same. Still the same. So that's what I told you to try and test yesterday. Okay, let me. Maybe he can send the slides and somebody else can share them. No, it's worth it. It's not really worth, okay? Because it's not so. Okay. Okay. So what I was going to tell you, I was going to give a sort of time scale on what has been achieved in stream phenomenology, how old it is, and how it has evolved. Did feel this already 37 years ago that it started, and the first paper. Started. And the first paper was a paper by Ed Whitton on the circle compatification, I mean, toroidal compatification with U1 bundles and giving rise to an SU5 unified theory. He also discussed axions, and this was really in 84. And since then, Wilder Wolves The wilderness and evolution along the years from 85 to 19, there was the fair construction of models in terms of Calabill heterotic compatifications in the first three generation examples, orbifolds, free fermions, Gebner models. Then at the end of the 80s, the T-duality effective actions appear. In around 1990, the first S-duality First, as duality symmetry stated. Then from 1990 to 95, there was the time when Gegino condensation was formulated and how it held to the problem of moduli fixing. Also, we learned to compute within this context soft terms and construct grand unified theories. But then in 1995. But then in 1995 came the M-theory Debra revolution, F-theory. At the same time, the ADD large dimension models, the first toroidal orientifo constructions were performed, and the Randall Sundrome models. By 2000, brains at singularities, D3s and D sevens at singularities. And D7s at singularities, as well as intersecting this brains, like Ignatio said, were constructed first. And KKLT and the JKP paper, Giddins, Kathrud Polsiski, about background site-of-be-background reflexes. And then from 2005 to 2015. To 2015, there was a revival of atiotic compactifications, studies of the instantons and the applications to the effective field theory. 2010, F-theory, grand unified theories started to be constructed. And then the Higgs was found at LHC 2012. Also, large-filled inflation. Also, large field inflation fake, but sort of appear with the bicep two experiments. And that was later discarded. But that triggered an interesting question. It was the possibility of working out large-scale inflation in terms of actions in string theory, which Theory, which led eventually to the story of the revival of the Samblan arguments. So in the last five years, what I think instead of, I think we have learned the lesson of these 30 years, we have learned a lot about the effective action of string theory compactifications, how we can obtain models. Can obtain models whose male spectrum is extremely close to the standard model. And we have started to learn how to obtain models with all model effects. But there is a, I think the tendency in the last five years is sort of in the transverse direction. We would like to learn to find generic features of string theory. There have been There have been landscapes, landscape studies, both in heterotic and in orientable type 2 constructions. Also use the techniques of machine learning to learn general properties of clavier compactifications. And then, of course, the swampland, which was introduced already in 2007. But only very recently, in the last four years, have received attention. And as I said, this was triggered by the attempts to build chaotic inflationary models from the actions. Of course, I think the streamline ideas, I think, is something which we should pay attention, as I will. As I will argue in a minute, but I would like to make some comments about these 35 years of activity in the area. I think we have been sort of in parallel with the rest of the Beyond the Standard Model people in the field. And I think the Beyond the Standard Model field is now in a sort of crisis. Now, this sort of crisis after the LAC results, and if you look at the archives at the moment, you see very little supersymmetry. You see neutrino physics, you see plenty of axions. Axioms are very fashionable nowadays. Then, of course, LAC phenology, because there is an accelerator which is at work and it will be upgraded. And it will be upgraded. But very, very, I mean, there was this euphoria 10 years ago, 15 years ago, about constructing more and more models with all kinds of extra dimensions, some in the bulbs, some in the boundaries, with all kinds of barpings. I mean, there was an explosion of model building. The problem with this kind of activity is that Of activity is that it is a strong bet. If what has happened, the experiment does not find your model, you're in bad shape because what you've done has not been principal, apparently at least, very useful. I must argue that in our field, we have been accumulating knowledge. I think whatever we've been doing in the last 30 years has been useful. 30 years has been useful instead because it is there. I mean, we know how from string theory we can obtain things which resemble the standard model more and more. We have learned quite a lot and it is there. It's not just the latest idea we have a crazy model which constructed to fit some data which later on fades away. No, no, it's solid knowledge that we have achieved. That we have achieved. And I think now both the Beyond the Standard Model people and us are facing the question of the naturality. And I think that's, to me, is the strongest problem both for us and for theoretical physics in general. What do we do with the hierarchy problem and with the cosmological constant problem? With the cosmological constant problem. And in particular, the ERK problem, the LAC results are pushing the threshold of supersymmetry more and more. So perhaps it seems to me that we've been naive in thinking as supersymmetry as the only solution. I mean, low-energy SUSI, because in my opinion, string theory predicts that. My opinion: string theory predicts that supersymmetry exists. The question is at what scale? So, I think probably it's supersymmetry, which may still be there because LAC has not reached beyond 1.5 TeV or 2 TeV for squares and leptons. And for some versions of Sushi, like car aparity-by-latin Sushi, the limits are even weaker. But we have the feeling that Loyani Sushi is. That loyal is susie is not natural anymore, and that's something we have to take into account. And perhaps it's time to think that it's important we cannot ignore quantum gravity. I mean, we take into account quantum gravity sometimes in doing phenomenology just by adding higher dimensional operators suppressed by Planck. Suppressed by plant mass powers, and that's it. But I think what we are learning in the last five years with the story of the Swalam is that it is not enough. It is not just that there are plant-suppressed interactions, but there are more serious things that you have to change. In particular, things like there seems to be connections between the infrared and in the ultraviolet scales. Ultraviolet scales in the theory. So you cannot, even when you do a loop computation and you use some regularization method, you have to be careful, at least theoretically, maybe numerically is irrelevant. But you have to take into account that the quantum gravity, all at least the string theory and many other ways of thinking of quantum gravity. Other ways of thinking of quantum gravity seems to indicate that there is some ultraviolet-infrared connection. And maybe that's an important issue, an important aspect to take into account to address this naturality problem. So as I say, I think the Swalen program, I think it's important because it tries to look for transversal sort of modeling. Transversal sort of model-independent features of string theory, which any consistent VACA should fulfill. Maybe we learn sufficiently about that. Perhaps we could bound or extract information about the observed world, things like the standard model, the structure, the garchy problem itself, and And the cosmological constant. Of course, as Miguel pointed out yesterday, up to now, the aspects of the FLAM program which can be sort of are well motivated or to some extent proved things like the absence of global symmetries or the The weak gravity conjecture, I mean, yes, the weak gravity conjecture associated to human interactions are very lightly correct and has been shown to be true in essentially all string vacua we have explored. But other conjectures. Our conjectures. I think the digital conjecture shouldn't be taken as a joke. I think it's in natural procedure. The mathematicians use it a lot. You propose something which looks likely to be true because there is some indirect evidence or a statistical evidence and then you try to prove it or to test it. One of the weapons Weapons to use to do that is string theory. I mean, if you believe that string theory is consistent with quantum gravity, then you find that your conjecture, whatever explored in the quantum strain theory, is always fulfilled. Well, that's good evidence. It's not a proof, but I mean, it's a way to think that what you are assuming is true and may have some implications. implications. Things like the, for example, the famous Desiter conjecture are very strong. So it's to say that there are no Desiter vacua, even metastable. It is too strong. It is true that in the, I mean, asymptotically, the decision conjecture has been, I mean, at large fields, has been tested. I mean, at large fields has been tested in many string theory examples. But I guess away from those limits, it is difficult to prove. But I think it's important to explore and test whether that thing, something like that, could be true, because the implications would be paramount for the observed world, whether we are or not in a minimum or in a runaway situation. It's something which, by the way, can be tested or Tested or at least constrained in future experiments, I think, is clearly important. But there are other aspects to it, like the story of the neutrinos and the cosmological constant, the fact that the scale of the slightest neutrino and the value of the scale of the cosmological constant is the same, and which can be sort of understood. It would be understood in the context of some strong conjectures like the ADEs. Some frontline conjectures, like the ADS stability conjecture or the ADS distance conjecture. I think it is also important to explore. I mean, there is, it could be a coincidence, but what if not? If not, it's very, very important. And in the future, cosmological experiments like in this, in Euclid, the mass of the latest neutrino is going to be, the limits are going to be improved a lot. So the connection So the connection, the numerical prediction for that from these constraints would be important. And I think that there are other strong, I mean, conjectures which give predictions related to experiment. There is this recent Festinalente constraint of Miguel and collaborators that the fourth power of Power of the chart of any charge particle has to be larger than the cosmological constant in the Sitter vacuum, which of course is fulfilled for any, I mean the light-test char the particles dielectric, of course, is fulfilled easily. But if that constraint can be put in a formal basis, it's already a very strong constraint because the general Because the general value, I mean, for the cosmological constant of the world, is planned scale to the fourth or some supersymmetry breaking scale to the fourth. So a bound like is an amazing improvement over the natural value of the cosmological constant. So I think trying to explore general properties of string theory. String theory. One direction is the swan, and others, like machine learning or landscape studies, are also bringing us information, transversal information about how a string theory, the properties, general property of string theory, is an important direction to go. Of course, other areas that we have been exploring in the last 30 years, like modules. Modular stabilization of new techniques to compute things in more complicated backgrounds, like non-geometric backgrounds, for example, or M-theory and M-theory backgrounds have not yet been sufficiently explored, etc. But I think for some years to come, the study of general properties of vacuum trying Properties of vacuum, trying to find constraints which could have an impact in the world for aspects like the cosmological constant and the hierarchy problem are an important direction to go. And that's what I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Luis. I'd like to hear the insight from Hans-Pitaniles. Well, I cannot add much more to what the two previous speakers. The two previous speakers have said. So I was just thinking, since there are so many experts around, I want to ask a few general questions. Let me ask two questions. The first one is, and you can give your opinion. So the first question is, are there any signs in nature that might give us a hint for string theory? And the first half of the question would be now, if you have an opinion. If you have an opinion for it, and the second one of that question would be: Could you think of such hints in the future? So that is the first question. And the second question is, are there some signs in nature that work against string theory? So I was hoping that we have a discussion. So I think, Fernando, what's Fernando, what's your opinion about these questions? Well, it just took me by surprise. Anyway, I would say the answer is no, no, no, no to all the questions. Well, for example, I was at the swampland discussion to some extent. There is now the positive cosmological constant, and people say in string theory. People say in string theory, we are unable to construct models which really do it. Well, that in that, I yes. So now you got me to this, so let me see. At least for one of your questions, I will say something tomorrow, but maybe I think in the future there will be it is not looking that bad for for getting to energies as that will be relevant for string theory. That will be relevant for string theory. And that I think is because of gravitational waves. So we know that gravitational waves of higher frequencies, the higher the frequency, the higher the energy you can explore. And you get to explore gravitational waves of the gigahertz frequency, you're already looking at the God scale. So, in that sense, it's something like 20, 30, 40 years from now, that's not that me that's that's not uh impossible so i i can i'm be i will be optimistic now the the question of the cosmological constant i agree with uh luis's uh point about the the the swambland uh statement about the citr but that is nothing new from what we already knew that that was it used to be called the dynam cyber problem that everybody knew it was correct i nobody nobody questioned it so the swimbland has not added anything new Swarmland has not added anything new to that statement. That asymptotically, we all know that there will be runaway. So, the important thing is that we all knew you, and that's why all these challenges people have been approaching is just to find minima where you are not in the runaway region. And people say, oh, maybe all the minima will be at the strong coupling regime, which will be the national mitosis. The natural thing to say. So that will be bad news because we know that nature tends to be weaker coupling. So in that sense, the region which is interesting is not taken care of by these two statements, either the asymptotic behavior of swimmland or the strong coupling regime. So that makes the attempts to find the citer at the relatively large volume or large weak coupling, but not too large or not too small. But not too large or not too small, that is the relevant question. And I think the situation in 2005 was 2003, 2005, where the first concrete realization of model stabilization came. They are even stronger now, 15 years later. So there is no reason, I would say, to start to make the claim that, oh, is it the swamping conjecture is only asymptotically, and yet we still have to... we we still have to to this is the challenge to go to to smaller values uh the i think the the the the the the situation for modern stabilization is better now than used to be 15 years ago so i mean it has been getting better and better and better so they i don't see any reason why to to to to make it uh um more i mean uh to still claim that that that that there is an issue there although on the other hand i think i always um that there was this There was this claim. This, let me see what this instance was. This extraordinary claims need extraordinary proofs. So, and that applies to both directions. It applies in the direction of the model stabilization things. So, if we claim that models are being stabilized, we have to be very, very, very, go to all the details, not just be happy with the rough arguments. And that's what I Rough arguments, and that's what I think there is a lot of things to be done there. On the other hand, the claim that it is not there, you don't have any extraordinary proof. I would not take it seriously at all. And I thought already that's too bold, yes, touching on that. So I don't think it's first of all, you shouldn't mistake the Swambland program with the Sitter conjecture. The Sitter conjecture is the... I never mistake it. I never mistake that. I never mistake that. We had a swampland discussion last Sunday, so let's not. This was not a question about the wrong. Why do you believe in string field? We are doing it since 37 years. Why do you still believe in it? Well, there's a book about it. Why trust a theory? I'll throw in an answer to why one believes in why I believe in strength theory. Believes in well, I believe in string theory. If you look at very high-dimensional theories of gravity, then you can show that string theory is the only thing that completes it in the sense that you know for 10-dimensional supergravity, all the n equals one supergravities are realized through string theory. And the more we look at it, the more we realize that in high dimensions, it seems that the consistency of quantum gravity with a lot of symmetries is uniquely, essentially, matching with the set of possibilities that come from string theory. So, to me, that's actually the most convincing reason why. Reason why theory is the right thing. Okay, I guess this is an argument, but of course, it's string phenomenology is just far away from your statement. I would not disagree with what you just said. Yeah, like usually in physics, I think you have to follow your what you mean. Your, your, what you, I mean, what you feel, what you smell, okay? Yeah, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence. There is a lot, starting with the fact that string theory, and unless you do some perversion, string theory predicts a massive graviton. It's built in. It wasn't ordered. It is there, either you like it or not. No, I guess I agree with that completely. That's the first argument, I think. Argument, I think. There are many. It contains all the ingredients of the standard model built in also automatically: chelefermions, gauge bosons, gauge variants, whatever. It seems to contain many of the things that we have learned in quantum gravity about black hole, for example, which have nothing to do in principle with string theory. But string theory, it was not programmed, but it is there. It contains the story of the counting of the degrees of. Story of the counting of the degrees of freedom and many other things, or like the stomach, I mean, the weak gravity conjecture applied to a U-1 interaction. I mean, it's a cumulus of things. For example, the particles of the standard model are in simple representations, whereas without the string theory, the particles in the standard model could have been in representations. Understand could have been in representations with enormous dimensionality, for example, where string theory predicts that no, you want to have light stuff, you need small representations. In some way, we would say probably because they carry little information. Little information means less mass. More information leads to more mass. And that's again built in in string theory predicts light objects. I mean, there are. I mean, there are such an amount of indirect evidence in this direction, and essentially no competition, that it's difficult not to believe that this is correct. Absolutely. Yes. I like to play the devil's advocate. On the other hand, there are people working in different fields that say that string theory contains actually too much and no convincing way to get rid of. Convincing way to get rid of all of it. What do you think? In which sense, too much? Too many dimensions, too many forces, too many particles, too many conditions as well, too many symmetries, too many that we don't see. Oh, no, I mean, so yeah, well so I think you were just asking is the issue about predictability. Asking is the issue about predictability. Yes, but again, it's an issue about low energy against high energy. Low energy, we're trying to explore something which is such a high energy that we will be extremely lucky if we manage to find a way at these energies. But if you go higher and higher energies, eventually you should be able to find a better way to test it. And yes, and if the solution is not... And if the solution is not unique, too bad. I mean, it may not be, I mean, at least nature has to behave in a way that we may not like it. But who are we to tell nature what is the way to behave? So I think the only issue we have to find is to do our best and try to explore the best and try and do what we are doing, but Luis and Peter and Ignatius. What Luis and Peter and Daniel mentioned. There is a question here from Miriam. Well, just a comment, but actually on a positive side that I think Louise may agree on too. There are corners of string theory where particle physics emerges beautifully, right? Geometrically. I'm not saying that's a proof, you know, that string. Proof, you know, that string theory is the only theory, but that's quite compelling when there is a geometrical, beautiful picture, right? Where particle curl matter appears, intersecting brain picture per se. Of course, I would like to also advocate, you know, the whole geometric origin of these degrees of freedom, the way they appear in F-theory compactification is also, I think, very appealing again, geometric phases of string theory. Phases of string theory, where particle physics is part of it. And it's, I think, has a very compelling, beautiful origin. So, this is more of an aesthetic argument or not a proof, of course. Can I ask a question? So, now that Megan mentioned, I think that that's a very, very valid point. So, in F-theory, it creates all these many other solutions that. many other solutions that I was I was thinking when Ignacius mentioned that the and Luis also mentioned the the limit of of representations and but in F theory apparently the limit is much higher is is there a way that we can just limit that in within F theory actually I think the limit in F theory is pretty close to what it is in heterotic actually because you can't get very complicated singularities without going outside the regime of the cadiric classification we actually had a paper with Classification: We actually had a paper with Dave Morris and Nikhil Ragarom and some others where we were looking at what kinds of matter you can actually get. And you can get a few exotic representations, but it's actually pretty similar to the thing that you get by breaking E8. So for instance, for SU2, you can get a triple symmetric matter, you know, a four-multiplet with a particular kind of singularity. And there are a couple of other kinds of representations, but anything beyond that seems to be. Representations, but anything beyond that seems to force you to have these four sex singularities that go outside F theory. So, actually, there's pretty strong constraints from F theory on what kinds of representations are allowed. That's very good news. So, can we make a general statement? I mean, how big the representation can be or so? Certainly, we can say that from F theory. There are some boundary cases actually which we seem to be able to get from heterotic, which don't seem to make sense in F-theory, and those are a little cryptic. I think Miriam. Those are a little cryptic. I think Miriam wrote a paper with Ling and some others on maybe this comes from T-Brains or something, but there is a pretty close relationship. I think Timov Igand has also written some papers connecting to this question. But there's a pretty, it seems pretty clear that each of these approaches to string theory gives you a pretty firm upper bound on what kind of representations. What's much less clear is for U1, how big the charges can be. That's actually kind of a puzzle. And there's been actually both Miriam and Group and we have written some papers. Group, and we have written some papers recently speculating about what causes this bound on upper charges of the U1s, which are somehow much more cryptic from F3. I don't know if Miriam, you want to add anything to that? No, you pretty much covered because we don't have definite answers, but it's clearly pointing to very restrictive directions. And what about the rank of the proof rigorous bounds, right, is still it's not completely tight. It's not completely tight, right? Especially for you one anyway, it's technical. No, in the theoretic, I think you can find limits on you one charges. Yeah, and the NEF theory, I think the conjecture, we actually have found U1 charges up to 21, which I think goes beyond what you get from heterotic. There's been conjectures that you don't get things naturally above six, but it seems implicitly you can prove that you get charges up to about 21. Fernando, you asked about the gauge group. Fernando, you asked about the gauge group. The rank of the gauge group can actually become quite enormous. I mean, you can get hundreds of factors of E8s, and you know, I think you can easily get up in the hundreds for the ranks because the H11 of the fourfold can become extremely large, largely dominated by this huge number of E8 factors and F4 factors and G2 cross SU2s. It is, we believe, even for Calabia fourfolds, has a finite bound, but that hasn't been proven. So, for example, So for example, this family in the standard model looks like a 16-dimensional spinal representation of SO10. Is that something we could attribute to string theory as a positive argument? So you're leading toward SO10 constructions in some way here. No, I'm just meaning that the family of quarks and electrons. The family of quarks and leptons, that's physics. This is something which we have seen. Let's believe that the right-handed neutrino exists. This is a beautiful result. Now, the question is, is that something why I should believe in string theory? I do, but for the question, as we have repetition of famines, is that something which is Is that something which is assigned for that's a prediction of string theory? Really? That's a prediction of string theory. Excuse me, that's a prediction of string theory, the multiplicity that there is more than one. I mean, I think that's very unlikely in this, you know. So it's and it's actually again in corners, right, of a string theory compact, it's again topological, right, due to the fact that we are in. Right, due to the fact that we are in compact space, right? Which is another beautiful. You see, those things are somehow have its origin either in topology or geometry, at least in some corners of string theory compactification, and that's compelling. Good, good. So we all love string theory and we confirm our prejudice in some way. By the way, it's the only game in town. That's what David Gross says, right? And so we still. Right, and so we still I know that you know he is the guru, absolute guru, but the fact is, it's the only game in town, but you see, he was the guru of low energy super symmetry as well. And so it's just I'm joking now. Well, we'll all jump on any alternative that would be promising enough. We have eyes open, I believe, you know. I believe, you know, to other alternative ideas, but I don't see anything. Is there something you can imagine that would convince you not to believe any longer in string theory? For example, in supersymmetry, we had this discussion. I think in supersymmetry, if they would have found a Higgs boson at 180 GeV or so, then I think I personally would have thought that supersymmetry. That supersymmetry is, there's no low energy supersymmetry the way let me call because I'm sorry to interrupt. Rabbit then, you see, now saying that LHC pushes the limit to one, two TeV for these particles, I think that's not such a conclusive result. So therefore, I was thinking that maybe what would you, when would you give up string theory? I make quotes thanks. I may quote things, Ashok Sen actually, because there was the same question, very much to the same question asked as strings when there was this discussion with the outside community. And what he said is, if there is a mathematical inconsistency, if somebody points out to, you know, mathematical or what we call theoretical inconsistency, of course, you'll drop it, I think, you know, because, but you. You know, because, but you're leading towards some experimental results that would make us right drop it. Yeah. Is there any signs that gravity is not fundamental in a sense the way we believe the particle physics aspect is? You know, if it's an emergent force of some other origin, that's very hard to justify. That's very hard to justify within string theory. Then we may have to go a new route and drop all that. Let me go back to your thinking about the sorry, go ahead. Go first. Yeah, sorry, I was actually going to say just quickly that going back to your standard model matter content question. I mean, one interesting thing about this question of what matter is natural in F-theory and what is not is that the standard model matter content is very natural. model matter content is very natural and minimal if we have an SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 mod Z6 gauge group. But if the gauge group doesn't have the Z6 quotient, the matter in the standard model is extraordinarily fine-tuned and Baroque and very difficult to realize. I think Paul Ullman had something to say too. Maybe that's all what you were saying as well. Yeah, exactly. Paul Ullman wants to say something about that. Yeah, yeah. I'm audible, I guess. Yeah. So, yeah, the the So yeah, the question was sort of similar that there's a couple of things that I have not explored in this broader swampland or classification issue, which is one, for example, potential discrete symmetries. I think yesterday we hinted at this that might be relevant maybe in order to engineer proton hexality, for example. And it's like in these broader constructions like F-theory, it's not clear yet. Constructions like F-theory, it's not clear yet what the bound on that should be. And then, exactly as Wody said, the question sort of what the global structure of the standard model, I mean, without Suzy even, what the global gauge group actually is is unknown. And we don't know it. But we might be able to answer this question by finding more subtle anomalies or string constructions that Or string constructions that, just as Wally said, maybe only very specific quotients, C6 quotients, or only subgroup quotients, or those sorts of things, or maybe even, like I said, more subtle anomalies that can tell us something about this, maybe even without Zuli. And so this is, yeah, this is something which is also still open. Well, that's where the direction is going. And that's what also Wadi was alluding to in the case of higher dimensional. Dimensional string theories, right? That's extremely constraining. And we have quite powerful techniques and hinting toward new aspects and new types of anomalies there. But going down to lower them, even in six dimension, it's tough. Okay. And so our goal is, of course, in our world, four dimensions, right? What we can say there. I think in this direction concerning what Direction concerning whether string theory equals quantum gravity. And this Kumrun calls that the St. Lampos principle, which means that only string theory, I mean the full quantum gravity, equals string theory. It's not that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, but any consistent quantum theory of gravity just equals. And that can, in principle, may be tested if. In principle, may be tested if you probably have to go to many supersymmetries and higher dimensions. You can prove that theories which are apparently consistent, anomalous here, whatever, but are not, you don't have the extreme theory, you have something wrong, wrong with some unexpected anomaly, that there is a breaking of some global symmetry that you didn't realize. Realize, etc., in such a way that only the string theory takes care, that is, and all things which do not cannot be obtained from string theory are just not there. So that's the way to prove that quantum gravity equals string theory. Of course, as I said, this has been started to be tested in 10 and 9 dimensions, but going down to even 8 or 7 and probably is. Or seven probably is complicated. Probably Woti knows more about that. Yeah, and I would like to say one has made some non-trivial progress on that, also on the global structure of the gauge group symmetries in A dimensions, for example, something that Paul was alluding to. Michel Wats has a question. Question to Paul: if he would be able to immediately tell us, if you get, let's say, the standard model. If you get, let's say, the standard model from an orbiford, tetraotic orbifa, do you know immediately if this has this over C6 or it doesn't have the C6? In principle, I mean, you should be able to look at it. I mean, you have the whole, you can compute the whole tower and you can compute, so you know the complete charge lattice. So you should be, in the erodic string, I would say it should. I would extrin, I would say it should be exceptionally clear. Okay, but you don't know the answer. I mean, it should be an answer in principle, but I don't know. Okay, good. Well, let me just plug in again F-theory. There, the derivation of global symmetry is geometric. Okay, and for concrete case, you get geometrical answer to this question that you say. Clear or not, you give me compactification. Give me compactification of F-theory with this gauge structure, right? Lie algebra. Geometry will uniquely determine for you what is the global structure. Whether there is D6 or not, for example. I thought also in the auto-hotic string, there is a geometric origin, of course. And my question was simply if it's known what you get in the heart of the realization. Take my question. But I understand that if you have the decomposition with SU5 in a five-power pass 10, then you essentially have the standard model with the C6 model. Yeah, I think actually most of the heterogeneous models, SU5, already you have exactly that result. Sure, but I mean, I'm sort of asking if you could see something like an orbital twist in the low-energy effective description. Any low energy effective description? I think many of the heterotic models will have F-theory duals. And one of the interesting things is in F-theory, if you engineer a group which doesn't have the Z6 quotient, you get much different kinds of matter. It's much more boring matter. You don't get things which look like the one-sixth, one-third charges, various distribution of charges in the standard model without the Z6. So I think. I have a question for Ignacios regarding one of one of his last two comments. He mentioned that he wanted to see cosmological and particle physics models together in a string construction. That could be a challenge. Do you have an idea how to get to that result, Ignacios? Result, Ignacios? Well, there is a method to proceed to modulate stabilization, and there is a method to construct different frameworks to construct models. So, in principle, we want to try to implement to combine together. I guess there are will be too many constraints and. Be too many constraints, and I don't know if there is any example, even toile, even at a toile level, where this can. But this is a I find this fair question to ask. In the same way that we construct models for one or for the other, we should be able to construct models for both. I thought Fernando had the program that was exactly addressing those things. Oh, so anyway, Fernando, you want to thank you, Lime. Thank you, yes, exactly. We have a couple of papers on that. We have the standard model on the singularity, and then we have one of the moduli to be the inflaton, for instance. So, in that sense, but there is a challenge, which I think is precisely by when you try to do these things, either you get inflation and then the scale is very high, and then the gravitational mass is very high, so you don't get low energy per symmetry, and then you want to. Energy supersymmetry, and you want to get low energy of supersymmetry, then you don't get the right inflation. So, the two things do not seem to be easy to get at the same time. So, I think that's an interesting challenge. So, one possibility will be like that you have the volume itself is the inflaton, so you can have the volume is stabilized and is rolling while it inflates is a small volume, and then you have the high scale of inflation, and then you roll very much, and then you have. And then you roll very much, and then you have a much larger volume at the very minimum, and then you get a small gravitational mass because it's the small gravitational mass we need is today, and the inflation is in the early universe. But to engineer something like that, you need some tuning. That's not very natural. Pure Swiss cheese scenarios and brains and singularity, right? The standard model is that is it is it what you're Is it what you're referring to? Yes, exactly. The standard model, the singularity, and then you have one of the moduli as the inflaton. And yeah, so you just first of all stabilize the modulus, which is already challenging given that the constraint that you have to have the standard model already there. So you need this configuration of brains and so on. And yet you have to have a small enough modulus such that one of them can be the inflatome. So yes, we have one or two examples in the past. One or two examples in the past, it's not straightforward. For instance, for our most recent paper, we don't have it. But yeah, you can achieve it. And what I say, you face this problem of either you get a low energy supersymmetry to work or everything is just a high energy. How much close to the standard model you go with this on the singularity part? Well, we had in our recent paper, we get We get the left-right symmetric model essentially, with three families and everything. With tattoos satisfied, with global constraints satisfied because you're turning on fluxes, you know, this is the message. Everything is consistent. Go and read our paper. It's almost 100 pages long. So yes, that's a difficult thing. I think my student, Andreas, gave a talk in one of the meetings. But yes, we have, it's very close. But yes, we have it's very close. And we follow this very nice paper, which is kind of not very well known by Weinholt. It's called the geometry of particle physics. So he classified the key thing is something that is to have the singularity to be orientified. So you look for what is the quiver? you say one you you want you have the the standard model quiver and you need you see that the the the this the direct way to scale it is is in a way that is not oriented so that means some of the arrows go in one direction the other one in the other direction so you need to have the oriented folding of the whole calabayo has to pass through the quiver and you have to orientifold the quiver and in the case of wine hole he did the whole analysis only locally and what we did is essentially taking that and make it into the global model into a whole It into the global model into a whole Calabria where you can have the whole oriented for the singularity, and then you get something very realistic. I think we're trying to improve that because we get the volume large, but not too large, or something like that, but as a model itself of particle physics, it looks very interesting. And yes, so it's based on a DP5 the PESO5 singularity. Singularity and that already getting the best of five singularities was a challenge. We couldn't get it from the cross-search character list, so we had to go to intersection grabbed and so on, but it works. So I think that's plenty to be done in that direction. Okay, thank you. I have a question for Hans Peter. He motivated this discussion saying that, well, we have to find signs of string theory. Of strength theory in nature or signs that there is no strength theory in nature, for example. Do you, Hans Peter, see any of the signs besides the 16th lead? No, I think what, well, I don't know who realized that first. I guess the first thing is that string theory gives us masses spin one and spin two. And the interesting thing is you only get it after you have quantized the theory. If you wouldn't quantize string theory, If you wouldn't quantize string theory, you would get just massless spin zero. You had the ragged trajectories. And then when you start quantizing it, it actually gives us spin one and massless spin two. Of course, a massless spin three would kill it, unless people are very clever and engineer something which does it. I think that's that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think string gives us a lot of things, but I think this for me also this duplication of families in some way is something which you get in string. There's no other solution. Of course, you could say this is not just string theory. It could also be extra dimensions. But of course. So there comes the point, of course, that. Course, that in a certain way there's no alternative to string theory, so it must be correct. The problem I see in some cases is that, you see, the more we learn about these new developments, which has to do with swampland conjectures, which in some cases actually are in string theory are clear. I think the weak gravity conjecture. I think the weak gravity conjecture in string theory is obvious. Because you see, the open strings are gauge bosons, the closed strings are gravitons, and the gravitational coupling is the square of the gauge coupling. And if the coupling is weak, then we know that this coupling should be smaller. So there are a lot of things which I guess come naturally in string theory, but then the more we learn, the more we learn. The more we learn about this implications of that, the more we move away from the standard model. Yeah, because in the standard model, you forget about supersymmetry. I just might say, okay, I have a global symmetry and some place it's a low energy effective thing, which is broken at a very high. Which is broken at a very high scale because of gravity effects, even if this is weak. That's something which is consistent with the standard model. Now, if I embed it in string theory, you see, we find out that if the global symmetry is embedded in string theory, you have to do a lot of things. And at the end, you will actually see when you make it light that additional fields come down and that your effective field field. Your effective field field description breaks down at a given point. So, in fact, you see, when I just look at the standard model and I see all these developments, you see, it's not that they move together. Of course, this doesn't mean anything because you see this is not exploited in such a way. So, I think these are some things which are still missing at the moment, especially when we are talking about string phenomenology. We are talking about string phenomenology, which after all has this word in it, which also has, which of course means that we are thinking about the electroweak strong, the electroweak and the strong interactions in connection with gravity. So I see that there are a lot of things which are interesting, but it is not obvious. But it is not obvious that they at the moment are close to a solution. And the question is, since we did it for 37 years now, you see, for another 37 years will be hard for me to wait, even for some of the other people in the audience as well. Okay. Nella has another question. Thank you. Yeah, I wanted to ask Ivanes that, so he mentioned that the problem of naturalness or naturality can be addressed in the swamland program. I don't know, some years ago I saw a paper that was connecting the electroweak scale with the weak gravity conjecture. So it's something like that what you had in mind, or in which other way the swambland can help to this. The swamp can help to this naturality problem. Well, I guess the way in which I would expect is that the naive idea that there is an instability of the Higgs mass under loops has to be re-evaluated in the presence of quantum gravity. Because, as I said, one expects things like Want to expect things like an ultraviolet and infrared connection. And so, it's the way we do the argumentation for the ERC problem, it's probably too naive. I think that's the way. So, there must be something which goes wrong when the mass of the Higgs becomes highest. You value that something, something serious like related to unitarity, I don't know, some entropy bound of some sort. Entropy bound of some sort. And in fact, I am most realistic. I think that I would, for me, wouldn't be surprising if before five years or so we can address that. Right. Peter, I have an answer for you at this point. Okay. So Peter, an answer to your question: when will I drop string theory? Yes, am I muted? No, no, I'm not. No, no, no, we hear you. And if the Higgs is composite, I will do up string theory. Okay, good. Okay, that's a statement. Indeed. There's worries that we haven't seen supersymmetry yet, and that the scales are up to 2T. I mean, we know mass. TV. I mean, we know mass. But hold on, hold on. But the phenomenological anomalies with the standard model, which could suggest that there's still other particles that we haven't seen at low energies. For example, the muon anomalies suggest that G minus 2 of the muon is three or four sigma away from the standard model. Also, be serious. Be serious, you know. Also, I am being serious. Also, B goes to K star mu plus mu minus violates universality for lepton number. And these can be solved by having extra vector-like fermions in the low energy theory. Also, extra U1 prime in the low energy theory, which still could be found before we find supersymmetry if it's there. Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, there's no contradiction. I mean, first of all, I think this, you know, this is a pool. This, you know, this are poor man's signals. I mean, you know, they're not conclusive. Come on. I mean, G minus two or the whatever lepton anomalies. They're certainly not conclusive. I'm not saying that. Right. I mean, there may be additional particles. I mean, there's no, I don't think that, you know, I think, you know, string theory for me, the tool. I mean, it's not. For me, the tool, I mean, it's not, I don't think it's the end of the road. I think it's an effective field, an effective theory that combines gravity with the standard model. And I think it makes sense to explore it because I think just like Louis said, I mean, if you do BSM, Without gravity, you can do whatever you want. I mean, you know, you can always add more parameters and have another model. And if there is a discrepancy, then you add another parameter and you can do that. But you're not constrained. Adding gravity constrains you. So I think that so string theory allows us to do that in a self-consistent framework. So, you know, but I don't think it's. I don't think we understand it well enough to answer many of the questions that we would like to. For example, the existence of the City of VACO, I think, is not answerable within our current understanding of Shrinsivity. Do you meant the tool or a framework? Good idea. Go back to your statement. So you think that nobody will be able in string theory to build a technical model? To build a technical model which gives you no, no, that's not what I said. I said, you know, you asked me a personal question: when will I quit? Uh, okay, good. Okay, good. But you will be rather alone if that happens. That may be, but you know, but I'm, you know, my name is I'm alone and my middle initial is E. So it's very close to being alone. So do you mean to? So, do you meant tool or a framework? I haven't meant really tool or a framework because it's different. Yeah, I mean, okay. I mean, it's a framework. I think it's for me, it's more a tool. It's a framework in the same sense that one field theory is a framework. No, but that's different, I think. Because a framework has some general properties which. Has some general properties which are it is a framework. I mean, but for me, I would say that the tool and the framework are have a well, you know, you can distinguish more refined meaning, but I think they're very close. But I think we're coming close to the hour. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So precisely, I wanted just simply to ask you whether you have some concluding remarks. You, whether you have some concluding remarks, Ignatius, Peter, Luis.
