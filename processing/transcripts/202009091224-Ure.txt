 My pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Charlotte Ureger from University of Virginia. She will tell us about the generic report. us about the generic Clipboard algebra and its Broward class. Yes, thank you very much and thank you to all the organizers for organizing this online conference and hopefully a conference later in person as well. And also of course happy birthday to Andre and maybe we can celebrate together later. So I'm actually going to start talking about just the brow group and then later I will get And then later, I will get to this generic Clifford Aldebrand associated Brow class. Let me start by just telling you about what the Brow group is, and it came up already yesterday in Paramala's talk. So the Brow group of a scheme X is just going to be given by Merida equivalence classes of Algemaya algebras over that scheme. Furthermore, if X is sufficiently nice, so for example, if it's farther projective, then the Brau group of X is isomorphic to the torsion of the Is isomorphic to the torsion of the second italic homology of x with coefficients and multiplicative. And just to fix notations for later, when I look at a variety or a scheme x over k, I have a map induced by the structure morphism that's just brow group of k into the brow group of x to denote the image of this map by brow zero of x, which I will also call the constant classes. And usually when I talk about the brow group of scheme x, I'm really only interested in the quotient brow group of x. That in the quotient grau group of x modulo, this gra group of gra0, just because there's nothing really interesting happening there if you know the gravel group of your base field. So, a couple examples. First up, if your base field is algebraically closed, that bra group is going to be trivial. Then if C is an algebraic curve of an algebraically closed field, Sen's theorem says that the Bragg of that function field is also going to be trivial. And then finally, if we move And then finally, if we make our base field not algebraically closed, this question actually becomes a whole lot more complicated. So if we ask over a non-algebraically closed field and we have E as an elliptic curve over that field, and we want to know what is the detorsion, let's say, of the variable of E, then this does become a hard problem, which was solved for the two torsion by Chenushev and Gliatsky in 2001. So they computed the two-tortion priority if the characteristic of the base was. If the characteristic of the base field is not 2, no other restrictions on the base field. And then recently for any odd prime, I was able to do a very similar thing describing generized inflations of the odd prime torsion inside of the Bra group with some minor restrictions again on my base field. Not too many though, luckily. But I've described these generated signalations in terms of tensor product of symbol algebras over the function field. And then finally, if we And then finally, if we want to know what is this torsion over any D, we need to really put more restrictions on our base field to get a description. As of this point, maybe in the future, we want. But there are results by Esko-Bogatov and then later using a different method by Janusuf Rapinchuk and Rapinshuk to describe generators of this detortion of paragraph. And you can also get your hands on relations as well in there. And the question that I'm after throughout this. That I'm after throughout this talk is: Is there a moduli space or moduli stack to describe pairs E, alpha, where E is an elliptic curve and alpha is a detours and Brauer class over E? And I will mostly focus on the Kz equal to 3, just because it's somewhat the easiest and it's the only one that I can really get my hands on. And I won't give a complete answer to this, but hopefully I can convince you that I do have a partial answer to finding this stack here. So to get this stack, I will tell you a little bit about some actions. So let's say my base field is K, and I have a homogeneous form of degree D and N variables with that base field. There are a couple different actions on the space of these homogeneous forms. It's given by the general linear group. And the first, maybe most natural action is just by acting. Natural action is just by acting by the linear change of variables on my coordinates. So I just act linearly and I just extend that action to be an action on the space of homogeneous forms. Now, the slightly more complicated action is when we twist our action by a determinant. So this is what's called the s-twisted action, where on top of acting on our variables, we also multiply by a determinant to the power. By a determinant to the power of s in the run. And it turns out that these, the orbits with respect to this action really have very, very interesting properties. So if u is the space of non-degenerate forms of degree d and n variables, then this quotient stack or these orbits over k corresponds to certain moduli problems. So this is, for example, a result by Gone, Gross, and Sabind back in 2001, and they proved that. Back in 2001, and they proved that there is a bijection between minus one towards the binary correct form, so when this s is equal to negative one, over the integers, and the set of isomorphism class of cubic rings. So cubic rings are just really a generalization of cubic field extensions, if you want to call it that. So basically, it's just a Z algebra that is also for rank 3 as a Z module. And furthermore, this And furthermore, this was also observed, this kind of correspondence by the lead of any big scheme. And then later by Wood in 2018, she described actually that this was really an action that also commutes with phase change and does everything the way we want it to. So she described that there is actually an isomorphism of the moduli stack of minus one twisted binary cubic forms, binary forms, excuse me. Me and the moduli stack of cubic rings. So you have to, of course, generalize this notion of cubic rings to different bases, but she's done all of that. And this has very, very interesting applications to both counting number fields, just because, as I said, these cubic rings are really a generalization of a cubic field extension. And then also, you can bound the sizes of class groups using this. And I do want to mention, even though it won't come up later, Mentioning, even though it won't come up later at all, that she also describes such a bijection for minus one twisted binary forms, where then instead of these cubic rings, you have to replace them by so-called binary n pairs. So, this is for the for the twisted action, if we put our minus one in there. And now, the key that I want to talk about now, which is our result, is that if we look at the action when we don't twist, we actually get exactly what we want. So the statement is as follows. So the statement is as follows. So if k is a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3, and let's say it contains a primitive third root of unity, what we can prove is that there is a bijection between these untwisted now binary cubic forms of a k and isomorphism classes of pairs E, alpha, when I don't have any elliptic curve, but I get only elliptic curves E of J invariant zero. And every elliptic curve of J invariant zero actually has an order 3 automorphism. Actually, has an order 3 automorphism theta, and I will write out later how exactly this one comes along. And furthermore, my alpha is a theta-invariant 3-torn Brouwer clause in the Brouwer group of E module of the constant classes. And the way this construction works is that I just start with the form F and then I get my pair e, alpha by taking the Jacobian of the curve W. Covian of the curve w cubed minus f, that's going to be my elliptic curve, j american zero. And alpha is what's going to be the Brouwer class of the Clipper algebra associated to F. So I will explain what all of these things mean in the following, but I wanted to give you a preview of what's going to come. Okay, so let's start by talking about Clifford algebras. So in the kind of classical case, we have a Clifford algebra just associated to quadratic one. Which is associated to quadratic form. So let's say I'm still over maybe a field K and V is a vector space of dimension N. Let's say Q is a quadratic form over my vector space. Then the Clifford algebra associated to this Q is just the quotient of the tense algebra by the ideal generated by elements of the form V tends to V minus when I plug in B into my quadratic form Q. And we denote this algebra by A sub Q. So a couple examples for this. Couple examples for this. So if I look over the real numbers, I of course can write out my quadratic form just in terms of its signature. And so for n equals to 1, I get these two forms, x squared and minus x squared. And the corresponding Cluppered algebra that is going to be either R plus R or C. When you make n bigger, becomes a little bit more interesting. And so, for example, for this quadratic form that's negative x squared minus y squared, you get that the associated Clifford algebra is the quaternion. Algebra is the quaternion algebra. Now, a lot of people actually study these Clifford algebras because they have a lot of representation theory encapsulated in them and they really carry a lot of information because they are in some sense really a universal object. And the way that this Clifford algebra can now be generalized to high degree forms works as follows. So if I start with now not a quadratic form, but a form F of degree D. But a form f of degree d, I just do the exact same thing. So I look at the quotient of the tensor algebra again, and now I quotient out by the default tensor product of v minus f of v. And so really just a very natural generalization because in the case d equals to 2, I just had a v tensor v right there. And so again, for d equals to 2, I really just get back my classical notion. And the interesting case and the case interesting case and the case that I will focus on is really the case, the binary qubit case, when n is 2 and e is 3. So in this case what will happen is that my Clifford algebra here is actually going to be an Osmei algebra. And so it will give me some Brauer class over something, which again, I will go about this in a minute. However, if I make my N and D bigger than this, the problem is that my Clifford algebra really becomes too big to have all Really becomes too big to have all these nice properties. So if I make my n and d bigger, the Clifford algebra associated to F contains a free algebra and two generators, and so it's not going to be another algebra itself. But what can be done is we can study a certain portion of it, which is called reduced Clifford algebra. And this was studied by Cocarney in 2003. So let's focus on the binary cubic keys. So suppose that my field K, I'm still working over the same field. Okay, I'm still working over the same field, and I want a primitive third root of unity in there. And now any binary cubic form looks like this: some AU cube plus VU squared V plus Cu V squared plus V cube. And if I write out the associated Clipper algebra, I get exactly this thing. So I get the free algebra over k in two generators x and y such that x cubed is a, and then whenever I second power in x, second power in x and one power in y so I add all of those up meaning x squared plus y plus x y x plus y x squared is equal to b x y squared plus y xy plus y squared x is equal to c and y cubed is equal to d and this algebra was actually studied by Hale Hirima and Tessa in various papers um and this is where I want to talk about kind of why is this still in some sense a universal object so I mentioned that the So I mentioned that the Clipper algebra associated to a quadratic form is in some sense interesting for representation theory because it is really in a way universal. And for this higher degree Clifford algebra, what happens is that every central simple k algebra of degree 3 is going to be the homomorphic image of some Clifford algebra associated to some binary cubic form. So we still get this somewhat universality property. Universality property. But furthermore, as I already alluded to earlier, our Clifford algebra here is going to be an Azimaya algebra of its center. And the center turns out to be the FI coordinating of an elliptic curve. And furthermore, you can extend this Brouwer class to the entire elliptic curve. And then whenever you get a Brouwer class, you want to make sure, well, I didn't want to just construct a trivial Brouwer class. And so they also proved that this Brouwer class. also proved that this Brauer class is actually going to be trivial if and only if the curve w cubed minus F has a K-rational point. And it so happens, and hopefully by the end of this I will have convinced you that this is very natural condition here, but this curve here shows up. So this W cubed minus F, this is the curve. Well, the Jacobian of this curve is this J sub F here, just as a preview for later. Just as a preview for later. Okay, so these are all the things that were kind of known about this binary cubic Clifford algebra. So again, let me remind you of what I wanted to show. So I wanted to convince you that we have this bijection between these untwisted binary cubic forms, meaning these orbits of binary cubic forms with respect to our GL2 action, and these isomorphism classes of pairs E, alpha. And the way this works now is: so I start with the binary cubic form F, and then I consider the curve given by W cube finance F. And as I said on the previous slide, the Jacobian of this curve is an elliptic curve of J invariant zero, and we can actually write out explicitly what the equation for this Jacobian is. So it's just going to be given by y squared equals to x cubed plus 1 fourth delta, where delta is just the discriminant of the binary cubic. The binary cubic form. Furthermore, all of these things, so all of these elliptic curves have an order 3 automorphism. So this automorphism is just given by taking a point x, y to omega x, y, where omega is my permit of the order of unity in the base field. And then the Clifford algebra, this is going to give me my Brauer class. So the Clifford algebra associated to F extends by these results of Hale and Tessa and Hirima to a three-torn Brauer class. To a three-torn Brauer class inside of the Brauer group of this Jacobian. And it turns out that this Brauer class that I get is always going to be invariant under this order three automorphism. Now, how about the other way? So the other way around, we look at this sequence here. So from the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, we get a sequence of low-degree terms. So this is 0 into Brow group of K to the Brow group of E to this H1. Group of E to this H1. And what this does is it takes a pair or it takes the Brouwer class alpha that I get to a principal homogeneous space. And it turns out that if I ask for my principal homogeneous space or for my Brouwer class alpha really to be invariant under the automorphism theta and to also be three torsion, then the space that I get, this principal homogeneous space, has to look like W cubed minus F. And so this is going to be the form that I This is going to be the form that I take the E, alpha to. Now, I do want to mention here that this result or this kind of connection really heavily relies on results by Hail Hahn and Watsworth, who were computing the Bragg of exactly these principal homogeneous spaces. And these are also called so-called cyclic puss of our elliptic curve. Okay, so we have now our bijection. So we have now our bijection and working with moduli spaces whenever we have a bijection what we also want is we want some sort of universal object. And the role of this universal object is really going to be played by the generic Clifford algebra. So this algebra was introduced by Chan, Yang, and John in 2016, and it's the following thing. So the generic Clifford algebra of degree D and n variables, it's going to be again quotient of a tensor algebra. Quotient of a tensor algebra, but a quotient out now by the commutator of u, comma v to the d, where u and v are just any elements in the vector space. And note here that for every homogeneous form f of degree d and n variables, we get this rejection from this kind of big generic Clifford algebra to the Clifford algebra associated to that form. Because, well, in the form or in the Clifford algebra associated to the form, all these V to the D, they're already really, you might be. To the d, they're already really in my base field, which means they have to be in my center. Now, in particular, as I said earlier in the binary qubit case, we saw that every central simple algebra of degree 3 over my base field is the homomorphic image of some central, some Clifford algebra, which means every central simple algebra of degree 3 over k now is going to be a homomorphic image of just my binary cubic generic Clifford algebra. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is the one I want to focus on, but just for completeness, let me tell you about the other cases. So for d equals to 2, this one was studied by Chan, Yang, and Zhan in the same paper that they first described this algebra. And they showed that this is just a very nice algebra. So it's going to be connected, graded, arcing shelter, regular, and so on. For n equals to 2, d equals to 3, we will show that this is actually an algebra algebra. Algebra. And again, if I make my numbers any bigger, things kind of become too big. And so you'll probably have to study a quotient of this. But we haven't really gotten to that. Okay, so focusing on the binary cubic case. So if I just write out my definition, I would see that this algebra, the binary cubic generic Clifford algebra, is the algebra of a k with two generators, x and y, such that all of these things are in the center. So I want x. Are in the center. So I want x cubed and then this second sum and the third sum. I want all of those to be in my center. If you write all of these relations out, what you end up with is actually only three relations. And that's, so I get the free algebra over k and two generators, x and y, such that x cubed y is yx cubed, xy cubed is y cubed x. And then this third relation is just x squared y squared plus xy squared is equal to y squared x squared plus y x squared. Plus yx squared. And this algebra actually was studied in a very different context by Wang and Wu in 2012. And so they really did a classification of all global dimension five Arkansas regular algebras. And so they proved that this algebra is actually, again, just algebraically very, very nice. It's an Arkanschelta regular strong linear theory and so on and so forth. And then in 2019, this was again studied by Wang and Wang. This was again studied by Wang and Wang, and they proved that it's actually a PI algebra of PI degree 3, and they also computed its point variety and discriminant ideal. Okay, so the way now I like to think about this is that, well, I want to make this some sort of universal object, which means I somehow have to relate it to these, to my binary cubic forms that I started with. And the way I do this is that I really consider the affine 4-space as the space. four space as the space of binary cubic forms by just identifying a point A, B, C, D, just with the form that has this ABCD as its coefficients. And in that way, I can also look at the space of non-degenerate forms in there. So u inside of A4 is now just the affine subset corresponding to non-degenerate forms, meaning where the discriminant doesn't vanish. And what Cole Carney and I are able Are you able to prove is that, well, first off, the center of my algebra A is actually isomorphic to the coordinate ring of a relative quasi-projective curve or waveform, and it's exactly going to be elliptic over this U. So it's going to be elliptic whenever my corresponding form is non-degenerate. Furthermore, this elliptic curve is the relative Jacobian of the curve W cubed minus F. I write it slightly differently here because of course. I write it slightly differently here because, of course, I think of this as really a curve over my u, where u is again the space corresponding to the non-degenerate forms. Now, the Clifford algebra associated to a binary cubic form, that was semi-demeye algebra, so we want that as well. And it turns out, yes, that does work. So over this locus U, my generic Liverpool algebra is going to be again an Azumai algebra. And furthermore, the associated Furthermore, the associated Brauer class extends to the entire elliptic curve. So this is, again, the Jacobian of this curve, W cubed minus F in the way. And as it happens, this Berrow clause is actually never going to be trivial, no matter what, excuse me, no matter what base field we start with. And this is really interesting because if you remember from a couple slides back, I told you the Clifford algebra associated to a forum. Associated to a form is trivial, or the Brouwer class associated to that is trivial, then only if this curve W cube minus F has a point. And now this translates in our case here to our Brow class is trivial, then only if this relative curve now has a section, and it actually so happens that it never has a section. So let me, maybe in the last couple minutes, let me go over how we go about extending this Broward class because I think. Extending this growth class because I think it's a very, very nice geometric construction. So, the way this works is I start with assuming there is a section. So assume we have a section from our U, which again is the space of non-degenerate binary cubic forms, up into my relative curve, C. And now again, I want to look at my relative Jacobian of this and consider the universal line. And consider the universal line bundle on CJ, which now exists because I have a section. And then my algebra that I'm going to look at is the endomorphism ring of pi lower sub p. So p is, again, my procure bundle. And this turns out to be an extension of exactly the generic Clifford algebra. So in this case here, my pi here is just the projection onto the second factor. And so you can see here. And so you can see here also that, well, if I have a section, I have this construction here, so there's really end of this pyloris of P, which means I should get something that's trivial. But as I said, there is never a section, which means our whereout class will never be turbulent itself. Now, if I don't have a section, what we can do is we can use a tile descent to obtain our extension of the generic Clippert algebra to the Jacobian, to this relative elliptic curve. Okay, so this is what I want to say about the work Kulkarni and I have done so far. So let me maybe say just in the last minute what's still out there. So currently what we have is we have a moduli space describing these E, alpha, but there are some restrictions on what my E can be and what my alpha can be, right? So the first restriction is, well, I only was looking at J-invariant zero curves, and really it would be very nice if I And really, it would be very nice if I could extend it to other elliptic curves. But the second and maybe more crucial restriction that I'm putting on it is that I only have my alpha to be invariant under this order 3 optimomorphism. And so the question is, can I somehow remove this? Can I somehow make my space or my moduli stack bigger by including all of these cases as well? And then lastly, of course, and this is very, very far away, can we do something similar for the Something similar for the higher degree forms, so the Clifford algebra is associated to higher degree forms, where again, we somehow have to study these quotients because the Clifford algebra, the generic Clifford algebra there is not going to be an Ozomi algebra on its own. All right, thank you very much for listening, everyone, and happy birthday, Andre, again. So let's thank our speaker. Are there any questions or comments? I have a question. So you said that you have an isomorphism of moduli stacks. So you consider the non-singular locus, so you only consider non-degenerate binary cubic forms. So you know that in Woods work. Woods work on, so they have something which takes care of the degenerate forms as well. So, do you have an analog of this? I don't know. No, I've been thinking about that as well, that like there should be some way to account for those as well, but I haven't been able to really make it look nice yet. Okay. Thank you. More questions or comments? If there are none, then let's thank our speaker again. And the next talk will be at one five past one.
