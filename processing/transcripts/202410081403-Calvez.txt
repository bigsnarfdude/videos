The subject of the talk will be very close to Rebecca's previous talk. And it's also very important for me because I have to start with a disclaimer. I have a very narrow perspective on cooperation. So I'm sorry if I saw, I don't know, I'm a bit embarrassed. If some people think that it's not very serious, I take all responsibility for this because my purpose here is not really to draw new insights about the evolution of cooperation, but Evolution of cooperation, but maybe to present some framework that may help to resolve some questions about that. So it's a joint work with Frédéric Chardard, Jean Garnier, that we you heard about in the previous talk, and Helene Neutron. Uh Helen. And the the story that Helene is a uh she comes from probability and she she she has been uh thinking about the evolution of cooperation in the spatial structure. And we sort of put her ideas and intuitions into a P D model and that realized is a very rich in terms of structure. So my point is to present you a P D which is very simple, much A PD, which is very simple, much, I mean, of the same type as Rebecca presented, but with some drastic simplification, and to present you what you can do from a TD perspective, and maybe it can help to go further with more realistic and more meaningful problems. So, the model is the following: we will have a density in time, position, and theta, which is a braid, so x will be a 1D. The trait, so x will be the one special position, theta will be the trait, also 1D, which would be like a cooperation trait. And here we make a very, very strong assumption, which is that this trait will be both a trait for cooperation, in the sense that I will uh make a clear right answer, and diffusion. And diffusion. So, in some sense, we say that it's they are linked tightly linked together, and I will explain why later. For me, it's a very strong assumption. There is no to what little knowledge I have about that, it's not clear that corporation trait and diffusion trait must be linked together with the same effect. But this is what we put in the model, and I will I will command the limitation of that later. The limitation of that basis. So here's the PDE. So of course you have diffusion in space. Then you have mutation with some rate, constant rate mu, the rate of mutation. So this is very close to what the rebella presented. And then you have a growth. So A is a growth rate, and this includes several points. So I will start with the negative R. So in contrast with Rebecca, we assume that the individuals alone do really bad. So R is negative, R is positive, so negative, R is negative. So there is a first bad negative rate of reproduction. Then there is a cost of, let's say, Let's say, uh, producing a common good, and then there is a benefit, of course, there must be a positive term, of uh common goods, and then there is a saturation minus integral of f now a standard logistic saturation. The individuals are in competition for some some uh external research. Yes. So you see this right that the theta is is your trait and also the solid competition. Yes. Theta is very low it's near the same. But so far I'm I'm taking uh uh the same theta on both sides. I just have to say what is theta. And theta is is the same as in Rebecca's uh talk. It's a mean value of theta. is the mean value of theta, F B theta. So locally you look at the mean value of the trait and it gives you some proxy for the common. So where does this come from? The logic idea to me is to look at a common good. I create I pick S of T of X. And you can, so a local space. If you assume that it's produced by the population at rate proportional to gamma theta L. So all individuals produce a component proportion to their traits and that they also consume Consume good, regardless of a trait, bit of bit, is exactly something you should find out. It will give you S of Tx a quasi-stationary state of D. So it's a good proxy for for, let's say, uh uh uh a local uh quality of uh cover. quality of uh common of common wood. And probably the the the the main observation of this talk is that this is of order zero, which means that so it's a non-linear term of this equation. If you forget about the the saturation the standard saturation, there is only one non-linear term in this equation, which is uh this this term, but it's of order zero, which means that it will be compatible with uh exponential uh Compatible with exponential transformations. When you are looking for trading wave, for instance, or Hamilton-Jacobi limit, this will be compatible with that, and this is what I'm going to do. But let me start with some heuristics. So, when you are looking in a homogeneous space, so first if space is homogeneous, Uh if space is homogeneous, so there is no uh different space, you are just looking at a uh homogeneous problem, then it's very easy to guess and very easy to prove that theta is going to decay. Because of course there is a cost here and the benefit is the same for all, so there is a decay. Of course, this is a function of t of x. So theta is going to decay in spatially Homogeneous problem. And we know, and this is where the main motivation for this theta is, that in a range of expansion, this theta is selected for just by because of some pink individuals which arrive first at some place. They are preferential they uh necess I mean they they have the tendency to have a higher uh rate of dispersal. Probably higher rate of dispersal, so θ is selected for range expansion. So, as in Rebecca Castle, there is an opposite tendency, and you expect to see something interesting in this function. I try to show you one simulation of that. Which is a stochastic simulation of the exactly the same process. Theta is a diffusion refusion of individuals, and locally there is a rate of growth which is proportional to the common good. And what you're going to see is a cloud of points, which is the hygiene-based simulations. Then there is a density, which will be essentially the same. And here is the trait variable. So each individual. So each individual which is in some position X has some trait theta, which is between 0 and 2, the trait, and you will see evolving, and you will see that at the edge of the front there are mainly angles with large theta that makes the front propagating. And at the core, you will have the effect of decaying theta. So what you see in the front, actually there is a pulse Actually, there is a pulse wa there is a pulse wave, not like a standard traveling wave, which is monotonic, because at the back of the front there is this effect of a decreasing theta due to the counter-selection of theta. And you see here the side that you have a counter-selection of theta at the back. So, what I'm going to present to you is essentially a number of theory to explain this type of route, which is actually rather difficult. Type of room, which is actually rather difficult to my opinion, surprisingly difficult. But there is much more in this simulation. And one thing is that even once the front has gone through, we are still the population is not extinct. What I did not say is that what we are going to see is the PD is not able to catch it. The PD is going to tell you that there is no one after the front has passed because it's mainly PD. Because it's mainly people with a small theta, and people with small theta they produce very little common good, and because of the negative R, the population shrinks down. But in the stochastic simulation, there is an additional effect, which is purely due to stochasticity, which is persistence of the population even without disadvantage of dispersal evolution. And it's even more surprising that now if you say that the Now if you say that uh all individuals uh disperse at the same rate, so I remove this uh additional uh this advantage at the edge of the front due to uh dispersal evolution on special sorting. So of course it's less pronounced. It's not like a true traveling way. You would expect the population to uh to get uh down, but it persists for some reason, which I think is the same as in the previous simulation, but you see at the core of the front, I mean, at the back. I mean, at the back of the way, let's say, you still have some persistency effect, which is a very, very stochastic effect. And this would be very interesting to have tools to understand that, because here it's only the model, again, the simulation with the theta, which is only the corporation trait, not the the same for all individuals in this uh simulation. Okay, so what can we do in terms of uh math? We do in terms of math, we can draw some analogies. So, the first equation is the equation of turning wave. This is the only question I'm going to address today for the PE model, not for the stochastic simulation. And the question is, of course, under which conditions? There might not be trapping wave, there could be or there might not be. It depends. And of course, we can draw some analogy. Of course, we can draw some analogy with dispersal evolution. So, some people in the room may have noticed that if you remove the co-equation part, this is something which was called a K-I-Tode equation, which is uh which was studied a lot uh in terms of uh propagation and uh random expansion and with uh this uh trade uh theta. It has very uh with a plus r k units of the sort uh positive uh rate uh Some uh some uh positive uh rate uh rule frame to make a wave, but which uh which was uh very well studied and we are going to borrow some uh ideas of uh this uh thing. And more generally, working wave for specially for traits uh for structured computation like for example kinetic equations, or there are many equations for which There are many equations for which you have an additional space, you are looking for cooperation space, and you have some additional variable which could fit out for diffusion or cooperative trade, or it could be velocity equation for which you have to understand a tracking wave. And for this, it's always the same strategy. You are looking for a wave with mainly always the same strategy. You are looking for a wave with a separation of variables. So you are looking for a With a separation of variables, so we are looking for some f x and theta, which will be like an exponential of minus lambda x minus ceta. So charging wave over the rate of d k lambda far away in space, 10 times some f of theta, which is your stationary distribution in trait, the one that the rebellious previously, the one that will inform you about the fraction of. About the fraction of how people are distributed with respect to the trait at the edge of the plot. So, this is a very important quantity. And of course, in all this study, normalize your parameter, C is your n-norm, and F is like an auxiliary distribution that helps you to understand what C. Okay, so if you put that into your equation, so you will get the derivative in time, two-derivative in space. In time, together with in space. This will stay, this will act only on F. So I will begin with this one. So you will have a negative equation in F, and this is going to equilibrate theta lambda square plus R minus C lambda tai t. Title and uh what you see is that this is your unknown, C or C lambda, and this is an eigenvalue and L is the eigenvalue. So you have to solve an eigenvalue problem, uh and this is uh almost uh explicit in this case, but we are not going to discuss uh the the the explicit uh format. And of course if uh mu is uh And of course if uh mu is uh zero or or a single uh a monomorphic population so assume there is either no mutation or you have a monomorphic population which is essentially the same, then you recover FKPT equation. Because what you see is that you have uh theta lambda square plus r equals to c lambda. Okay. And uh Okay, and uh in this case uh you know the pretty early picture, so this is going to be called H this lambda. This is on a simply a parabola when you have the Fischer-Kapidi equation. So you have a parabola. And if you are looking at now C, C is a parabola delete by lambda, it's something which looks like this. This is in the case where R is positive. Of course, if R is negative, the parabola is negative at the origin, and which means that C is going to be something singular and okay. So now this is the standard thing. Now what yes, so the R depends on the F. So it's not The R depends on the F, so it's not a constant, right? Ah, if you think that you have a monomorphic population, then everything is constant because theta is a constant and this is the only one. But now comes the thing is that this is something which will be also involved. As I say, the very important thing is that if you plug the exponential, I mean, this is exponential, this is a tune for linear equation. So this up to this thing is essentially linear. This term is bounded. Linear. This term is non-linear, but because it's only an integral in theta, you can divide numeral term, denominator term, the expansion is going to disappear. This is the main thing, the main mathematical thing of this talk is. And now it turns out that you can compute fairly explicitly this. But I'm not going to compute, but I'm going to draw what is age, what is this is the first time in a traveling way that I uncontained. That I uncontained an H, which is not convex. So, H is going to have a bull shape. The fact that it's negative, that the origin is due to the minus R here. So, this is H. And now comes C, so as a function of lambda. And C is something which, because of the negativity, is Because of the negativity is something which comes from minus infinity. And then for some values, it has a local minimum at some point, lambda star. Okay. Let me ask you again, sorry. You say this is a function of lambda, but C lambda is H, so it would be just a linear function in lambda. So then when you wrote H is C lambda. So then it's a linear function in lambda. Yes, so we see the function. Yes, so we see the function. Everything is a function of lambda. f is also a function of lambda. Take a parameter lambda. You are going to make lambda vary. And for all lambda, you can call this guy H lambda. It's an eigenvalue of this problem, and this problem contains lambda here. And so the eigenfunction depends on lambda itself. So everything depends on lambda. Yeah, in all structure population, it's a substantial. In all structure populations, it's essentially the same story as FTP plus the fact that you have to solve an eigenvalue problem, but it's not eigenvalue problem. At the end of the day, what you compute is the eigenvalue. Either you call it h, the eigenvalue, or you look at h divided by lambda, which is a speed. And in all problems, I know the h is convex, which has very nice properties. And C is something like this, which has a unique global minimum. Here it's not the case. Uh globally, no. It is not the case. So first uh first thing so I'm confused because h is equal to something that is equal to something with an r in it, but r depends on theta in some way, right? Yes. So h is a function of theta as well? No, no, no, no. So okay, let me uh maybe I should write what you have to solve very clearly. Um so what you have to solve, because I I put R uh to to to as a shorter notation, but what you really have to solve. Notation, but what you will have to solve is so it's theta lambda square. So here you see the advantage of having dispersal trait theta is a trait in an expanding range because lambda is non-zero at the edge of the front. Minus alpha theta, this is a negative, this is why you see the two opposite things, minus r plus beta. This, now I'm going to call This now I'm I'm going to call it uh sorry it's an integral theta f divided by f times f. So you have to solve this guy and you can here's a trick you can solve it uh you you can okay the only thing that you have to solve to so this is not in addition to that but this is the scalar so you you take this you solve f and you find that there is one uh with scalar that you can solve. Uh Can solve. Okay, so at the end of this computation, you get this. And what are you looking for? You are not looking for, as I said, looking at simulation by some simple heuristics. What you seek is a pulse wave which is not monotonic in space and which looks like this. Which looks like this. Something which is going to travel with at the age individuals with a larger. I mean, the mil theta will be V, and here the mil theta will be small. Something which has mainly cooperator at the edge and mainly non-cooperator at the back. Okay? That connects zero to zero. And does this thing exist? zero and does this thing exist we don't know so we tried like the usual uh uh thing which is uh the usual uh i mean a very efficient method is to look at this uh amyloid jacobi framework where as uh Chris explained yesterday, you are going to look at a a large scale asymptotic, so you you introduce some epsilon which here to uh to take a long time, but Here to take a long time asymptotics, you rescale space as well to catch the fault in the long run. And you write this as an exponential of u epsilon over epsilon. And you look an equation, you seek an equation for u epsilon. And usually, this gives a very nice result, as in Chris's talk yesterday. You can really compute things explicitly. The result is that, in some sense, you remove stochasticity out of the problem in this. Stochasticity after the problem in this large-scale expansion. And here you do the same. Okay, that's it's again it's essentially based on the same idea that you look at the exponential of something and you can get an equation for u and you so the formally what you expect is that u, which is still a function of q t except theta is going to go, is going to converge. Is going to prove is going to convert to a function which only depends on t and x. There is some homogenization of principles here, which is pretty well understood for other equations of this type. And u is going to solve du over dt equals to h of u over dx with the Hazard Jacobi equation. And this H is the same as this, which is not convex. Which is the first surprise that we have an H which is not convex. At first, we were super happy because it's kind of different from the usual picture. But then it comes like a shock is that it's not, for those who have heard about that, usually you get a convex amita, and usually you get a viscosity. Usually, you get a viscosity solution, but this we know that it cannot be the viscosity solution. For some reason, the kind of a shocking fact is that you cannot be. So there is a There is a good evidence for that. Let me just explain why it's a bit tricky. Usually, what you get in all this thing, you start from something which looks like a linear equation, essentially. You make a non-linear transformation, so you get a non-linear equation. But in this non-linear transformation, there is a non-linear term that gives you the gradient of u square. And usually, there is a of u square and usually there is a a term which is an eps uh uh an epsilon episode u and these terms is going to uh to uh to uh to vanish uh as epsilon goes to zero is a whole theory about that because it's a singular limit because uh this is the the Laplace where you have a lot of the the uh the highest number of derivatives. And uh so it's a complicated theory, but usually it's always the same because this goes away. So, this goes away in the limit you expect to get something which is compatible with this vanishing Laplacian linear equation. And this is exactly what is called this Clausi solution. There are both solutions that come from this kind of approximation where you have an epsilon Laplacian that you that you uh that you uh that you remove in the so here we get the same, the this is still there, it goes away. But due to this uh non inner term A non-linear term which is there, apparently this completely destroys this theory. So we get a solution which is not a discouraged solution. And there is one reason for that, what we can just prove. It's that there is a small lemma saying that suppose u0, the initial data, is concave and negative. So concave is very is very much. It's very natural. You start from something which is localized somewhere to start your expansion, and you expect it to be concave and negative. Then we know that the viscous solution is such that u of p of x by some formula which is going to be by some formula which is going to be less than uh t times h of z which is going to uh go to minus infinity. So uh h of zero is negative, this is two to the minus r. So with some lemma which is new, but if it would be the viscous solution, it would uh go to minus infinity. This is not what you observe in numerical, this is not what we expect by intuition, which is a uh a wave like this. So there is uh some inconsistency some inconsistency. Inconsistency. And to conclude, I'm going to say another thing which is even more, I mean, in terms of TD, even more shocking, is that because it's a 1D problem after all, you can look at the derivative of this, which is a Scala conservation law, a Nicaraguan equation, very classic, for which this corresponds in some sense to a shock, because it's a concave part of it, so it's something which looks like a shock. And if you carefully look at the characteristics, you see that You see that the characteristics enter the shock from the right side, but they go out of the shock on the left side. So you have a shock for which the characteristics are going outside, which is completely non-classical. It's something which is of course not entropic and not consistent with the usual physics law of conservation law. But this is exactly what happens in this problem. In this program. So now we are at the point where we have nice simulations, we have some conjecture about this object, but we have no idea about how the solution is selected as epsilon goes to zero. And because we don't really understand the case epsilon equals to zero, we don't really understand how to construct such a way. And as I told you, what now I'm very interested in is to look at fructuations that could explain. Look at fluctuations that could explain the persistence of cooperation with special structure. To me, due to the fact that each time you have some empty place due to a collapse of the population, it could be repopulated by this type of wave. So what I think popula uh simulation does is that you have waves moving all around uh in a fairly empty spaces, uh space uh local position. Local position all the time, and I'm very curious about the results in that direction. As I told you, I think this we have this mathematical thing of putting a theta here to otherwise, yeah, of course I forgot to say if there is no theta here, there is no way. It doesn't work. So you need a theta in the P D, but I I I'm pretty sure that in the stochastic situation theta this theta here, this the strong assumption that we made, is not really uh uh important. Thank you very much. Fantastic. So, we have some time for questions. I got a little in doubt about this shock formation that happens. When I look at the equations, I would think that at the core of this process, the population would find a way to sort of balance out the benefits. Uh uh benefits and uh that part of you know like the cooperation and you mean here? No, down there. And so I would expect to see something like a common wave, I don't know. Just because at the core I would expect to see this population balancing out those effects and is that always the case? Like this always happens in the so if you take out the fusion and just solve the the partial differential equation in trade case, don't you get like a stable trait distribution ever? Distribution ever something like this. Yeah, good question. You have stable distribution on both sides, the right. They are related in this way. So on this side, you have you have an exponential with a minus lambda star x times f. x times f star. So with some working assumption, we can prove that actually, I forgot to mention that, this is a selected velocity. And then, of course, this is symmetrical respect to lambda, so you have the same picture on the other side for negative lambda. And because, so you expect And because so you expect a sorry, I put a minus here. So this is positive lambda, negative lambda. And because it's the same speed, because it's a real pulsar, it's the same speed, what we think, and what is absolutely clear numerical, is that this is a lambda plus on the right side, a lambda positive, and this is a lambda negative. Because they must match in terms of speed. So I agree that there are a stable distribution in. A stable distribution in theta on both sides, but they have completely different shapes. And this one has a large mean value of theta, and this one has a slow mean value of theta. I think you were right. I think I may be confused in my explanation, but you have a question later. Okay. So there was a question. Why what what what changes when you take or the like? So uh in this case uh you you you can have a persistence of the population at the back. Uh to be honest uh we didn't really investigate this one. I think you still have a complicated stuff such as I think that it does not restore the viscosity solution. Yeah, but I think it does not really matter here. Uh but we we just uh we Uh but we we just uh removed this from the analysis because we thought that the case of negative of h would be more interesting to uh but uh yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think it was. Yeah, I just had a question about the like biological rationale of the original model. So it looked like the mutation term, the Laplacian with respect to the trait, was separate from fecundity by the birth term, which was the average term. So is there a reason why that's separate? So is there a reason why that's separated? It's mostly mathematical. Mathematically, yes. For some other problem, I think, yeah, for this one, I have to think more about that. Because of course when it becomes negative uh i i it's an issue. Uh sure. It's it's a very good point. Uh I got convinced that some simpler case it's it's Some simpler case, it's it's not such a a bad uh assumption. But I agree with this one where you expect collapse of the population. Thank you for that. Thank you very much for a nice talk. Thank you. So now you guys look immensely tired. So I would suggest everybody get up. Just get up, stretch your arms, turn your body up. Look behind you. Everybody get up. Come on. Maybe you have to wake your neighbor. So do that. So you are using the projector?
