And I don't want to delay everyone's coffee time, so I will showcase some results. And if you have any interest, I'll be very happy to tell you any details afterward. Okay, so the topic is modern signal processing tools to study high-frequency physiological time series. Okay, so my research focus is kind of from sensor design to physiology, clinics, signal processing. Today I will focus only on Today, I will focus only on the signal processing part. And if you have interest in other parts, I'm happy to talk about it as I mentioned. So, I mainly want to do dynamics quantification. Okay, so I like to use this example, this signal as an example to demonstrate why this kind of work is difficult. So, this is the signal, the raw signal, you get if you record the signal from a pregnant woman. The signal from a pregnant woman, subdomin. So, this is called transabdominal maternal ECG signal. So, if you read it, you will see two components. One is a big cycle, big spikes, big spikes. Those are maternal's ECG signal, maternal's electrical cardiac cycle. And the small ones, small ones, those are fetus. So, the goal is what? There are two goals. The first one is: I have interest to understand how high variability is of the fetus. High rate variability is of the fetus. So you need to get fetal ECG signal before you can do so. I want to get more electrophysiological information about fetus heart. Maybe he has some arrhythmia or some congenital heart disease, but how to do it, unless you don't really go to use the very advanced techniques, which I don't mention today. So the challenge is: usually, if you want to do something mobile, you only have one or two channels. So you cannot count on the So, you cannot count on the traditional ICA tools or PCA tools, this kind of price source separation tools. Then, what can you do? Second, oh, you may say, okay, we are signal processing guys, so we can easily use a benpass filter to handle everything. But turns out it's not true. The challenge is, sorry, all the signals, both components, maternal and the fetal ECGs, they are both spiky. Because they are spiky, so the spectrum is broad. And the frequency. Growth. And the frequency, the heart rate of mother and heart rate of the fetus both changes from time to time. So you will see a lot of mix-up in the frequency domain. So venpass views are story. Third, as you can see, this kind of heterogeneous noise. The noise sometimes can be crazy. Then what can you do about it? That is the challenge. Okay, so first tool I will showcase is called the Nano. Will showcase is called the nonlinear time frequency analysis. This is the only kind of lectural slide I will do today, only one, so that you have a basic idea. So we all know that if you have some signal, this is the PPG signal actually, you know it is a slow here, fast there. If you want to quantify slow or fast, what can you do? A very simple idea always people use is less truncated and the run Fourier transform. And what is it in statistics? It's tapered. In statistics, it's tapered periodogram, right? And you do this window, and you get some Fourier transform periodogram, and you tap this window, you get another one. So you can put them together, and you get this 2.5D picture, and it tells you, hi, when time goes, the frequency somehow increases, and you can also visualize it using a plot. The intensity indicates the stress. Indicates the strength of the oscillation and the location indicates the frequency at which time. Okay, so unfortunately it doesn't work. If it works, I won't be here. This is the Schottheim Fourier transform of this maternal transp nominal maternal ECG. It's difficult to interpret, even if I have the brown truth. It's very difficult to interpret. You see, this is one line. You see, this is one eye. What is it? There are some kind of, and there are several beautiful bubbles. What are they? And, well, good luck for interpretation. But we have an algorithm which designed, we call that the shape, Fourier transform, which is published in JFAA in 2017, which I will not go into details, but this is a result of such a transform. And once you apply such a transform, what do you get? You get two components. You get two components. One component, two components. And what are they? Maybe they're just junk, right? Just junk. But in the end of the day, this is maternal heart rate, this is fetal heart rate. How can I be so sure? Because I have wrong truth. I have a direct contact fetal ECG. So I have his heart rate. I superimpose it, I see details. Okay? And uh so far is I believe our algorithm can perform the best uh if you only have one or two channels. If you only have one or two channels. And there have been some publications which I don't list. And the one clinical application is a joint work with my collaborators, gynecologists, in Munich, and they collected data from females, and they know if she is depressed or so on, straight, not depressed, straight or so on. Why do we have interest in this? Because there has been evidence showing that if a female, when she's pregnant, she's When she's pregnant, she's straced, then the fetus will have a higher chance to develop AST, like autism, spectrum disease, and so on. So, whatever it is, we collected data and we run some heart rate variability index, which again, I don't tell you details, and turns out it works quite well. And the paper has been published in clinical journal, the first one. And the first one was finished in 2018, and we have a continuing study. Study. Okay, so from now on, everything will be fast. So don't worry, I think I can finish in 15 minutes. Showcase. This is a photoplastic smoke gravity during exercise. The signal I get from this kind of, I really don't know what it is, forget. But anyways, that is crazy. If you just use your eyes, difficult to see anything. Show time for your transform, pretty. Again, you may win some art, whatever, award, but it's difficult to do scientific interpretation. Difficult to do scientific interpretation. Use a D-shaped idea. You get a few nice, and you can see this very dominant nice heart rate. And what is this guy? This turns out to be your working reason, your running reason. Your running reason. And so if I have a triaxial accelerator signal, which we do in this case, I can use that to estimate your working running reason and do the mask. And if I do the mask, I get heart rate back. And again, we We have a benchmark database, and I think so far the result is still the best, even nowadays. Yeah, I think so. And you can also use get respiration from the PVG signal. And this is the result. PVG signal, you can see some slow oscillation. And you short time Fourier transform Gulag again. You can see even some AM phenomenon here. This AM phenomenon and this kind of multiples and Gulak. Of multiples and blah. But if you run D-shape, you get two components only. And we have ground truth in this case. So, again, I think that is a state of the art. And you can do decomposition if you like. And we can decompose the PVG signal into these hemodynamic cycles and the respiratory signals. How can I be so sure? Because I have simultaneously recorded ECG signal and antidote CO2 signal. CO2 signal. And there are some interesting phenomenons. For example, you see that from the original signal, it's difficult to see this, but from here, you can see there's a small ear popping up, right? And if you work with PVG, you know that it's called dycurotic notch. And this dyrotic notch indicates some hemodynamic variations. And the reason we see this is the patient was kind of cut in between. So he has some kind of natural stimulation reaction. Natural stimulation reaction, and so on. Okay, and the non-contact PVG, I also work on it, which is maybe closer to the topic of this conference. I work with different people in this non-contact PVG via RGB channels or even infrared channel. And this is the signal you get when patient is working on a training at constant speed. And this is the result, heart rate. And we have ground truths, the red one, and the working reason. Okay, and you can also use. And you can also use applied algorithms to decompose or to recycle cardiogenic artifacts. If you work with physiological signals like respiratory signals, then I think cardiogenic artifact is somehow very annoying. But don't worry, the algorithm can help you not only to remove it better compared with the traditional algorithms, it also can help you to recycle cardiogenic information, which means if you have respiratory Which means if you have a respiratory signal, maybe at some point you can also collect high-rate variability information. And this is the signal if you use the state-of-the-art algorithm, which is based on BenPass field and so on. And this is based on our algorithm. You just visualize it. I think you can see the difference. But we certainly have some more quantification. If you have interest, I can show you. High for and a second part, I have maybe five mo minutes, I guess. I have maybe five m minutes, I guess. High-dimensional functional analysis data set. So, here I will count on manifold learning and optimal rankage. It's a random metric theory, random metrics tools, which I will not go into detail again. I will just show you the result. First result is we can extract fetal ECG and extract even captural fetal arrhythmia. So, this is the original transabdominal maternal ECG. This is the decomposed maternal ECG and the Maternal ECG and the final fetal ECG. So you can see that there is a blood normal P. So this is arrhythmia we can catch. And the second one is premature atrial contraction. You can see that there is a P, P, and the T disappears. There's no P, if you know how to read ECG signal. And there's P, P, okay, no P, P. Which I would say not perfect yet, because we only have one channel. In this case, we use, yeah, this is one channel result. In this case, we use, yeah, this is one channel result. And we are trying to improve it. But, anyways, it has been published in Physiological Measurement with Duke Pediatric Cardiologist. And we can also work on F wave extraction. So, if you ever work with F wave analysis, what is F wave? Atrial fibrillation patients. The atrium is kind of broken, so it generates a lot of FR. So, you can, it generates a lot of F wave and so on. So, the question is: can you decompose it, get the atrial information out of the ventricular information? And this is the result. The gray one is the ECG signal, the red one is the decomposed F wave. We are trying to use this F wave information to predict the outcome, mortality, and so on, but unfortunately, so far, after that many years, we still cannot get any good better results compared with heart rate, which is a kind of negative result. Rate, which is a kind of negative result, but we still want to share the one, but there's more too many details here. And another one is a single-channel mobile EEG signal, which is this kind of crazy, whatever it is, is from ETH, and there's the ultimate goal. And it's a collaboration with some neuroscientists. So, what we want to do is you get this is an EEG signal, you get cardiogenic artifacts. How to recycle the cardiogenic artifacts, just like what we mentioned. Artifact just like what we mentioned before, and this is the result you can get. This is the EEG signal we recovered. This is a cardiogenic artifact. Okay, and I also work on this direct cortical stimulation or different stimulation stuffs. Beta burst modification is kind of recently quite hot. But anyways, this is: if you have this 128 intracranial EG signal and you have stimulation, you can get a lot of spikes. You can get a lot of spikes. Traditional approach is always: hey, ICA, very good ICA. You see a lot of spikes and they get contamination. And if you run our algorithm, you can get this back. And I think all the performance, all the indices are kind of better. Okay, how to visualize. Maybe give me one more minute. Okay. I actually have several other things want to say. But, anyways, how to visualize our trilogue signal. For example, Zeo patch. People like it, right? Buddhism. Okay, okay. 14 days. Very good. Read it. Read it. Read it. Okay. 14 days. Good, read it, read it, read it. Okay, 14 days. Okay, who will read it? Okay, let's say, okay, okay, one day, okay, one day, one day, okay, read it, okay? One hour, okay? Read it, okay, read it, okay, okay, five, one minute, read it, okay? If you show this to physician, physician will say, okay, please, ten seconds, don't do this to me. That is how they read it. And this is how I was trained when I was a physician. Okay, you have to do this. This is the signal. And how many? 120, good luck. 120, good luck! What readings for you? Even if your wife has this signal for you and asks you to read it, will you read it? Come on. I'm sorry. So, our goal is, can we visualize it in a more efficient way? Another question in the operation room, you have so many different channels. For example, ECG channel, ABP channel. And in this case, the patient has kind of intra-OP myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction. So you can see ST elevation, ST elevation, ST elevation, but in ABP you don't see anything. So if I only give you PBG signal or ABP signal, what can you do? Can you visualize or detect this intracardio-myocardial infarction? That is a challenging business. Or can you combine both so that you have a better understanding of the dynamics? That is a sensor fusion problem, which I will not talk today. But we have some algorithms to handle it, although not perfect. This is a demonstration of This is a demonstration of 15-hour waveform from liver transplantation, and this is the ABP signal. As you can see, that will be the result we will show to physicians in the future. So, you can see different colors indicates different phases of the surgery. And you can, from here, understand the differences and the relationships. Okay, so I'm done. Or just give me one more. Or just give me one more minute. I very quickly go over it. What is a phase in the standardization of phase extraction? Everyone does phase. You use EGEG signal, you use phase. You use everything, you use phase. But phase traditionally goes this way. Analytic function model, no exception. As far as I can tell, we have done quite a lot of literature survey. No exception. Here we transform, web transform, this kind of empirical mode decomposition, whatever you name it. Now I show you four respiratory signals recorded signals. Four respiratory signals recorded simultaneously. If you use the traditional model and you calculate the phase, sorry, you get four different phases, get four different instantaneous frequencies. How to compare, how to communicate in between different labs, how to communicate in between different equipment. No way, you need to standardize it. And the point is, if you want to standardize it, you have to know what phase is. And our model and our algorithm can give you this guy, instantaneous frequency, not only coincide. Coincide, but also physiologically meaningful. And if you want to do a coupling indexing between cardiac and pulmonary, and this is the result, if you run this blind outmane plot, you'll see that using a synchro-squeezing transform, what we proposed, you get a much more consistent comparison indices. Final slide, reliability issue. So we all trust Philips or GE, don't you? At least I trust them. Don't you? At least I trust them. And because I trust them, I wasted a lot of time on it. This is Felix Patient Monitor. This is called Pulse Chancit Time. And if you run past transit time, in a patient, you will see this kind of pretty pattern. And in the very beginning, I was so happy. I said, oh, because we work with a very ultra-long signal, so we can see some very low-frequency oscillations. So we are so great. We find something excellent. But it turns out this is an artifact. And this is an artifact. And why do we want to care about pulse transit time? And why do we want to care about pulse transit time? Because it's related to mean block later. Okay, so turns out this garbage. And we have an algorithm to correct it. Summary is both have mathematical, statistical support. Source code is available. If you have interest, you can use it for my website or write me an email. But they are generic code, I have to say. All are designed for real-time implementation. But they are right now so. But they are right now soft, and the hard version will be announced soon. And I need help for almost everything, so I'm happy to talk because, well, my knowledge is too limited, and this medicine is kind of too large. Thank you very much. Yes? I have a quick question with respect to this issue. With respect to this shape short time for it transforms. You briefly mention my thing is that it allows you to use that information that previously we were showing as this QD map, which is showing the time frequency, how it means with the use of this window technique. So what kind of a data this method works? For example, if I'm interested in identifying tremor in a heart with self-disease patients, and I'm having like a high density measurement on your products or whatever. Okay, so first one, for the trimmer, if you are during the trimmer period, yes, you can use it. But if there is no trimmer, it's just a kind of free movement, free movement, it won't work ver that well. But it will give you still some information that is there's nothing. Steal some information. That is, there's nothing. That is, there's nothing. No trimmer. Okay, but what is the no-treamer mean? There are many possibilities. But for this tool, for this kind of data, which I haven't seen, so I don't know, but it has a potential to tell you if there is a tremor or not. First one. Second part: this algorithm is designed for signals that is oscillatory. If the signal is oscillatory, for example, you have an interest in For example, you have interest in whatever signals that is repeating itself, even with some crazy shapes, that can be applied. But if the signal is kind of random, for example, keeping a Gaussian random noise, and what will this behave? Okay, to be honest, we do not know. We are kind of doing some analysis on this kind of random process analysis of the shape, but the calculation is a bit intimidating. So, students, it's a bit slow. Students, it's a bit slow, so then I cannot. Yes? I have some previous experience working on some fetal and maternal RV data. And I don't really know about the technology behind it, but my collaborators, she uses a device called Monitor. Monica. Yes, Monica. Yeah, so essentially, from what I, what she told me, she said essentially the Monica device used some algorithm to separate the Device used some algorithm to separate the signal. Yes. And so is that similar to what you're doing? And I guess your stuff is much better than theirs? Well, first, our experience is their algorithm is not very reliable, but their algorithm is preparatory, so we do not know what they use. But you can guess, because the developers are those groups and they have publications. But our experience and But our experience and at least the physician's visual inspectation shows that if using our algorithm, the so-called heartbeat R interval information about the fetus is better, more reliable. Because if you, I should show one picture, one result for you to compare. Just when the signal-to-noise ratio is all quite, it's low, or if the ECG has, if the feet If the fetus has some kind of dramatic change of the status, then the algorithm tends to fail. Yeah, yeah. I think that's a big problem, especially when there is a sudden drop, not like huge deceleration of the feed of our radius. The two signals were mixed together and we were not able to separate them. Yes, that is a challenging part. Yes. Right, thank you. I have a really similar question where I have post-war data and the heart rate is sort of extracted from something called blood pressure. Extracted from something called blood pressure volume. Okay. And I don't know if you've got something you're familiar with, but the proprietary algorithms from the company basically do works at estimated heart rate when the person is moving more. Okay. Which is a pretty big problem for any kind of company. I haven't touched this problem, so I cannot say comment too much. But I believe if maybe we can talk more afterwards, like if there's a signal and you can show me some signals, then maybe I can give you some, yeah, maybe there'll be some signals. Some, yeah, maybe there'll be something, yeah. But these signals are very different from the ones you are getting from. Just to make it clear, so his signals are electrical in nature because there is a monitor that gets the electricity from the heart of the baby, so it's highly sensitive to that. Yeah, I think you're thinking one lot of pulse. Yeah, so yeah. So that's PPG, basically. So it's just a PPG sensor. And we've actually, that study that I referred to yesterday is exactly that, that we've seen like 30% increase. That we've seen like 30% increase in error in PPG heart rate. So I think that this is actually a really cool application of that on the PPG signal to that device. Yeah. I have a comment about the PVG. So I have an impression that the PVG does not work well when there's a sudden change of the heart rate. So it's kind of the signal, the overall signal was smooth or something, where it's like moving everything. So that doesn't work well when you're So that doesn't work well when you're, for example, doing sudden kind of a very intense movement, but buddy works generally okay if you're, for example, jogging or something like that. Is it true? It depends. Everything is different. Yeah. That's why this idea of the hardware and the software combination is so important, because both affect the data that you see homework. PPG signal is very challenging. And PPG signal is very challenging and very annoying, to be honest. If you see the signal recorded during the surgery. I got to do a paper on blood pressure estimation with PPG. I just had to do the pictures. But it it it depends on the shape of the pulse and that's that's highly sensitive to the pulse shape. That's why. Yeah, one of the things I want to understand is that this is a problem that I can correct more in this data. If you have interest in this, I can share some experience. Yeah, I mean, the main challenge is, in the end of the day, the definition of what PBG is. Maybe we can stop here, take a half-hour break, and return to the speaker. We turn to the speakers on our time. I'm sorry, you're watching this.
