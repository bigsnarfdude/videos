So we're going to do just a very short bit on FSP and then most of it will be on the control sector. So here's Wright's description of what he meant FST to be. So it should be noted that if the coefficient F, and it means FST here, is used for the purpose for which it was originally introduced. Was originally introduced, the description of population structure. It cannot take cognizance of rates of mutation or selection since these are specific for each locus. So essentially, he's saying that selection might be targeted to a handful of loci of the same genome. But population infrastructure affects the entire genome. It sets the context for the entire population. And so the pattern was supposed to be not specific to any locus. Now, one possible glitch here is that, of course, you have to estimate FST from genetic diversity at a load. So here's a Here's a graph of 34 studies that were published in molecular evolution in a two-year time period. So they measured various flavors of LST. So here's phase GST, and these are scaled measures of GST. So GST is plotted against the heterozygosity of the sample set in which the Of the sample set on which the GST was was estimated. So, where is the gossip? So, the scaling does change the balance of FST a bit. But the overwhelming trend is this downward trend. So the loci that have high Heroes of Austin microsatellites. Microsatellites have low GST. Things that have lower, it's like oxygen or higher GST. So this was viewed essentially as a constraint. So the main thing that I want to cover during this time is to ask this question, exactly what are we trying to do? We're trying to do. So we might be looking at FSD just as a summary statistic. In bioinformatics, you can just try and look for patterns and trends, but not necessarily with any reference to the process that produce the genetic diversity. So that's perfectly fine. That's one application. Another application Another application is that you want to do some kind of statistical inference. So you want to know something about the population from which the sample came. And so you might want to estimate population parameters. Is the population subdivided? If it is, what are the migration rates? What are the rates of crossing over? What are the rates of mutation? And so on. Another thing is that you might want to compare different data sets. Different data sets. So are populations, some populations more structured than others. Our African populations have lower FSP than out of Africa populations. Or some loci more tightly associated with each other than other locations. And a really key question here is whether we're talking about a property of the population versus property of the sample. So, what are we trying to do? So, recently I wrote this kind of historical summary of FST in molecular biology and evolution. So, it's kind of a, it goes over the historical development of FST and it's coming from very many sources. Very many sources. Okay, so there's the partitioning of variance components, like from the weird and cognitive group. It includes identity by descent within a pedigree. And it also includes MACE GST, which is based on diversity in a sample. So people are coming at it from all kinds of directions. A lot of kinds of directions. Mainly, they were talking about FST as a property of the population rather than of the sample. But you can do a likelihood-based approach. And because we're talking about likelihoods, we are talking about properties of the sample, not of the population. So if you redo May's hierarchy, Hierarchy, then you can write down these components of the hierarchical components of structure. And for the particular case of the island model with inbreeding and K allele mutation, then GST within this context is equal to Benz. Now, this delta thing is one if there's random mating within the deeds. P is the number of deans within this island model. M is the scaled migration rate. K is the number of alleles in this K-all rotation model. So K might be 4 for nucleotides or 20 for amino acids. Amino acid. And then there's this theta. So theta is the mutation rate. And so if you set delta is equal to 1, your norm mutation, and there's an infinite number of beads, then you get the classical FST is equal to 1 over 4NM. But mutation is here. Is here. And so you can view this trend either as a constraint, but within the context of this likelihood-based approach, it's not a constraint so much as information. So it's telling you information about what this theta is. About what this theta is. Different loci may have different thetas. And so FST, if you define it this way, is kind of inextricably interacting with the mutation. And so there are locus-specific elements because you have to estimate population structure from the diversity. So that's the main point that I want to make. Point that I want to make. So it's the effect of the magnitude of genetic diversity and the pattern of genetic diversity. So now I want to talk about LD, a linkage to sequeluprium. And so it's very similar, actually. So suppose we have locus 1 here, and so we can have a random. And so we can have a random variable x1, which takes on the value 1 if it's a big A allele, say value 0, it's little A. And we have locus 2, and then we have another random variable X2 for that. Then linkage this equilibrium is association that determines. So you can So, Wright proposed a correlation coefficient as the measure of L D. And so it's just a Pearson correlation. So I want to make the point, okay, that all of this is talking about frequencies in the population. It's not the sample population in which you have F11 as that kind of. F11 as that kind of haplotype that has the one allele at both loss. And this P1 and P2 are also properties of the population. So it's very similar to GST. So this is from Noah's lab, that you can scale or You can scale or not. So you can normalize the linkage to the cycle rhythm or not. And you can square things, you can do all of this relative to some scale. But in the end, everything depends on the pattern of variation, the magnitude of variation. So it's very difficult to separate those two. Those two. So, what I'm going to do is to describe a likelihood-based approach to LD, which is very similar to this likelihood-based approach to FS. So, since these are essentially likelihoods, of course, it depends on how you took the sample. So, we're talking about four genes to what you explode. Genes to each locus. And so you could have sampled it. So these four genes could have come on two chromosomes, three chromosomes, or four chromosomes. So there are three sampling configurations. Then the likelihoods are going to, of course, depend on how you sample things. So we can look at We can look at the sample now of these four genes and ask how many, what is the probability of seeing a haplotype that has the one gene, well, that has identity by descent, okay, at locus A and locus B. Locus B, locus A, and both of them are identical by descent for those two haplotype. For those two have half the types. That's one problem. That's that probability, and then you have the other half fields. Then the marginals here are the probability of identity by descent at locus A or the probability of identity by descent at locus B. Then, so these things, and here, the basic things. In here, the basic things in there are likelihood, the probability of observing that happening in the sample. So you can form this function of the light liquids called that. And because things are either identical by descent or not, it's just so it's either zero or one. But you can also look at this function as an expectation of t. So this is a usual way of writing stuff. So that's for genes that are sampled within the same individual. Then you can do that for genes that are sampled between individuals, from different individuals. From different. Then you have this other measure of disequilibrium, which I'm calling DCLQ. Alright, so actually I'm going to skip over the model, which would tell you how I came up with these values. Sorry about that, but only. About that, but I only had so much time. So these are essentially the results. And so we can look at the loose linkage case. So S is inbreeding, it's partial something. And I put that in there just to be kind of a proxy for population structure. So reproduction happening on a time scale, which is much, much shorter. Much, much shorter than the mutation time scale or the colonous time scale. And then the combination rate, the rate of crossing over, can either be on this side or that side. So in the loose linkage case, it's on this side. And so it's happening on a time scale that's faster than mutational coalescence. So in this case, the between The between individual disequilibrium coefficient is always zero. The within population coefficient depends on the rate of selfing and also the combination rate. So, this is called Linkage Disequilibrium by Weir and Cochrane. And so, in the 1970s, they were 1970s, they worked out what I'm calling within the individual linkage disequilibrium. So it depends on the cell phone rate here and the rate of recognization, but has this non-monotonic relationship with the rate of self-hate. So as Linkage Lewis Linkage loosens, this measure of disequilibrium gets smaller. Less identity disequilibrium, you have looser linkage. But then you have this non-monotonic relationship. And essentially, this is because if you have basically an out-crossing population and then you add a little bit more something, then the correlation between Then the correlation between the genealogies of locus A and locus B become closer. The disequilibrium measure goes up. But if you have too much salt, so that you're in this region, then you have less diversity. It goes down again. So there's a trade-off between shared genealogical history and the level of genetic diversity. And so this is in my notation what we're in concerns identity disabled. So it's this within individual D, but then it's scaled by this diversity measure, but it's for between individual diversity. So this one minus So this 1 minus G sub A is the probability that if you pick two genes from locus A from different individuals, they will not be identical by state. So that's what identity disequilibrium, when I plot it on the last slide, is. But why scale it by, why scale within individual disequilibrium by between individual diseases? Equilibrium by between individual diversity. You could scale it by within individual types and get this. So this is nicer because now it has a monotonic relationship with S. So as S increases, this measure, this scaled measure of this equilibrium gets big. Big. Unfortunately, it doesn't, it can get big without without bound. But it is monotone, which I think is more useful if you want to think about what cellmes do. Okay, so that was the first part. That's loose language. Loose linkage, then for tight linkage, the combination of rate is on the same order of the coalescence rate and the mutation grade. And then, so now both the within individual disabled and between individual discipline depends on everything. And so it depends on the population structures, the rate of crossing over, and the Of crossing over and at Bosno is side. And so this case of tight linkage is really tight. So Sarah Tishkov, I think, was the first to point out that, look at this equilibrium is lowest in Africa. It gets higher as you get out of Africa. So this is based on markers that are like 10. Markers that are like 10 kilobases apart. So that's on the order of this R being about four. So um all right, so uh now we can talk about between individual the second grade. Between individual disequilibrium, and then you can scale it by the between individual diversity. And so this has been proposed before. This is Ota's standard identity excess. So this is how it depends on the mutation rate. So this is that scaled That scaled standardized identity excess against the recombination rate here. And so they all show this declining relationship. And the higher the mutation rate gets, the lower the disequilibrium. And then if you do it, okay, and then. Uh okay, and then this is within individual disequilibrium. It's for the simple case of symmetric my uh symmetric mutation, then you have this declining relationship with the combination rate and an increasing relationship with the level of cell. So, this population structure increases, this equilibrium measure. This equilibrium measure increases monotonically. So, this is again from Noah's lab. So, we're talking about that very, very tight linkage of 10 kilobases. So, you do see that relationship with R. Then different populations have different Have different, so they all have that form, okay, but the same form is migrated up. So I was hoping that this would kind of indicate the effect of population structure. Okay, so Okay, so if you want to scale things by the maximal LLV, you can. And so these are the maximal values. And it depends upon what kind of, how you took the sample. It depends on the sampling configuration. So this, so it could be in two chromosomes, three chromosomes, or four chromosomes. Four chromosomes. And there's a different maximum if it's two chromosomes, three chromosomes, or four chromosomes. So you can scale it if that's what you want to do. Basically, I think we're back to this question. So basically, you can use whatever decision you can use. You can use whatever decision grid measure you like. But people should try to answer this question, I think. What are they trying to do? And when they produce these numbers. So there is this thing about the dependence on theta, and it goes so doing it on a sample-based approach. Based approach doesn't remove that dependence on the mutation rate. And so if you really want to kind of duck the problem, you can look at loose linkage and then look at disequilibrium within individuals but under random dating. Then that scaled disequilibrium rate is true. The second lubricant rate is truly independent of the mutation rate. So but that's the only one. Otherwise, it depends on everything. But if you scale it this way, then at least you have this monotone property. So that is, as you increase population structure, the secholubin goes up. As you increase recombination rate, the sequelibrum goes down. Um I don't know that I'm I'm I'm done so maybe one question just so we can peek out so we can keep it Well, maybe let's just let's just uh um move on uh and uh catch Marcy and
