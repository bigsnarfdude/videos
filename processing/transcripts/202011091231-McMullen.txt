To go through them in complete detail, but one will be a new category of modular symbols, and the other will be a new kind of height that facilitates a descent argument in the number theory part. Okay, so let me first start by talking about some naive questions about groups and distinguishing non-arithmetic groups from the arithmetic ones. So I'm going to start by stating a technique. To start by stating a technical theorem, just because I probably won't get to the details of it, but this is an abstract, general statement, more general than the specific cases I'm going to describe, which underlies a lot of the results I'm going to formulate. So this has to do with the study of algebraic curves on a Hilbert modular surface. So the data that goes into this result is you have a real quadratic field, and then associated to that field, And then associated to that field, there is a surface, which is the product of two copies of the upper half-plane, modulo, roughly speaking, SL2 of the integers in K. And that group embeds using the two different places of K to become a discrete subgroup of isometries of the product of two upper half-planes. You form the quotient. This is called a Hilbert modular surface. And I'm going to be interested in curves sitting on this surface which are totally geodetic. Which are totally geodesic for not the symmetric space metric, but for what's called the Kobayashi metric. That means roughly the curves are covered by the graph of a function, a holomorphic function from H to H. And so these curves include the classical Shimura curves, which are arithmetically defined curves on Hilbert modular surfaces, but they're much more general. And Shimura curves on the Hilbert modular surface can be. Curves on the Hilbert modular surface can be compact. And so the theorem I'm going to rely on is this new theorem, which I'm going to call theorem Q, which says if you have one of these geodesic curves on a Hilbert-Montler surface, it's either a traditional Shumura curve or it has to have cusps. It can't be a compact curve. It has to go off to infinity to the boundary of the Hilbert modular surfaces. And in fact, the cusps have to correspond in a natural way with the full Way with the full projective line over the field K. And even more, the cusps satisfy some sort of quadratic height bounds. So, rather than trying to explain all the details in this statement, I'm going to illustrate this with the application to triangle groups. I'm going to call that theorem Q, the Q is for quadratic. And unfortunately, this kind of theorem, the method of proof, doesn't generalize to, say, Hilbert modular threefolds, and it may very well be false there. And it may very well be false there, as we'll see towards the end. Anyway, it facilitates the proof of this is by a descent argument, using this new height I mentioned at the beginning. Okay, so first let's talk about triangle groups. So for any pair of integers P and Q, there's a lattice in SL2R called the PQ infinity triangle group. And the quotient of the upper half plane by this lattice is an orbifold. And you can obtain it by just taking Obtain it by just taking a hyperbolic triangle with the internal angles pi over q, pi over p, and pi over zero, if you like. There's one vertex of the triangle is at infinity. And then you double it. You glue two copies back to back and take the fundamental group. That's a discrete subgroup of SL2R. And it has a naturally associated trace field, which comes from the traces of the elements in this group. Elements of this group. Technically, they're squares. And because of these orbifold points, the trace field involves cosines of angles related to P and Q. Okay, now when is this group arithmetic? It's arithmetic exactly when this trace field is Q. So I'm taking these triangles groups as an example of a domain of discourse where we can see the difference between arithmetic and non-arithmetic groups. Arithmetic and non-arithmetic groups. I'm not going to bother to define what an arithmetic group is because the only one you'll see in this case is one you're very familiar with. Namely, the 2,3 infinity triangle group is just SL2Z. So it's generated by this upper triangular matrix and by this matrix of order 4. That's a complete description of the group to give those two generators. And it has a natural A natural tiling by a fundamental domain that's familiar to everyone. Here you can see the 2,3-infinity triangle. There's the point fixed by this element of order 4. It acts with order 2 on the hyperbolic plane. There's a fixed point of order 3. And then there's the cusp at infinity. Two copies of this triangle form a fundamental domain for the action of the group. And these transformations, of course, geometrically act on the upper haploid. Geometrically act on the upper half-line by just translation by one, which identifies this edge to this edge, and z goes to minus one over g, which identifies this edge to this edge. The green dots indicate the fixed points. Now, what is great about the arithmetic group? First, let me add one more feature to it. Associated to this group are the cusps. The cusps are the orbit of this point at infinity in the fundamental domain. Point at infinity in the fundamental domain, but they could just be described geometrically very simply. You take the line at height one, and then you put underneath it a circle as big as you can draw, one touching zero and one touching one. And then you put the biggest circle you can underneath that, and the biggest circle you can underneath that, and you just keep going, and you look at the places where these circles rest on the real axis. And those are the cusps of SL2Z. SL2Z. Put differently either the fixed points of the parabolic elements in this group or the orbit of the point at infinity because there is only one cusp in the quotient surface. And we know what the cusps are. They're just the rational numbers you need infinity. In fact, the beautiful thing about an arithmetic group is you can survey the entire group at a glance. For example, if I ask you what matrix, what numbers appear as matrices in SL2Z, the answer is every. In SL2Z, the answer is every integer appears. If I ask you when do two integers form a column vector for SL2Z, the answer is their GCD has to be one. So we can get a comprehensive and global picture of arithmetic groups. And the reason is that these groups consist of all of the integer solutions to some, in this case, quadratic equation, determinant is equal to one. Okay, so now let's move on. Okay, so now let's move on to the non-arithmetic case. So the other triangle groups that do not have trace field Q are not arithmetic and they're more mysterious. There's not a single example where one can say what the matrix entries are. There's not a single example where one can concretely characterize what the columns are. But there are a few examples where we can say what the cusps are. Where we can say what the cusps of the group are. And what I'm what I, the interest, I think, in trying to study these non-arithmetic groups is to try to get a handle on the shape of the group, even though it's impenetrable from the traditional arithmetic perspective. Okay, so one of the corollaries of theorem Q is that we know what the cusps are for the PQ infinity triangle group. They're everything they can be. That is, they're the project. They can be, that is, they're the projective line over the field of definition, or at least their cross ratios are, as long as the field is quadratic. And the reason this is true is that every triangle group comes from a geodesic curve on some Hilbert modular variety attached to the field K. When the field K is quadratic, that's a Hilbert modular surface, and theorem Q applies. For Hilbert modular threefolds, this theorem is not true. This theorem is not true, and the argument doesn't apply. Okay, so in the this is sort of the next layer after the arithmetic case is the quadratic case. And we get a good handle on the cusps. And for most of the talk, I want to concentrate on a specific non-arithmetic group, which I call the golden Hecke group. And if you like, once you've introduced the golden mean, 1 plus the square root of 5 over 2, you can think of this group very concretely as. Think of this group very concretely as just the group generated, very much like the group SL2Z. There's this element of order 4 that xyz goes to minus 1 over z. And then instead of translation by 1, you have translation by gamma, gamma being the golden mean, 1, gamma, 0, 1. Okay, so there's a similar tiling of the upper half plane by a fundamental domain for this group. It's now bounded by a strip of width gamma up here, but and by Gamma up here, but by the unit circle down here, just as for the upper half plane. And these generators act by gluing this side to this side and by fixing this point to give an orbital full point of order 2. And here's the 2, 5, infinity triangle, just like we have for SL2Z. So the issue with this group is that I know what generators of the group are, but I don't know how to characterize what the elements of the group are. So I could, for example, Bar. So I could, for example, I can enumerate the cusps of the group by just forming products of these generators and seeing when I get a parabolic. But I would never know using that method whether or not some particular element is ultimately a cus. I might search for it and never find it. That doesn't prove it's not a cusp. So that's the kind of issue that one has to address when you don't have a global picture of the group, which is what happens in the non-arithmetic case. Arithmetic case. Okay, so as I mentioned, corollary Q applies to triangle groups with trace field that's quadratic. Here, the trace field is just Q adjoining the square root of 5, and indeed the cusps coincide with every point in the field. And I'm going to formulate this statement in several different equivalent fashions. This was for this group. It was first proved by Leutbecker in the 1970s. And here's one way to think about. And here's one way to think about this corollary in terms of circle packings. So just as there's a sort of a three associated to SL2Z, there's a five associated to this group. So what you do is you take the line at height one, and then you put underneath it a circle resting at zero, and another one resting at the golden mean, and then you can just fit two other circles of equal radius in between here. So you get In between here. So you get a little necklace of five circles centered at the fixed point of this element of order five in the group. And whenever you see two other circles, there's a way to put three more in between them so that they're symmetrically spaced. So there's what I call a five packing of the upper half plane, and it's easy to prove that the circles rest on points in this field K. And then the theorem is that every point in this field arises. That every point in this field arises as the resting point of one of these circles. These circles are enumerating the cusps. Okay, here's another way to look at the cusps. So just as in the case of SL2Z, when you have the 2, 5 infinity triangle group, you can form what I like to call golden fractions. They're generalizations of the traditional continued fraction. The statement is that every element of the field can be excluded. Of the field can be expressed as a finite golden continued fraction. And so, what is such a continued fraction? Instead of just starting out with a1 being an integer, you start out with a1 times gamma. And then you take 1 over a2 times gamma plus 1 over a3 times gamma all the way down to 1 over a n times gamma with these a i's in the integers. And there's an obvious way if you're given an element of. Obvious way, if you're given an element of the field, to try to form its continued fraction, namely, you subtract a multiple of gamma to make it as small as possible. Then you take its reciprocal, then you subtract, take its reciprocal, and the theorem is that that process eventually terminates, no matter what element of the field you start with. That's the statement that the cusps are what they should be. And now I can explain the quadratic height bounds. The quadratic height bounds give you an idea. Height bounds give you an idea of how long this process takes and how big these AIs get. And it says that if you know the height of this original point, that is the complexity of writing it down in terms of integers, then that height is a bound for the length of this continued fraction, and it's also a bound for the maximum of these integers that you obtain in forming this finite expansion. Okay, here's a Okay, here's another way of formulating the statement about the cusps. It says that every element of the field can be written uniquely as what I called a golden fraction. And so I mentioned we don't really know how to characterize the columns that occur in non-arithmetic groups, but it turns out, so let's just define a golden fraction. A golden fraction to be a ratio of two elements that occur as columns in one of the matrices in this group. And it turns out that although elements of the field can be written in many ways as ratios of relatively prime integers in the field, they can be written in an essentially unique way as ratios of relatively prime integers that occur as columns in Columns in this group. And so that's kind of a sub, that's kind of an enhancement of unique factorization in this field. And again, you might ask, how complicated are these numbers A and C compared to the complexity of X? And the statement here, this is why I call it a quadratic height bound, is that the heights of the integers appearing in the numerator and denominator are bounded by the square of the height of x. And here I should just mention, I've been throwing And here I should just mention that throwing height around, the height is the logarithmic height. So, for example, the height of an ordinary integer is log A. Okay. So those are the statements of the main theorems about triangle groups, and I hope they give you an idea of the spirit of this theorem Q. So now I want to turn to what initially sounds like a different topic, which is the theory of billiards. Which is the theory of billiards. So let's discuss billiards in a regular Pentagon. So here's a picture of a typical billiard path. It's just moving around, hitting the sides with equal angles of incidence and reflection. This one happens to be periodic. In fact, and this is a special feature of the fact that the angles here are rational multiples of pi. It turns out that in this kind of polygon, there's a dense A polygon, there's a dead set of slopes where the billiard trajectories are periodic. And so, a natural question is: how do these periodic trajectories behave? And I remember very well more than 20 years ago setting out to experiment on this behavior, periodic trajectories. At that time, I didn't know what the periodic slopes were. So, one periodic slope you can see right off the bat. Periodic slope you can see right off the bat is if you take a slope S that's parallel to a side of the pentagon, then if you start in the midpoint of an edge, the billiard path traces out a little star. And so the length, that is the number of edges of that periodic path, is five. So then you might experiment with taking other multiples of this slope s. For example, here's the trajectory at length 4s. It's also periodic, but it's much longer. Periodic, but it's much longer. Its length is 469. That's 469 segments in this picture, but it does come back to where it started. Moving on, here's what you get for 20S. So the picture is now completely black, and there's over 2,000 segments in this periodic trajectory. And if you want to be really ambitious, you might multiply S by a number that's a couple of thousands, like 6,765. 6765 times S, and it turns out that that's also periodic. The picture, of course, would still be black, and the number of edges is about 10 to the 25. So I didn't determine that this was periodic by calculating the path. And you might ask me at the end how one can figure out the lengths of these extremely long periodic trajectories. So the striking fact, which is immediately visible when you start doing experiments. Visible when you start doing experiments with poly with billiards and rational polygons. If you're working in the square, the lengths of the periodic trajectories are pretty short. In other cases, they get long very fast. In fact, if you try on a computer to determine whether or not this slope is periodic, you'll just never know. You need some kind of theory to, you'll never see the period because it's so long. Okay, so another correlation. Okay, so another corollary of the theorem Q that I formulated at the beginning is that in fact we know what the periodic slopes are in the regular pentagon. They're just the multiples of this fundamental slope s, the slope of the side, by elements of the field q adjoint root 5. And then the quadratic height bound says that you can also control the length of a trajectory with a given slope in terms of its slope. With a given slope in terms of its slope. But the bound is not in terms of the height of the slope. It would be in terms of the height of the slope if this was, say, a square or a rectangle, but it's in terms of the square of the height of the slope. And that's why the lengths can get so long for relatively simply described slopes. So for example, you should, if you have a number with about n digits and you multiply it by s and ask what's the length of that trajectory, it will be periodic, but it's Will be periodic, but its length will be about 10 to the n squared. That's just to give you an idea of the spirit of these bounds, enormously longer than the number of digits required to describe the slope itself. And by the way, this exponent too is sharp. So that phenomena really does occur. Okay, so I want to step back a little bit because there's a lot of different kinds of Kinds of algebraic dynamics in play these days. Arithmetic dynamics of rational maps, stuff related to Riemann surfaces, and stuff related to billiards. And I want to explain what will be familiar to some, namely why billiards in the Pentagon is connected to non-arithmetic groups. In fact, it's directly connected to the 2, 5, infinity triangle group. And the connection goes through something called typoid. Goes through something called typo occurs. So let me just briefly try to explain this connection, which is really quite elementary. Okay, so how do you describe a Riemann surface of genus G? Well, if it's of genus 1, if it's an elliptic curve, we all know a nice description is to write x as the quotient of the complex plane by a lattice. So you could say you draw a parallelogram, you identify opposite sides, and that gives you concrete. Gives you a concrete picture of every Riemann surface of genus 1. What about for higher genus? Well, it turns out that there's a uniformization theorem for Riemann surfaces of higher genus that looks exactly like the one for genus 1. And it's not very popularly taught in graduate school. Usually, you would learn that the universal cover of X is the upper half plane. It has a metric of constant negative curvature, etc. Curvature, etc. But there's a different uniformization which says that every Riemann surface of genus G can be built again from a flat polygon in the complex plane. It just might have to have more sides than four. So in fact, every Riemann surface can be described by drawing some sort of polygonal region and then gluing certain pairs of sides together simply by translations. So, like this green edge here might be glued up. This green edge here might be glued up to this green edge here. Okay, now why is this not more popularly known or used? It's because there's not a unique polygon that gives rise to x. And that's because this polygon gives you more information than just a Riemann surface. It gives you a Riemann surface plus a holomorphic one-form on the Riemann surface. So the real uniformization theorem says. Formization theorem says that if you give me a pair consisting of a Riemann surface and a holomorphic one form, it can always be described by drawing a polygon in the plane and then taking the obvious one form on the plane, dz, and identifying opposite sides by translations. And since dz is invariant under translation, it descends to a holomorphic one form on the Riemann surface. Okay, so there's a close connection between Riemann surfaces equipped with one form. Riemann surfaces equipped with one forms and polygons. And the remarkable thing about this association is it gives rise to an action of SL2R on moduli space, which is kind of radical because the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is not a symmetric space or even a quotient of a symmetric space. It's very inhomogeneous. And of course, it's not actually on moduli space, but it's on this button. On moduli space, but it's on this bundle consisting of the holomorphic one forms over each Riemann surface in Mg. But the action is very easy to describe if you've described, if you've presented a Riemann surface as a quotient of a polygon by gluing, you have this polygon P in the plane, and you have an element of SL2R. Well, you could act on this pair by just acting on the polygon. Just change the shape of the polygon by a real linear transformation. By a real linear transformation, like a little bit of a dilation and a shear. And you take the gluing instructions and just move them over, and you get a new Riemann surface and a new one form. So that's this beautiful action of this rich, simple Lie group on the space of moduli space of polymorphic one forms. It's been abundantly studied now for three decades or so. And Teichmüller curve. And Teichmüller curves arise as follows. When you have SL2R acting on this space, you could ask what's the stabilizer of your one form. And that will be some subgroup of SL2R. It's always discrete. There are certain miraculous cases where the stabilizer turns out to be a lattice. And when it's a lattice, the orbit of the form, under the action of SL2R, generates a curve. A curve in moduli space that's mapped in isometrically for the hyperbolic metric. So this curve is simply the quotient of the upper half-pline by the stabilizer, and it comes with a natural map to Mg, which just takes the SL2R orbit in omega Mg and projects it down to the base. And it turns out that these curves are totally geodesic for the Teichmuller metric on moduli space. So they're beautiful extreme curves. Extreme curves, and there's a lot that you get when you find one of these objects. You get an explicit uniformization of V, and at the same time, this curve is algebraic, so you often understand what it is extrinsically in Mg. And you also have a very concrete description of the mapping F from the curve into Mg. So they're rare and very interesting objects, but they're not described by By arithmetic means. And in fact, they're closely connected to non-arithmetic groups. Okay, so here's the connection with billiards. If we want to study billiards in a regular pentagon, first I'm going to build a Riemann surface associated to this pentagon by identifying opposite sides. Well, I need an even number of sides. So I'm going to double the pentagon. And now what I have is combinatorially an octagon. And I can identify... And I can identify opposite sides. Opposite sides are parallel to one another, so you glue those together, and we take the quotient Riemann surface, and it turns out it's a Riemann surface of genus 2. And the corresponding one form has one zero of multiplicity two. The degree of the canonical bundle is two in genus two, and that zero comes from the vertices. The vertices, the eight vertices of the octagon that you see on this picture. Now, what's the virtue of building this Riemann surface when you want to study billiards? It's the following. What's annoying in billiards is all these reflections where you hit the edges and bounce off. But if you have a mirror image of your billiard table on the other side of each edge, instead of imagining that you bounce off. Imagining that you bounce off the edge, you can imagine that the billiard just continues in a straight line, but into this reflected copy of the Pentagon. And then it keeps going. What happens when it hits the next edge? Well, I could put another pentagon here below it, but that pentagon would look just like the pentagon on top. So when I hit this edge, the next edge, instead of going into yet another pentagon, I just glue. Pentagon, I just glue this edge to the parallel one above it, and the trajectory continues up here. And so on, and so on, and so on. So, what happens is all the bouncing in the billiard goes away, and the billiard trajectories are turned into geodesics on this quotient Riemann surface. It's a great simplification in the study of the dynamics. But the real miracle is the following theorem of Feitsch and Maser. What they've Feech and Maser. What they proved is that if you carry out this procedure and you get a Teichmüller curve, that is, if the group in SLX omega is a lattice, then you can say something very strong about the billiards in P. It has optimal dynamics. And optimal dynamics means the following. There's a strict dichotomy between the way trajectories can behave. They either come back to where they started, which is as simply Which is as simply behaved as possible and non-chaotic, just periodic repetitious behavior. Either that or they're totally chaotic. That is, the trajectory goes everywhere in the polygon and it spends an equal amount of time in any region as in any other region of the same area. It's uniformly distributed. So for many polygons, you get this intermediate behavior that's neither periodic or uniformly distributed, but here we get this. Distributed, but here we get this very strict subdivision between the types of behaviors that occur. And I should mention that this dichotomy is really in the spirit of Ratner's theorem. So pre-Ratner, dynamics concerned itself with what happens with almost every trajectory in a generic dynamical system. But the beautiful thing about Ratner theory is it gave The beautiful thing about Ratner theory is it gave us examples, a very rich class of examples of dynamical systems and homogeneous dynamics, where one can analyze the behavior of every single trajectory. That's a wonderful ambition, and in the case of these optimal billiards, it's achieved. And we're not even in a setting of homogeneous dynamics. So the connection to Ratner theory is just an analogy, but a very powerful. But a very powerful one. Okay, so let me give you a concrete example of a billiard table which has optimal dynamics, that has this associative lattice that generates a typewriter curve. So it's gold again, so I call this the golden table. And the way you build it is you take here in orange is a standard golden rectangle, and then you scale it down and put a copy of it, just attach a copy of it. It just attach a copy of another golden rectangle to the top so that you get in the end a symmetric L of symmetric under reflection to the diagonal. This top edge is one, this side edge has length one, the long edges have length gamma, the short edges have length one over gamma. So that's a polygon in which we can study billiards. But it also gives rise to a Riemann surface, and the unfolding construction turns out to have a very simple result in this case. The Riemann In this case, the Riemann surface is the following. If you introduce dots, as I've shown, around this polygon, it becomes combinatorially an octagon again. There are eight edges. And you glue parallel sides again. So like this edge down here gets glued to this edge up here. This edge of length one gets glued to the other side of the orange rectangle. And lo and behold, you get a Riemann surface. A Riemann surface of genus 2. In fact, you get a Riemann surface of genus 2 and a one form again with a double zero. Okay, the theorem is that the stabilizer in SL2R of this one form is the 2, 5, infinity triangle group. So it is a lattice, and so Maser's theorem applies. And so we have optimal dynamics for billiards in this golden L-shaped polygon. L-shaped polygon. Okay, so this is the connection between billiards and triangle groups. Now, why is it true? Why is it true that the symmetry group of this Riemann surface is equal to this 2,5 infinity triangle group? Well, here's the proof. So the Riemann surface that we get by gluing together the Get by gluing together the sides of this polygon, it has on it evidently an annulus that's orange because this edge of the orange is glued to this edge of the orange. And it also has an annulus on it, a horizontal cylinder that's blue because these two vertical edges are glued. And what we can do is we can perform a Dane twist in each of these cylinders and do it in a linear fashion. It in a linear fashion. So that's that is, we just do it by a shear that takes these vertical edges and shears them to diagonals of the corresponding rectangle. That's a map of the quotient Riemann surface to itself. It respects the gluing instructions. And that map is real linear. So it gives an element of the stabilizer of the Riemann surface in SL2R. It gives an element of this group SLX omega. S L x omega. So in fact, it gives the element 1 gamma 0 1. And the reason is that the matrix of the linear map that shears this unit edge over to this one is 1 gamma 01. So we get a shear in the group of symmetries, and then also the table has this diagonal symmetry, and that turns out to give the usual element of order 4 that we need to generate the The 2, 5 infinity triangle group. So we see that we get the two generators and therefore we get the whole group. And in fact, that's basically the only way you can prove this because we don't know what this group is. We only know what its generators are. Okay, now I started out talking about the Pentagon and then I went into the Golden Owl. In fact, these two gadgets are almost the same thing. So you'll remember that when Remember that when we get this lattice, we get a Teichmüller curve. That is, we get a map of the upper half plane into the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. And the curve is actually the quotient of the upper half plane by this triangle group, by the 2, 5, infinity triangle group. So there must be special points in moduli space that correspond to these two special points in the upper half-plane. This is a fixed point by an element of order 2. This is the fixed point by an electron. Element of order 2. This is the fixed point by an element of order 5. Well, it turns out that the element of order 2 corresponds to the golden table. And you can imagine that that's true because this matrix just acts by a rotation of this table. It doesn't change the point you get in moduli space. So this element of order 4 goes over to an automorphism of this Riemann surface. And similarly, the point of order 5 goes over to the Riemann surface attached to the regular penta. Remote surface attached to the regular pentagon. Oh, Kurt, we have a question in the chat. So, Romain Dujardin says, What is special with gamma in the shear construction? What is special with gamma? So in the shear construction, yeah. Right, so right, so what if I had, let's see. Let's see. Yes. So you see, the point is that if I had tried, I wanted to make this table symmetric. So that means I need this L to be symmetric. But I also wanted to be able to do the same shear in this little rectangle as in the big one. So I want the linear map that does the shear down here to be the same. The shear down here to be the same as the linear map that does the shear in the blue. The orange and blue shears have to be the same. So if you take that condition and you combine it with the symmetry, you see that the only shape of the rectangle that works is the golden rectangle. So it's like the fact that when you take the golden rectangle and you cut off a square, like here, then what's left up here is again a copy of the golden rectangle. Rectangle. So that's dictated by the fact that we wanted to get this both a shear and this element in the group. If this rectangle were not similar to this rectangle, we wouldn't get any shear in SLX omega. And we could easily get a shear by making these similar, but then we wouldn't get this symmetry unless we took the height to be gamma. Other questions? Okay, thanks for that. Okay, so we have this beautiful connection with the golden triangle group. And there's also a connection with Hilbert modular surfaces. Let me just say what happens. Remember, we wanted at the end of the day to apply theorem Q, and there's a very good reason why you can. And there's a very good reason why you can apply theorem Q in this case, which is that we have a Teichmiller curve, this map of the upper half-plane into the Montulai space of Riemann surface. So we're in genus 2 here. The field is Q adjoining root 5. Mg is three-dimensional. But it turns out that inside of Mg there's a surface, there's a copy of the Hilbert modular surface, and this Teichmüller curve. Modular surface, and this Teichmuller curve factors through that surface. And the reason for that is that the Jacobians of all of the curves parameterized by V turn out to have real multiplication by this field K. So that's the deep connection between Billiard's triangle groups and Hilbert modular surfaces. It's that when you're building these special Teichmüller curves, you're getting very special Riemann surfaces. Special Riemann surfaces. They're not special because they have a lot of symmetries, but they're specials because their Jacobians have lots of endomorphisms. And that's why Hilbert modular surfaces come into play. So indeed, all of the theorems I'm talking about were first proved in the setting of billiards. And it's only after the fact that they've been applied to triangle groups and to general curves on Hilbert modular surfaces. Okay, so that's why theorem. So that's why theorem Q applies. And here's a picture of what the universal cover of the curve looks like inside of H cross H. Let me just say there's a beautiful map of the unit disk to itself, which conjugates the action of gamma to its indiscrete cousin. And anyway, there's a lot of geometry hidden in this discussion. Okay, so once we have So once we have this connection, it turns out that the golden fractions A over C, which corresponded to columns in the triangle group, they're actually the vectors represented by periodic billiard paths and by unfolding periodic billiard paths. And so the results on billiards that I mentioned also follow from theorem Q. Okay. Okay. Now you might wonder what's the real setting of this? You've given us this example of the regular Pentagon. What are the other kinds of special billiard tables and groups where this might hold? Well, as far as billiard tables go, it turns out that these results apply to all optimal billiard tables that come in families. So in fact, they're very In fact, there are variants of the golden rectangle where you replace gamma by some other specially chosen quadratic number. And you get the exactly the same results on the periodic slopes and the quadratic height bounds. And there's also, just recently, in joint work with Askin, McCammel, and Wright, we found a new family of arrows. Family of arrowhead-shaped billiard tables, where again you can replace gamma by many other quadratic numbers. You get optimal dynamics, and you get the similar theorems hold. And the reason that the theorems hold is what was really key was that we had a quadratic trace field, and so we were in the setting of Hilbert modular surfaces. And there's a beautiful theorem of Eskin, Philippe, and Wright that says that's the only way you can get. That's the only way you can get families of these optimal billiard tables or families of Tichula curves. If you tried to push on to cubic fields, you would only see finitely many examples in each genus. Okay, so there's a broad range of applicability. I'm not trying to give you the most general examples, just a representative one. Now, let me finally touch on this fourth topic. On this fourth topic, which is modular symbols. So, the first result I formulated this theorem Q. It's a fairly technical theorem. It requires the use of this new height. It's a kind of complicated thing to explain in detail. Modular symbols allow us to answer a different kind of question, and they're very easy to explain. So, I want to finish with them. In fact, I don't even have a theorem really about modular symbols. Really, about modular symbols. They're just a method. And once you formulate this method, it has lots of applications that go far beyond billiards or triangle groups. And I think it's just a very useful concept that hasn't been concretely formulated before, except in the abelian case, as we'll come to. Okay, so let's go back to the regular Pentagon. I want to ask a different question. Now we know it has optimal dynamics. So every trajectory is either periodic or Trajectory is either periodic or uniformly distributed. Well, okay, so what, how are the periodic trajectories distributed? So you might think, well, doesn't it follow that as a periodic trajectory gets longer and longer, it has to become uniformly distributed because the non-periodic ones are uniformly distributed. And that's not quite true. So it turns out, and this was emphasized by Davis and Lieutenant. Was emphasized by Davis and Oliyev, who made a very beautiful and complete study of periodic trajectories in the Pentagon. That there are longer and longer trajectories whose distribution is not uniform in the Pentagon. In fact, there are arbitrarily long trajectories that leave a hole in the center of the Pentagon. So they never even visit that region. You can safely put your Ming vase here and play billiards, and you're never going to hit it. So it's not uniform, which means that as you take limits of these periodic trajectories, you get some other kind of measures on the billiard tables. And this process is called starring in the physics literature. And based on their tree-like description of periodic trajectories, they conjectured that there might be a cantor set of measures that arise as limits of periodic trajectories. And it turns out it's not quite. And it turns out it's not quite that complicated. And the theorem I'd like to close with is this one. In fact, if you fix a periodic slope in the pentagon and then you take the limits of periodic trajectories tending to that slope, the limiting measures form a countable set, not a Cantor set. Of course, there's a closed set. But this closed set is pretty complicated for a countable set. It has limits, and it has limits of limits. Limits and it has limits of limits and it has limits of limits of limits of limits and so on. But when you intersect all of those things, you get one point. So technically, it's homeomorphic to the ordinal omega to the omega plus one. And this is true not just for the Pentagon, but for a very general class of billiards. So this theorem both describes the scarring behavior and it also finishes the classification. Finishes the classification of the closure of the ergodic measures for these optimal billiard tables. That had been kind of an open problem. So you might say, well, wait a second. I want my periodic path to become uniformly distributed. Maybe if I choose the slope right, it will. And the answer is yes. In fact, if you make the length of the golden continued fraction go to infinity. Continued fraction goes to infinity, then you can be guaranteed that the periodic trajectories will become uniformly distributed. Okay, so this is a second kind of analysis of the periodic trajectories. And here, by the way, is a picture of what the periodic trajectory, what these limit measures look like. So there's a dot for every measure, and as you can sort of see them accumulating on these spikes, that's a limit. These spikes, that's a limit point there, and then there's a limit of limits where you see these spikes accumulating, like here, and then you see limits of those limits and so on. And then finally, uniform measure is the only measure that's a infinitely iterated limit of limits. So that's what the limit measures look like in the gold now or in the pentagon. And so the question I want to close with is where does this or Where does this ordinal omega to the omega come from? What is its mathematical precursor? What's the mathematical structure whose shadow we're seeing in the dynamics of billiards? And the answer is it's the space of modular symbols, a non-abelian space of modular symbols on the Teichmüller curve V. So I denote that by S of V, S for symbol. So let me just tell you what. So, let me just tell you what the space of modular symbols are on an arbitrary hyperbolic surface. They're pretty simple. They're formal products of geodesics, gamma 1 up to gamma D, non-commuting products. And they're specified by first giving a sequence of D plus 1 cusps of V, and then you have to choose a geodesic that goes from one cusp to the next. So you can think of them as being a little chain of cusps. You can think of them as being a little chain of cusps with the additional data of an infinite geodesic that begins in one cusp and ends in the next. That's the definition of a Montour symbol. Now, what makes this structure rich and interesting is that it has a natural topology. So what I'm showing you here is a Riemann surface with three cusps and a modular symbol of degree one. It's just a path that starts at A and it ends. That starts at A and it ends up at B. Of course, it has to go an infinite distance to start at A and an infinite distance to end at B. But in between, it winds around and goes pretty close to this cusp C and then goes back and decides to go to B after all. Well, there's a natural topology where this sequence of modular symbols limits on a modular symbol of degree two. That is, in the limit, you get a modular symbol that corresponds to a path that goes all the way. That corresponds to a path that goes all the way to C and then comes back and goes from C to B. That's the natural geometric topology on the space of modular symbols. And with this topology, the symbols of degree one are dense. So algebraically, the space of modular symbols can be described as a category. It's the morphisms in a graded category whose objects are the cusps of V. The morphism is described by one of the The morphism is described by one of these paths, but it has this topology, and topologically it's isomorphic to omega to the omega. So to make a long story short, the modular symbols, oh, sorry, let me do one classical case. You might ask, what are these modular symbols for SL2Z? It turns out the modular symbols of degree one are just the rational numbers, but you should think of them in terms of their continued fractions. Should think of them in terms of their continued fractions, which are finite. And a general modular symbol is a continued fraction where some of the AIs are allowed to be infinity. Okay, let me skip this and finally say what this has to do with measures. So here's a way in the Golden L to make a very long geodesic, which is like a very long billiard trajectory. Which is like a very long billiard trajectory, which it obviously does not become uniformly distributed. Super simple. There's a periodic geodesic B1, which just goes from the bottom of the L to the top. And remember, this edge is glued to this edge. So that's periodic. That's a loop in the quotient surface. Also, remember the shear. This surface has a symmetry, which is obtained by shearing the top and bottom parts of the L. And that symmetry. The L. And that symmetry is linear, so it sends a periodic trajectory to another periodic trajectory. Preserves closed geodesics. So you do that shear a million times, and this short geodesic becomes a very long geodesic, which still only lives in the bottom half of the F. So that proves that long trajectories don't become distributed, uniformly distributed, and gives you a reason why. It's because of these iterated Dane twists. If I had instead If I had instead taken a closed trajectory that visits both the top and bottom rectangles and twisted it, I'd get a trajectory that goes everywhere. But now it spends a lot more time in the top than in the bottom. You can see the coloring here. It's darker in the top than the bottom. So it has a limiting measure, but that limiting measure is not the uniform measure, although it has full support. So the upshot is that the measures Is that the measures are predicted by the intersection numbers between these systems of closed geodesics? These systems of closed geodesics correspond to pairs of cusps, although to put the closed geodesics onto a Riemann surface simultaneously, you need to choose a way to identify Riemann surfaces near one cuffs with Riemann surfaces near the other. And you do that by choosing a path. And you do that by choosing a path connecting the cusps. And that's what a modular symbol is. So, in brief, there's a functor that maps modular symbols into some category of matrices. It records these intersection patterns of closed geodesics. And there's a map from those matrices into measures. And at the end of the day, that explains where the ordinal omega to the omega comes from. Okay, so. Okay, so I'm slightly over my official time. I hope I can have three more minutes. I just want to conclude with two things. So. Oh, yeah. I guess maybe though I should just say, Holly asked a question. I was going to wait till the end, but maybe now is a good time to ask it too. We can roll it all in. Is there some analogy with the case of periodic points of rational maps in the sense that some kind of average of periodic trajectories of a given length does have uniform distribution? Does have uniform distribution? Oh, that's such a good question. So they, so is Laura here? So yes. So there's something called the DeMarco current, and it's related in the very simple case of a single rational map to the measure of maximal entropy. So let me first just say that. So let me first just say that these, there's a measure that's in there's analogous measures in the case of rational maps, and there's at least two of them. One is you just take all of the periodic points of period less than 2 to the d to the n for, say, a rational map on P1, you put equal delta masses on them and take a limit of these measures. That gives this beautiful measure of maximal entropy. In the case of a polynomial, it's the hitting measure for a random walk that's still. Hitting measure for a random walk that starts at infinity and ends on the Julia set. So there's actually many measures available for rational maps. The more interesting one is you weight the periodic points by the size of the multiplier, which is the derivative of the first return map, raised to some power. And if you do that right, you get the Hausdorff measure on the Julia set, at least in the expanding case. Expanding case. So, those are some of the analogies to the measures that I'm talking about here. But in rational maps, I'd say, you know, the theorems are mostly positive. They are that if you take the periodic cycles, then they do converge to the expected measure. Whether you put the weights on them or not, you get either the Maxwell measure, the Hausdorff measure. Whereas here, we're getting this surprise that we have a unique measure that everything should be converging to, and yet it's. That everything should be converging to, and yet it's not. Thank you. Sure. Okay, so let me finish by just going back to this question of Leicbecker: the mystery of arithmetic groups. You can ask, what matrix entries occur in the 2, 5, infinity triangle group? And the answer turns out to be, well, it's a little hard to say, but you do the following, which I think is quite natural to number theorists. Number theorists. You look at the matrix entries that are non-zero. Those are elements of this field that's quadratic over Q. And you associate to each matrix entry an element of norm one, which is m prime over m. So it measures the ratio between a matrix entry and its Galois conjugate. And amazingly, M prime is usually significantly less than M. These differences lie in a compact interval. And in fact, if you see Compact interval. And in fact, if you scale it right, we have the following theorem. The closure of these ratios is a countable semi-group in the unit interval, and it is also homeomorphic to omega to the omega plus 1. So this I find really surprising because it says that there's a hidden semi-group structure on these sort of the On these sort of the boundary of the space of matrices, the differential of the space of matrices, because this is a semi-group. And it also has this rich topological structure. And it's also a very small set. It's just countable. And if we had taken all of the integers in the field Q adjoined root 5, delta here would have been dense in the real line. But instead, to be a matrix entry, you have to. matrix entry, you have to have the property that delta of m lies in this very thin countable set. And so let me just end by showing you a picture of that countable set. Yes, it's exactly what you saw before. And in fact, there's an explicit map that takes this set attached to the triangle group to the set of measures attached to the pentagon. And it connects this omega to the omega structure. Omega to the omega structure, possibly with its other appearances in mathematics, which include the P0 numbers, the file spectrum, three-dimensional hyperbolic volumes. There's other domains where this ordinal occurs. And this is a new entry of that list. Okay, well, there's one last statement I want to make. And let me just show one more slide. I won't even relate it to billiards. It to billiards, but there's an open problem attached to the 2, 7 infinity triangle group. And I almost can't believe that this is true, but it experimentally works. So when you go to cubic fields, everything breaks down. It's not true that the cusp for every element of K. No chance of characterizing the cusps. Looks like everything we did was special to quadratic fields. two quadratic fields. The 2, 7 infinity triangle group is defined over this very simple cubic field where you join the cosine of 2 pi over 7. And the conjecture is that every element of the k is the fixed point of some element in the 2, 7 infinity triangle group. It's just that that element might be hyperbolic. And this was observed in various forms by many authors and lately there have been further investigations by Carl Windsor. Under investigations by Carl Windsor, still a tremendous amount to be learned about what happens in these higher-degree non-arithmetic groups. Okay, thanks. Okay, feel free to unmute yourself if you want to applaud or you can, you know, I'll put it. So, we already had some questions, but do people have any questions? If you want, feel free to unmute yourself or put it in the chat or Unmute yourself or put it in the chat or use the raise hand function. Hopefully, it shows up. I don't know if I'll actually see it. I have a question, if I may. Kurt, I came in late, and so I missed your theorem queue. Are you willing to put the slide back up that shows what theorem Q said? Sure. Let me see if I can get there. And while you're doing that, can you also explain in the. Oh, actually, let me. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, actually, let me. Yeah, go ahead. In the picture where you were plotting all the limit measures and you had the spikes accumulating in the center, of course, you can show that picture after, but what were you in fact plotting there? Okay. This picture. So that's a really good question. So let me explain what I'm plotting here. So I'm taking just the integers in z adjoin gamma that occur. That occur, I'm taking that occur as matrix entries for this, for the 2, 5 infinity triangle group. So it's some very rare subset of zooing gamma. And I'm plotting two things. One is the height of that particular group.
