And I'll be starting with a quick introduction. I hope everything's good. I see something in the chat here. All right. So this, I don't think it needs any introduction. It's a workshop about comparison geometry. So this is pretty much what we're in. This is pretty much what we're interested in in comparison geometry. We're comparing different geometric or analytic quantities on a given manifold with the same things, but on a space of constant curvature, on a model space. Most results that we know are, or the best results that we know in any dimension are concerning Ricci curvature lower bound. So this is mostly to set up. This is mostly to set up the notation as well. Reach is the Ricci curvature. K is a number which is non-negative. This is a complete non-compact manifold everywhere. So k is either zero or can be normalized to be one. And the goal of the talk is to present some recent work where only in dimension three you can replace Ricci by scalar curvature. So the number will be minus. Number will be minus six because this is dimension three. Right? So, of course, there are many results that we know, but I'm going to mention only two of them, which are relevant to the talk today. So, one is the Bishop volume estimate, which I hope everyone is very familiar with. It compares either with Euclidean's. Either with Euclidean space or with the hyperbolic space, depending on the constant, on the Ricci lower bound. And a quick observation is that you cannot do better than Ricci. So even in dimension three, you cannot work with just scalar curvature. But there's some good news which I would like to report. One is that Would like to report. One is that in dimension three, we can do something. So this is these are two famous results, famous conjectures. One is Gromov's conjecture, which both conjectures are roughly in the 80s, early 80s. And one says that if reach is bounded from below and the scalar curvature has a positive lower bound, then the Bound, then the volume has an improved upper bound. So we can see that compared to the previous statement of Bishop, we dropped the power of the radius by two n minus two. That's because that's the effect of the scalar lower bound. Yao's conjecture is even more ambitious. It wants, again, in any dimension, to prove that if reach is bounded below, then an integral of the scalar curve. Below, then an integral of the scalar curvature of this form exists. If, of course, scalar is bounded from below by a positive constant, you obtain, in particular, Gromov's conjecture. So the talk will report on the proof in the 3D case, which is one of the goals of today, and some slightly more general results. Slightly more general results, but Yao's conjecture, even in three days, is completely open as far as I know. So that's first I'm going to present the relevant examples and questions, and then I'm going to describe the results. So I'm going to jump from Bishop and two conjectures. I'm going to jump to a completely different topic, which again can be done in 3D. Can be done in 3D. So that's the reason why I'm presenting this somewhat different topics, but in the same talk. This is, we're switching from volume to Richie lower bound and spectral estimates. So a well-known estimate in this case is due to Cheng, which again, K could be the rich lower bound is either zero or we can normalize it to be one, and you get. One, and you get an upper bound. In particular, if reach is non-negative, then this says that the bottom spectrum is zero, right? Because it's always non-negative. In fact, the whole spectrum is zero infinity in that case. So that's, you can say much more. Zero is sharp, it's for Euclidean space, and that number n minus one squared over four, which plays a role today, is what Are all today is what you get on the hyperbolic space, so that's why it's a sharp comparison estimate. I said that it's a completely different topic and there's no apparent relation, but there is one, the volume estimate that we saw on the previous slide, the volume comparison for Richie bounded below, actually both of them, in view of this inequality on the bottom, which is On the bottom, which is originally due to Brooks, it implies the Cheng's estimate. So, by using the volume quote from Bishop, you obtain immediately that Cheng estimate. So, there is a relation between them. Being an inequality, of course, people wondered what is the sharp, what happens in the sharp case, like if If you have rich sheet bounded from below and the spectrum now is equal, so I wrote it great or equal, but what I really mean it's in view of that on Cheng's inequality, it's actually equal, right? If it's greater equal, it becomes equal. There are many examples of the complete classification of this is impossible because there are many classes of examples and they have nothing to do with each other. But there's two examples which happen to Examples which happen to be when the manifold has at least one end. So, if the manifold has at least two or more ends, then you your manifold which achieves the equality case in Cheng's estimate has to be one of these two warp products, one with an exponential warping function and one with the hyperbolic cosine warping function. And what's interesting here is that the last example happens to be only in dimension three. Dimension three. It's just a coincidence as far as I understand. And so this is for any k, of course, for k equals zero, this is related to the famous Jiger-Gromo splitting theorem, because in that case, region becomes non-negative and lambda zero becomes greater or equal than zero, which is saying nothing. So maybe that's why we wanted to write. So, maybe that's why we wanted to write it in this fancy way so we can make this observation that this recovers the Jigger-Gromo splitting theorem for M having two or more ends. The goal of the talk, as I said, is to present development, but we want to study if such an estimate is possible only with scalar curvature. So, as a question, which So, as a question which answer turns out to be no, is can we replace Fricci by scalar in Cheng's estimate and in the rigidity statement? So that would mean if scalar is bounded by minus six times a constant k, where k is non-negative, is it true that lambda zero is bounded by k? The what happened with n minus one squared over four? That's exactly one in dimension three. In dimension three, three minus one squared over four is exactly one. So, so this would be the sharp version, which would uh correspond to the cheng's estimate, but with Ricci replaced by scalar. And then you wonder if the equality holds and you have more than one end, then can you prove that it's a work product of the type that we have seen before? So the answer is no. The answer is no, at least a categoric no for question one and a half no for question two in the sense that it's not that easy to see that there's a unique space this time or two spaces. It becomes a more complicated question. So, for the answer, no, for question one, for k equals zero, this example that I mentioned here, connected sum of Here, connected sum of s2 times s1 with itself, and then take universal cover of that. So, the universal cover is a manifold which has a positive scalar curvature metric, so k is zero in that case. If the question were correct, it would mean lambda zero is zero, but that's not the case. Lambda zero turns out to be positive by a theorem of Brooks for applied to this situation. So, I don't. So, I don't know an example yet to for the case when more interesting case when k equals 1, if scalar is bounded by minus 6, if lambda 0 is at most 1, I have no example for that, but at least for k equals 0, there is a counterexample. So, you may have positive spectrum, although the scalar curtain is non-negative or even positive. So, it seems like a weak quantity to work with. Quantity to work with. For the splitting, I said if it's a work product, the example I give here is a work product, but it becomes very clear that it's quite difficult to classify this. So you have a family of work products, only one of them which appeared in the previous rigidity of Li and Wang. But now you have a whole family of them, which have spectrum, spectrum exactly one, so max. Spectrum exactly one, so maximal, and scalar bounded from below by minus six. It's and none of them have scalar exactly minus six equal to minus six. So it's strictly bigger than minus six. That means it's quite difficult to obtain any kind of rigidity, like classify these things. So, but actually, the talk will report on some versions of. On some versions of this 3D versions of this Cheng's estimate, which use scalar curvature bounds. The reality is that you can do something. It's just that you need to add more assumptions here because you need to rule out some example like this. And the assumptions are not very technical. They're just topological assumptions. So this example that I'm presenting here, it can be ruled out by making some simple topological. out by making some simple topological assumptions. And once we make those, then the result becomes true. So that will be towards the end of the talk. But I make here a comment. It's more recent work of Kazara, Song, and Shu, which show that actually we are kind of lucky we can do spectrum estimate because what they prove is that the entropy estimate, so in this inequality on the bottom, This inequality on the bottom, we, as I said, we can prove Cheng's estimate, we just need an extra topological assumption. But their comment is that, I mean, their work shows that the volume entropy is not going to be bounded sharply by scalar curvature. So our inequality holds. The left-hand side can be bounded, but the right-hand side here cannot be bounded sharply. So it's quite a surprising thing. Surprising thing. So now, this was kind of the introduction to the problems that I'm interested in for today. And what's next in the next 20 minutes, I'm going to describe them in more detail. So as I said, I'm going to present a proof of the Romov conjecture in 3D and also later on talk about spectral estimate in 3D, both with just get. 3D both with just scalar curvature bounds. So, this was the statement. Actually, first, the statement, the statement part one is what we mentioned to be the that's the estimate chromoff conjecture in 3D. This is part one, but you can do a little bit better. Like you can assume that scalar is not just bounded by one, but bounded by a function which decays in terms of distance in a. Decays in terms of distance in a certain way. And you check, as expected by Yao's conjecture, you check that the volume has the appropriate growth. So that you can do. So it's not just scalar positive. You can do a certain positive lower bound, but decaying at infinity. You can also do more generally Ricci bounded from below by some as. Bounded from below by some asymptotically by some function which has this assumption. This is called asymptotically non-negative. It has appeared in many other works before, so it's not a new concept. But for this, we cannot really prove the same results as before, but we can prove things, some things that seem interesting. So one result is that if Ricci curvature is like that, Ricci curvature is like that, and again, some topological assumptions. This is only in this setting. In Ricci non-active, there's no other assumption. But in Ricci asymptotical non-active, we have to ask finite number of n's and finite first betty number. In that case, we can show that the manifold must be parabolic, which is an interesting analytical information. Information and some upper bound at infinity of the scalar curvature. So the scalar curvature cannot be too big at infinity. This turns out to be sharp in the sense that if I relax this k, this decaying function, just a tiny bit, like if I don't take it to be integrable in this sense, I can quickly construct a counterexample where scalar goes to infinity to infinity at infinity in a uniform way. Infinity in a uniform way. So it's such a bound only holds under asymptotically non-negative rigid curvature. So there's some results, some relation between scalar curvature and volume and all that in this setting of asymptotically non-negative curvature. So I'll go to explain a tiny bit of the proof. The proof of The proof of our result of the theorem I mentioned, and also of the asymptotically non-negative setting, is based on monotonicity for harmonic functions. The type of harmonic functions can be defined outside the compact set or even localized on a given end of the manifold. And we cannot do this for quite any. We cannot do this for quite any harmonic function, but we will do it for the monotonicity, it will be defined or stated for two types of harmonic functions, which are very important for the proof. So essentially, the harmonic functions are constructed by using a compact exhaustion at infinity. And because of that, they fall into one of the two settings that are mentioned here: namely, either the Namely, either the harmonic function converges to zero at infinity, or if it doesn't, then it has to converge to infinity at infinity. So there's no in-between this. So if you give me an end, I'll construct one of the two types of harmonic functions that I defined here, with the properties specified here. So, and they're exclusive, mutually exclusive. Exclusive, mutually exclusive. So either you have one setting or you have the other setting you can't have. And for such harmonic functions, we define the quantity which is like it's an L2 energy, but on the level set of the function. It's important for many of you who are familiar with this kind of monotonicity to note that we can only do power two. Do power two. So, in when in other settings, you can do any powers but large enough. But for us, only power two works. And then there's a quantity which has no meaning other than this is what works. And for that quantity, there's a monotonicity which involves the scalar curvature in an important way. So there's no right now, there's no reach. Right now, there's no Ricci curvature involved yet. So, this is the Ricci curvature assumption is not used yet. It's under the setting of having harmonic functions of this type. We can prove this monotonicity, which involves in three dimensions, which involves the level sets of the harmonic function. And it's a monotonicity for an energy. Homogenisticity for an energy of the harmonic function on level sets. Two cases are immediately important when you make alpha times alpha plus two go away. Then you have a term which is potentially bad. That term reduces to nothing. And most of the discussion will be about the case alpha is zero. So essentially monotonicity for For this quantity, but for alpha is zero. And I'll explain why, how this is derived. It's not a difficult thing, and how this is used, which, of course, that part I'll skip a lot of the details. So, this is very quickly for maybe those of you who have seen this, it's going to be very familiar. Going to be very familiar. It's nothing unusual. It's the Bagner formula. That's the usual technique that we use when we apply for functions, for harmonic functions in particular. So the Bagner formula is from second line to third line. That's the important Bagner formula. That's how Ricci curvature appears in this situation. The relation on the first line, that W. line that w derivatives of w and w are related to the laplacian they are because the function is harmonic and when you write the green's identities that's what you get so so it's uh it's a nice way to use the fact that the function is harmonic the special situation here is that ricci can be related to scalar curvature if you if we integrate this by coera If we integrate this by Coeria formula, so coeria formula allows us to relate right now, it's nothing, it's just coercive formula, but we can relate Ricci curvature by using Gauss equations to the scalar curvature. So that's the important observation, which was first time used for by Shane and Yao for minimal surfaces. We can relate Ricci curvature to Curvature to scalar curvature on the level sets. And what you also need to use there is the scalar curvature of the level set as a manifold. Normally, this is true in any dimension, this formula, but only in dimension three, our trick works, or the Chen Yao trick works, because in three dimensions, you can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. And first, you have to prove that the level set has only one component. That's why the topological assumptions that you have finite number of ns, finite p1, and essentially your function is defined outside a large enough set so that all the homology H1 is in that set. So that's the proof. I'll make some comments. I'll make some comments about this later, how it works. And so I'll say more about this later. But essentially, the upshot, as I said in the abstract, I'd like to explain how dimension 3 is used. Many of you have seen this already, of course. This is the typical proof of a monotonicity was used before by Colding and Colding Minikazi. And many others. And what we're doing here is using Sheniao Trig, which in this setting was pointed out by, already discovered by Stern that you can relate Ricci curvature to scalar curvature. And the scalar curvature of the level set, of course, has to appear there, but that can be calculated by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. And I should have. And I should have an inequality here, I think. So, how does this, what does this have to do with proving the volume estimate? There's a first step where you have to see there were two types of harmonic functions, harmonic function which goes to zero at infinity or that which goes to infinity at infinity. So, we rule out case one that the harmonic function going. That the harmonic function going to zero to infinity is ruled out. Intuitively, the manifold has to, you expect the manifold to look cylindrical. Cylinders are not non-parabolic, they are parabolic. So in other words, the Green's function, positive Green's function doesn't exist. In Rn, they only exist from N3 and above. So R times S1 will not have. times S1 will not have R times S2 will not have a Green's function. And that's what we're proving using the monotonicity, which is restated here again. For alpha is zero, that's the monotonicity. And essentially what we're doing, the right-hand side looks amazing because it's the integral of scalar curvature. So that's the kind of relation we want. The left-hand side, we proved using. Left-hand side, we proved using simple, not simple, but well-known classical estimates for elliptic functions that as little t goes to zero, h0 of t actually goes to zero, which is not surprising. 4 pi t, of course, goes to 0, but we can also prove that using gradient estimates that w of t decays faster than t when t goes to zero. So, all in all, all So, all in all, it says that this quantity is finite on the whole manifold. That leads immediately to a contradiction if you assume that the scalar curvature is bounded by one, which is the assumption. Again, reaching a negative scalar bounded by one has to be parabolic. So, if scalar is bounded by one, then you get a contradiction because the gradient is always unbounded. Gradient is always unbounded. So, any manifold you will have something like this. You'll have that the integral of the gradient has to be growing at least linearly. So it has to be unbounded when you increase the radius to infinity, because the flux is always a constant. The fact that it's harmonic by Green's formula, you get that the flux is constant. So the gradient has to be at least infinite. It has to be infinite, the integral. So, this is just doing like half of the proof saying that the first type of harmonic functions will not appear, the second type will appear, which is what you would expect. Now, you cannot make, so now the same formula holds as here. It's the same formula, but this time capital T will go to infinity and little t will start from one. So, it's exactly the opposites. The opposites values. Instead of being between 0 and 1 and little t going to 0, now capital T is going to infinity. So obviously it's not clear or you don't want to take capital T going to infinity in this estimate because it will likely, the whole thing will likely go to infinity. So it's not going to help you. So what you do in this case, you're trying to relate this inequality. Relate this inequality to an inequality using geodesic poles, because that's what you're interested in. So the rest of the proof is a sort of a contradiction proof. We assume that, so we want to prove Ricci bound and scalar bound implies volume bound, and we actually assume that volume bound is not true. So then we see what's happening. So in step one is So, in step one, which is kind of the technical, somewhat technical part of the proof, is using the volume estimate plus some mean value inequalities to prove a gradient estimate. So essentially saying big volume implies small gradient, which means that then I can transform the level sets into, I find a way if I know the gradient, I know how the function grows in terms of distance. Grows in terms of distance that gives me a way to transform the monotonicity. You see, it's not level sets anymore, it's geodesic ball. And because the gradient is small, the same constant appears on the right side. Finish the proof just like before. Scalar bounded by one, flux is minus one, implies k is small, which is what you wanted to show. So this is the proof in a nutshell. And so it's And so it's essentially the monotonicity that is here applied twice. One to rule out a certain type of harmonic function, so essentially prove it's parabolic. The other way it's used is to get the volume information at infinity by studying again the level sets and the monotonicity, and this time transforming the information into an information about. Information into an information about geodesic polls. Here I'll make a few comments. So I kept the comments for the end of this part. Everywhere the monotonicity was used for alpha is zero, but originally we found the monotonicity for alpha minus two first. So we a few years ago we discovered that we can do for alpha is minus two and we got this inequality. Alpha is minus two, and we got this inequality that it's here in the first line. We didn't really know exactly what to do with it, but we thought it looks pretty cool because it's only using scalar curvature. And actually, a few months later, it was already used by Chodo Shen Li in their proof of the Shane conjecture that stable minimal hypersurfaces in R4 must be flat. So they realized. So they realized immediately that this has certain advantages. There's a lot of work because we assume scalar non-negative. For them, that's not true. We had other things here which they had to improve. But it was a starting point for their work. And another comment is that very recently, Chodosh Lee and Stryker. Chodosh Li and Stryker, they have obtained the same result that was some time ago here. So these results, the two bullets, they know how to prove them even slightly better for the second bullet, but by using a different approach, by using the mu bubble technique. As far as I know, they haven't done this. I know they haven't done this part, which I didn't explain, but it's the same principle, it's kind of the same ideas. But they haven't used it for going in this direction of asymptotically non-negative curvature. So that's another comment that there's a different approach that you can use, which is also very popular. And here, just some general comments about related works. Of course, at this conference. Related works. Of course, at this conference, there are many of us who have done work on related topics. I'm not able to cite or to mention everyone, but I'll mention results which were important for us. So we were motivated by Kolding and Colding Minikazi's work, which originally they had a different motivation for studying this monotonicities. This monotonicities, but it works for reaching non-active in any dimension. Agostinian, if I know, and Mattieri, they applied monotonicity to get geometric estimates. We were also influenced by this because the type of harmonic functions we used appears in their work as well. And as I said, Stern applied the Shenyao trick on the left. Shenyao trick on the level sets, which is how we use the scalar curvature. We are inspired by his work. For the bottom spectrum, I know I have only 10 minutes, so I'll be somewhat faster on with relating to the proofs, no proofs actually, but I'll just explain what is the extra condition that we need to put. So this time, again, scalar. This time, again, scalar lower bound implies spectrum upper bound. But there are two topological assumptions that are, one topological assumption that is needed, either one of A or B. So either that H2 contains no spherical classes, so any sphere has to be, uh, has to bound, uh, or in the second case, it has Second case, it has finite demands, or and first Betty number is finite. So, if either A or B holds, then we do have to bound. So, now I will not go back so many slides for that, but I'll go to the end where I make that comment that this was the manifold, the universal cover of this guy, was the manifold who created trouble for us. Us um so s2 product with s1 connected sum that manifold has infinitely many ends so that's why it's ruled out by b and of course the spheres are non-trivial so that's why it's ruled out by a so in that that example will not appear but actually it turns out that if we put a or b we do have the result um so that's So that's related to the estimate itself and to the splitting. We do have a splitting, but again, we have to assume H2 doesn't have spherical classes. And we have to assume also that the manifold doesn't have infinite, only infinite volume. So it has at least one finite volume end. Because the example with the tori that I said creates a problem where That I said creates a problem where you have hyperbolic cosine, but depending on a parameter, that example has infinite volume ends. Both ends are infinite volume. So the way we rule out, we say, okay, if it's only one finite volume and at least one finite volume and then we can get rigidity, we can get a splitting. So that's the result. The proof of the result is the same as. Is the same as before. And that's why I introduce these results in the same talk as the others, that they're very much related because we apply the Buckner inequality, Buckner formula. We use Ricci, turn Ricci into scalar with the same trick as before, with the main goal of using this to bound. Using this to bound the gradient, the Hessian term of u, and then plug it in the lambda zero. So the main idea is that the test function you use for in the spectral estimate of m for lambda zero in the variation characterization of lambda zero is gradient to one half. So there are reasons which I won't explain here, but there are very good reasons. Here, but there are very good reasons why you want to take this as a test function. It's pretty much the sharp estimate, that's how you get the sharp estimate, and combine this with the Wagner formula. There are some complications here, so I'll make a couple of comments in closing. The first comment I'll make is that the rigidity is a very tricky business. Of course, we would have liked to have a more general statement, not Have a more general statement, not so many assumptions, topological assumptions, and whatever. But the problem is that if you assume something very general, like you assume scalar bounded from below, you will expect that whatever proof you come up with will imply scalar has to be constant. But that's very difficult to find in the class of examples with maximal spectrum, like the R. The R times the torus with the work product, none of them have scalar constants. So it's almost impossible for me to understand how to prove some result like this, right? Because applying the Bachner technique will lead me to constant scalar curvature, to a work product space. But those examples don't have constant scalar curvature. So if something is lost in the proof, that's why we need assumptions like H2 not containing. Like H2 not containing spherical classes and so on. This assumption on H2 also appears in the work of Hirsch, Kazara, Scuri, and Jang. So it appears in their work on 3D bandwidth estimates. And finally, I'll close with the fact that I kind of avoided to get into certain technical things in this part of the Part of the like concerning lambda one, it turns out for reaching on negative, due to well-known estimates like Liao and so on, um, reaching on negative, you have estimates which says the harmonic function will go to zero at infinity, right? So there are two cases, either goes to zero at infinity or goes to infinity at infinity. Unfortunately, when you work with manifolds that may have negative May have negative lower bound of Ricci or negative lower bound of scalar, the level sets of harmonic functions may not be proper. So the harmonic function may not be proper. The level sets may not be compact. So you have to use something. In our case, we used the cutoff function, which created a lot of problems because level sets not be, I mean, you change your function, it's not harmonic anymore. You kind of ruin the whole. It you kind of ruin the whole program. So it was a bit of work to fix this, but I'm not going to go into that.
