Very nice place, and it's also a nice opportunity to discuss this project that actually is in progress and is in collaboration with the Sir Daniel Fienci and Gregois Minute. So, since the title say that is how to cook these involutions, I will try to present this talk as a Present this talk as a recipe. Okay. And we know that the, okay, first notation, of course. And over C, here we consider projected K3 surfaces of genus G. There exists this ample line bundle. The moduli space of shifts of K-3 surface that we are considering here, we fixed this. We fix this Mokai vector and then we consider examples which are the formation equivalent to Hilbert scheme of points on Ktri surfaces. So, in particular, this talk is on this kind of moduli space. And of course, the dimension of the DRAF categories here is on bounded complexes of coherent shifts. Okay, so as every receipt, we We receive, we need ingredients, right? And as you prefer, if you like salad or salty or sweet, I prefer sweet. So let's say that this is a cake. And we consider the flavor, which is the main ingredient. And this one should be the spherical twist. So let me just remind how you construct it. So you started with a spherical object on K3 surfaces. So in particular, you know that the square of this Particular, you know that the square of these objects, when you consider the Mochai lattice and the pairing, is the square is minus two. So there are a lot in some particular discrete surfaces. And the spherical twist associated to this object is actually an auto-equivalence. This is a classical fact. And you can construct the Fourier-Mouquet transform with the kernel defined by the cone of this evaluation map in this. Evaluation market. Okay, I now change. Okay, well. So remember that actually in this construction of the life categories, this kernel is an object that completes this distinguished triangle. Okay. And you can also precisely describe what is this mass. size describe what is this map for any complexes of shifts. So it's basically given by this last formula. Okay, so but we need sugar or salt. So there is other ingredients that we will mention here and it's the first one is the dual. So for this you consider a complex and it's each of these Each of these elements are locally free shifts. And in particular, the dual, you can obtain it by considering this home. So under some very nice conditions of your projected variety, in particular when it's small, and then you can have that the derived where it's very well defined. So sense a complex in a complex. We know that actually it's a protocol that you. Protocol that you pass for the O positive, but in the right conditions, then you can still have a right complexes of shifts. So this is not the usual dual shift. However, when you consider the double of this double, the double of this complex dual, you will get again the identity. So it's a nice candidate if you are looking for evolutions. Moreover, Moreover, since we are considered projected surfaces, we have compatibility between this derived tensor product and the derived local home. So in particular, we have this functor say some of this functions. Okay. So let me also mention extra ingredients that we will use and other ones that we don't use. Other ones that we don't use, and this is tensoring by line bundles. And line bundles are very nice on K3 surfaces because they are spherical. And we remind that you consider a complex observation, you tensor by the align bundle, and then you get this complex. And you can see also this as a Fourier McKay transform with a particular cardinal of the push forward of L when Eota is the embedding of X. Is the embedding of X in the product of X. Optional ingredients, maybe, I don't know, you like a cake with strawberries. So you can consider the shift founder since it's also something that appears very thoroughly in the category. And also these are founders for KT services. However, in this talk, I prefer don't put fruits. So we just consider the previous ones. We just consider the previous ones, all right. So, what is the receipt of this involution? So, let me introduce the definition. So, you took your spherical object, you took your line bundle, and then you define this pointer, which is given by the R home on the image of the spherical twist in E with respect to L. And then this ponder, in fact, I can decompose like I can decompose like a composition of the my ingredient But now it doesn't work. Okay, yes. So the first question is: okay, this map is well defined on the direct categories. We saw that under certain properties, yes. But it's not immediately true that this is an involution on the direct categories. Okay? So, how can, since we are interested in involutions on my hypercalor, so my hypercaleries, the modulated space of. Hypercaler is the moduli space of shape on this catric or this is my ideal prototype. Okay, and this is something very classical, by the way. So, okay, they decided to show. So the first part, we know that actually a classical FATOM DIF category, so any auto-equivalence on the DF categories can be constructed by a Fourier MOKI transform with some particular kernel. And then so this B. And then so this P up H it's defined by you take this alpha in the Mocha lattex no okay yes I try to point okay yes yes okay this is my mucal lattice this is my mukalatis and there exists this action which is natural and classical given by this Given by these results, so there is a natural way to pass to the complex of shifts in an element in the Mukai lattice. Okay, and then there is also a way to consider these other maps. But now I need to say something about V, okay? And since this map is something that comes natural, I will ask it what are the MUCA vectors that are fixed by this isomorphism. Fixed by this isometry in the Mokai lattice. And then, if you are lucky and you found it, you can consider the orthogonal complement of this V. And well, here I will assume that also the square of V is greater than zero in order to avoid the case of K-3 surfaces. Okay, so higher dimension of hypergales. And we know what is this map. Where is this map? So, actually, if you recognize this map, now it's inverted. So, there, this is the ideal prototype, okay? So, you also need to see the elements here, like, yeah, because it's a superset. And then this level is the, which is the map that I'm interested in comology. So, in the comology of my hypercolor, you need to see what is the map induced by the first. Induced by the first, so and it's just uh push for here. Okay, so uh, the pullback, sorry, the pullback is the same. So, this map, this isomorphism, is also classical. So, it's the Mochai isometry, and we know that this, there exists a nice Hoch isometry between the orthogonal complement of B in the Mochai lattice and the homology of my hyperkeler variables. Of my hypercaler variables. So, this is also very well known, and this is what several people, Nukai, Ogredi, and finally, so now how can procedure here? So, okay, this is the pot where you put the previous prototype was where you will mix everything, okay? But it doesn't mean that if you put a lot of stuff, you will get a nice cake, right? So, you need to. A nice cake, right? So, you need to measure. So, a nice receipt, say how many sugar you need to put it in order to get something which is not so sweet or a little bit sweet. So, this is more or less how you start to impose conditions in order to get that this map induced by these elements on the derived category is an involution in the moduli spaceship. And let me start. And let me start to fix some notation. So you consider a MOCKA vector, which the ample class is V-generic, because you want very nice moduli spaces. So you also assume that a primitive of V and V square greater than zero in order to have that the space that parametrizes these shifts with fixed Mocha vector V. fixed machine vector v is actually a hyperkeler of k3 any type when n is this number uh this is i mean it's a classical result and we know that so many people is involved in this in this general fact very not so first question is shift is sending in a ship so i sometimes looks like a stupid question but it's tricky and And of course, what is the order of this map? This is something that we can actually partially resolve with. Consider the action of the Mokai lattice, and this is something that then imposes a condition also on the Lyme bundle. Since there is, we will see that stand study, the action of these autoequalens on the MUCAI lattice are actually very well known and reflections and blah blah blah. We will. Now and reflections and blah blah blah. We will see later. Then you can also ask the condition of these two parameters, L. And then it should be orthogonal, have to live in the orthogonal complement of the Mukai vector of this spherical object. So it's more technical. So then you need to ask for the stability conditions did it preserve it, right? And of course, you And of course, you need to try to see what of these implications you will get. So, maybe you add in the biggest one, and then you are looking here, okay, with the slowest semi-stability. But then we know that we want something here, since my moduli space is defined in shifts that are semi-stable. However, stable and semi-stable are the same because we are considered multi-vector shifts. Consider MUCA vectors which are primitive, so this is equivalent here, but you need to see when maybe is always stable or not, and this is more or less the tricky. And if you want an automorphism or a variational. Oops. So here it is not in every for any shift. So you will ask this condition and for some people that. And for some people that is familiar, this condition is called it when what are the shifts that banish the first homology? So this is the weak brill netter condition. If there is an empty, a non-empty set, so then this defines a very well open subset where your map is defined. Okay. Okay, so and of course, you need to preserve the Mokai. Serve the Mokai vector, right? So, first, you need to computer what is the Mokai vector of this map. And then, if you know something on the action in comology, well, you want them to see that they preserve or not the period, and then you ask that it in the two elements, how acts on the two elements. Is this the same or mines? The same or much. Okay? Okay. So, how to start? I mean, to cook the ingredients. So, take the place where you are you want to cook, then you put the first the auto equivalence. And remember that if you consider the spherical twist, then the induced map on the Mochai lattice is given by the reflection. lattice is given by the reflection on a class on a minus two class semispherical object so ds is a minus two and and we have explicit description okay so if you consider the dual the action of the dual in the mocha lactics is given by the first and the third components are the identity but switch the sign in the second one and the third ingredient And the third ingredient we that is tensor by line bundles, well, it has a more a large formula and it's given by this, but it's some is given by the multiplication in the cap product of homology. And you make the cap product with the with the shared classes of your L. And so this is now. This is now the type of stuff that we want to control it in order to produce a stability, send to stability, fix it in MOCA vector and shift, send into shift, etc. So how can do that? Well, you start into playing with a little bit of set. So you fix L of degree D, then you consider, let's Then you consider, let's simplify the notation. So now we'll call it PSD and because L is this one. And assuming that, well, you need something good. So you're assuming that it's a torsion free shift. And put conditions in order to get that the image is well defined. You ask this X1, X2 are zero. Are zero. Moreover, you ask that the coherence of the evaluation map is a torsion shift. Then you can computer this our involution like the receipt. It's actually simplified like this. So it is our hone of the between the spherical twist in E with respect to S and this my line bundle. So now you can take the dual of the distinguished Dual of the distinguished triangle, as we mentioned before, of the valuation map, and then you get this sequence, this act sequence. So now phys D appears like this, and then you can computer a co-homology, okay? And then you will ask the conditions in order to get that how to obtain this PC in terms of this our home. And well. And well, you play in a little bit with the hypothesis, and then you get it what you want. Okay, so PSD in this E can be computed for these, sorry, for any torsion free shield is given by this homology, so these sections on the leaf. Okay, so we see that we ask this vanishing in X. Could this vanishing in x1 in x2? We will see also that we need to computer the mocha vector and then your computer because you know how they act in the in the mochai latex. And then this is a little bit tricky, but at the end you reduce to the case that the degree of this L that we defined before at the end, if you wanted to have involutions, this To have an involution, these have to be equal to zero or equal to one. So, in fact, there is a lemma behind there because then you show that any D you can reduce to these two cases, passing for a conjugate. But since we wanted to get that also the multi-vector is fixed, we assume in this condition between the spherical object and my arbitrary. And my arbitrary coherent shape. And in the case that D is equal to zero, you get that it is fixed if and only if the spherical object happens to be the trivial one. And the first and the third component of the MOCAI vector, so the MUCA vector of a modulation shift have to be equal. So that happens in That happens in the case of d equal to zero. And similar way, you can also get a characterization of this condition that we wanted for t equal to one. And these are the possibility. So now in this case, we see that the invariance of my spherical object have to satisfy it at the Have to satisfy it that the run should be two. The finisher class is H, and the third class depends on the degree of H. Okay, and then you also have this equality in terms of the V1, V0, V2. Okay, so let's go to the part of the stability condition. So this is very tricky, but This is very tricky, but the point is that also again, you start to ask this X, this vanishes in the X in the extensions, and then you will see that actually the kernel of EV has to be supported on isolated points in order that Phi is again torsion-free. So I put it like this, like a question. When I have this, well, when happen this, at least we know. Okay? So we all. Okay, so we also tried to get weak conditions, but for the moment, those conditions are enough. And this is our one of the lemma. In additional, we will ask that this is new stable, yes, if the kernel of EB is mu stable. Okay, so then again, under these conditions, but now that we know that we want them to preserve. We know that we want them to preserve the Mukai vector, and we consider that the first year class is H, you get that this came immediately. Okay, so the co-kernel of this is supporting on isolated points, and the kernel of the valuation map is also new stable. So then you get it what you wanted on the image. Okay, so to be honest, To be honest, I will just mention the results. But the proofs are quite long. However, most of the proofs are based on the facts that I mentioned before. So how to find this right invariance. Okay. And again, the game is how I need to measure numerical conditions on my spherical object and my light bundle. So I will play with these two. So I will play with these two. And the point is that when you consider projected, and the first result that we have is when my K2, okay, so the same hypothesis of my projected K2 surfaces. And now we play with the rank of this MUCHI vector. And we found that if this rank satisfied this inequality, This inequality. So remember that is the genius of my K-3 surfaces. Then this map is actually a well-defined involution on my whole moduli space. So it's an automorphism. But that's what you ask too much. And then if you want them to get something which is, okay, maybe it's not well defined and everything. Maybe it's not well defined in everything in every coefficient, but then you can relax the conditions, the previous condition, and then maybe you can get it something which is very rational. And to this, in order to prove it, this, you use the weak Brillnetter condition, so that I mentioned at the beginning. So this is how we can also get it by rational involution on this model. Involution on this mobilized space, and let me just say that there is a very well-known involution which motivates this work. And it's actually when you consider the spherical object is opiate, so the trivial line bundle. And perhaps it's one of the so many involutions by Professor Bobil. Professor Bobil, but let's say that when you put some conditions on the K3 surface, so these conditions that we were asking in terms X, so in the moduli spatial shift, when, for instance, you look the genus 3, what you get is an H half degree 4. Form. And then this is. We know that actually the previous talk that he mentioned the Mokai models, then we know that we have a quartic in P3. And so we know how this is moduli space is isomorphic to X2. So the Hilbert skin points. So how can I see all of these conditions of my moduli? Of my moduli space in the Hilbert scheme. Well, it's actually if you consider a point in the Hilbert scheme of points of these K3 surfaces, then you will get it to points. You consider the line, right, in P3, and then you intersect it with the quartic. So the involution, the geometrical involution by Bobil is the this, you find, you intersect the line in the quantity. In the quantity in four points, two of them are my started point in the Hilbert skin, and then you send into the another two ones. So, this is broadly speaking, what is the geometrical evolution. And the point is that this is, if you do the calculations on the moduli space, you will get it actually the previous construction, but consider the This construction, but consider the spherical object like the trivial. So then, oh, okay. So let me just, oh, okay, see, yes. So this is on the sketch of more or less what I tried to say in the modelized spaceship. But how the ideas to computer this in this case is general, in some sense, we generalize this construction, but for Sense we generalize this construction, but for arbitrary spherical objects, not just OX. Okay, and if you want to do another exercise, consider genus equal to two, and then you will find other geometrical involution. But now the K-3 surface is, you know, that is the double cover of two in a sexy. So then you need to find the right one. And similar, if you want in our And in our general statement, if you consider this Mochi vector, so now for Rangu, you can see that there exists actually two involutions. So this is also another interesting example. Okay, so what happened when the rank of the spherical object is not one? So now we saw that the Mukai vector have to be in. That the MUCAI vector has to be in this way. And then you need to start to find the other conditions. Again, the game is how to get a stability condition, how to send a shift in a sheaf, etc. And where is well defined, so for any query shift or not. So this is a criteria to determine when phi, but now with S and one. Now, with S and one, S, this is spherical object with this particular numerical invariance, it's induced me a birational involution on the Hilbert scheme of S with these points. In a similar way, you can also do it for higher genus, and then you will find also this numerical condition because you want something. Numerical condition because you want to sound here in clear. So, question, and then this is also the receipts say that, okay, this map actually is well defined in the all shifts with this Mochai vector. And then you continue to continue find it to get weak. So, to get weak conditions or other more and more involutions. And then you can also find that if you construct the involution with this MUCI vector, in the moduli space with this Mocha vector, for genus greater or equal than two, and again, this okay. And again, the you put limitations between the first and the third. The first and the third component, so V0 and also depends on the degree of H, you will get it that the receipt gives you have a rational evolution. Okay, and since we are interested or not if this receipt actually generalizes also other properties of some other well-known Some other well-known involutions that at least we know that the Bogillian volution is also anti-symplectic. So we wonder if this also preserved or not the period. And the point is that in the main theorem with these restrictions, you also get it that is anti-symplectic. Okay? So this was the case when the spherical that is. The spherical that is trivial. However, give you more than one. And how many minutes I have? Zero. Okay, just let me say that to prove this, it's again natural. Okay. I mean, there are many ways to prove stuff, right? But of course, this, as I presented here, a prototype, you try to follow. Prototype, you try to follow this in the diagrams, but you have to be careful also because you are doing stuff on the Muckelattis. So you have more of these conditions on the extending than on severity. And then you need to see what is the correspondent in the orthogonal complement, but now in the comology of your hypercaleous, so in the comology of your moduli space. And and okay. I think I I think this is not the last no this is okay and of course you you wanted to do all the magic with Lattice theory and then to study the invariant of the co-invariant of these candidates. So this is also something that appears in our work. So thanks.
