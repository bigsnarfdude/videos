I won't talk too much about collective cell behavior. I'm going to talk about work that's still unpublished and ongoing. And if time permits, I'll mention a few related projects that are recent as well as ongoing. So the first thing to remind people is of cell motility. All of you, of course, have seen this. All of you, of course, have seen this famous movie, I think, of neutrophil, a white blood cell navigating between red blood cells. So, this movie has been around for decades and is a classic movie we always show in such talks. Now, underneath the hood, there's this huge regulatory system that governs how cells move. And in the middle of that system, And in the middle of that system, there are some highly important proteins called GTPases that funnel stimuli down to the actin cytoskeleton, which then causes the cell front to protrude outwards and causes, is in charge of many aspects of cell mortality. And some years back in 2008, we took that. We took that regulatory layer of the so-called GTPAs and attempted to find out something about their mathematical structure in a very simple model that basically concentrated on just one typical GTPase that has active and inactive forms. We assumed that it self-activates. And it turned out that that was enough to account for. That was enough to account for many aspects of cell polarity. And we refer to that model as the wave-pinning model for historical reasons. You'll see that this title recurves. Now, we've looked at many other models, which are variants, smaller or bigger variants of that big, big regulatory circuit. Here's the wave pinning version up on the top left. Version up on the top left. And I'll mention a few of these others if time permits. Among other things, we try to use some of these models to predict and simulate cell motility in two dimensions. So on this slide, I've concentrated examples that were worked on by many postdocs and students. One was an undergrad, several were active. One was an undergrad, several were actually postdocs, and one was working with a colleague of mine, Anutida Matsfamuse. And all of them were attempting to find what the cell shape would be based on this idea of regulatory proteins protruding the cell edge outwards. Now, what's the problem with this? The challenge is that we have to We have to simulate reaction diffusion of these regulators in this two-dimensional domain for simplicity. It's really in a 3D domain with membrane and interior. For simplicity, we try to simulate these in 2D, keeping in mind that the domain is deforming. And the solution to the equations that are describing the regulatory Describing the regulatory protein, the GTPA's distribution affects the boundary motility. So it turns out to be quite a complicated numerical problem. And many people invented their own way of doing it. And of course, once the postdoc finishes their position in the group, they leave and take this with them. So we have to reinvent the wheel. Now, luckily, in recent In recent years, there is some free open source software called Morpheus, and a talented master student, Jupiter, was able to use that open source software to do much of this kind of cell motility simulation using inbuilt techniques. And so that opens the way both for a lot of Both for allowing us to investigate the problem and even more so to share simulations with the community. So when we publish a paper, the figures can be linked to XML files, and anybody can download and reproduce exactly what we've done. Okay, now switching gears a little bit. In recent years, there's been an increase in our ability to control. Our ability to control and measure cell behavior, control cells by laser light, by optogenetically activating their regulators. So some laser would activate something that in turn activates one of the GTPAs. For example, a GTPA is known as a rack, and that will cause the cell to move left or move right as its regulators shift. Regulators shift along the cell front. So, recently, based on the fact that we can now easily simulate cells in 2D, we started a collaboration with Orion Weiner and his former PhD student, Jason Towne. They wrote a paper back in 2023 about optogenetic stimulation of neutrophils. Of neutrophils. And what's shown here is a cell that's either stimulated at the front with light, which activates something that activates rack, or on the side or in reverse. And these are actually images of real cells, what's shown here, and real cell trajectories. And you see that you can force the cell to turn left or right or to eventually turn around. Or to eventually turn around and reverse the direction of motion. Now, I'm going to talk about a couple of protocols that they use for stimulation. There'll be a step that takes a nonpolar cell and causes it to become polar. And then they will either use local stimulation on one or another side, possibly to stimulate a cell. Possibly to stimulate a cell or get it to turn. And also, they'll use what they call global stimuli, where the whole cell is stimulated at once, which activates this GTPase rack all over the cell. I'll also describe our modeling idea, and that is that now we're going to take and represent the cell by the activity of. By the activity of this regulating protein rack on the edge, so on the periphery of the cell, with much the same kind of wave pinning mini model that I've described earlier. And here we're going to map this edge of the cell to a one-dimensional periodic domain. So if BRAC is high here in the front of the cell, you'll see a bunch. Front of the cell, you'll see a bump with high RAC activity and inactive RAC will be fairly uniform throughout the cell. Okay, this describes a little bit more about the modeling methods. There are some PDEs that live on this periodic one-dimensional domain. That domain is being mapped onto the edge of a morpheus CPM. CPM cell, cellular POTS model cell. And in turn, wherever RAC is high, that causes the edge of the cell to protrude outwards so that the cell will tend to move in that direction. So for reasons of time, I have to skip many of these technical details, but suffice it to say that we can mimic the stimulation by inserting activities. By inserting activation terms in those PDEs, activation terms that are spatially dependent. And we can depict those by some kind of wedge in our simulation. So, for example, a light stimulus, which is localized in this periodic 1D domain, would be this blue curve, and it will affect the behavior. The behavior of the rack due to the additional activation term. So, this is just an example to show that something like this can be made to work. I'll have more details in a minute. And when you look at many such cells, you can create a set of trajectories and see how they behave. All right, so let's compare how our model compares with some of their data. So I'm going to use the very simple wave pinning model. I'm going to look at data where they took a cell and stimulated it locally in the rear. And we saw that that cell will turn around. So most of the trajectories will head backwards. And the wavepinning model. And the wave pinning model does much the same. So the cell starts here, and it's now moving upwards but stimulated at its rear, and it moves as predicted. Same thing when they produce or they use two stimuli, one in the left and the right. The real cell picks one side to veer towards, the model does the same. Towards the model does the same. So, at least for these simple experiments, the simple model performs well, for which I put these check marks. Now, what happens when they do a slightly more exotic stimulation protocol, where first they stimulate a polarized cell locally, which causes it to reorient and turn around. And turn around, and then they stimulate the entire cell globally. And it turns out something surprising happens: that the cell actually turns the other way. So here, the cell turns first one way and then the opposite way after the global stimulus. And this is the real cell and the data. So first it's moving one way, then it reverses its direction of orientation. Its direction of orientation and turns, as you can also see with these trajectories. Can our model account for this? Well, not quite. So if we run the model and we run many of these simulations, what we see is that once the cell receives global stimulation, it'll stop turning and it'll basically veer off into a kind of more or less straight path. Straight path in the direction in which it was heading. So, somehow, we're unable to capture this turning behavior that they see experimentally. Note that their tracks turn back, ours do not. So in their original paper, Towne and Weiner attempted to explain or account for this by postulating that there's an inhibitor. An inhibitor that's promoted by this regulatory GTPA is the RAC, and it in turn inactivates RAC, and that could account for the behavior. So we tried that. First thing, what we did was we tried to mimic the kind of time behavior that they obtained. This is real data on the top. And this lower panel shows that a model. Shows that a model with inhibitor has similar behavior to what's seen as far as temporal data of active RAC inside the cell, not spatially distributed, just total active RAC. And similarly, it can account for these double pulse experiments. So, here I should have mentioned that the light blue bands are when the light is on, and the white bands are when. And the light bands are when the light is off, and they have protocols where these are either well spaced apart in time or one after the other. And the model with the inhibitor can account more or less nicely for this green active RAC curve. For the moment, you can ignore the orange curve, which is a phosphoronosetide. Mention that later. The model can also account for some of the spatial experiments when we add the inhibitor. Namely, now the inhibitor here is shown in orange, the stimulus is still in blue, and the model shows that the cell will veer to one side as it did in their simple protocol. It also accounts for so-called latrunculin treated cells. Trunculin treated cells where the cell shape doesn't change, the cell doesn't polarize geometrically, but it does have differences between rack in the front and the back. And so a protocol of local and then global stimulation gives rise to data that looks like this experimentally. So the rack first, the left minus right signal. Minus right signal first goes up and comes back down, and the model is able to account for that as well. All right, so we asked, can the model with the inhibitor also give us this reversal in the exotic local versus global simulation stimulation? When we tested it, we found that nope, the model is still not. No, the model is still not quite what we need. Somehow, these trajectories do not look like the experimental ones. There's still some part of this that's missing. And so the part that's actually missing, it turns out, after much, many trials and many different things that were considered, is that the light stimulus here, their optogenetic stimulus, doesn't Doesn't directly activate the GTPAs. It actually activates an enzyme that creates phosphoronosetide, which in turn activates RAC. So there's a little bit of a lag between the light and the PIP3. And when we include that in the model, then all of a sudden things begin to work out. So let me So, let me explain what's going on here. I'll show this step by step. Let's look at this one step at a time. So, initially, the cell starts off in some direction, and this is the distribution of the GTPAs, the inhibitor, the phosphonoset, and at the moment there's no light stimulus. Now, the light stimulus is turned on, as shown by this wedge. As shown by this wedge in the cell. And things begin to move towards the right. So the rack activity moves rightwards because of the stimulus. This is followed by stimulating the entire cell, global stimulus, at time three. And you'll notice that everything begins to move in a left. To move in a leftwards direction. So the distribution of these regulatory proteins begins to move in the opposite direction, accounting for this bend. So in summary, as far as this, what I've told you so far, I've shown that a relatively simple model for cell polarity, which is really wave pinning with some variations. With some variations on that theme, it is able to account for some things that are seen experimentally in optogenetic stimulation neutrophils. Fine-tuning the model will either invalidate the hypotheses or confirm that at least they may hold some validity. Of course, there's a lot more to be done to fix. More to be done to fit parameters and to test various other protocols, but that overall these things can give us a little bit better insight to some of the underlying mechanisms of cell motility. Now, I think I still have a couple of minutes left, given that I started late. So, I want to just briefly add a few remarks about some of the other Add a few remarks about some of the other models that we've investigated and link them to this very simple wave pinning behavior that I've described today. So in view of the fact that this is a conference or a workshop that has a mechanical theme, I wanted to mention that we have had variants of the basic wave pinning, which is this part on. On the right, where contraction and tension are actually implicated, the active GTPase rho is known to lead to myosin contractility, which creates tension, and this could potentially activate Rho or possibly inactivate RAC. So we had a team of students back in 2010. Team of students back in 2018 study this sort of variant. And they showed, first of all, in one dimension, a chain of cells. Here, the cells are all aligned along the y-axis. They're each one-dimensional, and we're seeing basically their length as well as the level of active GTPAs inside the cell. So we see that different types of behaviors are possible. Types of behaviors are possible in such a model, including everything expands, all the cells contract and squeeze in, or undergo cycles of expansion and contraction, or various other transients. This was also shown in two dimensions in cellular paths formalism in CompuCell3D, where now we're looking at multiple cells. Looking at multiple cells, and we see waves of both cell contraction and GTPA levels, shown by the color scheme. And this is a time sequence, which shows how these propagate inside a two-dimensional tissue. All this from this very, very simple model consisting only of these ingredients. In another set of In another set of works with Andreas Bettenshen, who's now an assistant professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, he looked at polarity reversal again due to optogenetics, inspired by a paper by O'Neill and others from the lab of GOTAM. And he showed that he could get, again, one-dimensional cells to Dimensional cells to undergo similar polarization. And in fact, the model was simple enough that he could do a full bifurcation analysis to probe what feedback strength in the model and what stimulus strength is needed to assure one that you would get repolarization. In other work with Andreas, we looked at the interaction of a couple of cells. Of a couple of cells that both have a polarity model and are influenced and are influenced by their internal tension. And finally, a related ongoing project that's happening right now with a PhD student, Jack Hughes, and a colleague, Arik Jochelis, is a model where we're looking mathematically at a very similar kind. At a very similar kind of structure. So it's wave pinning with an inhibitor, but this time the inhibitor is actually the filamentous actin. And it was shown previously with postdoc Bill Holmes that models of this sort can produce both polar cells and traveling waves. These are now Kyman graphs with time and the cell. With time and the cell perimeter shown here on the axes. And what Jack Hughes is being able to do is do a full PDE bifurcation analysis to understand how these kind of solutions emerge. So how do we get transitions between one and the other as we vary certain parameters, such as the rate of GTPs inactivation? Of GTPs inactivation. Why are these important? Well, we certainly see these kinds of actin-inspired waves appearing in papers in the literature. And so now we're hoping to be able to use these simple models to understand a little bit of their mathematical structure. And finally, Jupiter, working with Jack, has been able to take some of his traveling waves. Traveling waves and these bifurcation points, and actually implement them in these motile cells to show how, in different parameter regimes, you can get polarity, you can get cells that turn, you can get cells that spin or ruffle with time. And that will conclude my talk. I'd like to just thank the Canadian government for the funding. Government for the funding, as well as the Morpheus team for making this software freely available to everybody and to the many group members for their work. Thank you very much.
