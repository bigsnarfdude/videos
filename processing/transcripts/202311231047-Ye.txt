Nicer for the vision. It's not really too clear. And so I'm going to talk something different. So most of the talk for convex bodies, but I'm not going to concentrate on the compact set. I'm going to talk about unbounded one. So and that's a dual Mikaus problem for complex set points. So let me talk about some motivation of the problem. So we know that the Mikaus problem is trying to Trying to construct a convex body based on gaze and measure. So, usually we do this for convex bodies. So, I'm going to use K0N means the convex bodies, which is this everybody knows, so I'm not going to agree. So, with a bracket, it means the convex body with origin inside the interior. So, then we know the radial function, it's the maximum lambda, so lambda u. That occurs. Okay, so then with this guy, we know how to calculate volume, right? It's formula. Here, DO means the sphere convection on the sphere. Now, in the dual Boomika theory, then we are interested in this guy. This is the power n, this is power q. Basically, you can view this one as the norm, the n-norm, L n norm of the radial function, if you take the n-scroop. And here will be just. And here will be just L2 node in some sense, right? So this is the major one for demo theory. And with this guy, we can introduce the measure. For example, we know we require the calculator to develop a service area measure. So what's the calculator? Look at this point. So this is the support hybrid plan, and this is my common spot, this point. This point, and the normal vector is denoted by the Dausener. And what we are interested in basically is this guy from this direction and then to V. So this is called the radial Gauss map. So basically you have a direction u, you extend this to the boundary, and then you calculate the normal vector. So it's just a composition of two. One is the radial function, and then another one is the Daussifact. Dausa. Okay? But this is not what we want. We want the reverse one. So you give me V and we go back to U. So it's simple. Basically, you just calculate the reverse cosmetic. If you know the direction, the normal vector, you go back to the boundary, look for the point of points on the boundary, and then you normalize this, you get a direction. So that's the reverse radio. So we are looking for u instead of v. Instead of read. Why is this important? Because we can use this guy to define measure. So measure is basically local, right? Local. So we just say, okay, for any Bureau measure, Barrier set eta, and Q is a real number. So you can define the Q-steer culture measure based on this formula. So this is pretty much like a Q-steer volume, but then this guy, this guy is different. This guy is not a whole sphere. The whole sphere. It's just a part of this. And what's that? So you use eta, that's your set, and you use a reverse radio Gauss map to put it into another set of the sphere, then you calculate this integral. That's the Q-steel culture measure. And then this of course will be obtained from the variation formula based on this Q-steel volume and the log perturbation. Locker perturbation. So that's well known by Lu Duang, Yang, Jia, and Huang. Now then, yeah, I need to mention this is a part function out of the notes here, so I'm not going to explain. Alright, so then the L P dual culture measure is basically this formula. Basically, this L P dual cohort measure is absolutely continuous with the Kielstein culture measure. And the Measure and this is the density function over the support function called you have you can ask like LP2 equals problem. So basically we you are given the final measure mu on the sphere and pq are some numbers. You need to find the conditions so that you are able to solve this uh this equation. This mu is k1. This k is constructed based on the variation. This k is constructed based on the variation formula of how much k. So you wonder why or when they are the same, right? Or how you can find this k, so this equation holds. And I list a lot of people who made a contribution. I may not be able to list all of them, but just show you many people have done some work here. Okay, my motivation is this. It's for the comments. It's for the convex body, right? Convex body is compact, convex set. So are we able to do this for unbounded one? For example, a typical example is the C closed set introduced by Schneider. So this C is a fixed pointed closed cone with vertex at its origin. And of course, an armed interior. I'm going to draw a picture for you, and then you'll say, well, what's going on? Was very normal. So then you have a C-close set, a cycle convex set, C-full set. So I said it's C-close set if it's a close convex set such that the complement of A bullet with respect to C, which is denoted by A, as a finite volume. And then if this is the case, then the set A will be called a cylindrical convex. Convex. And the last one I'm going to need is the C full set. Means what? That means this A is bounded in diameter. So let me show you the picture, then it's clear. So if you look at these two lines with this O, it forms the column C. And the A bullet is this. The unbonded one is closed and convex. And this part is A, this is co-convex. If the volume of A is finite, and A is finite, and this, of course, what we cannot be finite, right? So that's the model, general model. If you make sure this A is not empty and bounded, it will be like this. So the bundle of A bullet will touch the bundle of the column C. So in this case, it is a finite boundary. In this case, I call it A bullet is still full set. Still, full set is much nicer because Much nicer because it's kind of like a boundary one, right? If you look at A, this is a boundary set, start body, and this is not, right? So it's nice for a safer set. So let me talk about some terminology. For example, if you want to define the support function, you should know where we can define. So then this is the, we call it omega C product, which is the definition or the Which is the definition or the domain for the support function? It is the intersection of the interior of the product coin of C with the sphere. Of the product coin is this guy. So x, y, the uniform xy equal to 0, and you let y run over C, you get all such X. So that's the, the set of such X is the polycon. Then here's the picture. So you have a C here, and how do you draw? Here and how do you draw a polar coin? You just draw a vertical line here, vertical line here. This part is say polar. And then I'm going to normalize this. So, sorry, this is say color. I'm going to normalize this. So, it just we can say colour is here, this part. And you can see that if I use this one to draw higher plans, then you can say, okay, this will be the right definition for the right domain for the support function. Especially if you look. Especially if you look at this one locally, then you can define the Gauss map. You can define everything locally. For example, radio function, support function, the Gauss map, the reverse Gauss map. Because it's local, these are all local, right? So you can define as usual. So you can define a support function like before. But then always keep the u in the domain omega C product. And in this case, the support function is negative. It's negative. It's necked because it's still in the same box. And then it also has hyperflames, so I'm not going to explain that. Everybody familiar with here. And you can also construct a C closet. Basically, it's the intersection of all support in half space. And it just and also you have to intersect with C, because everybody is inside C. So it's it's pretty much like uh what you have seen for comics for it, but it's just uh Simple context for it, but it's just this tuckle, this sphere, and you just use omega sql. And then you can also define the surface area. Because this is our local, right? This are local. You use the sphere mesh like this. Surface area like this. Basically, you have a Gauss map, right? Then you use the reverse Gauss map to put the eta back to the boundary of a bullet, and then you take the hospital measure, and you get. You take the hostile measure and you get the surface area measure of any bullet. But I want to mention that the surface error measure here is not finite. Maybe, okay? Especially if it can go to infinite place, right? But if A is equality is the full set, then nice, right? It's always finite. Always finite. So you can see that we define You can see that we define everything for A bullet, but I want to work on A. And if you look at my picture, then A and A bullet, they share the same boundary. So whatever you define on A bullet should be also used for A. So for example, this support function I can use for A, but I have to change a little bit. I have to use minus sign of this support function of A product. So this makes it positive. If I make it positive, Okay, if I make it positive, I can do a lot of a combination. For example, LP plus or whatever plus you can do, right? Just like the LP boom because theory. So you can use LP addition. You have to make sure this is positive. And it's natural also, right? The surface area, you just let them do the same because they are all positive. Now you can define a mixed one. These are based on Shineader's result. Okay, so you use the surface area, multiple height, and then you integral over. And then the integral over the domain, right? You get the mixed volume. So the height is for A2, the self-array is for A1. So it's it's just uh exactly the same as before, but you will see a lot of difference. But I'm not going to tell that today. So you can calculate the volume like this. It's the base area times the height integral over the domain, just the one. The nation either asks, okay, whether you can The nationality asks, okay, whether you can solve this uh uh this mean cost problem. So mu is a given measure on regard say product, then whether you are able to find a say co-convex set, so that mu equal to the surface area measure of A. So he solved this one in two papers and he has he established the existence and the uniqueness for this problem. And then uh And then we actually, with my poster and his student, we did an LP version. We just used the user way to introduce the LT self-array measure, and we asked the same question. So what is LT surface area measure? We just use the support function is to power 1 minus v, then modify the self-array measure. Then you can ask the same question. Alright. So that's the next. Alright, so that's the natural thing for the extension. Then you have a nice PD, so this is module here type equation. But it's quite different because the domain here is now open set. Okay, and then the function is an active function. So it makes the equation a little bit harder. And the user tool may not be working well, for example, the flow technique. We are working on that. It seems to be complicated. But anyway, we do have a nice option. But anyway, we do have a nice object for PDE people and then we actually use some standard way to get LPE microscopy in the code and we get a uniqueness for this program. And we also prove the existence. So I'm not going to expand this because it's not my major topic today, but I just want to show you we have such a result. You can prove some existence. And what I want to mention is that the case when P equals zero, this Mention is that the case when p equals zero, then you get a common volume measure. Coin volume measure, like before, you can say this is the height, this base area marked by the height. That's the poly volume. Then the Shineda asks, okay, whether you are able to find the solution for the incorporation like this. You just replace the measure by the common volume measure. So this is uh the famous uh like the incomplex quality case is the famous logo problem. And uh and uh people had a hard time to solve it, right? has a hard time to solve it, right? But for the unbounded case, it's easier. So we can solve it. And then Schneider asked whether you are able to get uniqueness for this problem. And fortunately, we are able to solve it in a not so hard way. So we get a uniqueness. We actually established a lot of inequality, which is hard for the convex body case, but easier for this one. So the philosophy here is whatever hard in convex. Whatever harder in common spotty case will be easy here. But when whatever easy here will be harder for the common spotty case, and whatever harder for this case will be easy for common spotty. So they're kind of offside. That's why we are able to solve the uniqueness for the logum in cost problem here. But the complex body key is still open, still quite open, broad. Now, we knew that the convoluted method is a very special case of the Measure is a very special case of the dual culture measure. It's just the case when Q equals N. So, another question to ask is whether we are able to get a dual culture measure for the unbounded list. That's my major problem today. But that's the motivation also. So, my model is here, right? So, if you look at this one, then you should also think: okay, how can I define something we need? For example, We need. For example, uh are we able to define radio function like a duality, the radial Gaussian level, or its reverse? And even this basic one, how do you get the somebody to replace convex body containing the origin inside interior? It turns out something are very simple. For example, the radio function, the Gaussian that I mentioned already, because they are local. When this local, you just do whatever you have done as before. Okay, for example, the radio function. It just views this, it just views this. Just uh view this uh you just view this set as a start, start, start set, or start point. You get what you want. Although you may have some trouble, for example here, for this direction, it's infinity. But you don't care, why? Because uh but you are going to take an integral and those uh those matches are zero, you just don't don't don't care. Right? So they do have trouble, but they don't care. Alright, so locally you can define really a function, you can define the Radio function, you can define the radio Gaussian app, you can define reverse Gaussian Gaussian map, radio Gaussian map, whatever you have seen before locally. But there are two things which are not so easy. For example, trying to find a substitution for this K0N. And also the pod. We need also the polar body. So we are going to take a look for the definition here. So suppose you have a set like this. Have a set like this, okay? How hard to make it convex? Well, so we introduce a notion called the closed convex hole of E about the chord, which is defined as the intersection of all, say, closed set containing E. In this case, you guarantee it's closed and convex and it's unique. Okay? And then we introduce another set, a family of sets called the C convex. Family of sets called C-compatible sets. That means what? We assume that E does not contain the origin and E is a subset of C and such that E equal to the closed convex form of E about C. So it's just a natural idea because we have done this for convex body, right? So if it's convex body, then this set should be equal to the convex floor of itself. Of itself. So we just take the same idea, but we have to know what's the common sword. Yeah, right? The common sword turns out to be exactly like this. You can use the C closet containing E. And you take the intersection. And look at my picture. So you will see this is my set E, and then the convex one is just like this. Just like the red half. Okay? Alright. And we are since you And we are since you have defined the curve store, then you can think, okay, when we are able to define polar. The polar is defined in this way. So suppose E is not in subset of C that does not contain origin. And then we can define the product body of E with respect to C based on this formula. So basically I take all x inside the C product so that x in the paradigm is y is more than equal to y. y is more than equal to y minus 1 where y inside E. Okay? So it's pretty much as before, but you change 1 to minus 1. Because it's natural, it's doing unbounded one, right? And we found that, okay, somebody has done a similar col call up, but we didn't know, so so we claim that they they are different in our original version, but then the referee said, Okay, they shouldn't be the same. Then drummer three said, okay, they shouldn't be the same. Why? Because if you look at this relation, right? So our colour and their product just, oh, this is safe product for them. Sorry. This is just a small difference, right? So our polar just equal to their polar intersection with C colour. So he claimed that this shouldn't be the same. Then we take a week to prove it. And it turns out to be true, right? So assume that assume something, then you will get the other same. So I'm not going to explain. They are the same. So, I'm not going to explain what's the meaning of restriction wrong, but yes, it does happen, these two are the same, but you need to put the actual condition. So, I'm not going to explain in detail. And what makes it more amazing is this result. I see duality. I shall also be and uh oh, Wychesna, right? Square. Sorry I asked your name, but I forget. What why che Wychesany? Chair why chesony? Sorry, it's hard. I tried actually ten times, sorry, but it's really hard. Yeah, okay, but uh yeah, this very nice paper in 2023, they had a very nice uh duality which contains everything I would say. Like I had a I had a paper for the bicycling, uh which I use a sign sign for like a like a all uh cross product. Cross product and it also fought in this framework. Now, here comes again. I have to use their framework again. So, here, if you look at their result, I just let the cost function to be this one. If I want to say to the product, C and into R, and then you just take the cosine, right? X dot Y and put minus sign. And you just let T equals 1, you get the safe error. So it's amazing that we go back to the safe order again. We go back to the state director again. Which is natural because we are doing mean cross-problem, we are doing the follow here and it should increase the optimal mass transportation, then it should have a positive function. It's natural, I hope to say. Then here are some quite standard properties. I'm not going to to to to to say all of them, but they're just very natural. For example, you have a by product. When you do the product twice, you get a uh you will get a comma V. Okay? Common squares of E. And then in particular, when you do the follow-up three times, it will just equal to the folder, just do it once, right? So this is always true. This always true. If you do once, and it's equal to if you do three times, that's always true. And then you can just get the relation between the support function and the radio function. Basically, this should be one over. To be one over of the supporter function, the radio function should be one over of the supporter function, but you take a map minus side. Remember, my supporter function is negative. And similar here. But you have to know the C and the C column because I'm going to do correlating on C or C colour. It's very important. So I just always keep a mind corn here. The philosophy is one over the radial function of the core, of the polar equal to. Of the core, of the product equal to the support function. What over the support function equals the radio function of the product? So it's always like that. That's a bipolar theorem. With this one, we can define what we need, for example, convex, we call it convexification. So suppose you have a set theta in the omega C and you have a continuous function rho on this theta, then you can define. Theta, then you can define a set E which contains all the points like R V times V. And this may not be convex. What do you do? You just do the convex short of that, right? You just do the convex short. Basically, convex score, you just do the pot. Okay? Just do the pot. So that's how we define. And then you can define also wolf shape. Wolf shape is simpler, just like before. You have omega in the omega say product, then In the omega C colour, then you can use the support half space to find the convex object. So this we are familiar with, right? But this is also okay because you just use the pod, you will get a convex one. So the relation between these two are okay this guy. If I do the work shape for F, basically it's the convex The convex score of f to the power minus 1 and then take the column. Okay? So let me repeat it again. So you take the convex score of f1 over f but you have to notice the column. And then you will get a convex set. Then you do the product, you get the wolf shape. Then with this guy we can introduce a match shape and we can get a variational formula for this. Variational formula for this. Okay, so that's the natural one. It's pretty much like before, so I'm not going to repeat. But it just puts everything as the unbounded set. Then we can ask the problem. Whether we are able to solve a problem like this. For example, for what Q, for what condition of mu, you are able to find a say compatible setup. So you, so this equation holds. And then you also have a PD. You also have a PD, which is harder. Like I mentioned before, so the domain is open set, and the H is a negative function. Now then I will need a state determinant set. Basically, just a wolf shoot. Especially if I say state determinant set, I would like to say this omega is a compact set. So everything is on the compact set. So, everything is on the complex. Then you are able to get a validation format. So, I'm not going to repeat this. But just like before, you get the first order derivative of the Q steel volume of this wall sheet. You will get the closure method coming out. Okay? So, that's the setup. Now, what we actually do need is what we call CQ. What we call CQ growth set. Basically, it means the Q still volume of this C compatible set is finite. Otherwise, we are not able to do the integral. So we just consider all of this CQ closed set, which means that this is finite. And then you have seen, okay, when Q is equal to N, you just go back to C closed set. So then I can define the complement of A with respect to C, which is called a C. With respect to C, which is called a CQ co-convex set. So it's just like a Schneider C-co-convex set, say, say closed set, right? And but the nice thing here is if I know this is SQL closed set, then this skewer closure metric is always finite. Then I can solve this problem in this case. So the first result we had is: okay, if I assume that the merchant mu concentrate on Concentrate on a complex set or migrant. Then you are able to solve this problem for whatever Q. Doesn't matter. And your solution is a say full set, which touches the boundary of the column. So the proof are not too difficult, but you have to use the variational formula we had, and then you have to do something else. But the picture looks like this, okay? For example, you have a you have like a For example, you have discrete measures, right? You have four directions, then you can easily get this function like this. You get this for you for this kind of variable. And then when you touch the boundary, you just go along with the boundary. So that's the solution. That's how it looks like. And we know that Q equals N, it has been solved by Shinada. So in this case, don't worry too much because say full set. Because say full set is finite in whatever case for. Then if it's not concentrated on the compact set, we also prove something. We proved the following one. If mu is given non-zero finite Boolean measure and Q is positive, then you are able to solve this equation. You are able to find a state Q close setting. So that is this this whole. So that is this whole. If you are familiar with the dual-home-micros problem, in the common spot case, it's easy to solve for q smaller than zero. And here, it's easy to solve for q bigger than zero. As I mentioned, so y is simple, and in the other case, it will be hard, and vice versa. So, again, when q equal to n is done by Schneider, and this is my model. Just want to give you some idea how the proof looks like. How the proof looks like. So, you know, we are going to do the general case. We do not have a stateful set, we don't have any information now, right? And then what we do, we'll just prove this one by approximation. So basically, we give a cover here. Okay, we give a cover here, we just leave a cover to the infinity. So eventually you will just transfer this problem to a safe full-set problem. Then eventually you will solve it. Okay, by a personal. Way sulfate, okay, by approximation. And I list some closed mark here, but I don't have time to read. But I want to say that this form is very interesting because it links with some we call the algebraic geometry or similarity theory and has some new PD coming out, which are harder than the usual one. And it has some relation with log concrete function information theory. I don't know how to do it, and then we continue. I won't know how to do it, and then we continue to work on this. Thank you very much. Any questions? Is it possible to make a framework that includes both the bounded and unbounded? I don't think so. Because uh the polarity is different. Maybe, maybe, I don't know, but I think it's hard. It's these two are different. Yeah. They are totally different because Yeah. Yeah, totally different because some sometimes it's it's harder for for the compact case and then it's easy for the non-compact case. Any questions? Well, let's thank you.
