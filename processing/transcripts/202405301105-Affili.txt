Today's last talk is from Dr. Alisa Effie. So his title is Controlability in Vertical Water Competitive System with Constrained Controls. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you very much for the introduction and for the opportunity to present my work here. So I will present the joint work with Eriquet Rotou. So we'll talk about the public. So we'll talk about the competitive system. So we will have two populations living in the same environment and therefore competing for resources. So I will try to keep the coefficient in my system of the minimum just to understand better what's going on. So we'll have the two density of population y1 and y2. Both are bounded between 0 and 1. I will have my I will have my dot-capable terra system in an interval 0L for some positive L. And then I take the diffusion coefficient and the reproduction rate, I take them equal to 1, so I don't have to care about them. And so the only coefficient address are the competition coefficients, A for the first equation and B for the second equation. So here, moreover. So, here, moreover, I make some hypotheses. So, I ask that B is larger than A, and also that B is strictly larger than one. So, I avoid the weak, weak competition case, and I only have the strong, weak or the strong, strong competition. And the first population is always dominant. In that case, there are also some work about the sign of the traveling wave, and we all know that the traveling wave is going. Know that the traveling wave is going in the direction of the equilibrium one, zero. So for the first population, we spread. Okay, so I am in an interval, so I have to tell you what do I put at the boundary of my interval. So the quantity that the density population at the boundary will be a function that is a control for me. So I will choose accurately this value in order to drive the Value in order to drive the system where I want to go. But I have a constraint because since the value at the boundary is still a population density, it has to be bounded between zero and one. So let's talk a little bit now about what is controllability. So we say that the system governed by some PDE is controllable from an initial state SI to a final state SI. To a final state SF in a determined type T, if I can find some control function that I put in my PDEs such that the system starts from the initial datum as i and arrives at time t in this final state that they chose. Oh, so there are a lot of works about parabolic PDEs, about controllability in parabolic. PDEs about controllability in parabolic PDEs. For example, it is well known that if we have a heat equation, we put some control on the boundary of an interval and starting from any initial state and for any chosen time, we can drive the solution to any state we want. This is long ago since the 80s and the 90s. But there is a little problem for that. So if So, if I choose my final state and my final time, and I choose the control that drives my solution to this final state, and I look at what the control looks like, it does like this. So it is likely to have very big oscillations, especially closer to the final time. And this is a problem for me because, in my case, my control will be a density of population between zero and one. 0 and 1. So I cannot allow my control to oscillate that much. So therefore, I will not be able to use all the theory in controllability that we have since the 80s. And so how about the literature on controllability with positive constraints? Well, there are not so many works. In fact, Trella and Soto started getting interested in this kind of constraint. In this kind of constraint, just quite recently in 2017, and they did some work about the heat equation, some semi-linear equation, and the monostable and base-stable reaction diffusion equations. But so, there's not much literature about it. So, let's go, let's get to the questions that I want to investigate. Yes. Doesn't the pioneer stay, but doesn't it have to be smooth? Yes, yes. I mean, it has to be an acceptable solution for a heat equation. Yes, yes, of course. Okay, so I will look if my Rottka Valtera system is controllable to some stationary system. To some stationary states. So, just to have some points in mind, I focused my research on the homogeneous stationary states, which are 0, 0. So both the population are extinct, 1, 0. So the first population has density 1 all over the interval and the second is extinct, 0, 1, which is the converse. Which is the converse, and then there is a subtle equilibrium which appears only if both A and B are strictly larger than one. Okay, so my question is if this equilibria can be reached and how. And so sometimes the answer will be positive, sometimes the answer will be negative. And in particular, we will have some barrier phenomenon that prevents controllability depending on the length of the interval. Depending on the length of the interval and on the competition coefficients A and B. Okay, so we remember that for the analog competitive system, we still have a comparison principle that can help us a lot. So we can define what it is a subsolution. We just have to remember that here in the so for the first equation, we have the classic concept of We have the classic concept of the subsolution, but for the second one, we have to take the reverse inequality. And also, when we look at the ordering of the solution, we say that a sub-solution is below a supersolution if the first component are ordered in the normal way. So the sub-solution must be below the supersolution, but in the second component, we have the reverse inequality. So the supersolution must be below the sub-solution. Must be below the sub solution. Okay, so we have this very important tool that already gives us a very important information. So you see the state 0, 1 and 1, 0 are solution, but moreover, are sub solution and super solution. And in particular, so 0, 1 is a subsolution which is below any solution of my system. So by the comparison principle, By the comparison principle, if I have my solution and my subsolution is below, the two cannot touch, otherwise, they will have to be equal for all time. So this already says that 0, 1 can be reached only asymptotically and not in a finite time. And the same holds for 1,000 which is a super solution for all the solutions of my systems. Okay, so now let's look at the controller B2. So now let's look at the controller B to do one zero. So I recall that the first population here is dominant, so here is the easy equilibrium to reach. I also have a traveling wave that helps me reach this equilibrium. So I have that for any initial time, I can find some controls, the boundary, that drives my system to the equilibrium one, zero asymptotically in time. Okay, and so to do that, To do that, I can compare, for example, my solution with a traveling wave. And when the traveling wave goes to one, zero, also I let my controls of the boundary follow this traveling wave, and so I reach my pudding view. And when A is lesser than one, it's still easier. Okay, then I look at the controllability to the extinction of both populations. The extinction of both population, equilibrium 0, 0. So, there I have two cases depending on the length of the interval. So, if the interval is too short, is below pi, then I can, for any initial detune, I can find some controls that drives my solution to 0, 0. In particular, if I take the two controls at the boundary equal to 0. But if the interval is too long, then this Too long, then this is not possible. It is not possible to drive at the same time the first population and the second population to zero. And this comes from the fact that we know that the logistic equation in an interval has no stationary states if the interval is too short. And so I can compare with my solution in the case and the case one, and I can drive both. And I can drive both my solutions to zero. But when the interval is too large, then the logistic equation has a positive stationary state. And if I look at some equation satisfied by the sum of the two population, then I can see that this sum cannot go to zero. Okay, then I look at the controllability to the equilibrium 0, 1. So the first population, the one. So, the first population, the one that is dominant, is extinct, and the second population, the one that is weaker, goes to one. So, to do that, it was a little bit harder, so I had to do some numerical simulation to understand better this situation. So, what are we seeing here? So, on the left, we have the first population, on the right, we have the second population, and the x-axis we have the space. x-axis we have the space and on the vertical axis we have the time. So here I started from an initial datum which is one for the first population and zero for the second, so the worst possible case. But with some boundary controls I was able to drive the system very close to zero for the first population and one for the second one. So in this case I was able to do to find To do to find controllability of the system. And also, I found some special case where it is possible to control the system to 0, 1. For example, when the interval is short, or less for the same reason as before, or for some special class of initial data. But this is not always possible because the first population is dominant. And in fact, if I run some other And in fact, if I run some other simulation, I see that I get a different result. For example, here, with respect to before, I took a longer interval. And so I took the same initial condition, I took the same control of the boundary. But here in this case, I see that my system does not approach the equilibrium of 0, 1 that I want it to reach. In fact, the That they wanted to reach. In fact, the solution gets stabilized around a stationary state. Okay, and so I also have the same type of results in the case where instead of changing the length of the interval, I change the competition coefficient. I put the competition coefficient in the second equation to be larger. So this happens because there exists, in this case, there exists some barrier. Some barriers, so equal barrier, a non-trivial solution to this system. So we have the same equation as for the Losca-Valtera system. I take them in the stationary form, and I take for the first population zero boundary condition, and for the second population, one boundary condition. So that this boundary condition should be the worst possible condition for the first population and the best possible. First population and the best possible condition for the second one. And so, when I found a non-trivial solution to this system, when I found a barrier, then I have non-controllability to 0, 1. Because if I take my barrier as the initial datum, I already have the best control possible. So, I cannot move from there because it's a stationary solution. So, I don't have control. Solution, so I don't have controlability to 0, 1. And moreover, some kind of surprisingly, I also don't have controlability to the subtle equilibrium. So here, just to have an idea of why this happens, here I represented the traveling waves that I have, some of the traveling waves that I have for this system. So I see that there is a traveling wave going from the satellite. Wave going from the satellite equilibrium to 0, 1. So, if I was able to arrive somewhere near my satellite equilibrium, then with the traveling wave, I would also be able to approach the other equilibrium 0, 1. And since I already know that I cannot go there, I also know that I will not be able to arrive at the southern equilibrium. Okay, so the main theorem of this SOC is about non-controllability. So I can show that if the computational coefficient in the second equation is large enough, larger than a certain threshold, then my system is not controllable neither to 0, 1 nor to the sudden. One nor to the subtle equilibrium for at least some initial data. And if the coefficient is smaller than V star, then I will be able to control to 0, 1. So the idea of the proof is clearly to construct this barrier. So I will have to construct a subsolution in a very careful way in order to have my. To have my barrier. So, the same, I have a similar pressure result for the coefficient, the competition coefficient in the first equation. So, I can find some A star such that if the competition coefficient in the first equation is larger than A star this time, because the larger competition coefficient is worse for the first population, then this is the Population, then the system is asymptotically controllable. And if this coefficient is smaller than A, then my system is not asymptotically controllable, neither to 0, 1 nor to the subtle equilibrium. And the proof of this, actually, I use some A that is smaller than 1, which gives me the weak, strong competition case, that therefore it's easier. It's easier. Okay, then I really, really wanted to have a third theorem about the length of the interval. So I expect that if the length of the interval is larger than some threshold star, then my system will not be as important to be controllable to 0, 1 and to the central equilibrium. But so far, I haven't been able to construct the barrier. Construct the barrier that I wanted. And I think that I will need very precise information about either the traveling ways or some other special solution to this system. So if maybe you have some literature on this regard, please let me know. And another perspective I will look into is the relationship between these two equilibria, 0, 1 and so they. And also the equilibria for which the first population is extinct and the sudden equilibrium, the coexistence equilibrium. Okay, so this is all for today. And thank you for your attention. And hi from the local population of Pelona. I'm wondering if you look at the system on the half-line boundary condition. Because there are interesting differences in these controlability problems, even for the heat equation. Yes. Also, might help understand what happens for large L. Yes, I think that would be a first step between, yeah, just. Yeah, just I haven't been able to construct a solution for that either. And I've really looked a little bit into that. But yes, I think it would be very interesting as well. Okay. Any question from online audience? Oh, okay. Okay, another question is: I can see that not allowing your control to be less than zero is natural in pilot. Zero is natural in the population context. But the one threshold, you know, that kind of only represents a carrying capacity, but there's nothing really forbidding one from introducing a maybe lump of population that's above capacity at the border and seeing what happens. Have you looked at all about the situation where you only impose one threshold on your control but allow it arbitrarily large? Okay, so in this case, if you allowed the control Case, if you allow the control to be larger than one, I think that you can use some of the theory of controllability that is already available and therefore that it's easier to achieve controllability. Because it is true that so if you have a if you want to reach a final state at a certain time at a certain finite time, the control oscillates a lot. But if your If your final state is at least locally stable, stationary solution, and you wait for a long enough time, then with a control that oscillates not so much, you can reach this final state. So I think that in that case, it should be much easier. So, France, so we can ask your question. Okay, uh, so thank you, Elisa, for the nice talk. I had just one small question, just out of curiosity. How important is that the medium is one-dimensional? Did you mention it? How important? So, I think that also in a So I think that also in a multiple dimension one can find some similar results. I think just maybe it might be harder to construct the subsolution, the barriers. So for example, for the reaction diffusion equation for the bistable and the monostable case, there were some results both. There were some results both for one-dimensional case and multi-dimensional cases, and the results were pretty similar. Okay, okay, thank you. Any more questions? Hi, I have a quick follow-up. I had actually the same question as I think Cole asked about the controls being larger than one. And it seems And one. And it seems that with that, it's possible to drive the system to state 0, 1. Is it kind of obvious or clear that is it also possible to drive the system to the W1, W2 steady state this way? I'm not sure I understood your question because at the beginning the audio was a little bit low. Can you repeat that, please? Oh, okay. Sorry. Oh, okay. Sorry. So it's again the question about what if the controls can be larger than one. And it seems to me that with that, you can drive the system to the steady state 0, 1. But the question is whether you should also be able that way to drive it to the system W1, W2, or whether it's obvious that that should be possible or not. Okay, so. Okay, so the system W1W2 is actually one of the trickiest because it is not stable. And so even if I get really close, in some way, the solution might escape in a direction that I don't want it to go if my control is not strong enough. So for that. So, in that case, since the final state would not be something that is stable, I am not sure that I can use the same argument as before for the other equilibrium if I allow the control to be larger than one. Because I'm not sure I can eliminate the oscillations. Okay, okay, thanks. So, is it your time? We want that. So is the term one temple two unique? Sorry, is terminal one tab two unique? Yes, yes, it's the coexistent uh uh it's the sort of point for the Lord Kawaltera ODE system. Okay, see. So and one more question. So what what will happen for the threshold threshold case for A equals to A star? Yes, that is also a question, but I'm not sure. Okay. So my guess is that the system is controllable, but I am not sure. But I am not sure. I see. I see. Any more questions? So, if not, let's thank Alisa and all the speakers in the morning again. The conference will end. Anymore. We'll end those sessions over. Yeah. So we will have ambulance. Angulance mini course Friday morning in local time. But all other talks are over. So let's thank all the speakers once again. Thank you.
