Okay, so I'm going to talk about the construction. I'm going to talk about homology constraints and double holography and how this is connected to the semi-classical approximation. And I guess my talk will be a bit different to the talks we've seen so far in that I will mostly sort of like review fairly old things and also give an introduction to double logography. Hopefully that's beneficial to people here who aren't working on this and aren't practicers. And then I'm going to be super specific in a read meeting and sort of try to take the point of view what happens if we take What happens if we take the lessons we learn from double holography literally and try to sort of understand through them how the Edinburgh formula arises, how the semi-classical approximation arises from quantum gravity. Okay, so to start off, let me start like very basic by one of the sort of like most famous formulas in our field, which came up sort of about two years ago. And that's what I will call the island entropy. And that's what I will call the out of entropy. So, the upshot is that over the last two years, we've learned that in the presence of semi-classical gravity, there's a novel measure of entropy called the Adam entropy. Usually, what we would do if we're interested in the entropy of some sub-region of some quantum mechanical system, we'll build the reduced density matrix and compute the von Law entropy, right? Minus trace rho a log rho a. But now, with this novel measure of entropy, Entropy, we sort of have a non-local extension of this prescription. And it goes as follows: instead of just considering this region A I'm interested in, I'm also considering all additional regions I, I complete the fundamental P of A union I, or the fundamental P of the reduced density matrix on A union I, but I have to pay a penalty for this. That's the area of the boundary of this region I of 40 newton. And what I'm going to do then is I extramize overall choices of. Then is I extremize overall choices of I, and one extreme I always find is the extreme one where the island is just the empty set, and then this expression here reduces to this expression. But in general, and in particular, for, say, vaporing by holes, at some point, I will find non-extremal, additional extrema here where the elements are non-zero. And if that's the case, then I need to sort of compute this for all my extrema. And the minimum of those results will give me. Of those results will give me my formula. Practically speaking, what happens for black holes is that after the page time, this region I here will become important. It will cover the interior of the black hole and it becomes worth paying the penalty of the black hole area in order to sort of have a state here on the exterior. Say if I choose the radiation to be A, you know, the interior, which is almost pure and doesn't have a large engine pure. Here and yeah, it doesn't have a large NGP. Now, one of the, I guess, the most important lessons here that we learned from this is also that the island I is encoded somehow miraculously in the state of region A. And what this automatically implies is that semi-classical gravity as some theory of local degrees of freedom on some dynamical spacetime just fails as a low energy effective field theory. And that brings with it a couple of questions. First of all, A couple of questions. First of all, well, what is semi-classical gravity? Usually, what we were used to think of this as some, again, local degrees of freedom on some dynamical space-time. But now the question is, what's the regional validity? We knew it was breaking down like near singularities, but it apparently breaks down much earlier. But then, moreover, why do we have to use the Addien formula? Why can't we just use the phenomenon entropy? And of course, there's pathological arguments for this, but having a Hilbert space picture. But having a Hilbert space picture would, I think, be very instructive. And then, more explicitly, the question would be: how does semi-classical gravity actually emerge from a formulation of quantum gravity? And in two dimensions, there's strong arguments that really semi-classical gravity is an ensemble average over different theories. And in higher dimensions, this iteration is roughly speaking, just like very unclear. It somehow seems unlikely that it's an ensemble average over different theories, but maybe there's some core. Leverage over different theories, but maybe there's some core screening involved. And also, there's been a growing, but like growing amount of literature on the role of computational complexity when talking about the regime of validity of semi-classical reality. Okay, and so the idea I can pitch here is that maybe we can use double-cology to make some progress on these questions. Because in double-colography, we have sort of like very well paid, we have a theory of worship. Very well opaque. We have a theory of works in all dimensions, also in higher dimensions, and we have fairly good control over the different frames of double holography. So, let me introduce or review double holography real quick. I think I'm going to consider a model where we have a black hole, and I think the easiest way of starting is with what I will call, or what I've called here, the bulk description. So, what you should think of is having this Rindler ADS. So, here's my butt-frick and Rindler horizon. Frick and Rinder horizon, and I cut off part of the escalatic boundary, which I've indicated by these dots here, by a dynamic brain, which I model just by some constant tension object. And I impose an online boundary conditions here at the brain. And what this does, amongst other things, is that by tuning the tension, I can tune the location of the brain. Now I'll be interested in the situation where I tune the tension to some critical value, which means that the brain sort of approaches in this picture this kind of isymotic boundary. And then I can. Boundary. And then I can do as usual ADSB CFT, very analogous to ADS-CFT, do alti transition, and go to what I've called the boundary description here, which gives me a dual description of this system in terms of two boundary conformal field theories here, one on the left, one on the right, which are the thermophil double state, and which have some additional quantum mechanical systems living on their boundary. And the limit where t goes to this critical value in this picture. Critical value in this picture corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom living at those defects here being much larger than the number of degrees of freedom in this ambient ECFT space. Now, in this limit, we'll have a third description, which becomes available. And essentially, one reason this happens is that in this limit, a particular gravity mode localizes up here to the brain. And this is what I would call the brain description. What I would call the brain description. In order to arrive here, what I can think of is that I'm just integrating out the region of my body spacetime between the asymptotic boundary and this brain. And so what I find is some asymptotic EAES space in here in green, which has a topological massless black hole on it, just the horizon induced by the bulk. And it's coupled to gravity. And there's a meta-theory living on it, namely the holographic CFT, which is allowed to freely. CFT, which is allowed to freely propagate between the black hole space I'm here and what I would call the bath region here, which was the ambient space of the B CFT. And the state is so chosen such that I'm at the half-hour halting state. So everything here is in thermal equilibrium. And of course, the goal now. So here's a picture of sort of like time reintroduced, where we have the green region here, the ABS space-time, and then we have additional. Space-time, and then we have additional paths traveled to each of the asymptotic boundaries. Okay, and so of course, we want to identify this somehow, or this sort of plays the role of semi-classical gravity within double-tallography. And then, of course, a direct question is, what are the rules for computing observables in this perspective? And one observable, or some really observable, one thing we might want to compute and we'll be interested in is entropy. We'll be interested in entropy, in particular, phenomenon entropy. Now, before I go on, let me make two comments. So, first of all, we still have a holographic matter theory living here, in particular, in this bath region, which is non-gravitating. So something like the RT formula should still hold. And secondly, we really want to make sure that this can be understood as semi-classical gravity. And so we want to require that this here behaves like a local theory. Okay. Can I ask a question? Okay. Can I ask a question on the previous slide? Just to make sure I'm understanding the green region of your space-time diagram corresponds to the green region. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. All right. And so, well, the nice thing, what double flog is a holographic theory. So computing entropies is easy and it turns into a geometric description or geometric procedure, which goes by the name of Ryutateanagi. And so it functions almost like a usual ADS CFT, and that the entropy of this region A here is given by the area of the what's called the Takayanagi surface over 40 Newton, where this RT surface is the minimal extremal surface which obeys particular homology constraint. And usually CFT, we have this surface, chi prime A, which has to be exactly homologous to A. But note A ds B C of T, this homology constraint. But now in ADSB CFT, this homology constraint gets relaxed in that my extremal surface can also end on this brain just as it likes. So the homology constraint is up to terms or up to boundaries which are within the brain. And so we have two candidate RT surfaces. So here I've just drawn extremal surfaces which obey the homology constraint, but well, either of them can be the minimal one. And so if I just fix this region A at a time run forward, what I'll find is that initially I'm in this space here. Essentially, I'm in this phase here, and the area of the surface grows linearly, like so, until at some point this area becomes bigger than the area of my second surface here, chi A, which is invariant on the time translations. And so my fundamental entropy saturates. Okay, and what I then usually do is I say, okay, so this island RT surface here, so I'll call this the island RT surface for the rest of this talk, can be interpreted as. Talk can be interpreted as giving the value for the island entropy in the brain perspective after the page time. And how that works, remember the island entropy had some sort of penalty factor proportional to the area of my island, and that sort of comes from the part up here close to this brain. And then in standard ADS CFT sort of intuition, the rest of this body surface corresponds to the phenomenon entropy between A and the region I. If I identify the region I up here with the intersection. I appear with the intersection of my brain with this linked region. And then you can go on and moreover also show that an extremization of this extremization and minimization procedure of the bulk RT surface also corresponds to the minimization extremization procedure of the island formula. However, one thing one should be sort of careful about here is that this all happened in what I call the boundary perspective before. So I'm greedy. Boundary perspective before. So I'm really using the RT surface for the boundary perspective. So I'm computing the phenomenon entropy in the boundary perspective. And it's not really clear what this immediately corresponds to in the brain perspective. And so previous work with Rob Myers, where we had sort of like two spaces where a brain intersected, kind of seemed to suggest that this also would give you the phenomenon entropy in the brain perspective. But in fact, Um, but in fact, um I'm let me just give you like a sort of a hand-winky argument why that's not true. So I'm going to assume, as I mentioned before, that my brain perspective is somewhere local theory. I'm going to assume that there's some sort of dictionary which translates between the bug and my boundary theory. And I'm assuming standard rules for entanglement mode reconstruction, so standard rules for how I can find representations of operators within this region here by the OT. This region here by the LT service in the boundary on the region A. The argument then is sort of very quick. If this was an allowed surface here at some point, then I have an operative flight of X, which is contained in the entangling wedge. So that in particular, this is not contained in the complement of the entanglement wedge, which is, because we're in a pure state, the entangling wedge of the complement of A. But now, because I want to treat it as a local theory, well, what's the complement of A? It's this whole region. Of A, it's this whole region up here. And so, in particular, we have this region B here, from which we should not be able to reconstruct the operating fine. But by sort of, it seems very plausible that we can just apply standard bot reconstruction techniques, at least as long as this operator is close enough to the brain, namely HKLL, but we use data on the brain, sort of values and the derivatives of this field, and sort of like solve the equations of motion. Sort of like solve the bulk equations of motion sliding inwards in physics speak. And so this gives it as a contradiction. We have an operator which we can reconstruct from up here, although we shouldn't be able to. So what can we do if we don't want to drop any of our assumptions? We don't want to drop the first one, well, because that's what we started out with. And the second and the third one are, in principle, very important ingredients in the holographic derivation of the eigen formula. So there's some very obvious. So there's some very obvious fourth solution, which is we change the homology constraints depending on which duality frame we're in. So the claim will then be that the phenomenon entropy of a region A now depends on whether I am in the boundary perspective or in the brain perspective. In the boundary perspective, so in accordance with what Takayanagi taught us, we're using this relaxed homology constraint where my artisophas can end on the brain. Whereas in the brain perspective, I really treat Brain perspective, I really treat the asymptotic boundary union of the brain as sort of the asymptotic boundary in ADS CFT. So I do not let my RT surfaces randomly end on the brain. And that leads to really two different notions of phenomenal entropy for the exact same region. One, we have sort of the phenomenal entropy in the boundary perspective, which saturates at some time t, as I've described before. But then in the brain perspective, I do the same computation. Do the same computation, the phenometry just keeps on growing linearly because there's no second candidate surface where a phase transition could happen to. And so this here really agrees then with the semi-classical intuition. And that's a nice sort of consistency check. All right, so I've mentioned before that really double horribly gives you sort of like a triality of three different frames. And I want to focus on sort of the relation between the boundary perspective. Of the relation between the boundary perspective and the brain perspective. And the reason is that the brain perspective here really takes the role of semi-classical gravity, whereas the boundary perspective, in a way, gives me the UV definition of my system. And so in the end, when I go to the really crazy speculative things, I kind of want to think about this year as sort of some, well, the analog of some true UV theory of quantum gravity. And this year is our semi-classical. And this here is our semi-classical description. Okay, so because there are these dualities between the boundary perspective and the grain perspective, a natural question to ask now is, well, we have two different notions of phenomenal entropy of a region A. Can we get one, say, the phenomenon entropy in the boundary perspective somehow from A computation in the brain perspective? And the answer to this we already know, namely, in the boundary perspective, if you compute the phenomenon entropy, then before the pay. Compute the phenomenon entropy, then before the page time, this is the correct RT surface. After the page time, I have this RT surface which connects up to the brain. That's, of course, not allowed in the brain perspective because I have chosen different homology constraint. However, what I can, of course, do is I can just introduce or I can just change the rule to compute my entropy by saying, well, just look for some region I, extremize with respect to its shape, and then minimize overall choices of those extrema I've taken. And as I mentioned before, those two are really equivalent finding this RT surface and giving the Allen formula, like this. So, the upshot of this is that the Fannel Emmanuel entropy in the boundary is really dual to the Allen entropy in the brain perspective. Similarly, I can ask the question the other way around. So, I want to compute the brain phenomenon entropy, but by doing some computation in the boundary perspective. So, how do I do this? So, how do I do this? In the brain perspective, my RT surface is always given by this particular extremal surface. And so, what I want to do now is to sort of like, you know, ask a question in the boundary perspective, which as the answer gives me this extremal surface. And this is likely been done in the literature before in a slightly different context where the extremal surface here were compact. But, well, as far as I've heard, there are sort of results which are to be published quite soon, which also extended. Described soon, which also extended to this situation. And the answer is that even in the boundary perspective, this surface here exists as an extremal surface, although after the page time, it's not a minimal extremal surface anymore. And so we get asked the question, well, what's the interpretation of a non-minimal extremal surface, or here in particular, the outermost extremal surface in this case? And the answer is it's a particular notion of coarse-grained entropy. And it's done in a way that we want to... Done in the way that we want to maximize overall possible density matrices of A such that particular one-point functions of what's called simple operators are reproduced in the presence of simple sources. And so again, we have a similar upshot here where we can say that the brain phenomena entropy of a region A is now dual to a particular coarse-grained entropy in the boundary perspective. And you can keep on playing this game. This game, um, and I think there's like still many open questions of like how particular objects translate between those two um formulations. Um, but I think there's sort of like a couple of like points I want to make here and then and then go on to something else, namely, first of all, um we see that there's a the transition here really um is a reorganization of degrees of freedom um in the blog and this is done by changing the And this is done by changing the homology constraint. And now I can ask, sort of, like, okay, so how does this map very roughly work? And we can use something which is called the Hytham's Lunch conjecture. And if we assume this to be true, then the story will essentially be that operators, well, what we see from those pictures here that operators down here in this darkly shaded region, if I can reconstruct them in A here in the boundary perspective, I can also do this here in the brain perspective. So those operators map trivially. So, those operators map trivially. And using sort of a converse Python's language conjecture, what one would say is then that those operators operators are simple operators, and that if I want to reconstruct them here on the boundary, I only need a polynomial circuit. On the other hand, this region beyond this outermost extremal wedge here is what's called the Python's lunge, and operators which are located in this lunge, they get map non-trivially between those two perspectives. Those two perspectives. And so, if I focus on this operator, for example, here, then in my city, then I would say, okay, it's in my island, perhaps, but in the semi-classical gravity description, I have no access to it from my bath region. Instead, it's just encoded somehow in the local degrees of freedom up in the gravity region. So, all this is to say that there's really rather a low energy duality rather than just coarse graining going on. Rather than just core screening going on, if I want to go to semi-classical gravity. Okay, so now let me be more speculative and say, well, maybe we can use this here as a model for how we should expect quantum gravity to work in the real world. And let's, well, as I already mentioned, right, the brain perspective sort of plays the role of semi-classical gravity. The boundary perspective would then analogously play the role of quantum gravity. Play the role of quantum gravity, and what we would see here is that here we have a system where we have access, or we have a quantum state here, but we have access to the island. But as I try to go sort of where I expect my black hole to be, I run into this quantum mechanical system on the boundary. And so if I just speculate, you know, this might be sort of analogous to ideas of stretched horizons in flat space gravity, where here this will correspond to the region far away from the black hole. This will correspond to the region far away from the black hole. And as I go closer, I enter some complicated system. Or I could go to a different duality frame where now I have just semi-classical gravity, and I can answer questions about this quantum gravity description from semi-classical gravity by just learning what the dictionary between those two frames is. And on this one before you go on, so I would think that if I were able to actually I would think that if I were able to actually do some state counting here, I would get one answer for the von Moevin entropy, not two different answers. Which one would correspond? If I could do some true state counting, which one would correspond to that number? Right. I mean, it really depends on sort of the question you're asking and how you think the theory works. So if we're interested in state counting or the interests, let me say the entropy of black hole radiation, for example. Of black hole radiation, for example, right? Then I get, as you mentioned, two different answers. Now, one is just a particular entropy of a state in the semi-classical gravity perspective, which, if I believe that actually quantum gravity is the correct thing to do, will essentially be just an approximation, which is totally fine for simple observables, but not for complex observables. So measuring entropy as a very complex observable. As a very complex observable, so I just shouldn't trust this approximation here. But of course, I can still do the computation and I'll get an answer. It just might not be the thing I'm actually asking for. It might not match up state counting in a true quantum. Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I guess like what I'm gonna show next, hopefully sort of clarifies this a bit. So let's just see how this could pan out in. 10 minutes. Oh, I think I'm actually going to be done a bit early, maybe. So, let's see how this could pan out. If we take this as a model for proper quantum gravity, then we would have one sort of formulation of our theory, which I can think of as the quantum gravitational formulation, and then one which I can think of as the semi-classical formulation. So, let's consider a black hole, which has completely evaporated. And so I've drawn this banner. And so I've drawn this Benrose diagram here where I intentionally left out this sort of semi-classical interior of the black hole. We don't know what happens here, might be some stretch arrays or whatever. But the point is that after this black hole has formed, and say we form it from a pure state and has evaporated, there's going to be some quantum state here, say on this Cauchy slice, which is a pure state. And the claim is that there is a map from this space, which I modeled by some n qubits. And qubits to a bigger Hilbert space now, where I again have the same radiation region up here. And then I also have sort of the black hole interior Hilbert space, which consists of kg, which were k is bigger than n. And again, n was the size of the radiation system. And so, how I should think about this, right? I have the duality between a description which describes a particular state of low energy density. Low energy density, a pure state. And then I have a different description of the same state, which describes us as the mixed state on the same space-time entangled with the interior of some evaporative black hole or some baby universe. Okay, so what's sort of like the simplest model you can use to talk about this? Pick some random pure state here that's supposed to be the outcome of your Hawking evaporation, and then you define an isometry from this. Define isometry from this true quantum gravitational radiation into your semi-classical picture in the following way. First, you embed your radiation into your semi-classical radiation Hilbert space part, but just like a trivial embedding, you choose some fiducial state for your black hole interior, just for this model. And then you scramble the whole thing with some random unitary U. And what we can do now is we can look at the polynomial entropy. We can look at the phenomenon entropy of, say, the first n qubits of my radiation system. I know I have two descriptions. The first description, as I increase the size of my region, phenomenon entropy will grow. And then once I've reached the halfway point, it will turn around and get smaller and smaller. However, if I do the same computation, but now this different duality frame, if you will, then the entropy just keeps on rising because the state here is very entangled. Here is very entangled with the state inside the blood hole. So, again, like in double holography, we see that there's two different notions of phenomena entropy, and also when that's fairly trivial in this model, that few qubit observables agree between those two, so like simple observables, agree between those two descriptions, just because on a few qubits, my density matrix is going to be maximally mixed. But of course, I can now ask the question, but how can I, by doing a computation, this model here, By doing a computation, this model here reproduces this form of the fundamental entropy. And so that would be sort of the question of, you know, what is my island formula for this system? And the answer is fairly simple. You can just define some island entropy for this system by saying, well, instead of just computing the reduced sensor matrix on A, let's compute it on A union I, then compute the, well, that should be a phenomenon entry union on Ireland. Should be a phenomenon entropy and an island. Complete the phenomena entropy and minimize over choices of i in the interior of the black hole. And so then it's not really hard to convince yourself that what you find is exactly the phenomenon entropy in your quantum gravitational system, because initially, again, there's no benefit in including the interior of the black hole in this computation, but once you hit half the size of your radiation system, then suddenly it becomes beneficial to include the whole black hole. To include the whole, like whole interior, and your all entropy comes back down. Now, the one important point I just want to emphasize here is that really this formula, just in this semi-classical description, has no intrinsic meaning. It's just a tool to correctly reproduce a phenomenon entropy in the system. And you can do a similar calculation now, say, if you want to compute the purity, so with the trace of rho squared, which again, Which again will disagree between those two systems. However, I can define what I would call like a wormhole period in this system, where instead of titling the trace of rho squared, I titled the trace of rho A squared, I calculate the trace of rho A union I squared, and then I maximize over choices of I. And that approximately gives me the same result as what I find here for purity. Can I ask a question? All right, so let me just end with some questions. Question. All right, so let me just end with some final comments to wrap things up. Right. So in Delhiography, this semi-classical brain perspective really corresponds to a non-local reorganization of boundary degrees of freedom, or if we want to be spectrative, of sort of like quantum gravitational degrees of freedom. And we see that we didn't have access to the element bath. And the reason was that sort of this very complicated information, which encoded the bath, just had been reorganized. Just had been reorganized. And then, touching on your question, also the semi-classical description, then, if we sort of treat these boundary description as the true quantum gravitational description, really only is a good description for simple observables, anything which can be computed by only looking at the outermost switch. However, there are certain ways of accessing complex questions through non-local dual questions. So, for example, I can answer the question. For example, I can answer the question, which is a very complicated question in the brain, in the boundary perspective. For example, what's the operator in my island? I would have to reconstruct the operator. That's a very complicated thing to do. I can answer this question in my brain perspective just by probing with a local operator that by volunteering. Okay, so that's sort of like the output here. And then, of course, there's ways, and this was sort of like supposed to be an embarrassment to. Possibly an advertisement to hopefully think about those questions. I think what would be very interesting is to try to extend this dictionary between the brain and the boundary perspective to really understand well how this works. One example would be, is there a way of maybe doing a computation in the boundary perspective, which tells us how generalized entropies in the gravitational region in the brain perspective can be computed, or maybe use this as a model to understand sort of like more. Understands sort of like more fine-grained ideas. So, for example, how does pair creation in the semi-classical picture at the horizon, what does this really map to in the boundary perspective? And then, of course, this question whether we can or should carry over the lessons we've learned from double holography to more general situations of real-life quantum gravity is, of course, an open one, but I think that's an interesting one. Thank you. Okay, great. So Raphael has his hand up online. I don't know if you're able to speak, Raphael. Can we hear her? Can you hear me? Sorry, I can't hear you. Maybe you could type right in the chat. Or they're trying to set it up now. Okay, let's. Oh, I guess I can also have access to the chatting room. Can you hear me now? Oh, okay. Do you just want to type it maybe in the chat and then I can? Right, okay. So, um, yeah, so the question is: what plays the role of the horizon area in your qubit model just now? And so, this was sort of like the simplest model I could come up with. And well, as you see from here, I've intentionally chosen the state way after the black hole has already evaporated. So, it's really here there in this qubit model, there is no notion of horizon area, but in fact, Horizon area, but in fact, I mean, this year was just supposed to be some educational model to sort of like bring home the point. But there's a lot of ways this should really be extended. And I think trying to make this consistent with the fact that the horizon area needs to be accounted for with the fact that actually evaporation can happen. So there should be a process here where I create entangled pairs where one part goes into the radiation region. The radiation region and the other part goes into the black hole region. But on the other hand, there should be a map which now somehow maps this to sort of after the page time information escaping into the radiation region. And then here I would sort of add to maybe horizon degrees of freedom. Making sure that touching map exists and is consistent is an open, yeah, it's a good question. I wonder if I can play sound from my computer. Oh, that's so fun to. Oh, that's still function. Oh, there's a feature we didn't know about it. Okay. Other questions? I have a possibly related question about when you think factorization of the Hilbert space is actually possible. Right. So, I mean, I tried to be a bit careful in the beginning where I said, you know, it's local, but. It's local, but uh, up to some gauge constraints. Um, and well, I mean, I guess there's like different opinions on this. So, if you were asking Surat Raju, he would say, no, no, none of this really makes sense. Well, I must admit, I'm trying to, I don't understand his points well enough to have a well-informed opinion on this. But I guess generally, at least my intuition here is that, of course, like the Hilbert. Here is that, of course, like the Hilbert space doesn't factorize, but you know, having a fine like Latin up to gauge constraints should be like a reasonable model and a reasonable like mental picture to think about these things. Raphael, did you have another comment on this question? By the state on the right. But the state on the right. I guess he's talking about. Actually, what we can also try is if you need that mic, then I can try. If you can meet that mic, then I can try to use my speakers and hopefully we'll get feedback from our discussions we've had. Okay, we were trying to make Raphael. Okay, well, I'm just gonna go by what he wrote. Hello for it. So this map was one-to-one. Well, actually, let me just mute the mic here and then you can talk and maybe say a few more words about your question. Oh, okay. Yeah, no, I'm just very confused about this model because it's written down as if you were mapping somehow unitarily, like it was an isometry from the radiation state into the state in a larger Hilbert space. But it shouldn't be because in the It shouldn't be because, in the semi-classical calculation, it's always the same state. The state of the black hole interior plus the radiation is always the same state. It doesn't depend on the in-state that made the black hole, for example. Whereas on the left, where you're discussing a unitary theory, it does depend on that. Yeah, okay. Um let's see. Um I'm not sure what you what you mean by it's always the same state, right? Because so if my so if I add it if I added a pointer, if I added say some quantum mechanical system here, which I say these are my horizon degrees of freedom, then what I would have here. Then, what I would have here is sort of in principle, like the separation between the horizon degrees of freedom and this radiation would be shifted. So, you know, that could be a model for Hockey radiation leaking out. Whereas here, I would increase the size of both my radiation system and my black hole. So, I'm not sure in which sense those would remain in the same state, right? I mean, the number of, well, and sort of like the very simplest extension I could think of of the radiation and what am I available like. And when I available, like hole in the bridge space, which is grown. I mean that for a fixed black hole, I mean, a black hole of fixed initial size that is formed from systems in different quantum states. On the left, you would have different states of the radiation after the black hole is fully evaporated by unitarity. But on the right, you would have a state that is simply obtained by dividing the vacuum at the horizon into two parts. Parts. It's just the vacuum at the horizon evolved forward. It has nothing to do with the in-state. So if this correctly models the semi-class calculation, then it always... As a principle, this map, at least to some extent, can or should be able to depend on the precise black hole microstate to start with. And what you really only need is sort of like a code subspace around your particular black hole microstate. like microstate which um uh for which this map must exist and so if i if i form sort of like a state of the the same well if i have some matter theory and like you know rearrange my matter a bit then at least what you would get is sort of like small corrections on the right hand side here maybe somebody else should ask some questions somebody else should ask some questions. Yeah, other questions. Can you say again what example? Because I think many of the things you said about the things that you do with the brain and semi-classical unit also have repeated the same sentences for the broadcast to begin with. Say very similar things. So where exactly do you gain, get competitive advantage? Get competitive advantage from this perspective. Oh, with the topography, you mean? Yeah. Right, no, I think sort of like the main advantage here is that, well, let's see, let's go to this picture. Right, that here I have this blog description where a lot of questions I can ask here, or here, which is really what I'm interested in, can be, you know, either like geometrized or can be answered easily. Well, I mean, one example I've given, right, are. Well, I mean, one example I've given, right, are the entropy computations. Right, but I think it's really just about description. Plus, the other sort of advantage is that really, at least in part, going from here to here is understood as the ADS BCFT correspondence, or understood, going between here and here as August like less understood, but also there's like work on the Cart-Randall model, which is really what this is. Model, which is really what this is. And so understanding the map between those two pictures is really well, at least to some extent for the results that are known, piecing together those existing results. So this green line, if I understand correctly, is the sort of the tool of the scale? Well, that's not exactly true. Exactly, not exactly true, right? So, if you go here, then well, I guess naively that's what you would say, right? Like, you just take the dual of those guys here, and then you get this green line. But what's really happening here is that part of this green line in this boundary perspective, right, gets encoded in your radiation. So, really, just knowing about the state of your green squares won't tell you anything about it, but going into the grain. It but going into the brain perspective, um, you're sort of asking how do I rearrange the bulk information such that the information here is now sort of like locally encoded in the brain up here. So can it answer a question about the locality in the book in a better way than it could do before, for example? Well, maybe not, I mean, that's a broad question, but maybe not about locality, but I think what this is is beneficial for if you want to sort of answer things very concretely. So to give you an example, right, we could ask how exactly an operator in the island would be encoded in this region A, and then if I understood And if I understood entangling with a web tree construction, so let's say a pass nav or whatever, well enough, I can actually give you the correct result here. And essentially, just from using standard ADS CFG technology, which probably I've mentioned before is another competitive advantage of this approach. Okay, well, I think in the interest of time, we'll go to the terrible thing going again. Yeah. There's a coffee break panel and then possibly there will be a discussion session.
