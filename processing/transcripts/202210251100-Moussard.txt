Thank you. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me to speak in this great workshop. So, my talk is about some triple point invariant, which is a knot invariant constructed by counting some triple points on some surfaces. And so, I will recall the definition of this invariant and see how we can compare it to the slice genus. Slice genus. So we will work with knots in S3. I take a knot in S3. And we will be interested in surfaces. The sigma will be compact collected oral piece surface. In S3 with boundaries, not k. But we will not consider in general embedded surfaces. We will be interested in immersed surfaces and at some point we'll also allow branch points. And we'll look at singularities on these surfaces. So if such a surface sigma is immersed In S3, we have double points and triple points generically. And so the lines of double points will be essentially of three kinds. We might have circles or closed self-intersections. Self-intersections, and we might have intervals which can be either ribbons or clasps. So the ribbons appear in this way. We have this kind of self-intersections on the surface, while on the class this kind of self-intersection. Of self-intersection, and I will be interested in how this appears on a pre-image of sigma. So, here are the intersections. And I will look at, say, the surface sigma prime, sigma tilde, right? So, I have an immersed surface, so I will call sigma tilde the abstract surface, which is immersed. Is immersed in S3 and sigma is a surface in S3. So when I have a closed self-intersection on the pre-image, I can see two circles. When I have a ribbon, I will see on the pre-image one interval properly embedded in the surface, while the other one is embedded in the interior. And when I have a clasp, Then, when I have a clasp, I have two prime images going from the point on the boundary to the point in the interior. And as you know, we don't like class. So why this? Because when we have a ribbon, we can push the interior of the surface, we can push the leaf which contains the singularity in the interior. In the interior into before, and in this way we can designularize without modifying the knot. This is what we can't do with class, and that's what gives the well-known result that any ribbon knot is a slice knot. And so we don't want class, but we will be happy with ribbons and circles. And now on our inmost surfaces, we'll have also triple points. So So people points will appear locally as intersections of 3 leaves of the surface. I try to make another picture. So we have here three times of intersection plus okay well speeches are very good. I think you'll be able to understand it. We have the And it we have this kind of intersection. So we have such triple points and we will look at how they appear once again on a pre-image surface. So to simplify, I'll draw it as a disk, but this can be more general. So one possibility is that we have three disk joints. We have three disjoint properly embedded preimages like this and the meet the preimages embedded in the interior. So I will give a name to this when we have such a preimage properly embedded. I call this a B line, the pre-image, and this one is an. And this one is an I-line. So here we have the swipping images of the triple point are intersection of a B line with an I-line. I will call this a Boromian triple point. While the other possibility starts something like this So now one preimage is the intersection of two B lines. We have an intersection of two eyelines and an intersection of one B line and one Eye line, which is simply a non-Boroughan triple point. The reason why I call this Boromian comes, if you can guess, from the Borromean ring. So if we draw a Borrome ring, Peromian ring. You can naturally imagine three disks bounded by these three components and they will pairwise intersect along ribbons. And if I try to make a picture of that. So you see that each disk will come through another one and this will create a ribbon. One and this will create a ribbon. And if you carefully look at the picture, you'll see that these three ribbons will intersect in this pattern, so give a Bermudian triple point. Of course, here I don't have a connected surface, but you can bend some and get a connected one. So, this is where the name programming comes from. And the idea behind this is that Is that these are the intrinsic triple points? The non-Boromian one you can always create artificially. If you had a ribbon intersection on your surface, you can take a piece of the boundary of the surface and make it cross the ribbon. And this will create a non-Bohmian triplet. If you have such an intersection You can take a piece of the surface and make it come here around, and what you get is just a non-born triple point. So these ones are somehow the degenerate ones. Okay. About class, you said you don't write them, you actually forbid them. Yeah, yeah, when I consider triple point, I will always. Consider triple points. I will always forbid them. So when I look at triple points, I forget the existence of class. What about theoretical? They will come into play. I will explain this in a minute. We will have a way to consider boring triple points also with circles. So next, what we'll have is also we'll allow some branch points. Some branch points. So if what I will call what I will say that sigma is a singular normal surface in three and if sigma is immersed Sigma is immersed except at a finite number of branch points where branch points are locally behaved like this. You have a line of double points and a simple point where the singularity disappears. And on the pre-image, what we see is just something like this. Okay, so now Which one? Yeah, I remove this. So now, if I have such a normal singular surface where I forbid clasps, we'll look at the different possibilities for lines of double points. So if sigma is a normal singular. So, it's a normal singular surface in a street with no class. Then, double-point lines will be of four kinds. So, we have the two that we have seen there. So, we have ribbons. I drew the pre-mages. We have We have branch ribbons. So if I have a branch point and the double point line ends at a point on the knot, it will on the pre-image appear like this. So this is a branch ribbon. I have also sackings and branches. And branch circles. Well, if my double point line here ends at another branch point, I get something like this. So this is a branched circle. And I want to have a marking on these singularities, meaning that I want each pre-image of a double point line to be either a B line. Line to be either a B line or an I line. In the case of ribbons, I have no choice. I have to take this one to be the B line and this one to be the I line. In the case of branch ribbons, there is also a fixed choice. The B line is the one that meets the boundary. B here, I here. For circles and branch circles, I don't have some natural way to choose, so we just have. Natural way to choose so we just arbitrarily decide that one pre-image is the B line and the other one is the I line. So in the first two cases, we have a determined marking while in the case of sequels it is arbitrary. Well, the point will be that we will have to look when a marking exists with certain properties. So that's why we need to have a marking everywhere. And yeah. The drivers can hopefully nest the drive. They can be nested one and the other. Yeah, for your, yeah. Okay, so now that yeah. Yeah. Pretty image you've drawn over here, you are disallowing. You do not want both of you to reach the boundary. Okay, this is just a local picture. There is no but again, that's not allowed, right? That's similar to the class, I guess. So there is no class now. Okay, so with a marking, we can extend the notion of Boromian triple points to Triple point to any triple point on our faces with no class. So a triple point is Borman if each Is the intersection of a B line and an I line. Okay. And so extending in this way the allowed singularities, we have the notion of a ribbon knot, which is a knot which bounds a disk with only A disk with only ribbons as singularities. And now, allowing more singularities, we can get a characterization of slice knots in dimensions three. So these are quite all results. So it in some sense appears in a paper of Osokawa and Yanagawa in 65. In 65, and it was more precisely stated by Kaochi, Shibuya, and Suzuki. In 83 So the proof that I not care is slice. Is slice if and only if it bounds a marked normal singular disk in S three with no class and also no Bohrman triple point. No, no, borrowing triple points. So we have a 3D characterization of a slice knot, which is quite close to the notion of ribbon knot, but we have to allow also non-Bohrman triple points and branch points. So, how does it prove this? One direction is a natural. Direction is the natural thing that we do with ribbon knots. We push into before, and when we push into before, in the case of a non-boller triple point, we can first push the eye lines, and also we push a boundary or a neighborhood of these high lines there. But if we push first these two, we will also designularize the the red um singularity. So we can first push this part, then this, and then the rest. Then this and then the rest, and we can designularize in this way. While, if there is a Boromian triple point, we have a problem because there is some kind of cyclic pattern. If I start with the red, then I can push the blues and the sorry, if I start with the green, then I push the blues and the red, but I will get some self-intersection remaining. So one triple point makes this pushing impossible. We cannot this. Impossible. We cannot desingularize a pre by pushing into before. So that's the idea in this direction. Now, if you have a slice knot, the quite natural idea is to take your slice disk, put it in a rather good position, and then project onto S3. And there are some work there, but with careful analysis of what you get in S3, you see that you have such a Mach number singular disk. Okay, so now one thing is that this works well with a surface which has some genus. We don't need to restrict to disk in this proof. And it also gives a 3D characterization of the slice genus. So the slice genus, the slice genus is a minimal genus of a surface embedded in B4 with boundary node k. So the size genus of k equals the minimal genus Genus of the Mach normal singular surface say sigma in S3 such that once the boundary is k um and And with no class and no Boolemian triple point. So once again, this three characterization is close to the definition of the ribbon genus. So the ribbon genus is a minimum genus of Minimum genus of a surface immersed in S3, its boundaries are not, and only ribbons as singularities. And so once again, allowing non-born triple points and branch points, we get a characterization of the slice genus. Now, another remark is that here we forbid borrowing triple points, but we allow Triple points, but we allow the genus to be non-trivial, and we could do the converse. If we want to work only with this, we can see what we get if we allow a non-trivial number of Boromian triple points. And this leads to the definition of an invariant was introduced by Moakami and Subicita, which is the T genus. So we write it t of k, and it's the minimum number of Boromian triple points on Mark Normal singular disk. Such that the boundary is K and with no class, and that's all. So now I require to have a disk, still with no clasps, and I count the minimal possible number. The minimum possible number of Borman and triple points. Yeah. Sorry, I do have a question. Is this saying that if I take any sign against of K and I somehow project it to S3, maybe with some perturbation so that they can get more generic, it will look like that. Yeah, yeah, that's so the question is: if we take any slice disk and we project it onto S3 to some perturbations, do we get that? And yeah, that's indeed this theorem. So if I have a slice disk, I can indeed isotop it into a good position and project into a street, and I will get such a mark normal singular disk. And here we do the same with a surface with some genus, and we get a With some genus, and we get a Mach normal singular phase. Yeah, that's the end. Okay, so we have this. Now, if we look only at disks and with no class, the point is that any knot bounds such a disk. So we have a well-defined finite invariant. This is used to a result of Kaplan in 79. Well, T of K is finite. So we have a well-defined integer invariant. And this was introduced by Murakami and Tsubishita, and they gave some properties of this invariant. So Murakami. So they prove that T is a concordance invariant. So, this is once again this idea of projecting. When you have a concordance and you project it, you will also be able to. You will also be able to avoid clasps and borrow and triple points. And so we have a concordance invariant, and it's an upper bound for the slice genus. So this is the slice genus. So this is also some concordance idea. There's some concordance idea behind. So, when you have a Mach normal singular disk bound in by K, you can once again try to push into the fourth dimension. But as we said, when we have Boromian triple points, we don't know what to do with them. So you can push almost everything except the Borrowan triple points, and you will get a cobaltism between K and a split union of Boromian rings. Of Boromian rings, one for each Boromian triple point, and then you use the fact that the Borromian ring has slice genus one. This gives this inequality. And the third property is that if you reduce the T-genus mod two, you get the RF invariant. I won't recall what is the RF invariant. It's somehow algebraically defined invariant which takes values in Which takes values in 0 over 2. And so this gives somehow a nice topological interpretation of it, in particular, because this is true indeed not only for the minimum, but for any number of Bormann triple points. So I roughly you can say it is true for any realization. So what I mean. So, what I mean is that if you take any Mark normal singular disk bounded by K and with no class, the parity of the number of Bovomian triple points is always the same and it's given by the earth invariant. Okay, so with these properties, in particular the last two, Muakami and Subishita were able to compute the T genus for some for several nodes. Several nodes, but indeed a mean precise case. So they could compute t of k for some nodes k for which we have either t of k equals the slice genus or t of k equals slice genus plus one. So the point is. So, the point is that's always the problem when you define an invariant with a minimum. You have to prove that you have reached the minimum. So, if you get the slice genus, this tells you that you are done. And if you get the slice genus plus one, since you cannot change the parity, you're done too. Yeah, so the arc invariant is the reduction module, the coefficients of p squared and the power polynomials. Is there a relative? Is there a relation between that coefficient and geo k in general? I don't think. So the question is about this equality and the fact that the half invariant is also the prediction of two of the coefficients of the Conway polynomial of Z2 in the Conway polynomial. So do we have a more general relationship with T and I don't think there is I have Think there is. I've worked on that at some point, and I don't think I'll obtain some good results about that. This is kind of a hard two statement. Is there sometimes a diagram in which you can clearly see that there's a way to sort of cancel two Beromian triple points together? Yeah. So you can write a diagram for trivial note, I think. For a trivial note, I think the idea is to take two Bohrmian rings and make kind of collect some. Probably have to take the other direction. So I probably won't make exactly the right. Probably won't make exactly the right picture, but something like that. You make a bumpstone between two Berromian rings. And if you do this well, it will come so. Yeah. Why is it only a modified reduction and not a like, why is it not a major value equivalence? Like, can't you define this? Like, uh, can't you define the sign of the triple point by the orientation? Okay, so the question is: why don't we have here an equality not only mod two? The point is that the earth invariant is only defined mod two. Oh, um, I mean, uh, I what I mean to say is what is the count of rolling triple points and information about two perturbations of the turtle in determining. So, okay, I mean, is t of k is defined over z? It's an integer-valued invariant. Okay. Okay, so here we are. And so now we see that to compute t of k, if the value of t is possibly greater than the slide g. possibly greater than the slight genus plus one we we miss uh some possibility to say how to say that um we've reached the minimum so the question here is uh can this difference between t and gs be greater than one so So, question how round can be QK minus GFK and the answer is arbitrary language. So, of course, to answer that, we need some other lower bound. And what we use here is the 4D class number and some recent results comparing the 4D class number and the slice genus. So I recall the definition of this 4D class number. Faudi class number and some variance of it. So the 4D class number C4 of K. So now we look at surfaces immersed in before. And when we have a surface immersed in before, generically the singularities are only transversable points. So and this will be defined as the minimal number. As a minimal number of transverse double points of double points on an immersed disk D in before With boundary k. Okay, and there are two interesting variants of it. We have a positive 4D class number, which is the minimum number of positive double points. And in most disk, etc. We count only the positive double points, of course, we can also. points of course we can also define the negative for the class number can't think the negative number points and another possibility which is well suited to a comparison with t is to consider a balanced class number c4b so the idea is when you have an immersed disk in before properly embedded you can always arbitrarily add Always arbitrarily add some double points, positive or negative, without modifying the boundary. And so, in particular, you can require that your not bounds an inverse disk with the same number of positive and negative double points. And so, in this case, you can count the pairs of double points with opposite sign. So, this will be the minimum number of pairs of double points. Points with opposite sign on a numerous disk in before. Okay, so we have another series of inequalities that are very direct. We have that C4 plus is lower than C4B, lower than C4, lower than C4 twice the balance polyclass number. So these are just obvious inequalities from the definitions. Now another Now another thing is that this 4D class number is known to be an upper bound for the sliced genus. So the idea is that when you have an immersed disk in before, you can locally desingularize a double point at the cost of adding one to the genus of the surface. Now we can slightly improve this. The balanced Fourier class number is also a number balance for the slice genus. We have just get more than C4B. Okay. So this is because when you take on your disk a pair of double points with opposite sign, you can tube the surface. So you will remove two double points while adding only one to the genus. So you get this inequality. So, now what will be important here is a recent result by Daimy and Scaduto, which compares the positive 4D plus number with the slice genus. This is a theorem by Daimy and Skadruto in 2020. So the proof. They prove that the difference G of K minus C4 plus of K. No, it's the color, sorry. Sorry, I lost. Yeah, see functions. Minus. Minus Gs of K can be arbitrarily large. So, this will help us since we know that the balanced class number is an upper bound for the positive class number. Is an upper bound for the positive class number. And as said, we can compare the t-genus with the balanced polyclass number. So, indeed, what we have is that for any naught k the t genus is an upper bound for the balance for any class number. So, how do we prove that? So, when you have a Mach normal singular disk bounded by Z naught K, as we said, we can push the interior of the disk into B4, but we have a difficulty when we have a Boromian triple point. And so the idea is that we will be able to push also the Borrowan triple points, but we cannot completely desingularize at each Boronian triple point on our map. Borrowing triple points on our marked singular disk will give us a pair of double points of opposite signs in dimension four. So this gives exactly this inequality. So now if we use so the t genus is an upper bound for the balanced Fourier class number, which is an upper bound for the positive Fourier class number. And the difference with the slash genus, according to Daimius Caduto, can be arbitrarily large. Can be arbitrarily large. So we obtain the answer over there that the difference of the T genus and the slice genus can be arbitrarily large. Okay, so now maybe this raises a new question. We used this balance plus number as a lower bound, but we may wonder how large can be this difference here. And for this, I don't have the answer. For this, I don't have the answer. I write the question. So, question: How large can be the difference if? minus sq b of k um so maybe a remark here there is some uh result somehow related to this by miller this is also a recent uh so suppose that the difference of the slide genes and the positive And the positive Richard's number can be arbitrarily large. And so it is indeed the converse of what Damien Skenuto proved. The point is that we don't have an inequality between these two environments here. And so this shows also This shows also that the difference between the T-genus and the positive 4D class number can be arbitrarily large. But the nodes she uses to prove this are not that have some kind of symmetry. So they can have, they bound some disks in before either with a lot of positive double points and no negative double points, or the converse. But you cannot easily reduce the balance. Not easily reduce the balance class number. So this question here remains open. And I don't have the answer. My guess is that it should possibly be arbitrarily large, but I cannot prove it. I can propose an example, which is given by the twist knots. So this family of knots, where you have here Where you have here n crossings. So, this is the node Kn. So, these are well-known nodes. In particular, we know that for positive N, the standard three-dimensional genus, okay-n is one. It's a lip result of Casson and Gordon in 86. In 86, that if n is different from 0 and 4, then the slice genus of Kn is 1. And this allows to compute the 4D class number if n once again is not 0 or 4. So for n equals 0, we have the trivial node, and for n equals 4, this is the stable node. 4. This is the stable of node, which is a slice, and we have so if n is different from 0 and 4, we have that the balance for the class number and the 40 class number are both equal to 1. So the lower bound is given here by the slice genus, so by the result of Cassandra and Gordon, and the upper bound is given by the unlotting number. So, if you have the one thing is that the unotting number of kn is one, you just have to change a crossing here to make it trivial. And when you have a sequence of crossing changes which trivialize the knot, you can see them into a movie picture. If you draw a movie picture with your crossing changes, each crossing change in the fourth dimension gives you a transverse double point. A transverse double point. So the unlotting number is an upper bound for the 4D class number. So we have this. And now, of course, the question is: what can be the T genus of Kn? So for this, I only have an upper bound. I would prefer a lower bound, of course. But just to give an insight on how we can think about it. How we can think about it. I give a characterization of the T genus. It can indeed be characterized in terms of delta moves. So a delta move is the Fobinum Reidemiter move. So you have this and you turn it into This, if I understand. So, this is a move where the crossings between two components remain the same, but of course we've made a non-isotopic move here. And it's known by, I think, Murakami Nakanishi, I'm not completely sure, that this is an unnotting operation. Is an unnotting operation. So, in particular, there is a notion of a delta unnotting number, and what we are interested in here is a delta slicing number. So, the delta slicing number, really not as delta or k is the minimum number of delta mu's. Needed to change J into a slice knot okay, and it was proved by Kawochi Moakami and Tsubishika. That the delta slicing number indeed equals the T genus. And so this is some there is something initial in that because we have hidden Boromian patterns in this move. And the T genus And the T genus essentially counts the number of Boromian patterns in a knot. And so now what you can see is you have here the right button to apply a delta move. And if you apply this delta move here, you will get Kn minus 2. And so you can rebuild your not Kn starting. your dot Kn starting with K0 or K1 and making around n over two delta moves. And so this shows the following inequality, we have that T of K 2n minus 1 is at most n and T of K 2n is at most n minus 2. This is because we have K4 which Have a K4, which is slice. And well, it would be great that we can prove the equalities here, but I now know how to do that. So I think I should start. So just a very small remark. There is also a ribbon version of these invariants. You can define a ribbon T genus, a delta Ribboning numbers, and most results here are similar in this situation. In this situation. Okay, thank you for your attention. Any buttons? Um being the absolute It's a good question. I'm not completely sure that it should work because I don't remember precisely, but I've tried to make some sign counting at some point and I. I remember it did not work well, so I'm not sure this will work, but maybe it's to be looked at in a very important way. Um No, that's a good question. No, I didn't look at that sorry. I'm not saying it would be interesting. Yep.  Um what I know, I don't know if I put it. So the sign the sign of a triple point in a surface, right, is you take a normal vector to the surface at each of the sheets, and then you take their wedge product based on the order they appear, because the arcs appear in some order around the knot. Arcs appear in some order around the knot counterclockwise. So you can take their wedge product in that order. And then you get signed. But I don't remember only like specific order, so it matters. Yeah, it probably remembers. Maybe I'm wrong about this. Maybe I. Maybe I'm wrong about this. Maybe it's quite possible it's just defined mod two. All right, I'll have other questions. I would say
