Our next speaker will be Nathan Williams talking about semi-distrum lattices. All right. Thank you for the introduction, Jim. And thanks to the organizers for letting me present. I guess it's usual that we thank the organizers. It's like, yeah, as the last speaker, we're supposed to do that. But let's save it till the end of my talk, and then we can pretend that it's just for my talk, and that'll be great. Okay, so right, semi-district lattices. I'll be talking about that. This is joint work with Colin DeCend. Be talking about that. This is joint work with Colin DeFant, who you can see he's got his video on. And I like to start, you know, Lattice Theory talks with this beautiful quote due to Rhoda. Never in the history of mathematics has a mathematical theory been the object of such vociferous vituperation as lattice theory. That's from the many lives of lattice theory. So cool, good stuff. So let's talk about why lattices. Well, okay, let's talk first about where lattices. They're all over the place. So submodules of modules, subrings, subgroups. Modules of modules, subrang subgroups, normal subgroup lattices, Jordan-Holder style stuff, closed subspaces of topological spaces, torsion classes. So coming from this, you know, quiver representation theory stuff, or you can go to hyperplane arrangements or matroids, and you can look at intersection lattices or lattices of flats, or even, you know, posets of regions. Sometimes those are lattices. Then there's stuff called cluster algebras. And well, you should fill in the rest of it, I guess. And then why lattices over like general posits? Why are those cool? Well, I guess the point is that. Um, well, I guess the point is that um, you have posets, which are order structure, uh, but then you also have algebra, and the posets are algebra, and so you can think of it in both ways, and that's that's pretty cool to be able to do that. Okay, so that answers that question. So now we're all lattice theorists, so let's have a brief A history of lattices. Okay, so dark ages, nobody did lattice theory, I guess, so who knows? In 1880, we have Pierce who claims that all lattices are distributive. And he says that this is easily proved. And he says that this is easily proved, but the proof is too tedious to give, kind of format-like there. And then in 1890, Schroeder then says that actually not all lattices are distributive, as it turns out. And around 1900, 1897, two papers, Dedekind actually defines lattices. So this is part of the problem is that there's no definition. So he calls them dual grouping or dual groups. He also discovers the number 28. We actually know of that number today as the number 30. Today, as the number 30. Okay, so Birkhoff in the 1930s, he established lattice theory as a thing, popularized it, actually named lattices. Continuing with sort of the highlights of lattice theory, over here in 1939, Dov Tamari was imprisoned for possession of explosives. In his defense, it was said that he was a scatterbrain, like all mathematicians. He still spent time in prison, however. All right, at 8 a.m. 1954, Orr said that. Or said that I think lattice theory has played out. And then in 1972, all the lattice theorists moved to Hawaii. Okay, so that's sort of my A History of Lattices. I'll explain more about those as we go along in case you didn't get one or two of those things. It looks like most of you got it, though. So, okay, so 2002 then is really where our story starts. And this is the introduction of cluster algebra by Fomin and Zelvinsky. And there's this going to be this bifurcation that happens. Be this bifurcation that happens, okay? And this is really just in the interest of dramatic narrative tension. So, there are two schools: there's the Hugh Thomas School of trim lattices, and they don't talk to this other school, the Nathan Reading School of semi-distributive lattices. And you should think of this as like the local, the trim lattices, these are kind of like local and toggle-related things. And the semi-distributive ones are like global and lattice things. Okay, so we have this bifurcation, and these two schools, they're not talking to each other. There's no contact. Other, there's no contact. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. This is not true. So, huge rivalry going on. So, in 2000, what's the point? Is that we're interested in looking at these exchange graphs of cluster algebras, oriented exchange graphs, and we're trying to understand them, maybe for finite type. And so, we have Hugh Thomas. Well, let's go with Nathan Reading's approach. So, Nathan Reading decides to embed these exchange graphs into the weak order. He introduces Cambrian lattices and sortable elements. Am I getting feedback? Sorry, I'm hearing some feedback. Okay. Okay. And then he introduces some shards. Actually, this was in his thesis earlier, so I'm not sure why that's there. Over here in 2012, you can see that I had dinner with Nathan. 2014, there's the ARC diagrams, and we played ultimate at FibSAC in that year. This is very good history. And then there's some more stuff. This is totally not comprehensive, by the way. Nathan's done so much, so much stuff. So this is just a brief history. So, this is just a brief history of the Nathan Reading School here. And of course, Emily Barnard came out of that and she gave a lovely talk earlier on many of these themes. Okay, and then we have the Nathan Reading School, sorry, the Hugh Thomas School of trim lattices. So in 2006, also trying to understand oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras, we have trim lattices. And he's sort of he builds it as, you know, what if a distributive lattice wasn't graded is kind of the question that he's answering. It is kind of the question that he's answering. Then he turns with Colin Ingalls to representation theory of quivers and goes off of that. Yes, Sam, you're absolutely right. Here's in 2012, you can see that I've tricked Hugh into inverting the sweep map. He does some stuff with David Speyer. We did then row motion and in slow motion and independence posets later on. Okay, so this is the history, and we should keep moving. Of course, Hugh Thomas did enormous amounts of stuff. Also, this is not comprehensive. This is just. This is just some sampling. Okay, so if we're at the Hugh Thomas School of Trim Lattices, how do we do things? Okay, what we do is we start with a quiver, which is a directed graph with pretensions, and we make these indecomposable modules in some way. It doesn't matter. And the point is that these are going to be like joint irreducible elements inside of the lattice of torsion classes, which is over here. The upshot here is just that I get this lattice and the edges, the cover relations of colors, okay? And we can do row motion on these things by sort of Motion on these things by sort of following the rainbow. Okay, so let's do that in an example. So if I start here, for example, what I want to do is I want to walk along the colors in the order that I see them when possible. So I go, I try to go purple and I can. Then I try to go blue. You're seeing that. And then green and I can't. I can't. I try to do yellow and I can't. I do orange. I can. And then I can also do red and I end up over here. Does everyone follow that? I'm following the rainbow. Okay, this is like a local walking sort of thing. And what you'll note is that I went from here, which had. And what you'll note is that I went from here, which had orange and purple down, and I got over here and had purple and orange up. And that always happens. Okay, so this is how you compute row motion in the Hugh Thomas school, local toggles. Okay. All right. Now, the narrative tension, the Nathan Reading school of semi-distributive lattices. Okay, this is much more a global lattice structure sort of thing. So how do you do things if you're Nathan Reading or in that school? Well, you start with the hyperplane arrangement. The colors are a little deceptive here. You break it, you break each hyperplane. You break it, you break each hyperplane into little pieces called shards, and then maybe you delete some of them for some reason. And then you make this lattice of regions. Okay, so I don't know if it's obvious, but this is the same example as the previous example, just drawn using some hyperplanes, and there's some projection stuff, but okay, whatever. And now what you do is you globally say, well, for reasons, I know that anytime I'm going to have some region here and it's bounded below by some shards, then there's going to be some other region which is bounded above by those same shards. Above by those same shards, okay. And that's how you would do row motion in the Nathan Reading School. Completely different way of doing it. Okay, good. Okay. So let's keep going. And today, of course, we're going to resolve this dramatic tension. Hugh Thomas and Nathan Reading will finally be able to talk to each other again. And we're going to somehow, we want to take the join of semi-distributive and trim lattices to get semi-district lattices. Okay. So the point here is that, like, here's a lattice right here. So the point here is that, like, here's a lattice right here. This is a lattice that is semi-distributive, but not trimmed. This is a lattice that is trimmed, but not semi-distributive. And this is a lattice that is neither. And yet, it has many of the desired properties that you might expect of a lattice that was semi-distributive or trimmed to have. Okay, so semi-district. All right, so we have to try to define this. That's our goal. And so let's fail first. Okay, so remember we were talking about lattices had algebra. They were post-sets, but they also were algebra. So there's a thing called a lattice variety. So there's a thing called a lattice variety, okay? And I'm going to completely ignore anything about cardinality. Sorry. Okay, so what can we do? Well, we can take a set of lattice equations. These are equations in terms of the meets and joins and lattice elements, and we can map it over to just a set of lattices that satisfy those equations. So I look at the set of all lattices that satisfy those equations, and that's called a lattice variety. So for example, some examples. So for example, if I were to map the lattice equation, just the set of lattice equations where x equals y, then I just get the trivial lattice. Equals y, then I just get the trivial lattice, right? Everything is equal. Or I could have this particular law, which is the distributive law. And if I take the set of this, the set of all lattices that satisfy this, then I get the set of all distributive lattices. And that's a lattice variety. And you could go backwards, right? You could start with a set of lattices and then produce a set of equations that are satisfied by every member of that set. And then you could set up some sort of duality, just like with usual varieties and so on. Okay, so the upshot now is that we can order lattice varieties. Is that we can order lattice varieties by inclusion, and we get a lattice of lattices, okay? The lattice of lattice varieties. So, let's take a look at what this thing looks like. So, at the very bottom, right here, you have just the trivial lattice. We're ordering it by containment of these families of lattices. And at the very top, you have like all lattices. And so, this picture is from Nation's Johnson's contribution to the flatterer. I just redrew pieces of it. Okay, so let's see what happens. So, now you can look at the variety generated. So now you can look at the variety generated by the diamond. I think it's called the diamond, it's M3. Okay, and you could go off this way. And this way would be the land of modular lattices, and that's not today. Or you could look at the Pentagon and you could start looking at like covers of that. And there's this guy right here, and then there are 15 other covers. And if you get rid of the five rightmost ones and just look at the 10 over here, then sitting somewhere above that would be the lattice variety of semi-distributive lattices. Variety of semi-distributive lattices. Okay. Okay. So, which we're trying to do, remember, what we're trying to do is we're trying to, you know, make a join of semi-distributive and trim. Okay, that's the point. So I guess somewhere in this picture, you could find the variety of trim lattices, and then I would take the join, and I would get the variety of semi-distributed lattices. There we go. We're done, right? End of talk finished. And the problem is that this doesn't work. So, right, it would be the join or trim into semi-distributed. And the reason it doesn't work is that trim lattices are not, it's not a lattice variety. Is that trim lattices are not a lattice variety? So it's a really nice class of lattices. It's just not a lattice variety. It doesn't fit into this algebraic framework. And so there's this theorem due to Berkoff that lattice varieties are the subsets of lattices that are closed under homomorphic images, sub-lattices, and direct products. And well, the problem is that trim lattices are not closed under sub-lattices. So here's an example of a trim lattice that has a very, very untrim sub-lattice. And this is a very nasty example. If you're trying to define semi-distributed lattices by like excluded sub-lattices, this is one of the ones that you must. Sublattices. This is one of the ones that you must draw. So it has some weird properties. Okay, good. So that approach didn't work. So instead, what we should do is let's try to identify what trim and semi-distributive lattices actually have in common. And we'll just sort of write things down. And hopefully at the end, we'll have a class that we can do things with. Okay, so what do they have in common? They've got row motion in common. So let's start with that. We're going to fail here. Oh, so let me just say, if you're interested in this first thing about Pierce saying that all lattices are distributive. Pierce saying that all lattices are distributive, and Schroeder saying that not all lattices are distributive. There's a very nice stack exchange post on it. And here you have Pierce trying to explain himself using words that I don't know. So you can go look at that. I really could not understand his explanation of why he... Okay, anyway. But there's a very good explanation on the page where basically they were thinking of lattices completely differently, just very algebraically, and they just couldn't write down like M3. Okay, so row motion then. Okay, so row motion. That's what trim and semi-distributed lattices have in common. So let's just try to bake it in to our definition of semi-distributed lattices. Maybe that'll work. It won't work, but let's try it. Okay, so Colin and I have this theorem, and let me just try to explain. So we all remember the pop stack map. So the idea is that if I have an element in the lattice, then what I do is I look at all of the things that are directly under it so that it covers, and then I take their meat, and that's the pot. Their meet, uh, and that's the pop, right? That's the pop of X, okay. Um, so that's this thing. And uh, if you're thinking geometrically, here's the permutahedron. Uh, really, what that's doing is that you take some you take some element of the permutahedron, it's oriented. So, I take this element and I sort of look at the maximal face that it belongs to, and then I just drop down the face, okay, like that. So, it's a really very nice geometric thing to do. Um, and uh, so we have this theorem that if uh if L is semi-distributive, um, then uh in fact, raw motion can be characterized as it's the Motion can be characterized as it's the maximum element such that if I meet it with X, then I pop. Okay, so let me just sort of explain. So if I'm looking at this element right here, then if I were to pop it, then I'd get down to here, right? And you could ask, well, what's the biggest element when I meet it with this element, then I get all the way down to zero, right? And well, certainly if I meet with zero, if I meet this guy and this guy, then I get down to zero. But also, if I meet this guy and this guy, Get down to zero, but also if I meet this guy and this guy, then I get down to zero. This guy and this guy, and so on. So, actually, these are all the elements. So, for example, um, this one, uh, and this one, when I meet them, I end up over here, so it's not zero, so it introduces not the pop, right? So, so, so this is, this is the set of all the elements that when I meet them with the blue guy, then I get the pop. And the maximum such element actually turns out to be the romotion. Okay, and you could do something similar for romotion inverse. So, this is our theorem. And so you could say, okay, let's just take that sort of as a definition. That sort of as a definition. So we could say, well, let's let L be uniquely, completely paired. If there were a unique bijection, call it row motion, where if I so I can always pop in any lattice, I just look at what's covered and then and then and then meet them. If wherever I pop and then I look at the maximum of such elements, then I'll just say, if there's a unique bijection row, where rho is among the maximum elements and row inverse is among the minimum elements of the inverse thing, of inverse pop. Okay, and you can define this. Pop. Okay. And you can define this. And in fact, on semi-distributive and trivial lattices, this, you know, of course, this will agree completely with Romotian. They do have this unique bijection. But in general, if you make this definition, then the problem is that there's no structure to these lattices. You can't prove anything about them. They're just like somehow too many lattices. Some of them just satisfy it accidentally. Okay, but it's sort of an interesting class of lattices, but you can't say anything about it. Okay, so back to the drawing board again. And we're going to try and identify what trim and semi-distributive lattices have in common. Semi-distributed lattices have in common again, okay. And so, let's be um a little bit, um, uh, let's pull back a little bit. Let's not require uh that we have some pairing on the entire lattice. Let's actually note that joint irreducibles and meet irreducibles actually get paired in both of these cases in trim and semi-distributed lattices. Okay, now I'm supposed to explain Dedekind and 28. And I think Sam Hopkins pointed out, yeah, so this is the free modular lattice, the free modular lattice on three elements. And the problem was that his definition, Dedekind's definition of lattice, Definition, Dedekind's definition of flattis. It was every non-empty set of elements has a join or a meet. But nowadays, we just say any set has a meet or a join. And so that's the 28 versus the 30. There's a top and a bottom. And if you want to read about this, John Bays has a really nice post on it. And that's included right there. Okay, great. So we want to get this pairing between joint and meet irreducibles. So how do we do that? Well, let's just talk about it in the case of semi-distributive lattices. The case of semi-distributive lattices. So, what happens? Well, let's imagine I'm trying to find the joint irreducible corresponding to this M over here. So, what I do is since it's a medium irreducible, it has an element that covers it. So, what I do is I look at all the elements that are less than that unique element covering it, but not less than M itself. And among all of those, there will be a minimum such element, and that will be my J. All right. And the same thing for if I want to find the unique M corresponding to. The unique m corresponding to this joint irreducible, then what I do, the joint irreducible covers a unique element, and therefore I look at all of the things that are above the cover, but not above J. And the maximum element there will be the corresponding meter reducible. Okay, great. We can do that in a quick example right here. So I look at M2. What am I trying to do? I'm trying to find the corresponding joint irreducible. So I'm looking at its unique cover, which is up here, and I'm looking at everything that's less than that, but not less. Everything that's less than that, but not less than the M. Okay, so that would be over here. And the minimum element here is the J2. So M2 and J2 get paired, which is good because I chose those numbers and they agree. Okay, good. Fine. So you have this canonical bijection between join and mute reducibles in the case of semi-distributed lattices. And you have also a canonical bijection between join and mute reducibles in the case of trim lattices, but it's like different canonical. So let's explain. So a trim lattice is in particular an extremal lattice. And what that means is that it's going to have the same number of joint. That means that it's going to have the same number of joint and meteor reducibles, and that agrees with the length of the maximum length chain. Okay, so there's some maximum length chain here, okay? And I'm going to use that chain to pair up the joint and meteor reducibles. And the way that I do this is if I look at, if I look at some cover in that chain, then to go from xi minus one to xi, then there's got to be a joint irreducible that I join with xi minus one to get up to xi. And correspondingly, to go down from xi to xi minus one, there's got to be a meet irreducible that I meet with xi. That I meet with xi to get down to xi minus one. Okay, and this way, this edge sort of gets assigned ji, but also mi, like that. So I can pair them off in this way, canonically. Okay, and we could do the same example as before. So I'm choosing this maximal length path in the same example that I've been doing, which by the way, right, I should have mentioned it's both trim and semi-distributive. Yeah, okay. So we're doing everything like in different ways, and yet we're getting the same answer. Okay, so this is an intersection. Okay, so this is an intersection. Okay, so I have this maximum length path, and now let's look at if I'm going between x1 to x2, then to do that, I join with J2. So this edge gets a J2 assigned to it. But if I'm going down, what do I meet with to go from X2 down to X1? Well, M2 over here is the meteor reducible that does that. Okay, so in a different way, I still get the same assignments of joining meteor reducibles. Of joint immediate reducibles. Okay, um, so let's just bake that in. Let's we're stepping back from the you know completely uniquely paired, but let's just say it's uniquely paired, the lattice. Uh, if I can sort of pair up the joint irreducibles with the media reducibles, okay? So it's the same idea as before, but now I want to take, if I give me a joint irreducible, the corresponding meteor reducible will be taken from among the maximum elements such that when I meet J with that maximum element, then I get the unique cover of J. uh the the unique cover of j right so that's how i get uh the corresponding meteor reducible to to j is i look for among all the elements that when i when i meet them with j i get j prime j star um i want to find uh i want it i want i want the corresponding meteor reducible to be among the maximum ones there could be many um and the same the same thing with uh to find the the corresponding join irreducible um uh but the point is that we're we're we're we're requiring that there's a unique bijection so even though it looks like there are choices uh as the glass and the lattice as a whole there there are no choices you're forced okay so basically There are no choices, you're forced. Okay, so basically, like it means that maybe you know, this joint irreducible had to get paired up with that media irreducible, and then having done that, you have to strike it away from the list of the possibilities in the other ones, and you cascade and you get this unique pairing. Okay, so this is what we'll call a pairing. And it turns out that semi-distributive and trim lattices are uniquely paired. Okay, so this, so, so, so, so, this way, we had two different ways of doing it, but it's the same, okay? They're uniquely paired. Everyone's okay with us? Great. Um, all right, so. Great. All right. So let's continue to identify what trim and semi-distributive lattices have in common. And another thing that they have in common is that you can prove things about them. Okay. So now I'm going to talk. Wait, I'm supposed to say that Birkhoff established Lattice Theory as a thing. Okay, you can go read about this in Lattice Theory, It's Birth and Life, I guess, by Bilova. Okay, fantastic. But yes, he interested even von Neumann in lattices. Von Neumann. Yeah, so that's pretty cool. He really popularized it. All right. Right. So you can prove things about semi-distributive. So, you can prove things about semi-distributive and trim lattices. So, how do you do that? Well, what you do is it turns out that both semi-distributive and trim lattices have a sort of decomposition. Okay, so in particular, what you can do is you can decompose them into a principal filter, okay? So a filter up, and also an ideal down. So that's the picture that I've drawn. And if you started with a semi-distributive lattice, then when you do this, then you still get a semi-distributive lattice for both of them. And if you do it with a trim lattice, then you still get a trim lattice for both of them as well. For both of them as well. So you can sort of inductively pull these things apart. A prototype, you know, the first place that I ever saw this was in Nathan Reading's Cambrian Recurrence, where he essentially does this for Cambrian lattices. Okay, so you could prove things about them. So in semi-distributive lattices, any atom gives you such a decomposition, it turns out. And in trim lattices, they're just some atom which gives such a decomposition. Here's a counterexample of, you know, I chose some atom and it didn't give me the decomposition that I wanted. Let's formalize what I'm saying. That I wanted. Let's formalize what I'm saying. What is such a decomposition? Well, we'll say that an element J0 is join prime. And this is not the standard definition that's given really small up here, but it's equivalent. If there exists a corresponding meet prime element, such that the lattice splits like this into this union of integrals. Okay, this disjoint union of integrals. Okay, so this is what it means to be joint prime. And it turns out that if you have a pairing from before, then and J0 is joint prime, then it has to map to. Is join prime, then it has to map to the corresponding meat prime element. So this is very nice. These sorts of pairings let you, these sorts of joint prime elements let you pull the lattice apart into two simpler things. And there's a definition already in the literature due to nation et al. where L is called interval dismantleable if, well, it's of size one, sort of trivially, or you can decompose it into in this way where both of those intervals are also interval dismantleable. Okay, so you just slow, you just pull. Okay, so you just slow, you just pull it apart, pull it apart, and so you know, so you can prove things because induction. Okay, so but the thing is that our semi-distributive and our trim lattices, they came with more information. They had colors on the edges, okay? I haven't really told you how to get the colors, but they did. And we'd really like to be able to respect the colors on the edges and not just and not just have it be flat. Okay, we want the colors to stay put. So how could we bake that in? Okay, so here's how. So this is. Okay, so here's how. So, this is sort of the first new sort of definition here. A uniquely paired lattice L, okay, so I can pair up the joined and the irreducibles, is compatibly dismantleable. So it's really looking the same as before. I can split it into the two pieces, okay, such that each part is also compatibly dismantleable. But now there's, I want to, I want to, uh, I want to capture also the colors. So, what does that mean? Okay, well, if I have a joint irreducible that lives inside of the lower interval, okay, so I'm looking at this, let's say this lower interval right here, if I have some joint irreducible. Lower interval right here. If I have some joint irreducible that's looking at that lower interval, it's still join irreducible in that lower interval, right? Okay. So in particular, though, it paired up with some with some meat irreducible elsewhere in the lattice. But there's an obvious projection into that interval. There's an obvious projection of that meat irreducible that paired with J into the interval, which is M0 just meets the top element of that interval, meets the corresponding meteor reducible. What I'd like to say is that not only. What I'd like to say is that not only is this interval compatibly dismantable, but also if I have a joint irreducible in there, then it has to pair with that projection of what it paired with up top. Okay? And the same thing down below. So, well, the same thing for the other interval. So now, if I was meat irreducible, then I have one edge sticking up. And that means that I'm still meat irreducible over in this interval. And therefore, I want to force that thing to pair with the projection of the corresponding joiner. Of the corresponding joint irreducible into that upper filter. Okay. And so the first proposition that we have is that semi-distributive and trim lattices are compatibly dismantlable. Okay. So somehow this is capturing the idea, it's capturing the idea of preserving the colors. Wonderful. Let's identify what trim and simulated suitable lattices have in common. Okay. So the third thing is I have to tell you about the colors, okay? The edge labels. And that's actually going to come for free. Okay, here I was going to. Okay, here, I was gonna explain this Dove Tamari being imprisoned for the explosive. Well, this is true. This is just tragic, though. I mean, he managed to escape from Germany to France and then went to Israel and he was wounded. And it's really a tragic story, but you should read about it in this wonderful biography, Dove Tamari, formerly Bernard Tietler, in the Tamari Memorial Fresh Drift. That is really nice. Okay, so yeah. Yeah, he had a tough time. Yeah, he had a tough, tough time. Okay, so what are we doing? Oh, yes, we're trying to figure out what they have in common, and they have edge labels in common. Okay, so there's some way to assign edge labels sort of canonically, and the edge labelings are by the joint irreducibles. So the colors were just the joint irreducibles from before. And the idea is if I have a cover A to B here, then what I do is I look for the minimum elements such that if I take A and wedge it with X, then I equal B, and I take the minimum such thing, and that'll be the canonical. The minimum of such thing, and that'll be the canonical J. And in trim lattices, so you can see there's a minimum here, that's minimum in the lattice. And in a trim lattice, it's sort of the same thing, except you take I to be minimal, like in the sense of like numbers, like one, less than two, less than three. So it's both minimal, but in different senses. So it's still canonical in both of them. Okay, so what are we going to do? Okay, well, let's forget all of that. Here's a way to do it for any lattice. You could say, well, a uniquely paired lattice. Okay, so there's this correspondence between joint immediate reducibles. They'll say that that's overlapping. Reduciples, they'll say that that's overlapping. Okay, if for every cover, then what do I do? I look at the set of joint irreducibles that live below the larger of the two elements. And then I look at the meat irreducible elements that live above the smaller of the two. Of course, I'm sort of projecting them. I'm thinking of them as using the correspondence, the kappa, the unique pairing. I'm thinking of them as joint introducibles because then I can intersect those sets. Join your new schools because then I can intersect those sets. And it could happen that I get just a single element. Okay? And in fact, and that's what that's what you do when you're overlapping. So let's just quickly look at this example. Here, if I look at the joint irreducibles under this element, well, I have this purple guy, so that's this purple. I have this blue guy right here, because that's blue. And I have this orange guy right here, because that's orange. Okay, so these are the three colors that live below that guy, the three joint irreducibles. And now, if I look at the meteor reducibles above this guy, well, you can check, like, I have the yellow here. I have the yellow here. I have this guy, which is green. I have orange somewhere, probably here. And red. And the common intersection is orange. And that's why I got an orange color there. Okay. So this unique pairing actually lets you sort of, sometimes lets you color the edges, lets you label them by joining irreducibles. And in fact, it turns out that both semi-distributive and trim lattices. Both semi-distributive and trim lattices are overlapping. That's sort of the point. So, this fancy way of doing minimums and all in these two different ways, it was actually no, no, they were just overlapping. This just works generically. And so, well, it turns out that compatibly dismantleable lattices are also overlapping. So, I can't tell you like a fancy way of, you know, of taking a minimal element this way or JI, but they are overlapping. So, I can just assign colors to the edges, and that just works. And even better, just as with the semi-distributive and the trim lattices, our edge labels actually. And the trim lattices, our edge labels actually specify the elements. So that is to say, if I look at the colors that are pointing down out of an element, then I can take their join and I'll get back the elements. And conversely, if I take the meat of the kappa of the up the labels that are sticking up, the colors of the labels sticking up, then I get X again. So actually, the down labels and the up labels actually characterize the elements. And the up labels actually characterize the elements of the lattice, which is really nice if you've played with trim and semi-distributed lattices. And it's starting to sound an awful lot like this canonical join representation stuff. However, well, I'm still not completely happy because intervals and compatibly dismantled lattices are not necessarily compatibly dismantleable. And I would really like them to be because that statement is true in both semi-idistative and trim lattices. So we should get that one too. Like sort of, right, we're trying to find a common generalization. Trying to find a common generalization so like you can just work in our framework instead of working in the framework of trim or the framework of semi-distributive and prove it separately, just work in our framework. And then, and then, okay, so we need to, we need to, um, we need one more axiom. And so let's identify what trim and semi-distributive lattices have in common. And it's kind of a canonical joint representation. Okay, so I'm supposed to explain the origin of Orstein Orr. Yeah, so Rhoda apparently was taking his class in 1954 at 8 a.m. with 1954 at 8 a.m. with one other student. And I guess Or like opened the class by saying, I think class theory has played out, which is a little depressing, I guess. Okay, so canonical joint representation. So the way that I'm going to do that is as follows. So I'm going to define this directed Galois graph. Okay, and so the way it works is the vertices are going to be the joint irreducible elements, and the edges are going to be defined by, well, a joint irreducible points to another one if. Reducible points to another one if this joint irreducible is not less than or equal to the corresponding meteor reducible over here. Okay, let's do an example. So I have an arrow that goes from green to purple here, because if you look at the element that has the green sticking down out of it, it is not less than or equal to the element with the purple sticking up out of it. Or I have an arrow from blue to green because if I look at the element that has blue sticking down, then it is not less than or equal to the element. Then it is not less than or equal to the element that has green sticking up. But I don't have an arrow from blue to purple, because if I look at the element with blue sticking down, then it's actually, well, it is less than or equal to the element with purple sticking up because it is equal to. Okay, great. So this is how you define this Galagraph. It's got a lot of magical properties. It's a specialization of Markowski's posted of irreducibles. And so here's the statement. Here's how I want to. So, here's the statement. Here's how I want to think about the canonical join representations from semi-distributive lattices. So, if I look at the set of all independent sets in my Galois graph, then it turns out that if L is semi-distributive or trim, then the map that takes an element of the lattice to its down labels, or the map that takes the element X to the set of its up labels, these are bijections between the lattice and the independent sets inside of the Galois graph. So, in particular, this is sort of giving you a reason. So, in particular, this is sort of giving you a reason for why row motion exists. Because, well, I could either think of an element as being down or as an independent set as being the downset of some element, or I could think of the independent set as being the upset of some element. And that's sort of an explanation for why remotion is existing. And now we'll finally come to, so having built that in, let's now define semi-distrim. I'm supposed to explain why all Latisters moved to Hawaii. Well, they didn't. That's a lie. They didn't. That's a lie, as it turns out. But perhaps you can read some history in algebra and lattices in Hawaii, a conference in honor of Ralph Fries, William Lamp, and JB Nation. Okay, so here's our final, here's our definition of semi-district. So that is a semi-district if it's compatibly dismantlable. Remember that the translation was that you can prove things with that. Okay, you can recursively decompose it and it's compatible with the colors. And if the down the down. Um, the downs, the down labels and the up labels are independent sets, always independent sets. Okay, doesn't have to be, but if we're going to force them to be independent sets, okay. And now we get some theorems out of just from this from this additional hypothesis that down and ups are independent sets, we get some theorems. So the theorems now are products and intervals of semi-district lattices are now again semi-district. Okay. Nathan Reading says that he's ready to move to Hawaii. So not but not sub-lattices. But not sub-lattices. We have that counterexample with that trim lattice, and trim lattices are a semi-distrim. So and then we have another theorem. So the order complex of a semi-district lattice is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere. And now let's get to what we really wanted, which was row motion. And so here's the theorem. Even though I just imposed, I just required that I land, the down, the down and the ups land in independent sets. Actually, it turns out that they're bijections to the set of independent sets of the Galois graph. The set of independent sets of the Galois graph. And so now we can define row motion, where you just define row motion by thinking of a down set as an upset, and you win. Okay, so let's take a look at that. Well, no, first let me explain. Let me show you. So the down and up are bijection. So here's the Galois graph of this thing, which was my, which was my first example of a lattice, which was semi-district, but not trim and not semi-distributive. And you can check that indeed, like, for example, if I look at green and purple, green and purple is an independent. Purple, green and purple is an independent set. Okay. But red paired with anything is not an independent set because, well, it doesn't. Okay. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? So good. And then to compute row motion, so let's see. So A, A has nothing going down. So that goes to nothing going up goes to B. B has blue and yellow going down. So that goes to C, which has blue and yellow going up. And then it's got purple down. So purple up is D, and then red down goes to E, and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. And that's how you can compute row motion. So you can define it now. Wonderful. And I feel like I'm not saying something. Okay. We also have the same relationship between pop stacking and row motion. So if you do the pop down, then that's the same thing as meeting with the row motion, which is kind of cool. So for example, here, F, so if I look at its row motion, I'm looking for blue down, so it's going to be blue. It's row motion. I'm looking for blue down, so it's gonna be blue up. So F goes to G. Oh, yes, that's why I named them that way. And if I meet those two guys, then I get down to C. And indeed, that is the pop because this is the maximal face that F belongs to. It's got only one cover. Okay, and I guess I could say something about this. Well, so in terms of these independent sets, you can actually characterize now, like the image of pop, the size of the image of pop. You can characterize when row motion actually goes down, and it's actually. Motion actually goes down. And it's actually in terms of these dominating independent sets in the Galois graph. And a dominating independent set is every vertex has to be in the independent set or adjacent to an independent set. So you can actually very quickly compute like the size of POP without actually generating an entire lattice, which is nice. And so, right, right. So we had introduced this dramatic narrative tension at the beginning, these two schools that Uh, these two schools that didn't speak to each other, um, and now finally they can come back together and uh unite under the common heading of uh of semi-distribut lattices. Uh, and thank you. Well, let's thank Nathan for his talk. Any questions for Nathan? Yeah, I have a question. So you said that these things are spheres. Are they the order complexes are spheres? Are they nice spheres? Like, are they shellable? Or can you get some of the weirder? Weirder, like those knotted spheres, for example. I'm actually not sure if they're shellable. I mean, you'd guess that the natural labeling on them would be EL shellable, but is this even true for semi-distributive? It's not, right? Okay, so then no, just no, I guess is the answer. Emily Barnard is shaking her head. So thank you, Emily, for answering that question. Okay, cool. Thanks. Do you have any natural families of posets that are semi-distrim but not semi-distributive or trim? I guess that's sort of an open problem. Yeah, I would say that it would be nice to have some nice stuff, you know, infinite interesting families of really, you know, yeah, of naturally occurring such objects. And Noga asked me the same question a few hours ago. It's a pretty reasonable question. Yeah. Isn't there some story about somebody defined like a really remarkable family of like Riemannian manifolds and proved all these properties about them, but then eventually they were all spheres or something. And yeah, of course, you're not in that situation because you have some examples already. Well, I have a Well, I have a sort of a question. So, you've got this characterization of when remote can happen in terms of this model using independent sets. And to the extent that you can do that, you should be able to get a piecewise linear lift because an independent set can be characterized in terms of just equations and inequalities involving numbers. So, in the case of trim lattices, or more generally for independence posets, I do know how to do this. That's, I do know how to do this. I have not written it up, but it is possible. The trouble is that I don't know how to do local flips or toggles on semi-distributive lattices or semi-distributed lattices. I mean, you can try various things. Like it kind of looks like you put a couple trim lattices together or something, but the trim lattices really come with a nice sort of orientation that lets you define flips and that doesn't. Define flips, and that doesn't work in semi-structured lattices that I know of. Well, for piecewise linear remotion, you don't need to use toggles. You can just use sort of an analog of the transfer map approach. But I don't know if that's going to carry over here. Going back to Alex's question, can you tell when it's contractible and when it's especially? And when it's this year, do you have some kind of a sense if the if the top element I think is a join of atoms, I think is the condition for when you get contractible? Okay. Thank you. Have you thought? Have you thought about if your class is a variety? Is it obviously not a variety? Right, it's not a variety because it contains that counterexample of that trim lattice that contained as a sub-lattice this non-trim lattice. Which is also not semi-district. Which is also not semi-district. It has a different number of, where is it? I see, yeah. Yeah, yeah, here we go. I see, yeah. Yeah, here we go. It doesn't have the same number of joint independent wallets, for example. Nathan, I'd like to read your book on the history of lattice theory. No, I'm not a lattice theorist or a historian of lattice theory. So, are we doing breakout rooms? Well, first, let's thank Nathan again for fabulous talk.
