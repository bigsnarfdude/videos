Thank you very much for having me here. And thank you. This is a little change of paste, a little different subject. So this is a based on showing work with feature travel. And so then we display a little one. We want we do. So Epestante for the local kinetic field and the sh is a reductive anchor. share is uh reductive and shape that you put over there so you can think of shear than that and so you look at the magnet 4 group it's a complex group if you don't think there is a bigger and if the gene was s and there would be the pglf for example and we consider the x points of the loop gene and in the real case the representations that play a role The representations that play a role are the category of at least more representations for the living compleximal character. And if the case, we restrict and draw attention to those with unique potential sphere support. So in that case, the draft group is a page with two bases, the irreducibles and the standard. And in both cases, there is a parallel. important cases there is a parameter set that parametrizes both the issue and the standard modulus so we call p inst for the install parameters that index is both the standards and reduces so then since you have two bases there is a change of basis matrix you can decompose the the standard as a sum of standard as a sum of irreducibles and the filters that are talking about are the coefficients in the coefficients n when the filter is the real numbers the parameter set is introduced by alan barbersh and poker in the pi adding case because of the restrictions of the set of representations that they are considering so you can think is the mean numbers keeps Conclanted keeps the parameter set. So, naively speaking, and I'm going to say a little more what this phase is for. So, naively speaking, the problem is like this. Try to see if there is a match, a map between the parameter space for EPM for the real numbers, and that should match it. That geometric matching is possible to get matching in such a way that we can express the multiplicity numbers for the pianic case in terms of the multiplicity of introduces in the standard in the shared case. In the shared case, these numbers that will be cast and loosely column for the units and add those problems. Then we add those problems and compute the problems, and we can give them out to you. Okay, okay, so this is the outline. So I'm going to do the ingredients, but I try to give any idea that is because of the briefness, what it will be. So, what we mean by the parameter space or the ADB parameter space, briefly. Space briefly, we do an analogous statement for QPIN. Then I will explain some motivating examples. One of the examples is an example in 83 by Servinsky and a previous example in 2012 that treat the case of GNN by Chobataro and Trato. And finally, I will explain what I Finally, I will explain what are the main results that we achieved with the beta. The conclusion is that there is a strong geometric connection between these parameter spaces that allow us, in many cases, that include classical split groups, to relate the gas and look at polynomials that give us the multiplicities. The emphasis of the talk is going to try to give to explain what To give to explain what we're doing, it does in two basic examples that are easy examples. And then I want to make it very clear what are the techniques that we use. And I will end the talk by telling you what are the things that we can achieve and what are the needs of the results. So that's the plan. In the real case, I start with a function. I start with a functional on the carton that I think of as a semi-simple element for the lambda pure carton. So if I have a semi-simple element, I can do x of 2 phi i lambda. In order to simplify this position, I'm going to assume that lambda is integral and is real. So in that case, if I do the centralizer of x to pi lambda, I just didn't change the loop, I just say hi hat. But observe that here, this is my group, the centralizer of x to pi lambda. If I plot it, this in this group is an involution, and I can look at the fixed points of the involution and then get she hat. Well, okay. This k hat actually is fixed in a real form. On the other hand, On the other hand, this element in lambda viewed in H hat is semi-simple. So that means that it will act semi-simply in G hat, and I can think of eigen space the composition. It's easy to go. The eigenvalues are going to be integers. So I get g hat as a sum of eigen spaces. And I can look at the sum of non-negative eigen spaces and I get a parabolic. Spaces, and I get the parabolic subgroup. Okay, and here it comes the geometry. Once I have a parabolic subgroup, I can get the conjugates of that parabolic, I can get a generalized flat value. So I have a group and I have a generalized flat variety, and I can look at this in this moment. Okay, that is the Adam Barber Logan geometric space. So let's face once that I fix the real form, okay? And once I chose integral parameter one. Excuse me, what is the impact of assumption of real infinitesimal character? Yes, that is going to simplify quite a bit. But this particular slide doesn't integral, yes. So real form is real form of. Everything is G check. All the genomic representations in labeling is in the G side. But all the genomics in the G check side. I'm going to be more explicit. Let me keep on going to be more. So then, so looking at the parameters, so the complete parameter space is what? Parameter space is what? Is the shape of any local system in this geometric space? And so I have this geometric space and the complete parameter space in the Adam-Balversion Power are the Xi-equivariant local system on this space. Now we are doing geometry in the Xi-hand side. We can talk about perverse shift, we can talk about constructible shift. Perverse shifts can be written instead of contractible shifts. Be written in stem of contractable shift, and what Adam, Barbos, and Bogan proved is that these coefficients are exactly up to assign the multiplicity of the reduced representation in terms of the standards. So the representation in the C side are parametrized by this object in the C hat side. And the multiplicity multiplicity of issue usable in terms of the standards are the determined capture totally. Then been captured completely by the geometry. So, I'm here making a showcase for geometry. Okay, so these matrixities are given by the integers that appear in the decomposition of perverses in terms of constructible shift. Okay, so now look at the nature of the space. She has orbit in this space one-to-one correspondent with k. them with k half all in the generalized black so local she equivalent she had equivalent local system in this space but in one-to-one correspondence with k half equivalent local system in this generalized flat parallel so at one the conclusion is that the geometric objects that parameterize the standard and representation are just Are just a pair of k orbits in a similar class and a local system of k orbits. That's the conclusion in the real case. And then this geometry controls the composition numbers. In the PR case, so I take F is QP and K is the result. And there is a map of Garrod groups with the With a kernel, and inside the galax group, I have a dense sibling subgroup generated by the probes. The pre-image is the baryonic group. And one considers the language parameters, which are homomorphisms between the bio-democrat into the extended dual group that satisfies various conditions, in particular. conditions in particular if i restrict this map to the very loop the image consists of seven simple elements and the assumption that we make is that we are looking at unshamified parameters that means that it's trivial in this on the sampling subgroup okay so in this case since the image under the Image under the Langlands parameter of the Bay group is semi-simple. So the image of the provenius, the provenius will determine a semi-simple automorphism in G-hat. And once again, in G-hat, I can write it as a decomposition of eigen spaces. And so we look at one in Paris. This should be, we can normalize it. So the eigen space is the eigen space for minus one. Space for minus one. We look at the fixed points at the fixed center of the space of the floorbinius. This is the L group. And the L acts to find many orbits in this eigen space. And we can fix this in this module now, g hat, etc, gamma, and she gamma minus one. And observe that I'm presenting the parameter spaces in a way. In a way that is analogous to those of Adam Barnes and Bolton parameter space. So, here in the Adam in the shield case, the geometry will k orbit in the generalized flat. In this setting, for unsandified parameters, the geometry is controlled by this L orbit in G hat minus 1. So, going back again to the naive question is, so I said that we want to relate parameter spaces in a smart way, if possible, in such a way that these multiplicity numbers can be catched and they can be compared. And so we try to translate the question to a geometrical question. And in the PAB case, this parametrization comes by following lost work and the Hecke as we look at this how we get this orbit. So on the Pian case, the pyranical space are going to be some L orbit in some machines vector space and some line bundle. Space and some line bango in the real k serviced orbit in a generalized track and some dime bango. Is there a way to relate these orbits so they respect orbit closure inclusion and that allows us to compare multiplicity polynomials and these multiplicities are given by geometry and all the calculations uh translation perversions. Traditional permissions, can we use the geometry to compare? That's the question. And so, let me try to make these things more tangible by presenting the problem in very concrete easy examples. So, the first ingredients will be Xie and take number to be four. So, then the central, and it thinks that the centralizer of this number is just the tolls. The emergency is just the toll. So this is the row. So the grading, the G minus one, the G1 is just above the. So if I represent G and N as n times n matrices, the G1 is just this above the diagonal. Summa minus 1 are this start below the diagonal. So 2 minus 1 is the space of the space of the truth vector for the negative of the simple truths. And the T orbit are just given by subset of simple fields. And orbit inclusion, an orbit is including the closure of another one if the subsets are included. Easy. And all these orbits are smooth. We have two to the front of those orbits. And when you have a smoothness, then the polynomial is order zero or one. That is easy. So the question will be the worst. Will be the worst, and we get two to the round G Ln over two, G Ln minus n over two orbit, k orbit in the generalized in the full flag in this case, that has the same behaviors that the orbit closes related, they are smooth in the relative order, and they are related to this particular knowledge. And if you were in Queen's conference, so Conference, so you might have heard me talk about this in that conference, but now you have not heard me talk about that. So you are in a G and G check is no, in this case G and C check and they say yes, yes in this case she is secret to she check and this and this is for example what's celebrating. Sample what Selewinski did, or what Trava Chobataro did, but you cannot see the difference. Yes. Okay, so again, since I want to simplify the exposition, I chose this example, but I might illustrate some things. So the next example, example two, is not much more sophisticated, just allowed in your lambda some numbers to be the same. So the parameter is singular. It's not regular anymore, true. So, so here the difference is I'm taking A1, A1, A1. So, for example, if you evaluate lambda in E1 minus E2, you get zero. Okay, so that means when you look at the stabilizer of this lambda, the L gamma, you get a C L N 1, a G L N 2, C L N K. Okay, now the C minus, so then you can look at these vector spaces, spanned at the standard basis, for example, from E1 to El minus 1 and. From E1 to El minus 1 are the standard rebases in CNN and look at the space of V1, V2, etc. G minus 1 can be viewed as a quiver, as the sum of homomorphisms from V1 to V2, V2 to V3, etc. And then it's very well known. I mean, there's the n orbit in G minus 1. So what you do, so good to know what orbits are that we have to match with K orbits, true? With K orbits, so we have to know how to touch them, how to think of them. So, the G minus one will consider a set of homomorphisms, a family of homomorphisms. And if I take these linear maps, A1 is the matrix, the representative homomorphism, V1 to V2, A2 from V2 to V3, etc. When you compose them, you get Compose them, you get you take a few of them, consecutive ones, and compute them, then you get an homomorphism from Vi to Vj, right? And look at the rank of that homomorphism. So for each I and J, you get a number, which is the linear rank of the composition, then you get the matrix. And those matrices parametrize the L orbits in G minus one. So the question is again, can we? Can we get GLP cross GLQ orbits in the generalized flag determined by lambda that matches respectively with inclusion these L orbit in such a way that the cattle polynomials match? Okay, this is the same question as before, but we are allowing the more technical issues. This is allowing parameters to be seen with. Allow parameters to be seen. We are not talking about the full flag, now it's changed as true changes as flag. So these problems are not new. So the first instance of the problem was addressed by Servinsky in 1983. And in his setting, he was working on the category of parabolic verbal modules. Verbal modules, and they are the such representations. The standards are parametrized by the concept of the value, and they are the relative custom polynomials and the traditional customers polynomials. The P omega. And then in this case, you look at the a lander, like the one in the example two, the same L blender, which is the product of the. Which is the product of the G and acting on G minus one. And in this setting, there is some composition numbers that come from the geometry. And he was able to attach to these L orbits p orbits in the generalized platform, generalized sugar variables, let's say, and then show that the polynomials that come from the L the Jones Princia in this one. L the John Expression minus one corresponds is exactly the value of the Cassandra polynomials evaluated. In this case, he did it, evaluated the one, which is the values that Librum is. And how did he achieve this? Well, he remembered that the L orbits are given by some equivers that have to do with homomorphism from such spaces V1, V2, VK. Agree? Agree. So from that parameter, from those spaces, he built a flag in the more naive of the ways. The flag, the first space is V1, the second space is V1 plus V2, the third space V1 plus V2 plus V3. And then he wants them to match orbits and generize sugar by P orbits and the full flag. And so he said, what if I... And so he said, what if I look at all the flags with the property that the i, the space contains the vi minus k of this fixed flag. And he showed that that is the closure of a single orbit, of a single p orbit. And then, as the closure of a single p orbit, there is a union of other p orbits parameters. by the certain possessor of the diet. And as when you look at the sugar but argades and you try to describe sugar varieties, usually you describe it by counting the dimension of certain intersections through the same here. So can we see what are the smaller orbits? Well, he described it in terms of flux and the intersection with the fixed flux. The fixed lab and here's the dimensions are given by the same numbers that parametrize the L orbit in C minus Y. This is the Frank of the compositions. So you have the two options parametrized by the same matrix, okay, the Frank matrix. So that gave them the bisection between the orbiting C minus one and the P orbit in G minus. And the p-orbit inch which are contained in this big orbit. So they are all parametrized by this matrix of the R I shape, which is the rank of the compositions of the linear maps. Okay, so and then from there, very nice, he has a match of geometric objects, orbits. How did he get to compare the polynomials? And again, some techniques, some standard. Some standard techniques. So you get a sugar variety, the crowd, sugar variety, a full choice. And inside it, he's got a side variety that admits a tubular label that collapses to it and is dense. So the nice thing about having something dense is that if you have a perfect shift in a space and a dense space, well, because A dense space, well, because of perversity will retrieve and will enlarge, and you get the same shape room. So you didn't change anything to go to the dense state. But once you have a cubular neighborhood, which is isomorphic to an induced bundle, all the properties of perversity in the induced bundle corresponds to those in the fiber, and you don't lose any of them. That's the key idea here. So that is what he did. So, that is what he did. So, he got a sub-variety, which is also stratified by the intersection of the tubular varieties, and you need a tubular neighborhood that collapses so the geometry is not lost. And this standard, so you got this standard flat, and then what is the variety? Well, she just took the matrix, and she minus one. Took the matrix in G minus one, one percent, activism, and he got a variety and give you a standard matrix and then he got the only one. Sorry. In your previous slide, you said, Yeah, categoristic actually for one point, but you're saying cataloging also agree at once. Okay, at once. I think he came in at once. I think he claim it at one, but the argument will make the polynomials at the limit. I see. Because the market visit is just at one. So based on this example, let me tell you what is the classic just in case I overrun and you will know what I Overrun, and you will know what I do because I will cut it into slices and then I will do it in some examples. So, here's what we do: we have G hat is area spaces. We choose one area space, G minus one. G0, G hat zero is the diagram of my L hat. It acts with finitely any order than G minus one. And on the other turn, And on the other turn, you have the same venerized flat, and I have K acting also with finite many orbits. So the first thing what we do, we try to define a map from G minus one to the generalized flat that is L equivariant, equivalent for this field. And we try to get this map in such a way that this respect orbit closure inclusions. In particular, the zero orbit in the The left hand side should color will make it correspond to a cross orbit in the generalized graph. Once that we have a map, put L, L, the things are set up so that this group L is the subgroup of K hat. So once that we have a map on the orbit, that immediately induces a map between component groups, the centralized Between component groups. The centralized L is contained in the centralized hypergene CH. And so we have a map of component groups. Local systems, local systems of orbits are totally determined by this redistribution representation of component groups. So if we have a map from the orbits, it induces a map on component groups. That gives us total control on local systems and immediately. systems and immediately we get a map on the geometry set the measurement with parameter set right what do we want of this map so essentially we find the VB tape with an identific approach so there is an orbit since the orbit closure inclusion is respected there is an orbit which is the largest one that I call Qmax and what we do is inside the closure of Qmax The closure of humans, we get savariety. The savariety, we take an image of G minus one and we get the parabolic intersection K act on it. Okay, so we get the G minus one and we flip it with the parabolic intersection K. So that gives us an open dense set inside the maximum ordinance. So we show that this That this essentially we have epsilon g minus one is like a sub variety in the cumulative, in the maximal orbit, then we match it to the right and to the left, then by intersection k, to get that tubular neighborhood. So this should be the tubular neighborhood in cellular V of E. Okay? And this is the sati 5 space by L orbits that we want to hear from the K orbits. And we showed that this tube is really isomorphic to an induced bundle. Once that you have that, everything matches perfectly. It doesn't look like polynomials match. Of course, polynomials attached to one match. And if you want to go and look at characteristic cycle and multiplicity in the characteristic cycle, they also match. So that's the strategy. Okay. This was addressed by Chobatano and Trapa in 2012 in the CLN case, okay, and in the example, what I call my example two. And they, of course, since the G card is the same for them. And they use a Levinsky map essentially. Essentially, so they map to consider the max epsilon that I was telling you, how to put G minus one inside the generalized flag, they considered essentially what Zelominsky does, the identity plus the matrix acting in the parallelics of algebra. And it worked. And then Peter told me, why don't we realize this? And I said, why? And I said, why? How do I make this work in other groups? Because A is a matrix. And then I said, well, everything is linear algebra. So let's go slowly. And let's look at the small example. So this X, this matrix X is just a combination of these blue stars. And these are linear combination matrix EI. Linear community matrix EI, I minus 1, true, E21, E32. And they are looking at 1 plus X. But look, if I multiply E21 with E31, I get 0. Agree? If I multiply E32 in that order with E43, I get 0. If I reverse the order, my unlucky true. My unlucky group. So that means that one plus x, I can write it as a product of things: one plus the combination of e to dv times one plus e to e to because otherwise the other products disappear. Ah, and said, well, this maybe is x of a2 e to one x. And now that I have x, I'm a little more happy because I can look, x is already in a group true, not in a matrix. Okay, so we have a lot of x and x in certain order. So, nice, maybe there is an iteration here. Okay, so and that's it. So, I have my orbit, which is the t a combination of some of these root vectors. Each of the root vectors is in some is a root vector for some It's a fruit vector for some negative simple fruit, non-compared simple fruits. So, if I have one fruit, I can look at the parabolic Sabal sugar whose level is generated by the shear 2. Okay. For each of the fruit, I can take a parabolic. And if I have, and remember what the new effect is generated orbits. What I have to do is generate k orbits. I can start with a closed k orbit and then I want that orbit of one more dimension, another more dimension, until I get the maximum dimension. So I can do that step by the cooling, cooling, one step at a time. So I take a shima t, I project on shima parabolic. If I take a k already here, I project it, I project back. Okay, and it's in my room, this single non-component. In my route, this seems non-compact when I project back. I do the projection projection back. I am guaranteed that in that set of orbits, there is going to be an open orbit of one more dimension than the one I started with. Okay, that is well known. So that means that I can look at an iterated bundle. So I can, and this iteration means statement use orbit, project, project file, you get an orbit of one more. You get an orbit of one more dimension. When you are done, project, project, that and give you a second more dimension, etc. So that is the X was the image of an iterative bundle. So if I produce an iterative bundle, this matrix was acted by these elements in the base model. This is a proper map projected and is the generically finite map. So the C minus one is C. C minus one is sit by taking the exercise into these parabolics and then take the operator. And this is a combination, an iteration of this process or project project back. And since this is proper, it's the closure of one object. And that is my big order. And take less of this projection, and you get the other payorities inside it. Okay? And that is the And that is the interpretation of the Shobataro Trata and this works and this makes the life work in the classical cases and more general. And what I explained was in the past. So this is a small slice that I don't have the time to go into this detail, but the message that I want to give is that That I want to give is that in the previous example, I was kind of cheating because in the GNN case, there are no local systems, so life was easy. But in the FTM, for example, you have to deal with local systems. And then when you see in the previous slides, if I gave you time to think, you would have asked me, here there is an order. You have P alpha one, P. What if you switch the order? And that's the order matters. True, that's natural. That's natural to ask. Well, the order, for example, in this, here I'm using the Yamamotus parametrization of K orbit in the purple flap. It doesn't matter. There is a nice way to parametrize k-orders by what is called clams. And these arrows tells me you can act from a close orbit, actually do a Cayley transform, you get an orbit of larger or larger dimension, one more dimension, and this is the orbit closure inclusion. And this is the orbit closure inclusion here, also from Yamamotus. So the idea is that if I start with a closed orbit and I do, I have an SP4, I have a short shoot and a long shoot. Beta is my long shoot. So I can do the iterative under with a shoot, short first or long first. If I go from the close orbit and I produce an order, the long shoot first and then the short shoot later, I get Fruit later, I get into this order Q maps. Okay, but if I do the other orbit, I do alpha first and beta, I get another orbit. In one order, this k orbit has two local systems, but in the other order, this one only has one local system. And in the n orbits, the maximal orbit should have two local systems. Local systems. So that means that the order matters. And so there is a preferred order where you, if you want to match the local systems. Otherwise, you get partial match, but not total match. So the order matters. But anyway. Okay, so I don't have how much more time we have. A few more minutes, but two, three more minutes. Two? Okay, good. Okay, good. So, then in the triangular case, so for instance, the second example was a triangular case, and instead of having a diagonal matrix, I have a block diagonal matrix. And so, how do we get the construction? Okay, and this is an adaptation of the regular case essentially. So, suppose that in this situation, so I can look at flat parabolics. So, I have this parabolic with the block diagonals here. Block diagonals here. I can get a new parabolic by gluing these two together and getting a shield N1 plus N2. That's one parabolic. Okay, and this is the levy of one parabolic. So this parabolic, this new parabolic, let me call it P1 intersection P, has this levy. So I have a new L1 here of a parabolic P1, and if L. P1. And if L1 intersection P is a parabolic for my L1, okay, and then I can get the second parabolic by doing the second and the third one. I can get a collection of a minimal set of parabolic subgroups that contain P. And with the property that this piece is, this L L I, flattened L i, is giving this U1, U2, U3, which sun is. U2, U3, which sun is human as one. So it's kind of trying to look at what happened in the regular case and use the same technique straight in the singular case. So before I have the stars, I'm going to select the star by this U1, U2, U3. And again, I can get these parabolics. Again, I can do iterative handler. I can change it right in the template case. And again, things work and the polynomial. Things work and the polynomials match. We compare some of these computations with some computations geometric. There are also many examples. The example two can be generalized whenever I have a, my Udanta is such I have a parabolic when I can get this set of minimal set of parabolic that contains set. That one drains it. And essentially, in this setting, I'm naming I'm going to fast observe that here. I get some small example where I have a subgroup, GLN1 plus GLN2, and I have a parabolic. And if you forget about the rest and just think of this situation, this is like an abelian case of parabolic. In all the classical case, when you look at this construction here, you get an abelian case or two-step. An abelian case or two-step nilipotent case, and you can think that this construction is a generalization and induction from the maximal parabolic flow, but a rivalian or two-step nilipotent case. And I am finishing up by telling you the bad news. This construction doesn't handle all maximum parabolics. There is a very interesting example in Chavatello's computation in the type F4. Of in the type F4, which I spent months of my life trying to match, and I am unable to do it. This is a case of a maximal parabolic which is not to stand without it. And I don't know how to adapt these ideas to something that example. The problem is that in the epiatic case, when you look at representation of ki axetam, the component groups are much more interesting than for chaortics, and there are much more different local systems. Much more different local systems, and then you cannot do a one-to-one match. You might need to be much smarter and not to smart enough. Okay, that's it.
