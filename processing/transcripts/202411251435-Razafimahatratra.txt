Intersection. And this is joint work with Karen Marm, a PhD supervisor from the University of Regina and Papua Speaker from University of Milan at Dakota. I can't imagine where that was. Yeah, can't skip away. So, well, so I'm going to talk about an open problem that was still open and it's from a PhD thesis. So in 2019, this was the In 2019, this was the project that I kind of worked on. So it's the second project. So, which graphs can be the range of graphs? And I'm going to talk about, I'm going to define what's the range of graphs, of course. And then COVID happened sometimes in 2020. And I think in the spring of 2020, this paper of Lee Song and Lupankangi. By Mupan Tangi. Titled Erdos Korada Problems for Permutation Group appeared on the archive. And so they considered something that was kind of new back then, considering these groups with a large, well, far from having the Erdos Corrada property. And they had some conjectures and some open problems there. And we found some counterexamples to one of the conjectures. Examples to one of the conjectures, and this basically led to all of the things that I'm going to talk about here today. So, let me start with some definitions, of course. So, G here is not going to be a graph. It's going to be a transitive group. So, G is a finite transitive group. So, it is a subgroup of the symmetric group on a set omega that is finite. And if I take And if I take a subset f of g, then I'm going to call that intersecting for any two elements that I take inside, they're always going to agree on some element of omega. And so I guess we need to recall what's a derangement. So if I give you a finite transitive group, then what's a derangement? It is a fixed point-free permutation, so permutation without. So, permutation without a fixed point, and I'm gonna call this G of G in a set of all of these fixed point-free permutations. And so, the derangement graph of my transitive group G is the KD graph of G with connection set equal to the set of all derangements. And so, this is the graph whose vertex set is this G and two group elements in G. And two group elements in G are adjacent if and only if. Basically, their ratio is an arrangement. So if it's x and y, then x times y inverse is a fixed point free permutation. And so the goal is to study basically the largest intersecting set sitting in your transitive group. So why do we need this derangement graph? This is basically like in the classical In the classical Erdos Corrado type, the Erdos Corrado theorem, you use Knesser graphs to model the intersecting set inside. I mean, here, we use the Turing graph. So, if I take a subset F of G, and that is intersecting if and only if it is an independent set. But I'm going to use the terminology Coplik in this little talk in my derangment graph gamma G. So, for instance, if you look So for instance, if you look at the symmetric group on three, for instance, then this is what the derangement graph looks like. So you have your identity element. It is adjacent to all of the derangement, of course, because my connection set here is the set of all derangement, which are the three cycles. If I take two transposition, and so our transposition is, of course, self-inverse, so if I multiply by any two. Filter, so if I multiply any two, I'm gonna have a three-cycle and dotted arrangement, so there is an egg in here. And so, this is how we get this graph. And the largest co-plique in here has size exactly two. In this case, this is obvious. And in general, for the symmetric group in its natural action on the set one up to n, it is n minus one factorial. And we have some interesting examples. Some interesting examples. So, if you look at the alternating group on 4, of course, it acts transitively on the set 1, 2, 3, 4, but you can also look at the induced action on the two subsets. There are six two subsets. And so you can embed the alternating group on four inside of the symmetric group on six. And this is what its derangement graph looks like. So this is a graph on twelve vertices and Vertices and yeah, we'll see later. I think this is this is wrong actually, but we'll see later. But this graph is kind of important. So back to the definition that Li Song and Pentangi introduced. So they basically wanted to measure how intersecting my your group is. My group is. So, if you are given a transitive group G, then they define the intersection density of your group G to be this rational number. So, this is the size of the largest coclicks in your derangement graph. This is your point stabilizer. So, this is everything in your proof G that fixes omega. So, that's the intersection density. And of course, you can see that this is always at. Can see that this is always at least one because this on its own is an intersecting set. So this ratio is always at least one. It can be bigger, as we will see now. And most of the research in this area, back before 2020, before the paper of Fredison and Pantangi, really focused on the transitive groups, where we have equality here. So, for instance, if you take a W transitive group, so that's a group that is. Group, so that's a group that is transitive, but with an additional property that it also acts transitively on the set of all pairs with distinct entries. So Mars, Spiger, and Thiet in 2016 showed that the intersection density of these groups, for instance, always equal to one. If the degree of your permutation group is a prime power, then Lisong and Pantangi independently. Independently, Yudurovich, Putna, Marushic and Miklevich in 2021 showed that the intersection density is also equal to one. So there are a lot of work in this area, basically focusing on intersection density being equal to one. And one of the first examples that you will encounter is, well, the example that we saw earlier, it's intersection density. Intersection density is equal to this thing and equal to 2 in this case. And another example is if you take your Peterson graph, you look at its automorphism group, it is the symmetric group on 5. And this alternating group on 5, this acts transitively and faithfully. And its intersection density is equal to 2. Okay, so this was the conjecture that was in Ragu's paper. So the conjecture that if you have a transitive group, then the intersection density is at most this square root of omega. And back then I was using a lot of, well, I'm still using Sage, but this is the screenshot from what I did basically. So if you look here, there is this graph on. There is this graph on 324 vertices. This is the size of the largest oak clicking side, 108. And this was basically the counterexample. So in the library of transitive groups, you said, and I think in GAP, it's the same. It is transitive group of degree 18 and number 142. So this will give you this intersection density. This intersection density, which is larger than the square root of the degree of the group. And one thing that was kind of interesting here is that the derangement graph of this particular group is a complete tripartite graph. And I'm going to come back to that later. But after finding this counter-example, we are kind of interested to look at the following. Look at the following. So, define transitive groups with large intersection densities, and fine transitive groups whose arrangement graphs are complete multipartite. So, that came from these complete tripartites here. And of course, we are dealing with the KD graphs here. So, if a KLI graph is a complete a complete tripartite, a complete k-partite graph, then it's going to be a strongly regular graph. Be a strongly regular graph, and its spectrum has to look like this. So, zero has to be one of its eigenvalues. So, basically, you go to your computer, check all of the eigenvalues of these deranged graphs, so three eigenvalues. One of them is zero, so you are basically holding on to a transitive group that has a complete k-parthy derangement graph. And after running everything on the same, Running everything on Sage, we also discovered two transitive groups of TQ30 that were like a counter-example to the conjecture. And then we talked about bipartite graphs. So this is the derangement graph of the symmetric group 1,2. It's kind of trivial, but it's the identity and the transposition. Entity and this transposition, so you just have an edge. And when we run our code, basically we couldn't find any other transitive group of degree, at least three, whose derangement graph is a bipartite graph. And so the natural question that we considered was this deretransitive group G with the property that this derangment graph is bipartite. By part time, and I think I got stuck on this for like about six months. But then came Pablo Spigat, and we were able to show that with the help of Pablo Spiga, so gamma of G is bipartite if and only if the degree of the group is less or equal to 2. And we even proved something that's stronger. So if the degree of your group is at least 3, Is at least three, then in fact, you can show that there is always a triangle inside of the triangular graph. And so, using some stuff about the click-o-click bound, so we managed to show in fact, well, it follows easily, in fact, that your intersection density, because of the existence of these triangles in a graph, is going to be at most the degree of the group divided by 3. And so, all the examples that I mentioned earlier, so this is the group that gave us a counter-example to the conjecture, and these are the two other groups of degree 30. And this is the alternating group on 4 with degree 6. All of these graphs have intersection density equal to these things, so they are kind of extremal in this case. Kind of extremal in this case that it attains this upper bound. And I think a lot of these groups are kind of special because the first one, most of them are subgroups of these affine groups. But with like these two of degree 30, for instance, these are on the action on the lines of the affine geometry, AG25 in this case. But this one, there is a cyclic code with this. There is a cyclic code with this parameter working in the background. And I don't know if, I guess, I'm not sure if this corresponds to some geometry caption. But one thing that we also noticed is that the derangement graph of all of these examples are complete tripartite graphs. And so far, we do not have any other example of a transitive group that attains this bound. This bound, the degree divided by 3. So, this is my first open question. So, are there more transitive groups such that the intersection density is this omega divided by 3? And as I mentioned earlier, the derangement graph of all of these four examples are complete tripartite. So, we don't even know if the following is true that If the following is true, that if the intersection density is equal to this, so if it attains this, then is it true that the derangement graph is a complete tripartite graph? Probably, but I don't have answer. And so if you want to talk about these problems, then we need to see something about complete k-par type derangement graphs in general. So these tend to So, these tend to give, as we saw earlier, like large intersection densities. And in particular, if you assume that your derangement graph is a complete k-par-type graph, then you can easily see that the intersection density of your group is going to be its degree divided by the k. And so you can characterize these groups as follows. So define this subgroup HG. Define this subgroup Hg, which is the subgroup generated by all the possible conjugates of a point stabilizer. It's not hard to see that this is a normal subgroup. And if you have, if this Hg is trivial, then you have no choice, but the group is regular and the derangement graph is a complete graph on this many vertices. Graph on this many vertices. When this is equal to G, we don't know anything. But if it is a proper subgroup, then a point stabilizer has to be contained in this. And so one consequence of this is that your group acts imprimitively on this set omega. So it has a gene variant partition that is a non-trivial gene variant partition preserved by the action of G. And so the characterization is as follows. And so the characterization is as follows. So gamma G is a complete k-par type graph if and only if Hg is well the index of Hg inside of G is equal to K. And when you look at the subgroup Hg that I defined earlier, which is generated by all of these elements, it is equal to itself. But basically the meaning of this is that you cannot create derangement inside of this group. Inside of this group, because these all have a fixed point, all the conjugate also have a fixed point. And if we go back to the example of the alternating group on 4 of degree 6, we can basically view it like this. So it is this semi-directed product with the client group with a Z3. Its point stabilizer is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 2, and the group HG is given by this. Hg is given by this. So this is the normal subgroup that I defined here, and its orbits are these guys, so 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6. And in general, if you have a complete tripartite derangement graph, then Hg will have three orbits that will look like this. And so, of course, this is kind of trivial, that you can always. Trivial, but you can always represent your graph in this way. So, this is the identity, which is like everything in HG, and then these two cosets. So, basically, I have a surjective homomorphism from G with the induced action of G on these three orbits, and that's going to be equal to cyclic group of order 3, but I also have a graph homomorphism from the derangement graph to this K3. This K3, but this is basically the Portium graph corresponding to this Hg in this case. But the thing that is kind of interesting in these four examples is that they are all related. So the four examples that we have, the first one was the alternating group of degree six. The other ones are of degree 18, and then two of them of degree 30. They are all related. They are all related. So basically, there is when you look at the Hg inside of these three examples, then there is a proper subgroup K that is also a normal subgroup of G and its index is 6 in this case. So basically the orbit of this K is going to be a refinement of well like the partition that you're going to get from this is like a refinement. This is like a refinement of the orbits of Hg, and basically this set 1, 2, 3 that we have here, you can divide it into 6 like this. And when you look at the action of the group G on this omega 1 up to 6, it is exactly the alternating group on 4. So they are somehow kind of kind of related. So the question that I have is, is this always true that if you have Is this always true that if you have a complete tripartite graph, the arrangement graph, then do you always have like are you always in this situation? So is there always this subgroup? And so basically you'll have that the induced action is the alternative group and for. And one thing that I also kind of like to be solved is the following question. So the motivation is from a recent paper of Fusari Freditali. Fusari, Freditali, and Spiga, which was just published, I think, earlier this year. So they showed that if you have a transitive group, that is a so-called heliatly transitive group, but this is basically a transitive group with, that admits a transitive minimal normal subgroup. So if you hold on to these kinds of groups, and if the derangement graph doesn't have And if the derangement graph doesn't have a clique of size four, then your degree is at most three. So from this, the question that's kind of interesting is that is there a group around G with the property that the intersection density is between these two numbers? So if you look at this. So if you look at this one, so the guys that we know that attain this band are all complete tripartite. In here, we have some examples that attain this one. And they are basically coming from some special types of groups. Well, an example of degree 12. So inside of this sematic group 111, this is a so-called elusive group. And if you look inside of this, you have this group AGL19. You have this group AGL19 and this the finite field F3 squared semi-direct product with Q8. These two give me this intersection density equal to the size of omega divided by 4. And all of these guys again are complete 4 apartheid in this case. So that's something that that's kind of interesting to see if there is To see if there is a group whose intersection density is between these two numbers. I guess that's probably what I wanted to talk about today. Any questions for me? Uh what's the fastest growth for which you have infinitely many examples? Like so when we go with three, Like so, omega over three, you only have finitely many. So I guess the conjecture is that uh there should be like uh an absolute constant somewhere such that like when you are below this you might have some infinite family and or this like you don't have anything but I think I don't know like would you have an example in your picture? I have each picture So, all those linear examples, that's all we get by many for each so far. But I guess the thing is that these ones with high intersection density, probably they correspond to some um th there is some like um very special combinatorial thing behind like a certificate, maybe a design, something like that. Maybe a design seems to affect that. But so far, we don't know anything. Video, those two groups of word 30. Yep. You gave their abstract. Yeah, I guess. I guess I just looked at the thing on Sage. So I guess the point stabilizer, I don't remember what's their order, but I guess that's something that's yeah. But they they act on like um affine lines basically of AG25. So you look at the you take AGL AGL to 5, and then they see it inside not the action on the vector space but on the line. Any other questions? Yep. So you mentioned that one of your groups was one transitive and also active. Was one transitive and also acted on the ordered pairs? No, unordered pairs, pardon me. Unordered pairs, right? Yep. Like, do you think that some of the higher-degree transitive groups are good places to look or bad places to look? I think probably like a good place. I think we have some results, but I guess it's kind of unrelated to this, but we take. We take we take basically the action on uh subsets, not not on these uh these guys. Yeah, I think that should be interesting. Thank you. There are no other questions.
