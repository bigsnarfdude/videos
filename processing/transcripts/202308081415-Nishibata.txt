So, uh first of all, thank you brothers Yaakong, Hong Ka and me for giving me this opportunity to also work here. I am very very happy to come here and to see friends within me I do not who are quite good uh you know with a program of all. you know, good problem of all. So, yeah I will just have to try that again. Then today I want to talk about the stability of very flexible stationary solutions. So he is uh uh contained some meta uh I then work with uh sport as well. Uh another university on new phone path. I think now we can uh try the keyword uh home as  Yes, so so uh solving uh the key to my screen. So let me talk about a key temple microphone. So first I want to look into the second mode equations, composed paper buttons, then compressible methods record, ultra or length. So I want to comment my program and also information you are making inside. Then begin and This is pretty. The Philippines also claim our lesser taken part. Then we talk to our property of this medicine. The architectural video of the rest of the world means more intelligence. That is one of my main topics today for to attach to this. Open for this waiting with every stage. Then this is done for smooth initial design. Then I'm this year we study the outer ball program. Then in 6.4, I will make an info program. That is. Then I start to auto program then. Then here I go to auto. And here I go about the large initial results. And to obtain this result, we need to use a system of tests in the larger coordinate system. By using this coordinate, we can get a quantized possibility of test. This is very important to get the energy test. Then we need this energy. We can also get the association that we can get. However, in this part, we need to have some. In this part, we need to assume special assumptions. Oh, I will put everywhere. Then this system of create on the so to a bit more piece in terms of situation of mass and this is the situation of. This is the situation of motion. Then usually it is over outside of the ball in the ball edge by space. So any space I need for. We will do something. Oh, I get ball. Then what is this? I mean the The key in place I would achieve but see the Xiao Park one and a key price and importance. Then, as you know, you are learning with the old picture, finally in the following. We study a simple solution. So uh how are we a function or a business or uh uh have the x uh draw origin. Roll the order given by simple body or head. Then we have new one, new and menu. Then putting this in part equations, we have this system of equations. Here you will call the question of media positions. For our programs, we need to describe we need to describe an initial and boundary condition. I will write the initial data by both of node and digital node. We assume that this function compiles to roll salt plus and digital plus as space r state variable r tends to inc. Also we describe one area of you. Why some confirm us with he names the name which are shaped with this name. We are shipping this now. So, yeah. The main role gets out. So, since for us, we call this program out of all programs. So, data are referred to by the this program, user key is positive. Does that mean infra programs? Then this one is not a very study, but this obviously is important to check if it is only far more multiple conditions. So for this program, one model condition on this study are sufficient for you for five centuries of this language. So we don't need any other boundary English. Oh, also uh can I uh DRT. Okay, we are seeing about these processes. So, also later with a construct of smart solutions, we need to achieve contributing condition of like this. Then, let me talk about spatial resolutions. I want to write down spatial solutions as we skip. Then, a spatial resolution means independent of time about time by a team we have. This book I think we have this ordinary pressure conditions. We use all this on R. So we are going to describe the same ordinary and powerful conditions as a group of equations. So in the low I will process across R, R and 2. Then all the same organizations. Then bring that group of this uh So this data we show our solution to the motionary equation with this robotic time compass to the stationary solution to the role function. That's about this one. Then before talking about my results, I wrote the mention of some direct results. First one is in founder program of three and a half true. So you know that some So, you know the sound group is so by R time flow C data solution Then he study the large initial data non-designable false Then he constructs a time flow resolution and he also get a partial association that means this knowledge. Also Martino other data also have different points. So this will show that high closure is role and time of interest to a face and research. These are totally or stationary to this is this is this this result is obtained by Professional Schmoto and Su. First integrating the authentication of the Pi over R pro with both sides of this month we have killer this one without kill the unit. Then it is apparent, taking all that to me with this. So we need to achieve our piece table should be z. So we need this condition. Then substituting this relations into a calculation of ordinary classification, we have this relations. Then we integrate with respect to R. With respect to R. We have different areas. This part just details because we have a differentiation ROS. Then using Dean simulations, we see that this function must be minus P of R surface R minus P of P surface. P the specific point. specific point uh then hence we have this relationship function we need to solve this relation for what uh for us rather than what then also this uh mass function from what to say this or any some operations uh how to Like that, uh we change it. So, also this only contains an integral part. So, six with a single declaration and integral operations. Then, by using a creation method, let's start with smaller small groups that need in this matrix. By using a creation method in this function space, when we are with the We need to make sure stationary. They are seen insulting at least about the bias more. Then stationary is long to this. We need to win this function. Moreover, insert the size by screen behavior. Here is F is the function form depending on inserting. The HMI is comparable. This is compound I. This way, sometimes I define this way. Then, before specific solution, we need to obtain the integration of theta r, eta r. What we need is theta, so this we know that theta statement is a pd here you can y. He is very visible. Then meant by the robot for us, he learned to buy himself. Then you drive that very part of the special resolution are part of the use. So this property is good in showing a value of special resolution. Okay, uh basically some of our class for the camera theta. PK was built by going far with a small possibility as high. Theta is a modulatory function. It sucks where it's detailed. Um this is the the chart for theta sub. So even for this decline such as our This already means that since integrated still in Azure, even though it has a solution to singular integral ordinary question. For example, uh someone ODD, if you detain any length or detail uh data. Of different layer things. So it is quite very useful. So I think this value is not enough. Then design the EW or TW, we have these defaults. Then these defaults play an essential role in showing the internet of state-marked use. So here, From here, the discovery change, small data. Then we assume those are part of some even positive form and those are based in the next. Let me suppose our supervisor is some children. The initial data satisfies these two conditions. So this is uh is uh say big telegraph. So this is more use at all. Completely sub constant uh kilograms. Then we have a five-global solution for new in this patch space or the same in the space and this is where it's then very good building like some case way of solution Or always invite to change uh facial actions. We are superb uh filming all we need to write this uh weighted uh uh weighted weight sorry. Uh this is very important for its phase. Here she opened phone stuff means the inventory of high alpha shoot. Then up here is outline of book. Uh if we uh use uh some uh table passwords of book. Okay so we uh we we uh we We use the IR social material space to control it in the United Arab Emirates. When they have different Chinese state data in 1920, then Bonnie went out to use 3D path without getting to convert the closure. In one corporate straight in the middle of the case, In one program phase, the mularian program, most of which are then we have the phrase one to mularian program, the paradigm program. Then, using a small program today, we can write a tenano with the field of shelter theory or equation. Then we have time to see the movie. With moving this part, we have the animal solution in Universal. Namely, for other teams, we have this solution in this part of the state. Therefore, then here we use the H1 interface because again we can get this last week. This is the right uh next slide. Then uh that's what I will talk about uh how to derive this. So we derive argumentation by defined for solution, the promotional equation of our space market solution. Then for the basic we write by four raw velocity by what we have done in 5. Then this satisfies these feasible regulations. This kind of time may sound familiar to us. Then, we have the additional order information why we do like this slightly like this. Since we put the order initiation for you, then this file is there. Then we define a test form if by this way. If five is wrong, is uh bound with this giving us. Then the red floor computation will give us an equation for uh n has equal times e. The equation is usually complicated. So we cannot get a good estimate that is very this. So we employ a weight quite fast. Multiplied a white article. We have these correlations. This is very good to get the magnitude. Here, let me express w integral over R. Spatial variable R. Then okay but now pi is 4 integration. This one disappears. This one disappears. This one appears this one. Plus 4 pi. 4 times u times u. O times you times you, only a bar. However, this sound is in one means go to bar. I don't know what it is. But anyway, you saw it in a pong one, then this is both posted. So this one is done. So it is it gives us a very good term for here. There are also some hour posting. This arm is also give us a This will also be a good time. Then integrate in line over one, two, mean ourselves. The end of the integration, then what we need to do is adjust estimate that plus the two integrations, here, this one and this one. The software on the back end side is instrumented by using the first to kill the music. Here we want to handle this part, then this demo by this regulation. So this one uh behaves very fast. This is a footing relations here. I'm using a short info. We have deliberations. Still, we need to come to this one because there are small vehicles. So this is done by using the contract. Down by using the power reactor for this one. Then we have this. So this is just a part of the reactor for pi outside. Here we also use about 5 equals to set. So this boundary time will be called if index k is large as 3. That's four point 8 is 2 times x. Hope we can use this all right. Use this online to be both. Then the other time we also follow similar methods. Thus we get this basic recipe. Think we have this part of the button or five sub R squared. And we have this vocation, USA. So by achieving USB is a child, this occasion will become more small. One are small. That's a good point for this. Then we want to derive 5 by 3. So what about general is here we need to give a different function, not a differentiation. Then we have an estimate of one surface. After deriving the estimate, we get this example. But I would uh skip this uh details discussion. I agree this Then I agree this program as if uh we have enough evaluators. Then two, then uh with uh the first set we differentiate first iteration in R and multiply U time twice R. In second step multiplies, second iteration multiply by low time twice of R of the hardware R. In that multiplied this way, I mean great over the working community and I still need to get these relationships see we have this uh quite small space. And april side, we have this new term. Then turning also this time is more, this part is also being based. Also we have uh several terms which it is not a dark. However, for patients, it can be can be very very small. So put can be very very small so we can hungry. So this is the four part. If it's just a allowing pipe and I need to then this amount uses second region on the data. Then uh we let out we have three SMAs. This is 5, 3 o'clock variable 5. The real action size. Then we work by some footer protein up to the stage to reach summary time. Until the part, maybe it's a size small, and here is the size of the small. We can get this in variability. This is the one we want you to get. Then, uh using this estimate, we want the time to unpass the fabric. So, we get a acid fabric theory for all the smaller. Theorem for the small in. So in this computation, you don't have to worry about specificity or raw. Suppose this is small one, so it's almost the same as the secondary solution. So since this is a so many solutions positive, we don't worry about wall become there. However, three weeks at the last time initial data, again, some positive wall becomes there. So to avoid So to our program, we will use a point-wise method, which is for verify the predestination formula in the Madranian form. Today, I will talk about this paper. Before we find control programs, we consider the same program for Problem or inflow problem, that is a broad technique in the algorithm. So for this case, we need a full onboarding condition. Then for this program, we discuss the data solution also proved by a smaller analytic. And the onboard space we can write inside I. Then we have four. We we put We could um uh we could show that uh uh this statement solution is all uh geological statements. Anyway, our solution is global design is compared to statement solution. So to obtain this design, uh we use the rather mass code not for Did you need a moment? Yeah, it is actually separate before that initial. So, to study this, we have to achieve pressure P given by this form. Locate some content, throw the ballot contact, and it should be in an interval of 1 to 2. Then we have also we should get some content since those are remote with the size of the change. Then our intra data container eight months of web space, a very eight month of space, both of which then get angle assumption volume and that this time I want to see. Then x is so this advance will make for R to X P. So X is a unit R. X is a new R over BX given by X. So this B is a then using this new code, the layer code X, our activation given in this 4. So our initial data is given by this, and one data is given by the data. Then here let me give you one remark. We have a stationary tool so 24. But this is not a stationary in the vertical Algerian coordinate code X and T. If R is some function of X and T, it is given by E bus or basically relations. Then, he would define the energy for his array for this. Then, modifying F point B of I are using a reduced equation of this of A. Therefore, synchronicity reactions the pyramid side in the red land bottom satisfies these relations of eating the same kind of power. It is the same as the value in the larger coordinate satisfies this relationship in the same as before. That integral is over this F of T, you can get these relations. So this is the initial data. So we need to find the pressure. To find the pixel, we desire the integration video like this. So this is this in the restaurant, similarly. This integration is just a B. Then here we can we use this. Then we use this then much we can get. Maybe this is some parts. Anyway, some technical limitations we can get this basically. Here uh we need to use uh a diabetic component must be uh m must be one. Must be 1 to 2 1 to 2. So, here patterns 4. However, in this estimate, patterns 5 contain B here. So, T becomes 0 because B problem. So, we need to show some boundary length of B below alpha. So, to do so, we want to use the Use the representation of home neural potential. So, to get the representation of home potential, we improve this kind of match. So, I am basically from state. Then we can make a vibration in here in this region. So, anyway for people it's For even x and ke, there is some k uh such that x contains the mean this medium multiply this function to second database integrating over this medium and this is that exponential without thin relations. So this is the variable in volume and this is the sum of the relationship. So look at the right hand side. We know this is the We know this is the initial rate, and this guy is definitely complicated. However, all of them are given by some integration. So, clearly, this integration is estimated by using the estimate. We have already gained SP. Then we can get this. So, what we need to do is estimate one-hand side, which is given by some division. This is given by some equations. The DRDP could be done by using several members. But maybe time is going to be I have a better speech, some some elemental computations, computations. Then finally we can get this estimate. So that is the one we wanted to prove. Also, we need to get driver power folder estimated for folder directories. But it is all on the same set of But it is all same as the ADS one, so I thought we had a skip to go up pushing. Anyway, thank you very much.
