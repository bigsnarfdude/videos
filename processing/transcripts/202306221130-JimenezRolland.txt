Okay, that's fine. So can you hear me? That's fine. Well, thank you so much for the introduction and thank you to Carlos and all the organizers for the wonderful workshop. It's very happy. I'm very happy to have you all here. I should apologize in advance because this talk is not about Bordism. So it's more about the mapping class group, like a follow-up of what Marco was introducing. So hopefully there is going to be something interesting for you, but yeah, it's not borderm. So I'm sorry about that. um so the the talk the work that i'm going to be talking about is joint work with profirio leon alvarez which is a phd student and lujorge sanchez aldaña from facultadaciencias in unam so let me give you the setting of the question that i'm interested in so i'm going to be talking about commensurators and normalizers So, let me introduce the question that I'm going to consider. So, let G be a discrete group. And I'm going to be considering subgroups of G, H and K. I'm going to say that they are commensurable. And I'm going to be writing H is commensurable to K if. If so, I can look at the intersection of these two subgroups and look at them as subgroups of H and K. And I'm going to be asking that this intersection is a finite index in both cases. So for instance, example is if I take K, a subgroup of finite index of H, then K is commensurable with H. So this is a typical situation when this happens. And I'm going to be interested in the commensurate. And I'm going to be interested in the commensurator of H in G. I received criticism about this notation, but I'm going to keep it because it's convenient and it's what people in this area use. But yeah, there is a confusion between this and normalizer, but I want to stress the square part. To stress the square parenthesis here. So this is the group of elements in G such that H is commensurable with the conjugate of H by G. So, well, a couple of observations is if I have two groups that are commensurable, then the commensurators are the same. And you should notice that inside of this lives the normalizer. So this is the normalizer of HEG. And I guess what I want to emphasize here is that this inclusion may be strict. And I guess again, I emphasize this for normalizers. I'm going to use this parenthesis, for commensurators, I'm going to use this. And my experience is that this board doesn't read very well. I'm going to put the general question here to keep it there, and then I'm going to use the board there. But let me know if you cannot read it. So, the question that I want to address is the following. So, I want to consider. To consider groups or for which groups G and subgroups H of G is true that you can find H prime commensurate with H such that if you consider the commensurator of H, I mentioned this is the same as the commensurator of H prime, and it's true that this can be realized as the normalizer. As the normalizer. So, in words, that is saying for which groups and subgroups can you realize the commensurator as a normalizer of a subgroup in the same commensurator class? I want H prime, yes, thank you. Well, well, then hopefully, you understood the question at least. So, there are several examples where this. So, there are several examples where this is true. I'm going to call this property star because I'm going to be referring to it. So, just to list some of the examples where this happens, any subgroup of virtually polycyclic groups satisfies this condition. Some abelian subgroups of out Fn satisfy this condition. Infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of linear groups. And I'm going to be talking about mapping class groups and some subgroups of the mapping class group that satisfy this condition. So, let me introduce sort of the groups that I'm going to be interested in, which are the mapping plus groups. And for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to be taking an orientable surface of finite type. You can ask the same type of questions for non-orientable surfaces, but I'm going to do. Questions for non-orientable surfaces, but I'm going to be focusing on orientable case. So that means that the surface is compact and has finitely many punctures. So if I want to refer to a specific surface of genus G with n punctures, I'm going to be using this notation. So this is genus G and punctures. And so the group that I'm going to be interested in is the mapping class group. I'm going to be using this notation for this. Notation for this. So, this is defined as taking the group of diffusions of the surface that restrict to the identity in the boundary component, preserve the orientation. If you are dealing with non-orientable surface, you drop this condition and then you mod up by isotopy. Are punctures, boundary components? Are they punctures? They're punctures. Yeah, so this surface may have boundary and punctures, and they are treated differently. Boundary and punctures, and they are treated differently. Um, thank you for the question. So, let me use this bar to state the results so that I can keep it there and then use the two words there. So, this is the first result that I want to share with you. Let me tell you, and then I'll tell you about the attributions of the result. So, I'm considering that the Euler characteristic of my surface is negative, S is orientable as before. Orientable as before of finite type. And so I'm going to be considering age, the age in my question there to be virtually a billion subgroup of the mapping class group. Of rank, I'm using K, well, rank greater or equal than one. I don't need to put a name on it. So what we can prove is that for these families of subgroups of the mapping class group, the answer to that question is yes. So there exists H prime commensurable to H, such that you look at the commensurator of If you look at the condenser of H, as I mentioned before, this is the condenser of H prime, and this can be realized as a normalizer. So let me give you a bit of, well, and here G, by G, I mean my mapping glass group. So let me make some comments about who did what in this result. So this is a result of Daniel Hompiné. This is a result of Daniel Jampineda and Alejandra Atujillo Neguete. But this is like talking about this result is like a nightmare because everybody decided to use the two last names and then some of them have like two first names. So it's like, and then it's a collaboration. So it's like, so this is our result from 2016. And also. 2016 and also there's a follow-up by Nucinis and Petrusian from 2018 where they deal with the boundary case. And what they did is the rank one case. So this is the virtually cyclic case. And what we did with Polfirio and Luis Jorge is the other cases. So we generalize this result. So Leon Alvarez and Frances Saldano. And I just tell that you. And then you can find the proprint in the archive. So I guess I'm going to keep it there. And let me make some remarks about the result. And then a bit of the motivation of why we care of such type of results. So any question, please stop me. I can raise this. So, I guess some remarks. I guess the first remark is that if the surface has no boundary, in the statement there, we can take H prime to be actually a finite. Take H prime to be actually a finite index subgroup of H. In general, it's just in the same commensuration class. So if that is true, we can take H prime, a finite index subgroup of H. And this has the advantage that then this result can be inherited to all subgroups of the mapping class group. So this, I would say, term A is true. term A is true for G any subgroup of the mapping class group so then you need the the surface to have empty boundary so that means that for any subgroup of the mapping class group if you ask the questions about are virtually abelian groups of rank blah have commensurators that can be realized as normalizers and the answer is yes so then you can get as a consequence Then you can get, as a consequence of that, that the result is true for the mapping plus group of non-orientable surfaces. Because there is this two-orientable cover of a non-orientable surface, and then this gives you an inclusion of the mapping class group into the into the of the non-orientable surface into the orientable surface. And you need to ask this to be of negative Euler. To be of negative Euler characteristic at 4. That means also that this is true for rags because it's known that they embed in the mapping class group of a surface of genus G, where the genus is large. And then you can also conclude this for bright groups, bright surface groups. Again, because the Berman Sachs sequence gives you the inclusion. The Berman Sachs sequence gives you the inclusion. So, yeah, Rax, right, right angle groups. Okay, so in the second observation is that you can also promote these results to central extensions. So, like, I'm saying terma, like a result type of terama is also true. For central extensions of mod S by finitely generated free abelian group. And I'm mentioning this because this is what allows us to go from the non-empty the empty boundary case to the non-empty boundary case. Boundary case to the non-empty boundary case. So there is a short sac sequence that allows you, if you start with a surface, yeah, if you start with a surface with non-empty boundary, you can cap the boundary and surject into a surface that is closed. And then the kernel is generated by the dentist along the boundary components. And so if you know. And so, if you know that this is true for this, this type of comment can make you that this is true. And this is where you lose this fact that you can take a finite index subgroup. You just stay in the same condensation class. Okay, so well, again, I guess here this is a good point to ask a more general question that was asked to me by Alan. To me, by Alan Roy. So, I guess a more general question is: is this true for any subgroup of the mapping class group or is like just particular of these type of groups? Is a star through or any H subgroup of the mapping plus group? Is this something that has to do with? This is something that has to do with how rigid the mapping class group is, or is like just this type of subgroups or just a family of subgroups, more general subgroups. So, I guess the techniques that I'm going to be talking about just apply for virtually abelian subgroups, so we cannot hope to answer this question using the techniques that we are using, but then there is a more general question. So, maybe this is just a particular case of a more general phenomenon. Okay, so I guess what I want to do now before going into What I want to do now before going into the proof of that kind of statement is give a bit of one motivation of why we did care about this type of result. So, I guess my motivation has to do with geometric dimensions. And well, bear with me with a bit of definitions, and at some point I'm going to come back to commensurators. So, I guess I'm going to be considering G a group and I'm going to be considering F, what is called a family of groups, of subgroups. So, I'm not going to write it down, but I mean a collection of subgroups of G that is closed on the taking subgroups. Closed under taking subgroups and closed under taking conjugations. So the families that I'm going to have in mind are the following. So F may be the trivial family. So I can take just the trivial subgroup. And this is, of course, close to their subgroups in conjugation. I can take the family of finite subgroups. So I'm taking all the H subgroups of G, so that H is finite. And this is also closed under taking subgroups and conjugates. They're taking subgroups and conjugations. I can take the family of virtually cyclic groups. So these are the subgroups of G, so that H is virtually cyclic. And I guess maybe for people who don't use virtually properties very often, just a quick reminder: I say that H is virtually. Is virtually something if there exists H prime of finite index satisfying something. So in this particular being cyclic, this something being cyclic. So another more general, a family that generalizes these two is the following. This is Fn and this is going to be the family of subgroups of G so that. Subgroups of G so that H is virtually a free abelian group of rank K where I can take K in between 0 and N. So notice that this generalizes the other two families. So this is actually F0 and this is F1. And I guess at least there is like a first connection here with my statement before, right? I mean, I'm taking virtually a billion subgroups. So here's a definition. I G CW complex X is a model. Or the classifying space with respect to this family of the group, if you have the following two conditions. So for every x in x, if you look at the stabilizer of the point by the action of x, this group is in the family. So if you want free actions, you better have the family to be trivial so that the stabilizers are trivial. The stabilizers are trivial. And the second condition is that if you look at the fixed points, that is to say, the points in X, such that when you act, they are fixed for every H in H. This should be contractible whenever H is in the family. And I guess I should mention that such models always exist and are unique up to each. Models always exist and are unique up to a geome homotopy. So, always exist and are unique of 2G homogeneous. So, I guess let me give you some examples. You've seen those before, at least for some families. So, this is what is called the classifying space of G for the family F. Space of G for the family S. So, in particular, look at the definition when the family is a trivial family. So, what you have is that all these stabilizers are trivial, so the action is free, and then the fixed points of the trivial groups is contractible. So, actually, In examples, you can notice that if the family is a trivial family, then X a model, if X is a model for this classifying space, then G acts on X trivially freely. Freely, and X should be contractible. So the quotient is a model for Vg. So I guess there is like not a consensus about the name classifying space because we usually call this classifying space, but they call classifying space the universal cover of the classifying space. So this is actually the universal cover. The universal cover of the usual classifying states of the group. And let me go back to what is known in the setting of mapping class groups. So if you take F to be the finite, the family of finite subgroups, then it's known that Tech Miller space So, this space that parametrizes Riemann structures on a fixed topological surface is actually a model for the classifying space of the mapping class group of the surface of genus U with n punctures with respect to this family of finite subgroups. And well, the action of the mapping class group there has finite stabilizers, so they belong to the family, and then you can check all the other properties. The family, and then you can check all the other properties as well. Um, and moreover, Harrow proved. And well, this dimension is known, so this dimension is known to be, I think, 6G minus 6 plus 2n or something like that. But HAR actually proved that, this is from the 80s, that if n is greater or equal than 1, so I need a functor of list. So, I need a puncturable list, then there is a spine of technical space of dimension that is also a model for this family, the classifying space with respect to this family and And as I mentioned, equal to the B C D of the group. And this is actually the paper where Hare computed the B C D of the mapping class group. And this is the way that he did it actually. So the B C D is known to, I don't remember the exact number, but it's computed there. But it's something like 4G something. So it's way less than the dimension of tech builder. The dimension of tech miller. And I guess at least this is the setting that I'm interested in for this talk, but at least we can see that there may be several models for this classifying space, and one would like to have the model that has minimum dimension. And for mapping class groups, it turns out that the model that has minimum dimension is this and it coincides with the B C D of the mapping class group. So, yes. So is it true in this case that the stabilizers of these finite subsets are actually points? Like if I have a finite subgroup of mapping class group, is the fixed point set in Python space just a single point? I'm not sure. I mean, I guess for this purpose, it's enough to be contractible, but I'm not sure if they are actually points. I should know better, but I'm sorry. But yeah, at least that's known, but maybe you're right and it's more rigid than that. Rigid than that. And so is fine. Does that mean it's a deformation retract? Yes, yes, and it's G equivariant, actually. But I guess the caveat here is that you need a puncture, at least. So, okay, so let me give you the definition of geometric dimension, but I think I motivated with this example. So the geometric dimension is going to be the minimum of the dimension that you can take. And I should stop at 10 theory, right? Well, maybe before if I can, right? I guess elementary, okay. Otherwise, running a little late. Yeah. Yeah. So the geometric dimension of a group G with respect to a family is going to be usually denoted by this. And this is the. And this is defined to be the minimum of the non-negative integer so that there exists a model for the classifying space with respect to that family of dimension equal to n. And I guess if the family is trivial, this is just the geometric dimension of the group, which is the dimension. Which is the dimension of a VG at all? I'm using notation here. So the minimum dimension of the VG that you can have. So I guess some known things about that, and then I go back to mapping class groups, some examples. So the geometric dimension of a group is zero if and only if the group is in the family. If and only if the group is in the family, because then you can take a point. And then the other observation is that the geometric dimension between all family is just the usual geometric dimension. There is a result of Dongody. I don't know if I'm spelling this correctly. That says that the geometric dimension with respect to F0, F0 is the family of finite groups of G. Uh, of G is one if and only if G is virtually free. So, I guess this is the type of result that one would like to have that this property completely characterizes like a family of groups. And I guess going back to the mapping class group, what can be read off from this paper of Her is that the geometric dimension The geometric dimension with respect to the family of finite subgroups of the mapping class group of an orientable surface of genus G with n functions is actually the B C D. So the spine is the space that realizes this dimension. And this is true if n is greater than or equal to one. This is needed for the retraction and the spine construction to work. And despite construction to work, and uh, but actually, it was proved. This is from the 80s, but in 2013, it was proved that this is also the case when the surface is closed. So, I see a little bit. So, V C D is a lower bound. Yeah, in general, V C D is a lower bound. So, I mean, here you realize the space of minimum. I mean, here you realize the space of minimum dimension. That's why you can get it. But then you need more algebraic tools. And this is a result of Javiera Magona and Concita Martinez. That is. I think from 2013, that this result is actually true if the surface is closed. So the geometric dimension with respect to the family of finite surface. With respect to the family of finite subgroups, all the mapping class group a surface of genus G is the BCD. And they use a more like algebra topological construction, and they use that as an induction step, actually. So they need to know this. So you've actually been trying to attack this problem for non-orientable surfaces. And we have more. Surfaces, and we have almost all the ingredients except some cases with punctures, like very small cases. And so, we're working on trying to find a spine that works as well there, like a geometric proof instead of an algebraic one. Yeah, it's sort of the basis of an induction of a more algebraic setting here. So, I guess, so this is what is known for the family of finite subgroups, but it's actually also known for the next family. For the next family. And so this is a result of Nusinkis and Petrocian. And it's not a coincidence that these names appear also in the theorem. This is an ingredient of this result. So they prove that if S is orientable, compact, and the Euler characteristic is negative, the geometric The geometric dimension with respect to the virtual secret subgroup families. This is the family that I call F0, and this is the family that I call F1 of the mapping class group of the surface is bounded above by the DCD log one. And they show that it's equal if as. If S is closed. And I guess here this is a good point to sort of emphasize why people care about these dimensions and these spaces. One of the main reasons is that the families F0 and F1, the finite and the virtually cyclic one, appear. In the statements of the Farrell Johns and Bonfound's conjectures so those are called the isomorphism. Isomorphism. I'm far from being an expert on this, but those are specific types of isomorphisms that relate the algebraic K-theory of a group ring with some equivalent homology of these type of spaces with respect to these families. So in principle, if those conjectures are true, one can try to compute K-theory using homology of these type of spaces. Homology of these types of spaces. And finding models of minimal dimensions can be of help to get some homological considerations. So, I guess something else to remark here is that in 2019, Artur Bartels and Maladen-Besvina proved that the isomorphism conjecture, the Farrell-Jones conjecture, is true for mapping class groups. For orientable surfaces. And I don't remember if they include functions or not. Okay, so any questions so far? So this is sort of like the vocabulary, I guess. And well, and I was saying, well, our motivation to study our result like that was actually computing one of those dimensions. Computing one of those dimensions. So let me state the result in this idle D. I think I'm good to erase this. This is the second theorem that I wanted to advertise today. So the theorem says, I hope you can see it. This is terrorum B. This is. This is again your work with Leon Alvarez and Sancho Saldan. And this says that if S is connected orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic or Abrian. For every n greater or equal than 2, if you compute the geometric dimension of this families Fn that I mentioned before, that have to do with abelian subgroups of the group of the mapping plus group. This is bounded above by the V C D plus N. And I guess I should mention that. Mentioned that this family is actually stabilized. So you can notice that F0 lives inside of F1, lives inside of F2. But if there is an upper bound for the rank, the maximal rank of abelian subgroups in my group, then at some point they're going to be the same. And it's known for the mapping class group. So this is the abelian subgroups are known to be finitely generated, and there is like an upper bound for the rank. So at some point, this stabilizes. So at some point, this stabilizes, I guess. But this is sort of a generalization of the results that I mentioned before. I think I erased them. I guess, yes, it's a generalization of this and this. And actually use those inputs as an induction, a base of induction. Yes. These terms don't get that. It's a bit disappointing. I guess there's like, and I'm going to comment. There's like, and I'm gonna comment a bit on it, of how it goes, but then this doesn't get a space as Carl did, for instance. So, you would say to this fact about a pipe knowledge space being one of these classifying spaces for F0. Are there known examples of explicit models for Fn? I don't know. I guess in principle, these abstract consortiums that one can do, you can do it geometrically as well, I guess. But I guess it's not like how nicely presented. Not like a nicely presented space that you would like to work on. So I should know, but I don't know. And I mean, I guess these families have been just recently studied. To be honest, I guess the ones that people really care about are those two. And this is sort of like a way to generalize that. And it's unclear if this is going to be helpful to compute something else. So I guess maybe that's why people haven't paid that much attention. But yeah, it's a good question because usually you can compute better if you have concrete spaces. Compute better if you have concrete spaces. So, um, any other question? It doesn't have to do anything, it's just the definition. So, what I'm claiming is that there is like an upper bound for the maximal rank of abelian subgroup. So, when you get to the upper bound, so I'll say the upper bound is n, so you get to the family fn. If you look at the definition, this is going to be the same as the next one. So, it's just the definition. So, it's just the definition. So, in principle, once you get to this, all the these are going to be like the same. So, you're not going to compute any other invariant. And it's going to be bounded by the upper bound. Yeah, it's something like that. It's something that has to do with the genus, and there is like explicit, this is very classical, actually. It's Birman, Lubotsky, and McCarthy, I think, from the 80s as well. And I guess it's good to know also that all subgroups, a billion subgroups of the mapping class group are finitely generated. Subgroups of the mapping class group are finitely generated as well. So they lie in this setting. So I guess I put this to state the result, but also to give a sort of motivation why this term, why we care about that. So let me give you a bit of an insight of what goes into this proof briefly, because I mean, I don't think it's worth going through. So, I guess let me check what I put in my sort of the sketch of proof or RMB. I guess this is a I guess this is a proof by induction on n. And I used to erase my base of induction because I'm very bad at using words. But n equals zero is the result of Harris, Ayarmayona, and Conchita Martinez. N equals one is Nusinki Sempetracien. And just to simplify my notation, G is going to be the mapping plus group of the surface. And I guess the idea is to do a push-out construction that is due to look by Erman. To look by your man. And I'm going to put a diagram and just explain the general idea of how it goes. So the idea is that you want to construct X, a model, or the classifying space of the family FK or the group, and you want to use an And you want to use an induction step. So you want to know information, you are giving some information about what happens for the previous family. So this is sort of the dimension is bounded by an induction hypothesis argument. And in the push-out construction, there appear like spaces here. I'm going to write down the formula, but not going to the details. Go into the details. I guess what I want to emphasize is in whatever formula is here, but it's probably wrong because I didn't copy it correctly. There is like a disjoint union of spaces, but what I want to point out is that sort of the spaces and groups that appear here in a lot of cases are commensurators. Are commensurators. So the strategy to bound the dimension of this model is to bound the dimension of the corners. So this is given by induction hypothesis. And if you can bound the dimension of this and this, then you will get a bound for the dimension of this, which is the one that we are looking for. And the point here is that in these vertices, there are condenser radars appearing. And And it's way more tractable to try to bound these dimensions if you know that this can be realized as normalizers. So and bound if commensurators are realized as normalizers. And it's not enough. I mean, that's one of the first steps. Mean that that's one of the first steps. You actually need to know more about the structure of the normalizers and the condenser loss structure. You need, I mean, a bit more than that is not enough to know that, but it's, it makes the problem like you can try some things out. And then in this case, we could. So we bounded this, and this is an induction argument, and what we get is the bounded one. So I guess it's a bit disappointing because we don't. It's a bit disappointing because we don't have spaces, but somehow this push-out construction is like you start with this and then you pay like some fibers that somehow are copies of this classifying spaces. And this is going to be the space that's only going to add one more dimension. It's going to only want to add one more dimension because actually I don't remember which one is going to add. I mean, I guess the whole construction adds one dimension. And then the dimensions that we get here are less or equal than the ones that we get here. Are less or equal than the ones that we get here. Something like that. I don't remember exactly. Okay, I guess this is sort of the reason why we studied that question, but I guess the question makes sense independently. So I have, I guess I should give a bit of a sketch of the theorem and the tools that are in there. And maybe I try not to go over time. So. I guess these are sort of general tools to deal with this kind of dimensions. But what I find interesting about computing this kind of invariance is that once you want to do the computations, you need to go and understand the group. And the geometry of the group is what is going to give you the tools that you need. And in this case, you need to understand mapping like very well, or to some extent, virtually a billion subgroups of the mapping plus group. Subgroups of the mapping class group. If you change a family of groups, you will need to understand what happens there. So, even if the general type of machinery is the same, once you change the groups, you change the tools that you are using. So, I guess the proof of sterium A that is still on the board, I believe, is the one that is there, which is the ingredient for the other one. So, it's the realization problem here of. Is the realization problem here of commensurators, normalizers relies on a very technical step? Well, I don't know if technical, but this is like a proposition. And I guess this is sort of the technical part, but also the one that involves the geometry of the group. So I guess I'm not going to state it very precisely, but I'm not going to state it very precisely, but what it says is that instead of working with the mapping class group, we work with a subgroup of finite index of the mapping class group that is torsion-free, which is the congruence subgroup, the level congruent subgroup of the level congruence subgroup of the mapping class group, and we want n to be. We want n to be greater or equal than 3 because then it's known that this is torsion-free. This is defined as the kernel of the action of the mapping class group on the first homology with coefficients in Zm. So it's very concretely defined and it's torsion-free once you take m greater equal than 3. And working with subgroups of this torsion-free group help us do the stuff that we need. And in terms of commensurators, since this is finite index, it's going to give. Since this is a finite index, it's going to give us the result that we want. So, this is a subgroup that is three abelian of rank. And we deal, I guess, with rank greater or equal than two because the case of rank equals one was already done. And there are like slightly differences between the two cases, so we separated. And so, what we need to prove is that That we can look at the centralizer in this mod S M of H. We can look at the normalizer of, well, I'm going to call this G again so that I don't write it down. And we can look at the condenserator. And this is actually a subgroup that are contained that way. These are contained that way. And what we do for each of those is we build up some short sequence that tells us about the structure of these groups. So there is like they surject into a Q and they have kernel, a Freyabelian group of finite rank. And I guess what is important here is what can we say about this Q and this Q. And this Q, we can show that this is a finite index subgroup of something like that, looks like a mapping class group of a disconnected surface cross a virtually abelian group, finitely universal. So, when I was saying, in order to understand these spaces, we need more. In order to understand these spaces, we need more structure. This is the type of more structure that is going to be helpful to deal with these computations. And let me say a bit more. Okay. So I guess I'm not saying that this Q is the same for everything, but it's something of the type. And when you do this, you can show actually that these are subgroups of finite index. It's going to be a consequence of this structure. Is going to be a consequence of this structure theorem. And another consequence that is going to be important is that you can show that the commensurator is finitely generated. Something that you cannot know for free. You need to prove it. So, and this is true for any H that is virtually a billion in the group, actually. So, I guess this is sort of our contribution is actually proving this and this structure term so that we can deal with this. And in order to get term A, we need some property C that was proved by other people that together with this gives you the result. So, I'm not gonna, I mean, I can state the property, but I don't think it's helpful, I guess. Helpful, I guess. But yeah, I would say theorem A follows from property C that calls for mapping class group is work of several people plus the finite generation statement of these commensurators. And I guess what property C allows you to say is that you can find this, the H prime in the same commensuration class, so that this happens. So it's a stated a bit different, but it's basically what I'm That's a bit different, but it's basically what amounts to once you put the ingredients there and you apply it to this one. But it needs as an as an um it needs you to give you a finitely generated group, and this is the group that you give it to this. What I want to say in the last five minutes or so is more about how where the geometry of the group playing is how you build up this row. So, this is what is called. So, this is what is called a cutting homomorphism. And I guess in proving this proposition, you need to be very careful of proving these finite index conditions and why you get this type of stuff. But let me tell you about how this role appears, and then I'm going to stop. And this is why this technique only works for abelian groups and not something else. So, I guess this has to do with, if people are familiar with these tools for mapping class groups, this has to do with what is called reduction systems and the so-called adding homomorphisms. And I'm going to be very vague here, but let me give you a bit of the insight. So we deal with the surface with empty boundary. And there is a simplicial complex associated to a surface that is called the curve complex. So the vertices are simple closed curves, isotopic classes of simple closed curves. Isotopic classes of simple close curves in the surface, and then you put an H if you can take two of them that are disjoint, that have disjoint representatives. So there is a well-defined action of the mapping class group there. And there is this definition by Ivanov from the ADIS that says that a subgroup of the That is a subgroup of the mapping class group is reducible if there exists a simplex that is non-empty in the curve complex so that when you act on it, you fix it for every element in the group. So people. So, people may be familiar with the notion of a reducible element that is the same as being reducible for the subgroup generated by the element. And this comes in the Nielsen-Turston, no, the what is it? Thurston, I forgot the other name, classification, Nielsen-Turston classification theorem of elements of Mappy class group. So, this is more general for subgroups. So, I guess what Ibanov did as well is that if you have such a subgroup, there is a way to construct what he calls a canonical reduction system. And I guess what happens when What happens with this canonical reduction system is that you can define this row, this cutting homomorphism. I'm going to put it here. So it is canonical in the sense that sort of you can cut the surface by, so this reduction system is actually a simplex in the curve complex. In the curve complex, so it can be represented by simple closed curves that are realized disjointly. And the thing is that you can sort of cut the surface and understand the action of your group in the pieces that result by cutting the surface on this. So what is good for this is that you can define a homomorphism that is associated to this canonical reduction simplex that goes from the subgroup. From the subgroup of the mapping class group that stabilizes this simplex to the mapping class group of a surface that you get by cutting. So this is the cutting, the cut surface. So again, I was saying, so in the surface, just to illustrate, there are like a bunch of curves that realize the simplex. And this is going to be this sigma h. This is going to be this sigma h that exists by E by naught, and then you can cut it and get, I guess, the resulting sort of like pieces. Well, I'm just making this up. So this is going to be the surface that you get. And the point is that any mapping class that stabilizes this is going to give you a mapping class of this colored surface. A mapping class of this coded surface, and I mean, you need to work out by going to finite index subgroups that fix the curves like point-wise, so that you can restrict actually the action to the pieces. So it's not as easy as this. You need to work down, but it's always finite index, which is why we care there. And what Ibanov theory allows you to do is that there is an understanding of how they act on each of the pieces. And they act either trivially. And they act either trivially or by a pseudonym. And the advantage of doing this, so this row is the one that appears here, so we need to understand exactly what it is, but this is why this lies in something like this, because it lies in the mapping class group of the pieces where it acts trivially, and the mapping class group of the surfaces is a subgroup of the mapping class group of the surfaces where it acts as a pseudonym. And the advantage is that centralizers of pseudonyms. Is that centralizers of pseudonosov are well understood and are known to be virtually z. So, this virtually abelian is going to come from that. And I guess this is a good point to stop because I didn't go into more of the details, but I just wanted to see, to show you why this is not as mysterious as it seems. Thank you. Lotrito for the next talk. So, questions was a virtual audience. Do you have a question? Yes, can I ask a question? Of course. Okay. Yeah, no, this is just a technical point. So, when you define the So, when you define the classifying space for a family or subgroup, you also want that any group in this family is represented by one stabilizer, right? So, you want not just the stabilizer in the family, but also that any subgroup of your group appears as a stabilizer. I I actually am not sure if this is native. Not sure if this is native. Otherwise, I don't understand how the dimension goes up. Because I mean, if you don't have this condition, then for instance, the classifying space for F0 is also classified space for F1, for instance. So can you hear me, Mercury? Yes. Yeah, so I don't think that is required. And I think that what you say is true. I mean, it can be that you have a model of the classifying space. That you have a model of the classifying space that works for one family and works for the other. But I guess what we can get in this type of terms is an upper bound, not the best one. So the construction says like it's going to increase the dimension, but that doesn't say that this is going to be the actual dimension. It can be less than that. But I mean, it's true that, yeah, I don't think it's required that all the groups appear, actually. So I guess it may be the case that the dimension is way better than what we got. Is way better than what we got. For instance, tech Mueller space, you know that every finite subgroup of the mapping class group is the stabilizer at some point. This is a deep result, actually. Yes. I don't know. Do you know if that's true for the spine as well? The spine, I don't know, actually. So you have an equivalent retraction, right? Yes. Okay. But yeah, I think in the definition from your question, it's not required that is realized. I mean, that's way more, I mean, it's way more information that. Actually, I was also wondering if you have a group of F infinity type, which is a beard shot one care duality group. I mean, do you have some general result in this case? Because it looks like. It looks like or not, it just you are just. I mean, you need to prove everything for your specific group. You mean the specific group being the mapping class group or the specific group be in the mapping group? I mean, it's this pro this theorem that the geometric dimension coincides with the virtual homological dimension. So, is this true? So, is this true just for a class of abstract group of a certain kind, for instance, FP infinity virtual virtually? I mean, I don't know if there are like results as general like that. I know that there are like several families of groups that people have studied where it is true, but I don't know if there is a statement as general as the one that you're mentioning. It may be the case, and I'm you're. It may be the case, and I'm just not aware of it. It's always true that the BCD is a lower bound of the geometric dimension. But then the equality holds for very particular families. Okay, no, okay, thank you. Okay, yeah, this makes sense. So another question is: okay, so you mentioned this generalization of your work, so to try to understand this for other families. Understand this for other families of subgroup of the mapping class group. So probably, I don't know, the next step would be to try to look at solvable groups, solvable subgroups of the mapping class. I don't know if there is something going on. Yeah, I guess we haven't tried. I guess the tool that we use is very these reducible subgroups. One can try to look at if they're like some family of groups that have this property that. That have this property that these two can be used. So, if you have a subgroup of the MOP class group which has non-trivial center, maybe that gives you, you know, you can do something because I think that that's at the minimum probably you need to be able to use this reduction theory. If you have a subgroup of the MAPI cross-group which has non-trivial center, then you can probably apply. Yeah, which is the case. Okay, yeah, thank you for the suggestion. We will look at it and see if there are like. And see if there are like other families of interesting subgroups. So, for example, near potential groups and of the mapping class group. I don't know if there is a classification potential group of the mapping class group, actually. I don't know. I don't know. I think, I mean, the tits alternative gives you that this is actually a result for amenable groups and not just virtually abelian groups. Because also, people study the family of amenable subgroups. People study the family of amenable subgroups of a group, but I haven't thought about this more. Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you, Merco. More virtual questions? No, okay, so we come back to the real audience. Okay, Mark and I can have a particular session. I ask him questions and he asks me questions.
