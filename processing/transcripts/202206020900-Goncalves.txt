And now it's my deep honor to introduce our first speaker of the morning, Justin Spaulders from the University of St. Paul, who will tell us about free cyclic actions on surfaces and the force of Gulam theory. Okay. It's a great pleasure. It's a great pleasure to be back in Oaxaca, to meet several people that I know and to meet new people. And thank you, Lucille, Don, and Jesus, for the opportunity to be here. Okay. So So what I'm going to do in this talk is to tell you more or less the recent development and one direction where this classical Borzuculum theorem is. The main stress will be surface. Closed surface that everyone we know. So the classical Bozouk Ulam theorem It says for a map from Sn into Rn continuous exists a point X which depends on F of course in Sn we have F of x equals to f of I of x where I is the antipodal map. That was the begin 1933 and it's just a historical remark when Bozuk. Mark when Bozuk wrote this result and he published it in the mathematic, Fundamental Mathematic, Polish. At the end of the paper, there was a remark where Bozouk thanks Hopf because he has pointed out that this problem was equivalent to the one by coverings, number of controls. Coverings, number of contractible covers in this sphere, etc., which has been solved three years early. But nevertheless, after this point here, people start to see some kind of the new examples. So let's see in which directions we can try to find this kind of. To find this kind of a symmetry. Yeah. So the first thing that you may think is: how about to replace S N by other spaces X okay. So, to be in the context, you should say that you have a space X. Of course, you should know that X admits something similar to the antipodal map. That means Z two three. Reaction on X. Of course, there are other technicalities because here you put Rn and then if you take a too arbitrary space, you have to fuss about Rn. So maybe Rn is also one variable. Well, another thing which Another thing which pops up is also that you said what's so special about the antipodal map. And probably if you have other actions, you may ask if the result holds or not. It turns out that up to certain equivalents. This is the only involution on Sn. But for other space, you may have other involutions, distinct involution even after some reasonable definition of equivalence and so on. Yeah. Okay. The next thing is that you may think is. Replace Z two by a finite group and so and finally replace R in are in by a topological space one so in general here's the picture that you will look for x a finite group g Call this map tau for the same G, you can have several things in this quadruple like this, what What is the question? So let me stress now that there are two natural questions that you can ask. Although for some of you, or maybe most of you, maybe Borzuklum is here just for a decoration. Is here just for a decoration, but I hope to show a few things about configuration in space that is a more attached. So there are two natural questions that you can ask. Here is this. The first one is for every map from every F from X to Y does there exist X in X such that the entire orbit, which I denote by this The entire of the collapse. So that's question one. Yeah. So yeah. Now the question two for every map F from that. F from X to Y does there exist X belongs to X such that when you look at the orbit is at least two points colours, so that's mean the colour. colours so that's mean the cardinality of f of x g of x of this set is strictly less than the cardinality of the group okay so this is uh so people has been studying this So, people have been studying these two questions, and in both cases, configuration space is used. And in my case, I will focus in question two. Of course, if you group G is Of course, if you group G is two, you it's the same question and so on. Yeah, okay. Is there a recent terrorist with many groups of probably not, but uh has not been explored. Okay, so you could take. Okay, so you could take discrete group. So, of course, you would expect to have X larger and uncompacted, but that's could be thing. Yeah, but I have not seen anything, but it's yeah, it is. Yeah. Maybe there are other something is about continuous groups. Something is about continuous group because this is like Rabornovich, Fadel, and so on. Hussein, yeah, but yes, yeah. But would be reasonable to think about G-infinite discrete groups in the spaces that limit, and so on. Yeah, okay. Okay, now so So let's see the one result let's say after Bosupulam Mozoglam theorem along the lines of such generalization. So, I will search. I will search for. I will search for spaces which have enough look for spaces which have mass evolutions. Okay, so here it is. If you have a surface, A surface, and if the surface admits an evolution, this implies that the because here is good because you know everything, the classification. So the quotient is again in a surface, and therefore this involution can be enumerated. Enumerated by home of the pi one of the fundamental group into Z2, which are trajectories. So in this way, you can come out with the classification of the, yeah, and of course, the And of course, the number, there is a notion of equivalence to involutions, and the number of these classes of involution are not exactly this set. This is stupid. Is home from here to here, the ones which are subjective. Every time that you Every time that you have this, you construct an evolution and so on, and so you have reaction. Okay, so let me show you in 2006. I wrote a note which tells you the following. Let S tau be a pair where S is a compact surface sorry, closed Sorry, closed means compact without boundary and Paul on involution. Then the Bozouk-Ulam theorem holds if and only if so here's the full picture S is orientable And the Euler characteristic of S is congruent to two mod four. Say again. You're right. That's right. That's right. So I'm dealing with maps into R2. And that's, yeah, yeah. R3, there is no question and R1 also is. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Good, good, yes, makes sense. Yeah. Now S is S is non-orientable. As you say in part A, the evolution doesn't play a role, but he will play. S is none and the involution. Is such that, and here I tell you what it is because this is it's like this: I should give a homomorphism, that's your special uh. And the homomorphism is as follows. When you have a homomorphism from pi one of a surface into z2, because this is a billion is factorized by the homology of this. And when you factorize by the homology, s is. Characterized by the homolog, S is non-orientable, there is a well-defined torsion subgroup here, which is Z2. And your homomorphism phi should satisfy phi of this torsion element should be one bar. Just the notation. So here, So here, you can look the number, the number of equivalent classes of involution, whatever it is, then you can see that for some, the BOZOC works and some doesn't work. Yeah. So, yeah. But, okay. I could see, I could say that up to this point. The techniques used did not involve braid groups, did not involve configuration in space. So then we try to extend. We try to extend these results for surface S evolution. I don't have to tell the group, but it's suffice S group Z. Surface S group Z2 involution and I replace the second thing by another surface. So this is interesting. I mean, this replacement of the target is interesting in the following sense. When there's Rn, you only have one. You only have one homotopy class because you have maths. When you introduce y, you have plenty of homotopy class, and this even can suggest other questions. Okay, now consider the same problem, okay, and now where you replace the target instead of R2, and you put another surface. The surface. Okay, one of the major arguments used here so far is because the maps which goes into the Euclidean space, you can make the difference. Okay, this is the classical thing is given. classical thing is given x from x to r2 and then you create g, which is f of x minus f of tau of x. That's what we learn in the classical thing. And then we interpret the have or not coincidence point, say that g blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. This creates a difficulty when you replace this for another space, but that's very confusing. That's where configuration space comes naturally. So comes natural. So in 2010, together with John Buski, we classify all possible. And I'm not going to take this statement because it involves separate the surface RS2 or IP2 and then so on. So it's a long statement. But here the Here, what comes news was that you had, once you have a map from S1 to S2, and I just recall the argument that says, already said, if f of x is different from f of tau of x, f of tau of x implies that you built a map from s1 into you just let it know f2 of s2 let's reversively pair then you create this map and you create this map and that's the map that you that's the map that you study Okay. So it was using this diagram, it was using this map here that we are able to solve. But I'm going to tell you a little bit more about when you go beyond this point. When you go beyond this point, meaning if you replace for a finite group, what kind of ingredients will appear? Okay. So suppose you have A G action and so this is the so have g cross x that's in general x and x into y and then you create F graph capital F going into configuration space cardinality of G and your map is given by this diagram here and f of x naturally is Naturally is f of X Let me start to explain this setting. So, suppose we have a direction f from x into y such that Y such that the cardinality such that the cardinality of the set GX is equal to the cardinality of G. So, this is the condition to say that suppose blah blah blah the bozo doesn't hold. So, if Bozook doesn't hold, Zook doesn't hold, and that means that you can construct a map from x into the configuration in space with cardinal of g coordinate. And of course, you have to fix enumeration between g and the coordinates. So you have this map. But if I want to transform my problem. If I want to transform my problem to a new problem here, I need to have to come back and just have a map in the configuration space. It's not enough. It's not enough. So I leave this and little by little I complete the diagram. So, I would say to get back a function where the Bozouklon property Does not root it is enough to show to have f equivalent So, in the classical case of Z2, this is very simple, was not a big issue because here was Z2. Then you have two coordinates, and then you know how to And you have the natural action, it's the only, yeah, it's that one which flips the coordinate. And so this was important to recover a map. And there was not much work to do when the group was V2. In the group of Z2. So if I want to recover, I should have a diagram here where this map should be G-equivariant. Okay, so because, okay, so here is a little proposition, but you have to be a little But you have to be a little careful because this is a delicate point. And so the proposition that I tell you is like this. If G is a billion, then Is equivalent. Okay, so once you have it equivariant, you can study if this map is equivariant by look the map into the quotient. Now this belongs to G and to complete that this diagram comes from an equivariant map. Not only you have this here, but also you have the compatibility. compatibility of the options which in the case of Z2 this is RP infinity and so on and so this is true that one of the options is a left action and the other one is a right action actually perhaps it's well but you could also make both actually Actually, because the thing is, you have, when you say that this is equivariant, you have to tell how you embed G in the symmetric group here. It does not naturally embed. So, for example, from the Kaylee theory about the embedding, this is one way how to embed this group is yeah. But when it's uh But when it's not a billion, you don't see that you try to make the embeds and you don't see how it can fit the natural one. So you may have end up with another question. Maybe there is one way to embed and then so on. But when you do try to do some, but what I say here is that there is a natural way to embed. There is a natural way to embed an abelian group here. And because of the commutativity, it's something well defined. And then you use the action here. And the action here is, you look, there's embedding in the symmetric group. And of course, the symmetric group you fix on action in some way. And then you look at the restriction. Look at the restriction, and so when you do this, and that's uh, yeah, so it's uh uh, I think there is a hope to do, but the diagram is not going to be this. This is going to be a little bit more sophisticated because the thing, yeah. Okay, so if G is a equivariant, if G abilities is equivalent. If Gabelian this is equivarity, then I fill up this diagram. Okay, now if this diagram exists, I can build a map. If this diagram exists, I can build a map. So you forget all about this, and you are only concerned about this diagram. If you want to know that this diagram exists, what you do? You look at the algebraic diagram with pi one. High one. And you ask the question: if I solve the algebraic problem, do I solve the geometric problem? Well, I'm dealing with surface. So X is a surface. If I put here S2, the only group which X is Z2, I don't care about Z2. about z2 i'm interested in z n n greater than two i cannot put here rp2 because there is no involution free involution so this entire diagram is made out of k pi one so this is made out of k pi one so i is So I end up studying my problem just looking at this diagram. Furthermore, it suffices to look this piece. The rest I recover by usually. So at the end, for G, a billion and And let me specialize for G equal to Zn in greater than 2. So the end of this story is that I look at a surface by one of a A surface, pi one of a surface. I look at Zn I look here the surface S1. I look at the configuration space PN of the Euclidean R2 called as the arching. The arch in pure break groups. And here I have Pn of R2 mod out by Zn. This is not the full braid groups, but it's called the intermediate Braid groups that we just put a notation. You wrote the R2. Yes. You were dealing with one Y? No, no, at this moment only with R2. So you're you think that why is it? The target, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. This is. This is okay, but the generalization of this is as follows. Go back here to R2 and increase the group. I'm not generalized this. Generalize this completely for this. Because now, because I'm enlarging the group, for the moment, what we can do is keep this back. But yeah, but that's what is going to be next. I mean, it's project and so on to do the things. Yeah. But Uh, but all I write here will be the same, it's just stick here. But the only thing is that the calculation so far has been done for our picture, right? Okay, so this so here is what you do. This map is comes from the brains. So, what you do here is now you run theta for all possible homomorphisms and you try to see for which ones you can have such a different mixture. So, the answers go. So the answer is going is going to be a classification. Nothing, no. So I will tell you the main theorem. And this, yeah. So the main theorem is this.   Orientable. Okay. You see, I have to do with with the confluence. Is the involution. So, what is the evolution? So, remember that there was one which is special in terms of to send that torsion element. So, you go to the homologous torsion element, and here appears again the same condition. So, that means that outside. That outside of these two conditions, we are able to construct a homomorphism. Now, on the other hand, if this condition holds, that means that You are not able to construct this. Now, let me just focus in this part with one example, just to give you a feeling. It's a combinatorial group theory, in some sense. Of course, the first thing that you have to do is, let's see, one idea, why. Why under the conditions above there there is no site okay? Okay. To begin with, you must have a presentation of this group. You have a presentation of B Z to DN. Well, it has an extra element besides all the Arcting braid groups, A I J, whatever it is. Whatever it is, then you have the relations and so on. But there is one key relation is when you take G to the power n. So this braid here is the one which goes to a generator here. So the power g to the n of this braid, it falls inside in the pure braid groups. And when you make this calculation. And when you make this calculation, this gives a well-known element of the bridge group, which is the full twist. And the full twisted it has an expression which is product. Product j from two to m of a i j of product of a i j i from one to j minus one, blah blah blah. Yes, this is historically thing. And the interesting thing. The interesting thing is this part is that you count how many AIs appear. And the number of AIs which appear in the foot list is 4K plus 1 times 2k plus 1. So this is odd. So, all I have to say is this when you look at the relation What is a surface relation? Here's an example. That's what is the surface relation, C square commutative psi A psi B. I just make an example. Every surface is given by one. Every surface gave by one relation, take the connect sum of three project space. So, this is the relation, and you search, you search for elements psi c, psi a, psi b, such that inside of this group, this relation holds. Okay? All I can tell you is because Because the full twisted here is odd, when you look at this equation in the abelianized, you get a contradiction. That's all. If you want to see more details, it's in archive and so on, but that's what, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let me stop here. Thank you for your attention. So the comment that you said that you start with one side of an action and then you end up with the other side of the action. This is essentially what you're solving with when the group is sticking this. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So the okay, yeah. If yeah, if the group is abelian, it's this thing diagram here works. All you have to do is analyzing the computation. If the group is not abelian, then you we have some feeling what should replace. Feeling what should replace here because then you have to be more careful. First, you have to see how the embedding you can take, because you can have many embeddings of this molly group. For example, we try, we are in process to do one such example where we pick this symmetric group. It's the first non-abelian group, but it's nice because it's a symmetric group. Symmetric group and so Sn here, but then you will see that S you have to embed your group G as S3, and so she should naturally embed the symmetrical group in the cardinality of S3, and so this goes inside of S6 and now. And now, yeah, so this, yeah, we have an expectation that this should be replaced by something here that goes a symmetric group here, and that's, and this is the pure n, yeah, but it's going to be another diagram, and then you. And then you have to face the question to look at all possible embeddings of Zn on Sn to C. And that's, yeah. One comment about this. You may ask why is that interesting that there are actions of non-abelian groups in surface? Non-abelian groups in surface? The answer is yes. There are enough actions of the finite groups in surface because of the following. When you take a surface, let me just take this one to simplify. Surface is this by one. When you take the symmetric group S in this symmetric group. This symmetric group is generated by two permutations: one transposition and the full one. And then I can easily construct a homomorphism from pi one of the surface. One of the surface into Sn, which are subjective because you see the C I send in the transposition one, two, and A and B I send to the same full transposition as in. And of course, the relation holds at Suju. Therefore, the cover, the cover which corresponds now. The cover which corresponds to the kernel, it's a surface while the symmetrical group will act. Therefore, any finite group, it's inside also massive. So there are it's very rich the actions inside so extra design. So actually these are the two directions that we're trying to go. One is the extension for the non-abelian groups. And the other was the thing that you will point out is to put in the second coordinate another surface, which you can use this. Yes, except to except S2E and RP2. Except, yeah, except for the same picture without saying that. Same diagram, yeah. Yeah. So you can do the same thing. We can do the same thing. The only thing is to see how this calculation goes on and so on. If you were playing with non-surfaces, is there any alternative to capture other that's that's we have not touched because it's question of to have this diagram in you know if things are more not k pi one and what you need to say algebraically yeah looks like Looks like that not pi one is enough. Let's let not pi one enough. Yeah, okay. Let me point out one thing. Even in the case that because there are questions also in interesting, when S1 is a surface, the group is S Z2, and the target, for example, For example, there's S2 because you have many classes and so on. So I say, well, in this case, it's not a pay k pi1, the configuration space. But that's not the bad news because you ask, okay, this configuration space F in S. space F in S is configuration space of RP. They are not K pi1, but you may ask if it's not K pi1 at all. So tell me what is the universal cover of it. Turns out it is known independent of VM independent of VM. We discovered this, but for S2, this was already known. Well, known, yeah. And then we also saw that this was this is so you do have some information. And so even this diagram when n is equal to two in certain situations, despite not everything to be k pi one, but knowing this fact. But knowing this fact, you can reverse. But that's that is it. But that thing is good to know because this is interesting for some people who works with space form, because this is an example of homotopy spheres. And the brain groups act freely on these homotopy spheres. Yeah, so it's it's the homotopy sphere because now it's you may simply connect well, it's just three as they say. So these were six three four six questions. So what happens if you take the simplest sign with a million you have to work out this? You have to work out this, you have to compute this intermediate space. Because of the result, so we know exactly what is the embedding, you know exactly what you are going to put as an action on here on the configuration space on the door. I just switch it forward. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I think that most of them vote for that action. It's like this. You can make the restriction if you know the reason. There is one direction that you can do. Because if you know the result for by restrict of Z2, and so there is one direction. But there are other complete picture you only get if you. you only get if you compute blah blah blah d4 of d you keep this and you have to compute this group to study so the so you will not follow everything maybe follow after you have done the whole calculation but The whole calculation, but in principle, you don't know if it's going to follow only from z to but otherwise you you have to go here all right let's thank us forget it.
