In one variable. So here I'm assuming that the coefficients of my polynomial are elements of some given field k, and I will fix a base field little k. So you can think of little k as being the complex numbers, and the big k as being the field generated by the n variables, which are the coefficients. Okay, so let me say a few words about what I mean by solving. That's where all the content is. So by solving, I mean finding a procedure or formula which produces a solution, or better every solution of this polynomial f of x equals 0 for a given set of coefficients. And these terms, procedure, formula, And these terms, procedure, formula, are ambiguous, and they're different ways of making them precise. So let me try to be more specific. But once I specify this formula or procedure, then I'm thinking of some kind of algorithm that at each step produces. Each step produces, so I start with elements of my field and I start with the base field K, and then at each step I perform this procedure, and I produce another element, and then another one, and I went in a finite number of steps to arrive at the solution, or in fact, every solution of this equation. Okay, so the simplest setting is that we're only allowed to perform the four asthmatic operations and nothing else. Operations and nothing else. And in other words, we're asking if roots of this polynomial can be expressed as rational functions in the coefficients. And as everyone knows, if the degree is at least 2 in general, this cannot be done. So the next problem historically is solving polynomial. Is solving polynomials and radicals. So now we're allowed to perform the four arithmetic operations and take radicals of any degree. And in this case, again, we want to obtain every root of this polynomial by using this procedure in a finite number of steps. And again, it is well known that the answer is that this can be done when n is at least. This can be done when n is at most 4 and cannot be done in general if n is at least 5. Okay, so now I want to restate the problem in more geometric ways. So if the polynomial is separable over my field, then I can do it in terms of coverings or torsors. Torsors. So let's consider the Tal algebra E, which is obtained by looking at polynomials modulo F. And if the polynomial is separable, then this is a Natal algebra. So it defines a class in H1 and this class is given. And this class is given by the SN torsor of I should probably take the Galois closure here to actually get the torso. Yeah, so let's take so the so this should be the spec of the Galois closure of E. So the group SN actually acts on it. So geometric. So geometrically, the points of t are the roots. So to solve the polynomial, to get every root is the same thing as to split the stories. So geometrically, the problem that I ask, the two questions that I ask is, is every SN torsor split over field? And the answer is no. Answer is no. And the second question can be restated as follows: Can every s n torsor be split by a solvable field extension? And the answer is the same as before. No if n is at least 5 and yes if n is almost 4. Okay. So next I want to get away from S and torsors and look at torsors for an algebra arbitrary algebraic group. Arbitrary algebraic group. So the same questions can be asked. Is every G torsor over field split? And so G here is defined over little k. Little K is my base field. And the second question is: can every G torsor be split by a solvable extension? And the first question. First question. Well, first of all, if G is a finite group in the usual sense and we think of it as a constant group over K, then the answers are the same as before. So the answer for 1 is no unless G is the trivial group, and the answer to 2 is no unless G is solvable. G itself is solvable. In general, groups are. In general, groups satisfying condition one are called special, and so we're back to the subject matter of Sasha's talk this morning. So these groups have been studied and classified since the 1950s. In particular, in 1958, they were introduced by Sayre and then classified by Grothendieck in the same volume of the Chevrolet seminar. And in particular, Ser showed that the special group is always linear and connected. So, for a finite group, there's only the trivial groups, the only one that's connected. So, if now let's focus on question two. So if G is connected, then 2 has a positive answer in many cases. But in general, it's an open problem. So more specifically, let's look at PGLN. So now we're asking: can every central simple algebra or field be split by a solvable extension of that field? That was an open problem. Field that was an open problem for several decades and is one of the consequences of the Mikurio-Susaning theorem. So the answer is yes in this case. And so more generally, we have the following theorem due to tits. So if G is an ohma simple linear group over a field K, so here G is a group over big K. In my setup, G was a group over little K. G was a group over little k and then I base changed it to big k when I wanted to consider torsors. So if g is a simple group of any type other than e8, then any g torsor can be split by a root extension. So in characteristic zero, a root extension is the same thing as a solvable extension. So root extension means that we're allowed to adjoin roots. And then kids asked whether this is true if G is of type E8 and this problem is still open. And so I learned of this question from Ser about maybe twenty-five years ago. 25 years ago. And Sarah told me that there are two schools of thought on this. There are some people who believe that this is true, and then there's some people who believe that something, that this is not true, but something slightly weaker is true. And that this slightly weaker assertion is stated here as question two in my slides. So I will say that the Feynman group is almost solved. The finite group is almost solvable if its composition factors are either cyclic or A5. So, for solvable, we're only allowing cyclic composition factors, but here there's a small non-cyclic factor that we allow. And then, question two, which I assume is also due to tips, is it true that every EA torsor over a field can be split by a Galois extension with an Extension with an almost solvable Galois group. So apparently most people believe that either one or two is true, but we're very far from being able to prove either of those statements. Okay, so since questions one and two are out of reach at the moment, I will weaken the question a bit more. Weaken the question a bit more. I'll keep doing that until I can actually say something. So, okay, so you may say that's not really okay to start with a difficult problem and then replace it by an easier question and then solve a special case of that easier question. But my excuse in this case is that this easier question That this easier question is actually also has classical roots that are as deep or arguably even deeper than the ones for solving polynomials and radicals, even though it has been a little bit out of fashion in the past 100 years or so. So specifically, I want to ask if every g torsor can be split by five or ten torts. For a given positive integer d. And I will define what this means in them. So in particular, all solvable extensions are of level one, so I'm allowing a bigger class of extensions. So the new problem is related to the algebraic form of Hilbert's 13th problem. For a finite group, this new problem is. Finite group, this new problem is harder than it. So I'm actually not making it easier uniformly. I'm only making it easier for connected groups. For finite groups, I'm making it harder. There is no result analogous to this classical theorem of Abu Ruffini and Galois about solvability of polynomials and radicals. But for a connected group, and specifically for EA, Group and specifically for E8, this problem will become more excessive. Okay, so let me go back to A5. So remember in the second version of Tid's question, I allowed solvable extensions and degree 5 extensions. So let's take a closer look. So this is a very old result. Long before Hilbert and long before Galois. Hilbert and long before Galois, even. So, this is due to Bring, a Swedish mathematician. So, a polynomial of degree five can be solved if we allow the four arithmetic operations and this operation. This operation. So solving a polynomial of this form. So let's take a closer look at this operation. So what I want to say is that this operation of solving a 50-degree polynomial of this form is kind of similar to extracting the fifth root of t. Right? Extracting the fifth root of t. Extracting the fifth root of t is solving the polynomial t to the fifth power minus x to the fifth power minus t equals zero. And this is only slightly more complicated. So the one thing they have in common is that they both rely on one parameter only. There's only t. So in classical language, every root of such a polynomial is called an algebraic function in one parameter, or in one variable. So this is what they have in common. Roots of this polynomial and roots of this polynomial. They're both algebraic functions in only one variable. So informally speaking, this So informally speaking, this field extension is of level less than or equal to one if it can be obtained by adjoining algebraic functions of at most one variable. In other words, the operation that I want to allow in solving polynomials is, so instead of just extracting roots, oops, instead of just solving polynomials of this form, I allow solving polynomial I allow solving polynomial any polynomial where the coefficients are all lie in the field of transcendence degree at most one. Okay, so let me now do this more formally. Yeah, in particular, according to Brink's theorem, every field extension of degree less than or equal to five is of level less than or equal to one. Than or equal to one. Okay, so let's do this more formally. So I want to recall the definition of essential dimension of a field extension. So the essential dimension of a field extension is less than or equal to D if there is an intermediate field of A naught such that K0 such that this L is induced from a field extension of K0 and the transcendence degree of K0 is less than or equal to D. So the exact value is the minimum here, but I'm really only interested in the inequality being less than or equal to t. So if this extension is separable, then this inequality is equal to 0. Is separable, then this inequality is just a formal way of saying that L is generated over k by a single algebraic function in less than or equal to t variables. That algebraic function is a generator of L naught over k0. Okay, and now I want to define the level. So I'm allowed to construct a tower. Construct a tower of such extensions where each one is given by is of level less than or equal to t. In other words, it's defined by a polynomial. It's the root extension of a polynomial where the coefficients are in a field of transcendence degree less than or equal to d over little k. So I may not get L exactly, but I just want to be able to get To feel this way that contains our So this is a new class of fields that's larger than solvable extensions, the new class of field extensions. I just want to warn you that there are no examples, there are no known examples where this level is greater than, strictly greater than. Is greater than, strictly greater than 1. So constructing such an example would be equivalent to solving the algebraic version of Hilbert's 13th problem. So everything that you should take, everything I say past this point was a grain of salt because there's this elephant in the world. Okay, so now I'm ready to define the resolvent degree of an algebraic The resolvent degree of an algebraic group, and the resolvent degree is the minimal level. Oops, that's a title. So this should be level of L over K. So it's the minimal level of a splitting field. So if a torsor can be split by a solvable extension, that number is at most one. So then the resolvent degree of D is the maximal value of the resolvent degree of T, where T ranges over all possible torsors over fields, over all field extensions of our base unit. So it's worst case scenario. And if one takes a versal torsor, that will give that maximum value. So this is a numerical invariant of the group. And for finite groups, this is exactly Hilbert's problem for the symmetric group. So this problem was, it goes back centuries. It goes back at least to the 18th century and probably beyond that. Probably beyond that. But it was sort of formalized recently by Brouwer. It was Brouwer's, the subject matter of Brouwer's last paper from 1975, and then more extensively by Farm and Wolfson. They use the term resolvent degree instead of the level. So the term level is taken from an earlier April by Dixme. It takes me. So the Hilbert's 13th problem is to find the resolvent degree of a symmetric group as in this case. So very little is known. So for polynomials of degree up to five, we know that one parameter is enough. So the result in degrees one. And then then it's not known whether this number goes to infinity when n increases and it's not even known if the resolvent degree of sn is bigger than 1 for any n as i mentioned before so but there are some upper bounds and so so Dix Meer's paper discussed So Dixmeer's paper describes some of the attempts at the upper bound. So they're all of this form: n minus epsilon of n, where epsilon of n is an unbounded but very slowly increasing function of n. And so Dioxmeer describes classical bounds of this type in his paper, and they go back to Hamilton and then Sylvia. Hamilton and then Sylvester and then Hilbert and then Sigray and then Brower and as Dixmeer explained some of the older bounds were forgotten so the strongest ones are actually among those are actually due to Hamilton and they were rediscovered in weaker form by other people and then more recently Wolfson sharpened these bones again of the same form but Balance again of the same form, but was epsilon a little bit bigger. And then his student Sutherland has some even stronger bounds. But it is a little bit discouraging, but the best we can do is this, and then we don't even know if it can be bigger than one. So Hilbert's, the algebraic form of Hilbert's 13th problem is. Of Hilbert's 13th problem is basically there hasn't been much progress made, I would say ever. Hilbert actually stated this question for continuous functions rather than algebraic functions. And for continuous functions, it was solved by Kolmogorov and Arnold in the 50s. But their theorem has nothing to do with polynomials. Their theorem has nothing to do with polynomials. It's just about an arbitrary continuous function being expressed as a composition of continuous functions and one variable in addition. And then Arnold argued for many years that what Gilbert really had in mind was the algebraic form. And he popularized this algebraic form, but not. He also claimed at some point that everything that he's done in mathematics that he In mathematics, but he had done in mathematics. He said that fairly late in his career, he was motivated by Hilbert's, by the algebraic form of Hilbert's 13th problem. Okay. So now I want to describe my results. So let me start with dependence on the base field. So the first theorem is that if I change the base field, so go from k to a larger field, k prime, then the resolvent degree doesn't change. So if k prime is algebraic over k, this is Over k, this is very easy, and this was known to the classics because any algebraic element over k has is contained in a field of level zero. It satisfies some algebraic equation with coefficients in k itself. So I can throw in any algebraic equation. I can throw in any algebraic element for free, essentially, without increasing the level. So the real content of this theorem is that K prime can be arbitrary. So in particular, the resolvent degree over Q is the same as the resolvent degree over C. So this is in particular this applies to the symmetric group. Okay. And so the second theorem is requires some additional assumptions on the group. So it has to be defined over the integers, the connected component should be split-reductive, and the component group should be finite over the integers. But the important thing here is that the split reductive group Here is that the split reductive group, say connected split reductive group satisfies these conditions, a definite group satisfies these conditions. So at least it covers those two cases. And in this case, so if k is an arbitrary field of characteristic zero and k prime is an arbitrary field, then Then the resolvent degree over k is the so you see one advantage of having the group defined over the integers is that I can specialize it to any field. The fields don't have to be related to each other. And so the resolvent degree over any field of characteristic zero will be the same, right? The first theorem. It's the same as it is over Q. And then I can compare it to the Can compare it to the resolvent degree of the same group over a field of prime characteristic. And I get something that's no bigger than characteristic zero. So this is primarily interesting and mixed characteristic because if the characteristics are the same, then again, by the first thing we actually have a quality here, not just an inequality. But in general, we have an inequality. Is this inequality a restrict? Well, Equality are restricts. Well, I suppose if the group is not, so one can have a situation where this is one and this is zero. But I don't know if any of these numbers can be bigger than one. So in that sense, I don't know if it can be straight. Okay. Okay. Okay, and then the third theorem is really the main theorem for this talk. So if G is connected, then I claim that there is all in degrees at most phi. So in particular, so for the symmetric group, we don't know for Sn we don't know whether it tends to infinity as n increases or not. But Increases or not. But for connected groups, we know that it's bounded uniformly. And the group doesn't need to be smooth or linear. So this is quite a bit stronger than what's known for symmetric groups or for Feynman groups. And I guess this is related to. So if G is a simple group of any type other than E8, this follows from the theorem of tits that I mentioned earlier. Because those torsors can be split by a solvable extension, unsolvable extensions are level at most one. So let me just describe the steps involved in the proof right now. Steps involved in the proof, but I'm not going to give any details on any of this. But first, we use theorem one to reduce to the case where k is algebraically closed. Then we reduce to the case where g is smooth by studying this sequence in terminology. So the point is that we can pass to the perfect closure of the field because that only involves taking roots. because that only involves taking roots and these extensions are of level one at most and then over over perfect field so so the the point is that this as we go as we go from g to g reduced the resolving degree cannot Resolvent degree cannot get bigger. And then, so once, then we handle the case of an abelian variety using the fact that every torsor for A comes from A D for some D, and A D is a final group, finite abelian group. Then we use the Chevrolet structure theorem to reduce to the case where G's are fine. G is affine. So I just indicated which exact sequence I studied. Then we reduced to the case where G is semi-simple by using the fact that the radical is special, so it has resolvent degree zero. Then we reduce to the case where G is simple, and then for simple groups, And then for simple groups, we apply the stereom of tits to reduce to the case of E8. And then in the case of E8, there is some work that I did with the while group of E8 using some of the same tricks that were used for upper bounds for SN in this setting. So that's how I got far. That talk. So, conjecturally, I think that 5 should really be 1 and everything works with 1. All the proof, everything works with 1 except for the last step was the 8. So, this is my conjecture. And And again, using the steps that I didn't spell out for you, but you believe me, then it suffices to only do the case of or case the complex numbers. By the way, the part where I refer to tits can be simplified quite a bit by reducing, so using theorems one and two to reduce to the case where the base field is the complex numbers. Complex numbers. So in Titz's proof, the most delicate steps have to do with finite characteristic, and here I don't need them. So for the theorem, but also for the conjecture, one can reduce to this case. And then I just want to point out, perhaps this is obvious, that this theorem That this theorem, theorem three and conjecture four in the same spirit as the questions of tits that we considered earlier. So let me just remind, there are two questions. One has to do with solvable splitting extensions, the other with almost solvable. And either one of them is stronger than conjecture four because solvable extensions are of level one. Are level one and conjecture four is stronger clearly than theorem three. So the first two I can't prove. The first two are conjectural, they're stronger, but the weakest of these three I can actually prove was five instead of one. And now since I felt I needed to give a proof, Felt I needed to prove something in the talk. I want to give some evidence for conjecture four. So what I want to prove specifically is that it follows from a long-standing conjecture of SER. So the conjecture of SAR says that if we have a torsor, a G torsor over a field, and G is a smooth algebraic group. Algebraic group, and we can split this torsor by field extensions of relatively prime degrees, finite number of field extensions of relatively prime degrees, then I was split to begin with. So here is my observation. Observation. So if G is the simple group of type E8 over C, and if Sayre's conjecture holds for G, then conjecture 4 holds. Then I can replace 5 and my inequality by 1. And this is the so the proof is just by putting together some known results about the Ross invariant. Rose invariant. So, first we reduce, we reduce again using the same arguments as before, we reduce to the case where G is a simple group of type E8 over the complex numbers. And situation I prove that if we assume Sayre's conjecture, then every G torsor, EA torsor split. Splits over a solvably closed field. So it means it splits over some solvable extension and that is of resolving degree one. So in this case, it will imply conjecture four. So to prove this, I will construct final splitting extensions, four of them, k2. Four of them, k2, k3, k5, and k greater than or equal to 7, such that the degree of this extension is prime to p, so where p is 5, 3 or 2, 3, or 5, and the degree of the last field extension as prime to is not divisible by any prime greater than or equal to seven. Greater than or equal to 7. So this last field, k greater than or equal to 7, its existence follows from the fact that the exceptional primes for E8 are 2, 3, and 5. So this is a general theorem due to Tits, that there is an extension of degree divisible only by the exceptional primes of the group that splits every torso. And for every torso, we can find an extension like this that splits it. Like this, that splits it. So, here I'm not even using the assumption that k is solvably closed. So, for k3, to construct k3, consider the mod3 Rust invariant. So, by the Block-Auth conjecture, H3 is split by a solvable extension because the product is generated by symbols and By symbols, and each symbol can be split by a root extension. So, splitting all the symbols involved, we see that over a solvably closed extension, H3 is trivial. In other words, our torsor T lies in the kernel of the Ma3 Ross invariant, and then by a theorem of Chenus of this This torsor can be split by some field extension of degree prime to 3, and I call this field extension K3. And then for K5, K5 is constructed in the same way as K3. Of course, there's another paper by Valoid Chernusso that handles this case, so I'm making it sound easier than it actually is. But modulo is. But modulo modularities work, it is the same. And then for K2, I need to work a little harder. So again, T lies in the kernel of the mod 4 bust invariant. And there's another invariant called the Simonev invariant from the kernel of the mod 4 bust invariant to H5 with coefficients in μ2. And μ2, and that also, so RT lies in the kernel of R4, but then it also lies in the kernel of the second map because all of the Dalook homology groups vanish over a solidly closed field. And then I, by theorem of Nikita Simonov, T then splits over an odd degree extension, which I call K2. So I've constructed. So I've constructed k2, k3, k5, and k greater than or equal to 7, and they have relatively prime degrees, and therefore, because for each prime p, it doesn't divide the degree of at least one of them. And so then if I assume Serge's conjecture, that means that T was already split. So, did I actually prove Tits gave a pa did I give a positive answer to Tits' question for E8 torsors assuming Sears' conjecture, well not quite, only in characteristic zero, right? Because Simone's theorem is only valid in characteristic zero and I used it, that that was that was the most important ingredient in my proof. Important ingredient in my proof. So, what did I do in prime characteristic? I used theorem 2 to reduce to characteristic 0. And theorem 2 only tells me that the resolving degree is less than or equal to 1. It doesn't tell me that it's split by solvable extension. So, in characteristic 0, indeed, this same argument shows that Sears conjecture implies a positive answer to. It's question one. So that's that's all I have. Thank you. Are there any questions, comments? Yes? Remind us how the proof goes that the resolve integrity is bounded by one for a billion variants. Bounded by one for a billion varieties. You went over it very quickly, but you so for the point is that every torsor for A is deduced from a torsor. For A is deduced from a torsor for AD. So, this is proved in Silverman's book on elliptic curves, for example. I mean, in that book, the argument is in the case where A is an elliptic curve, but it works in exactly the same way here. So, AD is in a good situation. I'm working over the complex numbers, it's an abelian group. It's an abelian group, so it's solvable. One has to. So if I'm not in characteristic zero, but the field is not algebraically closed, I can always go to the algebraic closure, as I said, because adjoining some algebraic element is harmless in this setting. It's essential dimension zero, so it's zero, so it's so in characteristic P, it's a little bit more involved. So I used some lemmas from the previous step where the group is not smooth to reduce to the case where the group is smooth. So that's it's it's not difficult, but it's not completely obvious either. But in in characteristic zeros it's In characteristic zero, it's not difficult. And then for an exact sequence like this, when you have, so what you can do is, so H1, say here, if you know it can be split by an extension of level less than or equal to t, then you go up to that extension and then this becomes trivial. And then this becomes trivial. The H1 becomes trivial, and then you do it here. So you just have a two-step tower. So then you put an upper bound on what's in the middle. The group is in the middle. So I use these kinds of tricks. So in this theorem, if G is fire, is it interesting? Because in the second point, if we're using the spin. The second point, if we're just to well it has to be connected. Okay, so if it's fine and connected, then we're just to the case where it's because it's not so if Yeah, so if it you mean you want to do one of the steps in the case where the group is not connected. Like reducing to the smooth case? Did I understand your question? My question is: if we start with a kinetic algebraic group that is also finite, then it cannot be smooth, right? Right. Right, so then step two advice. So it's, I think, if you go from G to G reduced, then G to G reduced, then it, so it's the maximum of the resolvent degree of G and 1. So if you know that G reduced is the resolvent degree is less than or equal to 1, then you know that the resolvent degree of G is less than or equal to 1. And that is true, I believe, even if G is not equal to G. Any questions or comments? Yes, please. I'm just curious about the skate of the R and this stronger conjecture, maybe that the cohomogeneal dimension of the maximum solo of extension is one. Has anything happened recently? Don't think so. In when you prove in what is the algebraic function that pi valuable to I oh you mean the specific I mean I'm asking is there a specific function that Is there a specific function that you know something similar to the I don't remember 17B something? Yes, it is very similar. Yes, so the So the while group of E8 is a reflection group, just like SA. So the so what I did is I So what I did is I applied some of the same tricks that were used for Sn to prove upper balance on the resolving degree of Sn to the action of this while group of E8 on the Cartan algebra, A-dimensional Cartan algebra of type E8. And so for Sn, the invariance The invariance are these elementary symmetric functions. So they're the coefficients of my polynomial. For E8, there are these fundamental invariants of there are eight of them. So they are of degree Arthur Go, four, and the highest one I think is of degree 30. Highest one, I think, is of degree 30. And so, what I showed is that one can reduce to the case where two of them are zero and then projectivize. So, that's how the three, I subtracted three from eight. But if you just want eight instead of five, then one doesn't need to bother with these invariants, then it just follows that the fact that That the fact that the resolvent degree is less than or equal to 8 follows in a similar manner to saying that the resolvent degree of Sn is less than or equal to n. So you just take this dimension and you pull over 8 dimension out of space and then you just cut it. So you projectivize and you set If I degree two invariant and the next one, I think of degree one and degree four, you set them both to zero. So it's the function field of that variety that's obviously five dimensions. Are there questions or comments? Thank you, Speaker, again. Are there any questions from Okay, so a couple of comments. First of all, there is a scheduled change, as you know, for the afternoon. So the first call is pointed by Misha Warburg of the Rock Homology Bill back to groups. And then we have an early lunch today, starting at 11. An early lunch today, starting at 11:30, and then for those of you that want.
