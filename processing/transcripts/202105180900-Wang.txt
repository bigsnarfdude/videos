So it's my pleasure to introduce Yi Wong from Johns Hopkins. She's talking about rigidity of local minimizers of the sigma 2 functional. Yeah, thank you, Paul, and thank you. Thanks for the invitation. And it's my great pleasure to give this talk here. And thanks for those. And thanks for those of you who need to stay late. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about the rigidity of local minimizer of the sigma k functional and non-sharp Soplev trace inequality. This is a joint work with Jeffrey Case, who is also in the audience. So the sigma k operator, just very briefly, it means that the k is elementary symmetric function of case elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of symmetric matrix A. And throughout this talk, I will consider two different situations. One is that the matrix A denotes the hash of some function u on the Euclidean space. And another situation is when A denotes some geometric quantity, basically the Shouten tensor. Tensor. So we're going to restrict ourselves in certain classes of matrices. So the gamma kcong denotes the matrix A such that it satisfies the sigma A, sigma 1 of A is positive and all the way to sigma K of A is positive. So that on this special On this special class of cones, the sigma k operator satisfies certain properties. So the specific property that we're going to make use of in fully nonlinear equations is the following are the following. One is that the sigma k operator is really an elliptic operator. And another thing is that the sigma k operator is operator. Another thing is that the sigma k to the power 1 over k. So this is a concave function in terms of the argument, which is the matrix. Okay, so the property two is very important in order to apply the Evans-Kriloff regularity. Namely, we would be able to obtain the C2 alpha regularity from C2 regularity. So in other words, we don't need to worry about In other words, we don't need to worry about higher order irregularities once we get C2. So the geometric setting that I mentioned a little bit earlier is that we consider the sigma k of the Shouten tensor. So we on a Riemannian manifold, so sometimes we could consider manifolds with boundary, but sometimes we just consider a closed manifold, depending on the context. So the So the geometric integral, so the integral is the integral of the sigma k of the Shelton tensor. And Shelton tensor arrives, sorry, the Shelton tensor arise naturally in the decomposition of the remaining curvature tensor. So the definition is that it is Is some linear combination of Ricci curvature tensor and the scalar curvature tensor. So, why do people consider this quantity is because this is a natural generalization of the so-called Yamabi problem. So, when k is equal to one, that's just some multiple of some scalar multiple of the short of the scalar. Of the shelter of the scalar curvature. And this so this is the functional that we see in the Yamabi invariant. Okay, so the the so the if we want to write down the equation of this variational problem, so that would be the prescribing scalar curvature equation. prescribing scalar curvature equation. And the operator associated to this scalar prescribing scalar equation in the conformal, in the same conformal class is this one. So Lg denotes the conformal Laplacian operator. And this equals some constant Cn times R hat, where R hat is the prescribed scalar curvature, and times U to the critical power. u to the critical power m plus 2 divided by m minus 2. So the generalized Yamabi problem is to consider the sigma k equals some constant or sigma k equals some prescribed given function f. So here, if we write down the conformal change, The conformal change, the gw equals e to the 2w times the background metric g. So then the corresponding symmetric matrix of this sigma k is just given by this formula. And as you can see, this involves, of course, the background shelton tensor, the shelton tensor of the background metric, as well as Background metric, as well as some second-order derivative of the conformal factor W. And the leading order term is exactly the sigma k of hash and of w. So this functional was first introduced by Verkovsky in 2000, and he proved that this problem is variational. Problem is variational if k is one or two, or the background metric is locally conformally flat. So the Ola-Lagrangian equation is given by this one. In other words, when n is not equal to 2k, then the corresponding Ola-Lagrangian, sorry, the Ola-Lagrangian equation is sigma k of g. Is sigma k of g equals some constant. So this PD has been studied by a lot of people. So I put some of the previous works here. Of course, I'm not able to list all of them. So the problem that we consider that we consider regarding the sigma k is that we would like to know what happens if the the domain has boundary or the manifold has boundary. So in other words, we would like to know what is the suitable boundary condition that we need to give to the sigma k problem. And of course, And of course, there are all different types of boundary operators. So we could just consider the Dirichlet boundary operator. We could also consider Neumann boundary operator. But here we would like to develop some more some other boundary operators so that it associated with sigma k operator in the interior so that the functional satisfies. The functional satisfies certain Dirichlet principle. So, this is the main goal in our mind when the k equals one. So, of course, we know it is a well-known, this is just the well-known Diruchelet principle for the Dirichlet energy. So, the Diruchelet principle for the Laplace operator could be For the Laplace operator, could be just written in this way: the minus u times Laplace U integration plus integration of u times un on the boundary is minimized by uf, where uf is just the harmonic extension of the boundary data f. So why does it have anything to do? Why does it have anything to do with the sigma k operation? anything to do with the sigma k operator is because if you look at this term here the first one here that is in the form of the the k hash energy so it's like minus u times the sigma k of u sigma k of hash of u when k equals one so the main theorem that we prove um as the first step is this dirichlet Is this Dirichlet principle for the sigma k operator? So basically, we could define our operator BK such that when it is paired with the sigma k operator in the interior, it satisfies this Deutsche Leux principle. And just like what we expected to be true, this functional on the left-hand side is minimized. So this whole thing, oops. I mean, the whole thing on the left-hand side of this inequality 5 is minimized when it's minimized by some function uf, where this uf is the solution of the sigma k equation with Dirichlet boundary condition. So that's exactly what we wanted to be true, because that's exactly the case when k equals 1. 1k equals 1 for the for the well-known different principle. Okay, because of the time, so I'm not going to go into this problem, how to give the proof of the proof of this problem. So let me just skip this technical part and let me. And let me just continue with the geometric corresponding problem of the similar type. So this setting is the geometric setting in which we consider sigma k of the Schelton tensor instead of sigma k of Hessian of a function u. So So in this setting, actually what we did in our subsequent paper is that we find the Dirichlet principle for the sigma k of Schelton tensor. So we consider the sigma k of g u plus the integration of sigma k g u plus the integration of the h k on the boundary of this manifold. And this is And this is minimized when u is taken to be uf, where uf is the solution of the equation 10. So here, hk is something that you could think of as higher order or fully nonlinear mean curvature. So the definition is a little bit complicated. So, the definition is a little bit complicated, but it is just a combination of the Schelton tensor restricted to the tangent space of the boundary together with some second fundamental form. The expression is explicit, but I'm not going to put it here. So, HK was initially defined by Sophie Chen. Defined by Sophie Chen, and she used that to study some boundary sigma k problem. So let me just remark here that when k equals one, this is exactly the S cobalt Yamabi functional on manifolds with boundary. So the interior is about the integration of the scalar curvatures, so that's a functional. So that's the functional, the Yamabi functional. And the boundary term is the integration of the mean curvature. Okay, so again, we use some functional analysis method based on the conformal invariance to study this problem, but I'm not going to go into the detail of the proofs. So here So here, let me just make a very quick remark that in contrast to the previous case, the proof of this problem highly relies on the construction, well, highly relies on the usage of the conformal covariant operator LK and BK. So this is something that we didn't see, we did not see in We did not see in the previous Euclidean case. So, although the formal presentation of these two theorems that I've just presented seems to be very similar. However, the proofs of these two theorems are quite different. So, they're based on very different things. So, one is simply a lot of A lot of one simply some inductive argument about the symmetric properties of the sigma k. The other one uses the conformal covariance and invariance very intensively. So the so the so the last part that I will So, the last part that I would like to talk about is about the properties of these functionals that we introduced in these previous two results. So we really like to understand not just constructing this new functional, but also would like to know whether there's any geometric implications of those newly introduced functionals. So, what we did is that we considered the Um, is that we consider the rigidity theorem, and we noticed that the algebra is really complicated, so we only consider the sigma k for k equals 2. What was in our mind is that we know by previous results that when k equals 1, this is known. So, we really want to develop similar results for k equals 2. So, okay, so here is the theorem. Okay, so here is the theorem. When n equals 3, 4, 5, and we consider the closed unit ball in the Euclidean Rn plus 1, and we consider G as a metric in this special class C1, in which the sigma 1 of the Shelton tensors, so basically you can think of Gu, sigma 1, GU as the sigma 1 of Schelton tensor, and H1 of this Schelton tensor of GU2. One of the Schauten tensor of GU to be positive. So when the metric G is the local minimizer of this functional, S2 denotes this one where K equals 2, then the only metric that satisfies this property is the flat metric up to a conformal transformation. Transformation. So, this is a rigidity result. We really expect that it is true for all dimensions. And however, so far we could only prove it for lower dimensions, three, four, and five. And I guess the reason is just somehow you would be able. You would be able to see in the proof that in those lower dimensions, we could see a way to break up the terms so that we could get for each term, there's some rigidity. But for higher dimensions, we have no clue how to group the terms. So, it might just be technical difficulties, but so far, this is the most that we could get. So the let me just give a little bit stretch of sorry scratch of what was in our argument. So the main idea that we use in this proof is the Frank Lieb's argument of commutators. So it is called commutators, but it's simply it is some kind of a formal is some kind of a formal commutator that I will introduce in a minute. So basically what happens is that because it is a local minimizer, so there would be a second variation formula and for the local minimizer. And so that means that there is some inequality and from And from the inequality, what you can actually derive is that you could derive this clean formula and in which this bracket here that looks like the Lie bracket is defined as it's defined as something like this. So just to replace L4 by L2. So L2x simply means 2x simply means it acts on one argument, one function u, and it acts this way. So L2 of x times u minus x times L2 acting on the u. So the x is just viewed as an operator. It means that this function x multiply on the function u. And L4 is a differential operator, of course. So this inequality is true, but it is not true for arbitrary minimizer u, but it only is true for functions u that satisfies the following balance condition. Balanced condition means that the integration of xi times u to the power 2 over minus 1 equals 0 on the boundary. So this one, one can actually show that for One can actually show that for any function u, you could always make do the conformal transformation so that this condition is true. So even though this is not true for arbitrary local minimizers, it is true up to a conformal transformation. So this argument works perfectly for k equals one, and our main work is to Our main work is to run this argument for k equals 2 in the dimensions 3, 4, and 5. So we consider L4 instead of L2 and B3 instead of B1 in this case when K equals 2. And basically, what we did is that we proved. What we did is that we proved this proposition. So, under the balanced condition, we could show that the formula 16 holds. So it seems to be exactly what is going on for K. So very, it seems to be analogous to what to be analogous to what what was going on for k equals one so this one did imply that uh so this one did imply that uh the rigidity of the metric so let me just let me just use the last uh oh did i run out of time um maybe just one minute so go ahead One minute. So, okay, so we also have proved the solvent tracing quality for the functional that we define for k equals 2. So, what do I mean is that we consider the functional. So, this E2 is just the S2 that appeared earlier. So, it's the functional of this one, but in terms of the This one, but in terms of the function u, but not the metric g. Okay, so e2 of u, if you think of it as some kind of energy term that contains the interior integral of the sigma 2 together with the integration of h2 on the boundary, you would believe that you would expect that it bounces. You would expect that it bounds some LP norm over the boundary. So, this is indeed the case. And the theorem that we proved is that there exists some constant. And so far, we could not get any sharp constant. We could only get some constant said that this inequality is true. So, in other words, the L P for P equals 4. P for P equals 4 over n minus 3. So this L P norm of U is bounded from above by the E2 of U that we defined in this study. So I will not go into the proof of that and the last one is the project. And the last one is just so all of these problems you need to consider, you need to distinguish between the critical dimension and the non-critical dimension. And in all of the cases that we considered, whatever is true, whatever is proved in the non-critical dimension also holds in the critical dimension. But the formula of the theorem is a little bit different. Theorem is a little bit different in the critical dimension. Okay, so I guess I will just stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. All right. Questions? So in your last theorem, in your statement of your last result, you do not need to assume this you satisfy. You satisfy this sigma two equal to zero. You do not, this is for all you. No, yeah, this is for all you. This is more like a functional space inequality, like the soplev inequality. But because it involves the boundary data, so we call it soplev trace type of. So you expect in be a temp by your UOF. You have a minimizer. Uh, you have a minimizer in that class in your first theory, okay. I'm sorry, yes, yeah. Yeah, so this one, if you consider the uh Ola-Lagrangian equation, yeah, so it would be set, so you would have something like uh okay, so maybe you need to prescribe the integration of the boundary. integration of the boundary and then under that in in that class you you would have a sigma k of the interior equals okay sure some constant times u to the power yeah okay so you do have a formulation of your first two theorem for k equal to m over two To M over 2 case. You do have for formula. A equals 2 case, yes. That's right. So everything when you have the non-critical dimensional case and the formula for the critical dimensional case would be a little bit different, but the results still pose. Yeah. I see. Sure. Hello, hi, this is Rupert Frank. Hi, thanks for this very nice talk. Thank you. I was wondering about these Sobolev inequalities that you presented at the end. Do you have a conjecture about what the optimal constant would be? Or, I mean, the optimal function u is probably. Yeah, that's a good, very good question. Well, I guess we don't really know. So, of course, we could write down the Ola-Lagrangian equation, but then so if, but then I guess we would, we would, we would guess that there is some ODE, right? So it's a radially symmetric one, and that, that, uh, that, that, and then we reduce it to a ODE, and that ODE has solution. Has solution. Yes, that would be a natural way to attack the problem. Yeah. Yeah. And like Alice said before, you would first want to prove that there exists a minimizer. So that would be a first step. Then you would prove radial symmetry and then you want to do an ODE analysis. But yeah, right. Right, we have thought about this problem, but just like what you mentioned, that when you're trying to do the existence of the minimizer, you need to consider about the minimizing sequence. And the problem is that this E2 of U involves the sigma 2, of course, and H2. And we are not able to really obtain like compactness result. Compactness result under this sequence. So, namely, if we have a minimizing sequence, we really want to see that there exists a U infinity such that U infinity is satisfy certain regularities such that it's E2 of U is also, I mean, I mean, you. I mean, I mean, u satisfies the sigma q equation, right? So that needs certain regularity, but we don't really obtain that from the minimizing sequence because of the lack of the compactness. Yes. Anyway, thanks again for your talk. Very nice. Yeah, thank you.
