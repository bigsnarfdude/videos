I talked about a project I'm working on, so um, mutational signatures to basically distinguish the effects of the damage processes from mister Ray. And so we've already seen a lot of signature stuff. It's the same story as always. We start with some mutational catalog and we're hoping to go from the left side of the slide to the right and figure out what are the components sort of mutational processes and the levels at which they're presently solved in these percentages. Which they're presently smelling as percentages, which we're all using as activities. And the mental model that we've been working with so far is that mutational, rather, point mutations accumulate as sort of a function of this two-step process where some damage occurs, DNA lesion follows, and the vast majority of the time, this is correctly repaired and we never observe it at all in the data. And so the only time that we actually see a mutation. That we actually see a mutation in our whole genome sequencing data is when some sort of misrepair process has occurred. And so the thinking is: if these are separate processes, they deserve separate signatures, and we'd like to come up with a model to capture this. So we took this idea and we just had a look at the COSMIC database and basically just rewrote all of these cosmic signatures in terms of their damage and misrepair profiles. The way that I've done this is marginalizing over. That I've done this is marginalizing over the substitution or the trinucleotide, respectively. And what we found was a whole bunch of redundancy. And what I mean by that is we found many different signatures that had very similar looking profiles. So at the top here, I have an example of two signatures that have quite different looking damage, but very similar misrepair. And then we also have examples of the opposite with very similar looking damage, but quite different looking misrepair. But quite different looking misrepair profiles. And the way we're going to model this, we've talked a lot about NMF already, so it should look familiar. What we're doing is more probabilistic. So I'll show how we're modeling just one row in this genome by mutation count matrix here. So for each genome, we have y, which is the count vector of mutation types, modeled as a multinomial where n is the number of. As a multinomial, where n is the number of mutations in the genome, k is 96, that's our number of mutation types. And then we have probability p of each mutation type of this genome. So if we were doing topic modeling, this p would just be a Dirichlet distribution, or rather, p would be drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. What we've done is make a little bit more, sort of parameterize P in a way that is a little bit more complicated in order to be able. Bit more complicated in order to be able to tease out the effects of damage and misrepair. And so, the way that we've done this is given a, going from this mutational catalog, we have some damage process activities, and we also have an association matrix that sort of gives us conditional activities for each misrepair and connects it with each damage. And this model is called Demeta. This demonstrated allocation of mutations, and it's exactly what I just said. We have this observed count vector. And then we're going to be parametrizing this p vector by the damage portion. And I have credecker product here, but really just the C's and the T's match up is what this does for us. And we're going to be going through the association. Going through the association matrix to control the level of misrepair signature in each sample. You'll notice we have this genome-specific theta, which is the damage activities, and then each genome also has its own association matrix. So we fit this to 18,000 whole genomes and we extracted 18 damage signatures and 6 misrepair signatures. And six misrepair signatures. Here I'm just showing the damage signatures. There's a lot of sort of familiar-looking ones. We have SPS1, clock-like signature, a couple of apabets. What you won't see up here is the flat SPS-5 signature. It's not because it's not there at all. In fact, our model seems to be sort of combining the multiple damage signatures and misrepairs in order to get back SPS-5, so it doesn't sort of get its own specific single damage proof. Own specific single damage profile. Can you tell us anything about the clinical features of the tumors that you looked at? I have sort of variable information. Mostly PFOG is what I have access to, but we've also fit this using HMF and the Genomics England football. So there's sort of a variety of different like pre-treatment, post-treatment, meds, primaries. Primaries. Where I was going with that is, of course, you've got some obvious drug things here. I don't see radiation, which might indicate like this is primarily a surgical color and stuff like that. So it would be useful for interpretation to know what treatments you did have and which ones you didn't. So what the negative landscape might look like. Yeah, so these are just labeled based on the closest cosmic signature. They're not like for confirmed ideologies by any means. They're just this is what this signature looks similar to. This is what the signature looks similar to in the damaged space. You do not see a smoking related signature. Smoking does come up. It's not the closest in any of these damages, but we do see smoking does match in this misrepair for quite strong. So in the misrepair space, it's quite similar to the OVs. So yeah, this is the same thing, but our misrepair signatures, there are fewer of these because there's more redundancy in the cosmic data set. Or in our samples, really. And yeah, so more signatures will have similarity to these misrepair profiles. And one thing that's nice to see is a lot of our MLRs group up together. We see some homologous repair deficiency come out here. But yeah, overall we're sort of still teasing apart what is the biologies and how can we confidently label these. Confidently label these. I'm going to show, these are some examples of association matrixes that we've pulled out here. On the left are all of our damage signatures, and then we have a misrepair. And I'm showing the connection strength by the weight of the edges. We saw a pretty big variety of different sort of connectivity types. Some are singly collected, some are have quite strong many to one connections. One connections quite infrequently, actually, but occasionally we do see one-to-many where there's one damage that is strongly repaired by multiple different most proposed cultures. And then we also observe some complex interactions. Okay, so are these actually useful? Is one question we're hoping to answer. One approach to doing this. We've put these activities to use. Activities to use, comparing them against a feature set of COSMIC activities, and set up a binary classification task where the question is, can we identify repair pathway, or rather repair deficiencies as marked just by whether these pathways contain mutations. So the positive set of samples here for MMR, for example, is if any of the genes in my MMR gene list Any of the genes in my MMR gene list are mutated, and then the negative step is none of the above mutated. We did two things with this. We built the classifier, and when we compared the performance, it's nearly identical between these two feature sets. Which is maybe not that surprising, it's the same information, but we do get to use much fewer features usually doing our activities, which is kind of nice. And then we also do gene scoring. So I'll talk about that next. The way we've gone about this is taking each. Is taking each sample which contains a mutation in a gene and then just averaging over its period and probability. So on the x-axis, I have a bunch of different repair genes, or genes that are listed as sort of components of my inverse repair pathways. And I've colored them by their membership in MMR or not. And then the y-axis is average probability. What we'd like to see if we were. What we'd like to see, if we were really good at scoring genes, is that all the MMR genes fall above that 50% line, which is the case for the Dubena signatures, and not so much when we lose cut. And the immediate question that I always get when I show this plot is, who are these two gray genes? So I'll show you them. They're MCM8 and RMI1. These are both, I can, I mean, I can Google these and come up with some. These and come up with some possible reasons that they might be explored quite highly here. For one, MCM8 seems to be associated with some MMR-like disease, and in fact, this paper found that knocking out MCM8 was sufficient to induce a MMR signature with SPS20. And then the second one, RMI1, is a little bit more tenuous, maybe. Maybe, but it participates in conflict with TOP3 and SGS1 in basically regulating how hetero, or rather, whether heteroduplex rejection is taken in response to particulate type of damage. In this case, we're sort of trying to avoid non-allelic homologous recombination. This can be resolved by heterodeutoites. Heterodeutoites rejection or non-homologase tail removal that's subsequently MMR. And what these guys show is that RMI, without RMI1, you basically can't go down this hemopuplex rejection pathway, and you have to take MMR. And so we could hypothesize that when MMR, you have some kind of MMR deficiency, if you're being forced to use or rely on MMR, more frequently you might start to see the signature with higher. Start to see the signature with higher activity. But this is overall not a super well-studied gene. Yes, just an idea. So those are examples we're all for mismatched repair. We also did this across a variety of the different repair pathways, and we were consistently able to positively score, have these component gene genes in the gene list be identified above that 50%. Most of the time we were. Most of the time we were able to do a decent job of identifying most of these genes, whereas cosmetic signatures were not as useful as. And I will say that if you change the criteria a little bit and are a little more stringent with filtering sort of on just frequency of genes, say, or rather frequency of mutation, say a gene has to be mutated at least five times over the whole cohort, then this becomes much more dramatic and cosmetic is much worse, and we don't really lose much performance in this respect. In this respect. Definitely a little bit with this. Yeah, so this is just our gene. That's just answering the question of how many of these black genes fall above the 50% line. So how many of these are we able to average, yeah, prediction probability for is this path being mutated or not? So if it So it basically asks me the question, are we good at predicting whether these are mutated by only looking at the signature activities? And we could go the other way and look at sort of the correlation of these mutations with the activity in the other direction, but I haven't done that yet. And Jesus suggested that yesterday, so that'll be on my list. How many intuit intuition I intuition by your method is better um I think that it has to do with I think it has a bit to do with we sort of make better use of some of the signal maybe in that a lot of our MMR um signature or the cosmic MMR signatures all map to a single mismatch signal or misrepair signature rather. Repair signature, rather. But yeah, I don't really have a good answer for that. I mean, you're trying exactly what you're exactly what you're trying to get, right? I mean, you're trying to decompose the damage and the repair, and so you maybe get stronger association with some of those input-all genes, right? Because you're actually explicitly, that's exactly how you set up your. How you set up your exactly what you're trying to do by decomposing it to damage and impair. Yeah, so we kind of see what we were hoping to see. Exactly what you're trying for. Try to do the opposite in terms of, because if you're this is sort of showing the repair processes, have you seen if you're better at explaining the damage as well? That one's much harder to do because I don't really have the the clinical identification, so I don't know if I have access to data to support that carbon analysis. Access to gaming for that kind of analysis. I guess maybe if you focused on heartwave or something, if I looked at the sort of treatment, and then you could look at the lung cancer, the smoking, and stuff like that. Yeah, that would definitely be interesting to see. Right, so this is my summary slide. Overall, we've come up with some domino signatures, which are another way to represent sort of the same cosmic signatures. Represent sort of the same cosmic signatures we all know and love. They're more compact. And they also let us start asking questions about the associations between different damage and misrepair, which these associations tend to be, they can range from quite simple to very complex. Some of these signatures and association matrices show quite strong tissue specificity. I didn't show anything for that in these slides, but sort of follows quite obviously from what we know about mutational signatures in general. We know about mutational signatures in general. And then lastly, we can use these dimutosignatures to do this gene scoring and potentially implicate genes being involved in misrepair processes. Yeah, that brings me to the end. Awesome. Thank you. I mean, especially, yeah, Quaid and Tyler helped me out a lot. We have time for three minutes. So I'll touch your questions.
