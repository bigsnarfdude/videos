So our first speaker is Graham. He's already been mentioned here and he will be talking on mixed graphs. So please. Thank you, Robert. I should probably explain most of the terms in the title of this. I mean, I guess about half the people here at least will be familiar with mixed graphs. Mixed graphs as a topic, I Mixed graphs as a topic I got interested in largely because of the influence of Merkel Miller, which I know many of you will have known. She was very generous with her time in encouraging PhD students like me, as I was at the time, to get interested in her research topics. So that's how I became interested in the topic of mixed graphs. I view a mixed graph as a generalization both of an underscore. Both of an undirected graph and of a directed graph. So, in a mixed graph, vertices are allowed to have undirected edges into the tone and are also allowed to have directed edges or arcs into the material. So, in a model, for example, of a transport network, it might model a street network where some of the streets you're allowed to go both ways and some of the streets you're allowed to go one way. I'm going to concentrate particularly today on totally regular mixed graphs and I'll explain a bit of the reason for that as we go along. In that case, every vertex will have the same number, which we almost always devote by have, of undirected edges incident to it, and it will have exactly the same number Z of Z of directed darks emanating from it. I almost always use n for the order of the graph, so if I forget to specify that, that's what I mean by n. The topics that we'll be interested in are largely generalisations of the same topics in the directed and the undirected graph problems. So we're interested in the diameter, which for today I'm always going to For today, I'm always going to call K, and that's the obvious definition of the largest distance between any two vertices. There are two different generalizations of the notion of girth and an undirected girth. We'll talk a little bit about some, both of those today. In some ways, the most natural and obvious definition is that the girth is Is that the girth is the length of the shortest cycle which respects the directions of the arcs in the mixed graph? But the one that I actually prefer in many cases is a different generalisation of the undirected problem. It's defined in a way that hasn't confused Jeff, I think, for the past six months or so, but he's now got his head around. So it's the large. Round. So it's the largest integer such that there are no two vertices which have more than one directed path between them of length at most k. And you'll notice that I've reused k both for the GSD and the diameter here. Hopefully it will be clear from the context what I mean at any point. And the reason for that will become somewhat apparent as we go. Somewhat apparent as we go through. When we formulate these problems, then quite often we just specify R and Z as the lower or upper bounds of the undirected and undirected degrees. But it's often convenient in the sorts of work that I do in particular just to view these as constants so that we are looking for graphs which are undirected degree exactly R and directed out degree exactly. And directed don't agree exactly as it in that case we'd say that the graph is regular. It's also often convenient to impose the restriction that the directed indegree of every vertex is also equal to z. And if that's the case, then we say the graph is totally regular. One reason for that, which particularly comes from my research interests, is that a lot of the natural construction A lot of the natural constructions of such things, like Cayley graphs and voltage lists and so on, lead naturally to totally regular graphs. And I'm kind of in the same camp as Robert here, and I like constructions like that which have some algebraic influence on them. So that's why I'm talking today about totally regular. Okay, um you see Moore bound in the girth problem. There is an equivalent Moore bound for mixed graphs and the Moore bound is an upper bound on the number of vertices that you can have for a given diameter K and directed degree Z and undirected degree R. R and it's also the lower bound for the number of vertices you can have in a graph with geodesic K. That kind of explains why we're sort of reusing the K here, because the lower bound is essentially an upper and lower bound for these two problems. So, this horrible formula here, which came sort of nine years ago, roughly now. Years ago, roughly now. It's what we came up with by a counting argument to just explain what the newer bound is given parameters Z, R and K. It took us about 18 months, I think, from coming up with this formula to finally getting it published, mainly because we took the view that there was such a horrible formula that there must be a simpler way to express it. In particular, I remember Dominique who's sitting there grinning. Dominique, who's sitting there grinning, was very keen that we try to find a simpler way to express this phenomenon, unfortunately, but there really isn't one. No, there's a slightly nicer proof than the proof we initially came up with, because my colleagues to the left of Mercadier came up with a nice linear algebra proof, but luckily they actually got the same answer as we did. We won't need to worry too much about this formula, we won't be dealing very much with it. In the elementary Much of it. And the avatar of Geodes D2K is a rather simpler form. And it's just a conserv squared plus one. And so the natural first question is: are there any graphs which actually attain this bound? It proved a long time ago that used to normal 8 this with the diameter. I'm going to express all this in terms of diameter for the most part, but we can just take it as red, that geodesity. Take it as read that geodesicity is the same. So they can only exist for geometer two. For undirected degree one, we always have one of these things. For all values of a directed degree, and these were known long ago as the couch diagrams. For general values of R and Z and diameter two, there's a condition here. A condition here, which, if you know the Hoffman-Singleton theorem in the undirected case, this sort of rather generalises the special condition that Hoffman and Singleton came up with, which showed that Moore grass could only exist at 30 degrees 237 or 57. And in fact, if you plug z equals zero into this formula here, you can actually recover Hoffman and Cell Constance resulting in the undirected case. Result in the undirected case. It's important to note though that, unlike in the undirected case where there's only one open case at degree fifty-seven, which Robert mentioned earlier on today, there are an infinite number of open cases in the mixed case. I said here that only four and a half cases are actually resolved. I'll explain what that means. Means in a second. Most of the recent progress on searching for mixed mood graphs has been very much computer-based. So three of the smallest cases were ruled out by natural and with mates a few years ago now using computer searches. And since then, most effort has really been concentrated on trying to find clear. Trying to find Kelly graphs just as a possible subset of these things. So you can see here that there is one at underrated degree 3 and 1, which was found by POSAC many years ago. These three were ruled out by Natchel and his mates a few years ago. The only other one that is known to exist is this thing here. To exist as this thing here at 108, which was signed by Lee Shawkinson again a few years ago. And since then, there's been a whole lot of work done just to rule out the existence of Kayleigh graphs for a particular subset of the admissible parameters. So the green stuff is something I did, so fairly elementary group preview, I think probably around about the time of the last I want, which is a few years ago now. Is a few years ago now. And slightly more recently, there's a little bit of slightly more advanced group theory by these three authors here, which has again rolled out a bunch of potential candidates for Cayley graphs. The fact that we've ruled out Cayley grass for all these borders here doesn't mean that there are no more grass. It's potentially the case that Potentially the case that there could be some non-Kayley vertex transitive graphs, or there could be even some graphs which are not even vertex transitive. We just don't know. We don't have any reasonable method of trying to find these things apart within the Kayleigh graph case. So that's something that we might be interested in thinking about. I think we've more or less stalled in this service for Kelly graphs, we need some kind. Service for Kelly graphs need some kind of a new idea, so there's challenge one. What ideas that we from group theory might be brought to bear on the on the problem? And for those of you who are into voltage lifts, I don't know if anybody has done any work on trying to find mixed mole graphs as voltage lifts. If anybody has, I'd be interested to know about it. But that's possibly a direction that we might take at least to rule out. At least to rule out some cases where it's obviously not possible. So, there are some ideas that we might be able to work on there. Is there anything that we can do by trying to consider the spectrum of voltage lifts, which I know some of my colleagues from Barcelona are experts in, because we should know what the spectrum of these graphs is. So, can again can we rule out? So, again, can we rule out at least some options? I don't know. So, these are ideas of how we might kind of move the topic forward. I'm particularly interested in one particular case, which is at border 648, because the only two sporadic ones we know are 18 and 6 times 18. And it's possible, I suppose, that there could be one at 6 times 6 times 18. Times 18 but at the moment my poor computer runs out of steam when it tries to do an exhaustive search. So perhaps if there were some ideas that would sort of narrow the possibilities for the groups or the generators in this, it would be nice to rule out that case. Or find one, of course, in the alternative. That would be even more interesting. So, assuming we can't find any more actual Moore graphs, can we find large graphs which almost attain the Moor bound? So, the first obvious question is: can we have graphs that are only one off, so deficit one? And there are some fairly strong conditions of what RNT can be. Intake can be to find a totally irregular mixed graph which has deficit one. There are a very few of these things known. There's one at order 10 which looks suspiciously like the Peterson graph slightly amended. At diameter 3 again there are three graphs, but that's pretty much it or knowledge unless my colleagues from Barcelona know. Uh, my colleagues from Barcelona know different. So, one thing is it'd definitely be interesting to try and find either some more graphs with deficit one or some other conditions that would rule out lots and lots of parameter sets. For larger diameters, we know that there aren't any Moor graphs, and in fact, we can bound the deficit below by a nice result by the table. Of a nice result by the table in the centre there, which states that the deficit for gameter at least three is bounded below by the undirected degree. In a sort of semi-trivial sense, these three graphs with undirected degree one do attain this bound. In larger cases, it kind of seems to me to be unlikely that this bound would be tight. Maybe. Tight, and maybe people would disagree with me, maybe they wouldn't. But it would be very interesting to know whether there are any more of these things. And if there aren't any more of these things, it would be interesting to get a better bound so we can try and find what's going on there. So, some quite recent work for particular values of R and Z, it might be interesting to investigate what happens as. Investigate what happens as the diameter increases. If you look at the Moorbound formula, it's dominated by this term deer. So the idea, I could state this slightly more formally in sort of logarithmic language, but you get the idea here. It would be nice to find a family of graphs with order at least some multiplicative constant times some power. Some factor raised to the power of the diameter k, and the idea would be here to try and get as close as you can to this factor view two, which appears in the Moorbound formula. A sort of recent example with directed and non-directed degree one, if you look at what the Moorbound does, it's essentially the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence, so that this factor here is just a confirmation of 1.6 something. And there's quite a recent construction. I'm not going to take any credit for this at all because even though my name is on the paper, I did very little work other than some computer checking of this stuff. So again, this is largely this table in the middle here who did most of this. And this gives us a factor here of 1.4 root 2. And the question is: is this good? I mean, my answer to that question is yes, that's very good. James's answer to this question is no, that's not good at all. It's nowhere near. So, I would like to know whether this is a good result or not a good result. My suspicion is that that's good and we're not going to do any better. It would be interesting to think of what sorts of construction might get you to one point five, say, for example, but I very much doubt that that's going to be feasible. That's going to be feasible. Assuming it's not feasible, can we extend the sort of ideas of that which have appeared before in good mixed graph constructions to other values of directed and undirected degree? And I don't know if my colleagues are already working on that. It's entirely possible that they are, but that would be definitely an interesting avenue to pursue, particularly now. Particularly now thinking about the Diameter II case, which is the most studied case, I guess, in the undirected problem, Gabriella and collaborators have some nice results for particular values of R and Z. So it's not a general result, but you're picking out particular values of R and Z here, you get some nice graphs which attain, you know. Which attain 8 over 9 times the lower bound. People who are familiar with the undirected degree dams abroad will recognise that 8 over 9 coming from a previous family of undirected graphs. So again, there's a special case there, and this may really be more of a computational question than a construction question. Is this actually the best that you can do at that particular set of parameters? Set of parameters. In the general case, so for undirected graphs, we do have a set of Kelly graphs which asymptotically approach the diameter two moorbound done by my colleagues from Bratislava, only one of whom bothered to show up today. But thanks for coming, Anna. It would be nice to know if we can replicate. To know if we can replicate that somehow with proper mixed graphs. And I'm going to rule out just the cheating way of doing that by adding another generator to the Kaylee graph to a mixed graph with directed degree one, for example. So I'm really asking the question: is there a way to do that that doesn't depend on existing undirected instructions in some way? So that's the diameter problem. The flip side of the diameter problem is the geodesic problem. So remember, the definition of the geodesic problem is that I give you a value k and I'm not allowed in my graph to have two vertices which have more than one path of length at most k between them. And again, I've got my name on this paper for reasons it's not in. Name on this paper for reasons it's not entirely clear. This was something that James did largely as part of his thesis. He came up with this really nice bound on the excess of a totally irregular graph with G addest DK. Remember that the Moore bound in this case is a lower bound on the order, not an upper bound. So this is obviously horrible formula, really. Formula Grille. Again, it seems to me very, very unlikely that this bound is going to be tight. So it would be good to get either some examples where the bound is met, which is probably only going to happen if it happens at all in very small cases, or some better bounds. In particular, if you're looking for the smallest possible excess excess one, then we have a theory. Then we have a theorem that gives some pretty strong conditions on what values of R and Z that can happen for, pretty much piggybacking on the equivalent result in the diameter problem. There is, as far as I'm aware, only one non-trivial graph with which it's one known. So it's So it's Cayley graph of the dihydral group of order 12 where the moor bound is 11. So is that really all? Very interesting to find larger examples, if there are any. However, there's a big problem with the GDSD problem in that, as I said before, it's essentially a generalisation of the undirected government problem. And as you heard from Robert this morning, we know nothing. From Robert this morning, we know nothing about what happens essentially as the girth increases, and we know even less, I think, about what happens in this problem as the geodesic increases. I said, our understanding is quite poor. Miles away from the moorbound. If you look at the tables, even for the cubic case, it's almost embarrassing how far away the case are. How far away else are from the mob, and essentially, at the moment, we have very little idea of how to bridge that gap, and that's even more the case in the mixed case. However, we do have some nice constructions for undirected graphs of a given girth, e.g. Shayley graphs or algebraically defined graphs or any of the things that Robert mentioned this morning. Could these ideas potentially be extended to mixed? To mixed graphs, we would just make some of the so in the Cayley graph case, we would just have we wouldn't have an inverse closed generating set, we would allow some of the generating set not to have inverses. I haven't thought very much about that, but I think there is potential there for some interesting things to be done. If we can't get that, can we at least get some Least get some construction which gives you something, even if it's not a good construction, so that we've got something to aim at. I think there are probably things that we have, things that again the Catalan people have been working on, on some of these things like permutation digraphs and so on, and ancake grafts and things like that. Some of these ideas I think possibly could be used. Possibly could be used. But it would be nice to get some sort of idea of what we should be aiming at. The curve problem, again, this is where we are looking particularly at the sort of minimum size of a graph that has no undirected, no small, no small directed cycles, or mixed cycles at least, where the cycles respect the Second respect the direction of the arcs. Adding directed edges, I've always thought that the girth problem for digraphs is a bit of a weird thing because you can have transitive tournaments where you have all the possible arcs but no cycles at all. So it does give a very different flavour to the problem. This thing I really like, every time I see this diagram, I think that can't possibly be right, but it is. So the GUF problem in the case So, the graph problem in the case of directed degree one, which is probably the sort of most tractable version of the problem. So, this is the bound that you get, and the way you get that bound is that you have this path here, which is your directed path, gives you your z equals 1, and then you hang undirected trees from each of these. So, you're just adding up the sizes of. So, you're just adding up the sizes of these directed trees and the exact formula depends on the parity of what you're aiming for here. That's a very nice result. You can get to that bound in the case of GURD4. If you look at the case of directed degree one, undirected degree two, you know what the cages are. I think that was mentioned uh this morning. Mentioned this morning. It would be interesting to think about what we can do for larger girths here. We have, certainly in the case of GURF 6, we know exactly what the cages are. They're the levigraphs of projective planes, which have been mentioned, I think, in at least three talks so far. So they must be important. So there's possible that we might be able to leverage some of that. It's possible to take an indirect graph of given girth and just orient a Hamiltonian cycle or a set of cycles, and it's not very clear whether that's a good construction. So, just to finish with, there are some overarching questions that apply to most of these topics. I've concentrated on totally irregular graphs, but can we find extremal graphs? Which would probably be a computational question. A computational question which are not totally irregular. I don't know if Jeff has any examples from what he's been doing recently, but it'd be very interesting to know whether there are extremal graphs which turn out not to be totally irregular. If we can't find any of those, it would be nice to prove something about total regularity being a necessary condition, at least for some problems and for some of the parameter sets. Possibly a bit out of left field is that can we see? Possibly a bit out of left field is that can we say anything about other graph parameters in relation to the extremal graphs in any of these problems, such as paragraph, for example? I think I've mentioned that it would be nice to find sort of algebraic, or typically algebraic good constructions for small values of R and Z for any of these problems and new ideas required for searches for K Ling. Searches for Kaley graphs. I'll say a bit more about this later, but if anybody is interested in editing some pages on Combinatorics Wiki, then please drop me an email because I'm looking for help in that, whether that be in mixed graphs or the damter problem or the cage problem or whatever it is. And in particular, as Robert said this morning about the cage survey, we are in the middle of. In the middle of updating the survey which was started by Joseph and Merke in the diameter case, and the main holdup on that at the moment, I have to confess, is me because I undertook to write a section on mixed graphs and I haven't been able to keep up with all the progress that people have been making on mixed graphs over the last couple of years. So, if anybody's aware of any papers in the downtown problem for mixed graphs, please send me and they'll be included in the survey. And I'll stop there. Thank you.
