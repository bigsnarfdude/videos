start talking about uh the compactified universal trifobian in uh the algebraic sense. So it's uh we've seen a lot about them this week, so maybe m many things I will be saying you already heard them about, but I just think that it's nice to have maybe like the whole theory together. So I'll start by recalling universal compactified recognition and what I'll mean. Compactified recordings and what I mean with them. Also, to fix some notation. And the idea is that our tropical universal Jacobins will be tropicalizations of these objects and this will be made precise both in the non-archimedium sense and also in the logarithmic sense. This is the idea of the talk. Of the talk. And so the universal trichovian is like this object, Jgn over Mgn. So the fibers over curve with n points are just the trachodian of the curve. So this has, as we all know, this very nice compactification, the Linux Manford compactification, MGM bar, and the universal compact hydrocopy is something that That completes the diagram here. So, and the idea is that it should be as nice as possible, and there are various versions for this. So, in the beginning, so to start with, I'll just take, so if I have a curve here, start points, over this curve, I'll have X P I L, so this will be fiber over C P I. Fiber over Cpi, and if this is the case, then C is going to be the stabilization of Pi. Because, so objects here, so an object, an object X B I L in J bar G N is going to parametrize quasi-stable curves. So we heard about quasi-stable curves before, so this is just a curve obtained from a stable curve, maybe by normalizing some of the nodes and inserting Q1s over these nodes, which is one over each node. And the line bundles, and I will insist that we take line bundles over these curves. So L is a line bundle. So L is a line bundle, which we call admissible. And this means that the line bundle can be anything but when restricted to this exceptional component, so this modification, so this is a quasi-stable modification of your original curve, as I said. So this is obtained by adding exceptional P1s, so adding exceptional P1s over Over some of the nodes. And so, for instance, say you have something like this, so this is your C, so your X, maybe you choose to insert a P1 over this. So this is one exceptional component then. And L is admissible if the restriction of L to these exceptional components is a degree one. Okay, so this is the only requirement for the moment. And so then, so of course there are lots of other possibilities to compactify the Jacobian. And maybe the more popular is that you consider instead of modifying your curve, you keep your curve and you allow your shift to degenerate and you take torsion-free rank-1 shifts. And this is really so. And this is really, so I'd like to point out that there's a dictionary between the two, they're really isomorphic spaces. Sorry, yes. So yes, C is equal to X stabilizations. Sure. Sorry, yes. So C, so this is X, this is C, which is the stabilization of X obtained by just flowing down your exceptional components. Yes? Yes. And the way, like, if you want a dictionary between the usual language here and the torsion-free sheaf language, then what, like, a nice way to do it is that you consider, I just use it like maybe here, so you consider the normalization over the nodes that you blown up before, so this is the partial normalization. And so if you have, so this is. You have, so this is your line bundle, the line bundle that you're considering in your compatrification. So the normalization will have an inclusion inside of this x. So if you just restrict your real to the normalization, and if you push it forward via the normalization map, then you get a torsion-free shift run, shift forward the original. And this is really what so this is really the way to pass from one motor to the others. To the others. So if you're more used to this language, so you just restrict L to this kind of normalization and you just push it forward to the original curve. So this is torsion free. One sheep. Okay, so and the the this is exactly the the objects you will find in the The objects you will find in Toshien Freer and Quench's compactification of the Dutch Jacobians. So, for the sake of tropicalization, this language is more natural, because we're always dealing with line bundles over curves. But if you want to work with curves with more general singularities, then maybe this is the right thing to work with. Okay? Uh okay. Yes. So in this case, uh the submitted push forward sure yes yes yes yes. This is just yeah you can also push forward here yes and this the fact that you are admissible is really the requirement that you get overtware correspondences for example. Yes, you can also push forward this via this stabilization morphism and you get as well I and the admissibility is really this, that you Admissibility is really this, that you get in the end a torsion free shift. Alright, so and many of the things I'll be saying about the general properties of this phase will be also true over other families of curves, so for instance pre-stable curves, or if you are working with torsion-free sheaves, you can also take like the stack of old curves or something like that, and many of the things I'll be saying will also be true. Okay. Okay. So yeah, so let me just write some facts about cell JGN bar is an algebraic stack and satisfies the existence part of the and the existence part of criterion. Criterion for properness. And if you want to restrict to the simple, to the locus of torsion-free random shifts, in this language, you'd have to restrict to normalizations that don't disconnect your current. So this is the way to go from one to the other. So if you restrict to the simple locus, So, this is the place where X minus the exceptional locus is connected. This will be then corresponding to torsion-free rate one shifts that are simple. Then, this is representable. And of course we saw different types in this conference, in different moments in this conference, that this will never be separated as it stands. They are not requiring any stability condition for the moment. But if we do that, then we... So by this is the we do require stability conditions then and we then cut out the substacks of these. Uh substacks of these that are separate or what? So can I answer? What do you mean by representable? Because I might. Representable over nj. Okay, and this is and this is and this is the linear Manford locus of this big stack. Okay, and yeah, and all of this is true if I replace M by any other stack of like if I'm in that language. Like if I'm in that language, sub stack of the stack of wall curves. All right, so there are lots of them. There was a nicer one in the first days, but also stayed here. But it's okay. There is one better. Yeah, yeah, but I just like this nice one. Like this, the nice one, the speaker. Yeah. The speaker product. Oh, okay, yeah. Alright, so if then I require a stability condition, so I'll recall you numerical stability conditions as were introduced by Cas and Herani. So, what's this? This is an assignment for a number over the irreducible components of your C. So, and it's a real number then, and with the requirement the requirement that the total sum of these numbers is an integer. These numbers is an integer. And then with the requirement of compatibility, so this is over mg and bar. Compatibility meaning that compatibility with automorphisms of your curve and also specializations. Specializations. Then we construct, you consider the substack of our original space consisting of our triples X, P I L such that L is phi semi-stable. So, and you remember, so this is a condition on. And you remember, so this is a condition on the multi-degree of URL, which should not be far away from this assignment, from this numerical assignment on your components. I think we've seen this. Let me go. Maybe it's not necessary that I write it again, right? So it's just, let me say, so the degree of L should be the total sum of your assignment and the for all subcurves of The for all subcurve of y, for all subcurve of x, if I consider the degree of L restricted to L, this should be bounded. So, and then if I compare it to phi of y, so this is the sum of phi in the components of c that live inside y, so this should be not bigger than the number of points where s e uh where y intersects the rest of the curve divided by two. The rest of the curve divided by 2. So, this is the stability condition. And then, what we get in this situation is that this is connected finite time and universally okay, so And moreover, so if I consider this stability condition to be general, and general means that phi semi-stable is the same as phi-stable. So, this can be attained by, you know, like working Working out this stability condition so that you never get equality in this requirement here. And then, if phi is general, then we get really nice properties for these. So, these are proper and they admit a projective modulo space. Okay. Moreover, in this nice situation, all of these stability conditions can be obtained out of a vector bundle in your original curve and from which you extract like degrees and ranks. So, so-called Steel's stability condition. So, this will be isomorphic to some JGN bar. J G N bar E, where E is a vector bundle on M g n plus 1 bar. So this is a status of artifact. Okay, are there any questions? Well, perhaps you should say a status menu of 55. Yeah, it is status. So it's also a course in this case, right? Also, a course in this field, right? Yes, it's also a course, yes, that's true. Okay, so what is the significance of passing to these quasi-stable required properness of the universal closeness? Is that what you're doing? Yeah, if you just require line bundles in your original curve, you won't get nothing. Well, in your original curve, you won't get nothing. You won't be complete, right? It's going to like, it's not going to be complete. If you just, yeah, you have to allow the generation. So it's... It's in existence. Yeah. So think of a line man like a divisor going to a node, so you have to take the old. Yeah. So you do this, either by blowing up your your singularity, like by regenerating your curve, or by Your curve, or by like allowing the sheaves to be non-morculify on the nodes. So these are the two options, and I want to exist. So these are really isomorphic also as texts. And this is a result by H. Davis and Pancini some years ago. So not only as like modelized spaces, but also as text. So this is for me. The dictionary between the two. All right. So Uh n well, n not that we know. Yeah. So for the moment we can only show this for when you have on your program. Starting with like um proper um yeah, like applying kilmori and then showing that you have um ample line on. Yeah, that's the way we look at that. That's the way we cook it. And also, of course, so as this was mentioned yesterday, so when this phi is cooked up by E, which is like the power of the canonical, then this was already worked out by Lucia Caparazzo in her thesis. So you get projective, of course, because it's a GIT question, okay, in this situation. But if you are in general, if you're outside of this range, then we don't know. Yeah, but at the moment we don't. Outside of which range? Sorry? Outside of which range? Sorry, I didn't. If you are outside of which range? So we can do this when this is obtained from something which is general. So you know that the set is proper and you apply Kilmori and that. So that's the way that it's been proved. Okay, so o otherwise so in these other situations you you only get universally closed so you it's not separated and so it's yeah yeah I don't know it it's not it's not being yes someone it's not being done to George Cooper. But it's GIT question. Yeah, it's GIT question. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, maybe there are Yeah, maybe there are other things maybe coming up that we can be with the new work of algorithms. Yeah, sure, sure, I know, yeah, yeah. And same thing. What is the significance of this vector one? How should I? It's just one. Does it have some natural interpretation? No, well it's just some so there's a a way to write down this fun so I can so if you give me a sign if you give me a like a chamber in the stability space. In the stability space, in like a chamber, I know that there's going to be one vector bundle in the universal curve from which I can put up a stability condition or it's going to give you the. You find the phi first and then the. Well, or otherwise. Yeah, of course from, yeah, yeah, you can do it. And these are real, so there's formulas for these data. They are. Just if you want to work out some concrete stability conditions that will give you representatives for all chambers, I can give you one that is shape. That's what I'm saying. Okay. All right, so okay, so some remarks I want to do about this space is that, so if m is bigger than 0, of course I'm saying this is really when you have nice properties. If s if if you have marked points, then it's always possible to get phi gene general, then there always exists. And they've always existed. And of course, it's easy to imagine. You can take E's, which are like you can twist by your sections with some rational power that you can. Some rational power that you can control, and then it's easy to do this. But if n equals zero, which is, as we know, an interesting situation, then this only exists, they don't always exist, unfortunately. They exist if and only if you get this numerical condition. Okay, so Okay, so it's so for instance they exist when degree is equal to G and then we'll see later on that these are connected to brake divisors in the tropical version. But when D is equal to G minus 1, then they will not exist. And G minus 1 is an important degree to consider to cover. This is where you have the natural extensions for the Torelli map. And they don't exist. So this is, I think I can. So that they don't exist outside of this fraction. So we knew that they do exist here, so already some were tasked with G at this curve, but not out of this. Last minute, these numerics are known on the process. No, in there, yeah. If you want general, it's the same that you work with this world or this world, and there are no. This world, and there are no general stability. So, because of this compatibility and the constraints that you have in your mind, what prevents me from trying to choose Q independent real numbers, putting them on the most configurated style. Yes, and it's distinct, yeah. It's distinct because you have a total degree that is rigid and Rigid, and if you ask for this, then you see that degree is going to input constraints on the stability conditions that you can assign. Alright, and so currently we are working in different versions of these on more general versions of slides, where instead of considering like an assignment. Considering an assignment for each curve, for each graph, if you want, we consider the like we heard about the stability condition space, it was drawn by Alex yesterday. So instead of working with this, we work with the region and we assign, so we obstruct Something that we know like this. So, this should be the region where this phi lives inside the stability space. The turning the region in the stability space. And then we require like compatibility according to, so this stability space is cut out by regions, they have a coset. Regions, they have a coset structure according to the closure, and the stability condition is going to be then, the compatibility condition is going to be then like it can degenerate if you are going to a region which is in the closure of regional, right? Regions to the tool set structure in PGM. Okay, so the stability space that was mentioned yesterday by Alex. So you know that, so yeah, these assignments are leaving a big Yeah, these assignments are living a big big vector space, and the fact that you are giving numbers like according to the subcurves you have, like the topological types you have, these will construct walls for your space, and the opens are the chambers and then like that come with a stick with a poset structure. So there are more general spaces that we can get if we allow for. So it's not when you construct the Jacobians, you don't really need the numbers, you need the You don't really need the numbers, you need the region, so this will all build up for you isomorphic spaces. And it turns out that, of course, if you are in a single curve, it's not give you nothing more. It's just because everything is the same inside the chamber. But as you are in families, this will give you more. But unfortunately, not in this situation. Okay, so So so and well my title is tropical and I'm not didn't do nothing tropical so far. So if I want to tropicalize I have to describe for you the toroidal structure of these compactifications. That's what I'm going to do now. So the toroidal stratification J R G N. So these are So these are very nice. So, even if we don't impose stability conditions or anything, so these are smooth, and the boundary is one of crossings. So, the bedding is steroidal. Steroidal. And if we want to tropicalize, it's nice to have the description of this steroidal stratification. And hysteroidal stratification. So we do that by if I give you x. So now I tend to forget about the points. You know, like the points are only, so the points are not appearing in the Jacobians. It's just that they allow you to work with the stability conditions or something. But so sometimes I forget about the points, because they are not relevant for the Jacobian point of view. So this the combinatorial type The combinatorial type of an object in this space is going to be given by a pair, which is the dual graph of your curve and the noted degree of your line bundle. So this is the dual graph of x. So this is going to be a quasi-stable graph. So it's a quasi-stable graph. Stable graph. So it's a graph obtained from a stable graph by inserting some vertices inside of some of the edges, one vertex at some of the edges. And the multi-degree is a divisor in this graph. Okay. So this is the combinatorial type as an object in my compactification. And so what I do is that I describe a category which governs the. So then what I'll do is I'll fix the locus of objects. Of objects have points in the compact fatigue having a fixed combinatorial type, and then there's a category which governs the way that these strata move together. So set Gn. This is the category such that objects are G D, so the pairs like that, so G has a stable graph. So G has a stable graph and D divisor of your graph, which is admissible. So an admissible divisor in your graph is just what you expect. Whenever you have in your graph a vertex which is exceptional, meaning that it's a weight zero vertex with only two edges entering on it, then you require that your definition On it, then you require that your divisor has degree one over here. So it's just really the dual, the combinatorial types of the objects that you have in your compactified Schoolian and morphisms given by so you have a morphism between an object between G D and G prime D prime if you have if you have G to G. have G to G prime morphism of weighted graphs and plus that plus the the this phi induces so pi over star of t is going to be this compatible with the the divisor so let me just draw a picture here for this situation so let's So let's say, so imagine that you have something like this. So this is a quasi-stable curve of genus 1, 2, 3. So we have an exceptional component here, and an assignment would be like a degree assignment on your vertices. And so you see, so here I have to have one because this is an extra. Here I have to have one because this is an exceptional vertex. And then the contraction. So, for instance, if I would contract this edge here, I would get then weight 2 in this coded in this being an isomorphism of weighted graphs. I would keep the same degree here, and here I would have to add more degrees. You can sort of quite expect. Okay, then. Spectrum. Okay, then the space, the JGN bar, is going to be the union of this J G D as G D varies in G G N, where this is the locus of points in your compact species of men having this combinatorial time. B X L such that the combinatorial type combinatorial type I think I have this shrinking in my picture if I would have this shrinking in my picture then this would be one Okay, so of course you have this joint union, but the nice thing is that if you want to describe, so this has no bar here, so it's really the locus of pairs having this combinatorial type, and if you want to describe the closure of this locus, then you use the fact that this category has a possibility structure, and so the closure of a strata in this communication. The strata in this complex is going to be given by a union of lower-dimensional strata according to the Posset structure that you have in the scale for so meaning that so the coset structure so the coset of strata in the torrential complexification is anti-isomorphic to this one to the one. Smile. Alright, so let me go dropical finally. This is category, is it really a post-set or is it like a stack over postets? No, it's a, so you really use a category. Yeah. So there's like a self-subject. Yes, and so you have different maps between code. Yeah. I'm just saying. I'm just saying that poset, you have a poset induced by that, but you really use the category to find the stratification. Okay, so tropical universal Jacobian. So I'll define it as a generalized complex associated to this category. So let me just remind you that if we want to JGN false is going to be the limit over this category. This category of cons associated to the objects in this category here. So this is a generalized colour complex colour complex and it And it comes with a morphism to Mg and drop, which is the limit over the smaller category of... So this is the category of stable graphs of genus G and singular abstraction. And what is PG, the first part? On the edges of your graph. So this is. So, this is my notation. So, I'm taking, so with this limit, I mean that for each object in this category, I take a cell, I take a cone of the size of the edges of that object. And like the structure, the possible structure in your category. So, these can't be phase morphisms, you can use phase morphisms in your counts and you. And you use those face markers to glue your cones, and this is what's encoded in this limit here. So you glue together all these cones, which will be meaningful in like tropical Jacobians of some combinatorial time that I glue together along faces, according to phase morphemes deduced from the maps that you have in your original category, really as in MGNTROP. So remember, MGNTROP can be considered. Can be constructed the same way. So you take like abstract tropical curves of given combinatorial type, then this will be encoded in a cone of this dimension. And then you glue them together according to phase morphism, where you like impose the fact that you have a contraction in an edge is going to induce a phase morphism in this category. And this will be also be accounting for the automotive. Be counting for the automorphisms of your count. Okay, so this is quite brutal definition. Let me try to explain you. So this is in this category. So what is the morphism? So imagine that you have theta graph here and so in the fiber of this you would have for instance QTIF sorry, yes. Could if sorry, yes. Yeah, sorry, yeah. It's this category, yes. Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry, could you check? That's what I call it. So it's the same category that I use to uh to to describe the Torebo stratification in the the Copax Page Jacobian, then I'll use uh a point in this category to construct This category to construct a cone, and I'll use morphines in the category to glue the cones along phase morphemes or automorphisms. So why is this called the compactified universal jacobian? So what are the morphisms to start with? So if you take, if I give you an object here, so this would be given by, so for instance, I would have a combinatorial time. So a combinatorial type of a curve and an assignment. So this would be a combinatorial type of object here and with these assignments L1, L0, L1, L2, L3 I'll be assigning lengths to the graph. So this is a point here. So and the morphism would be that you stabilize your graph. Your graph, so you just remove this edge, and you and if you decide to contract this edge here, then you would be 2 minus plus 1, and the lengths would be added here. Okay, so this is the way the morphism turns. Okay, so the final function comes exclusively from the Comes exclusively from these sort of rational bridges that you have. Right, so yes, so I didn't write the dimension of this complex, but if you yeah, it's going to be twice the dimension of Mgn drop, if you don't impose any stability condition. If you impose a stability condition, then you can do just the same. I forgot here, but if you, so there's a category, a version, a smaller category of this. Very boring piece, where I just make the objects very within if I also require that these files are unstable. Okay, so inside this category I have the subcategory, full subcategory of objects where the degree, where the divisor is required to satisfy the same single. Is required to satisfy the same stability conditions I had before in the algebraic version. So, this is a full subcategory. And it's easy to see that the morphemes are compatible with asking stability. And so, I can do the same thing here. So, I can do the same thing if I restrict to this sub-category. So, this is going to be a sub-complex of the original one, and in this situation, this is. And in this situation, this is going to be one dimension, so in the origin for g minus 3 plus n. So if you require stability condition, remember if this is going to be general, phi is general, you cannot just divide any edge because you cannot divide edges where, yeah, like Where, yeah, like the stability condition being general will impose for you that you cannot divide edges which would disconnect your curve. And then this is going to be, yeah, it's a combinatorial occupation. Alright, so... Alright, so I see, so monotropically, it's the same amount of data to give the divisor on the stabilized curve or to give the quasi-stable curve ring above, because that's another one. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Now I'm I think, yeah. So it's just giving you a curve, yeah, together with a divisor where you can just spread out. And I'm requiring something more, I'm requiring this admissibility, but it's easy to see that if I give you any divisor in a tropical curve, that you can, it's easy to see that you can have an admissible representative for that. And even more, then the statement is that there is a unique. then the statement is that there is a unique representative which is phi semi-stable if you if I give you a phi stability condition which is general. At some point you have to do this twisting rather than equivalence. Where is it? Yeah, it's not it's not no, this is not uh so uh if I don't impose any stability condition, I'm not doing any twisting, I'm just doing it something cute. Twisting, I'm just doing something huge. Okay, I'm just considering all the admissible divisors I can work with. But if I restrict to these combinatorial types, then the statement is that if you give me a divisor, I can give you a unique one which is r which is phi semi-stable. And then this is going to be equivalent to this. To be equivalent to these. So basically, you're saying I can think of phi as a section of the map with no equivalence relation to taking equivalence relation. Yes. So let me clarify this. So if I so the section, so if I give you gamma, which is GL tropical curve, then Then and if I call this map phi, then phi minus one of gamma is going to be and now I am in this orange situation where I'm imposing the phi stability condition. So this is going to be isomorphic to this gamma mod green gamma. So, and this is because, you know, because if I give you one, if I give you one, if I give you one divisor, in any curve there's a unique group attentive. So let me do another picture for the filter graph. Yes. Sorry? Okay, so sorry, I'm not saying something here. So here I'm defining this as a generalized cone complex, but actually we work it out as a cone stack. And so where you just allow for your lengths to vary in like monoids associated to your cones. to your cones. And if you like, yeah, so when I'm saying this, I really mean that I think of this as a cone step. And then you don't have to model out yautum of systems. But otherwise you would model bi-automorphism. Okay, so example, the theta graph again. So if I give you one, one. 1,1 stability condition 1-1 in the zeta graph, and the Jacobian is just. Well, anyway, the Jacobian is just a real dimension 2 torus. And I will pull this picture here that probably you've seen. So, this is a toric picture for the Jacobian of gamma, so which is R2 mod So, which is R2 mod C2. And so, this is, so the assignment of a stability condition is going to give you a way to subdivide these torus. And so the subdivision in this situation is going to look like this. And in each top-dimensional chamber, you're going to get like... Going to get like combinatorial types for your divisor. So, this is going to be all divisors over this curve at this combinatorial type. This is going to be 1, 1. I'm not drawing numbers if it's not 1. And for instance, here I'm going to do this here. And it's nothing. Oh, you like it. What a nice picture. So it's a toy picture, so this should be the same. And by here the up ones. So these are all the same points, of course. So of course the lower dimensional cells are the cells where the of the combinatorial types where you did not divide the edges. And this would be like putting Would be like putting a degree two here, I think, and then on the edges you have just one subdivision and this one this one and yeah, I it should be. It's coming from here, so it shouldn't be mixed. Okay, so this is like a picture of what I have in mind for this. These are the fibers of my Jacobian. Yes. Yes, yes. You have these torus and your fee is going to give you a way to find a unique representative of a certain communatorial type. And it's really the dual And it's really the dual picture to the compact phi Jacobians that we have. And if I give you another phi, then this will give you another way to subdivide. But if it's general, then you have exactly the same number of maximal regions and everything. And the compatibility is then when you generate these whole books together. It's really nice picture. But I cannot draw an easy universal compact spider code and so on. Okay, so now we have like two results. I'm not sure how much I can get into what is. So there's then a statement where we say that this thing is the tropicalization of the previous universal Jacobian within non-Archimedean geometry and within logarithmic geometry. So these are the two. Logarithmic geometry. So these are the two statements that we have, and in different categories. And there's like so the first theorem is that there exists a correspondence of topological spaces which goes like this. So let me just write the words and then I'll explain. So this is the better analytication of the big space. I'm not doing the statistical. I'm not doing the stability condition for the moment, so this is just the big step, which is not proper, so I'll take that analogation. And this comes with a reduction map with the original one and a tropicalization map, analytical tropicalization to JGN. And so let me just And so let me just explain you the maps. So a point here would be represented by some map from spec R to your space. So R is evaluation ring of rank one. So I'll think of this as some kind of curve generating this. So this is the special point, this is the generic point. And so Generic point. And so the map here, the reduction map would be take the quotient by the maximal ideal. So you look at the special fiber. So take square R over MR which maps to so take this as a representative for a point. Yeah, take the topological space associated to this. Topological space associated to this abstract step. And on the other map, it's going to be then given like this. So you look again to the special fiber, you look at a note, for instance, so take a note here. So the first thing, so you again look at the special fiber and you go to You go to the point in your Jacobian combinatorial type given by this. Okay, so it's the dual graph. So this is, let's say C over spec R. So this is just the dual fiber, so the topological, the combinatorial type of the special fiber over zero. Then you have a length function. A length function that I have to explain. And the multi-degree, so this comes, of course, with a line bundle. So it's a point in the universal Jacobian. So it's, remember, it's a quasi-stable pair together with a line bundle. So you take the multi-degree restriction of your line bundle to the special fiber. And the length function is obtained as in, I think, you've seen the situation for Mg, and it's just the same thing. The situation for Mg, and it's just the same thing. So it's just, so this is going to give you, so it's going, we have to give lengths for edges living on, for edges that are corresponding to nodes in your original curve. So if I have, if C naught admits a local equation at the form xy equal to x y equal to F E. So E stands for the E edge that is going to be then associated to this node, x E at F, which is not a unit of your R, then the length of C E is going to be coming from edges of your. Your dual curve associated to the spatial fiber, and if you are at each edge, you just take the valuation of this edge. Okay, so it's just like the same thing that we have for Mg and just some results about this. So, this map is surjective and anti-continuous, as in the And anti-continuous, there's in the MG situation. And then this tropical analytic map is surjective and continuous, and everything is compatible with taking the substance where you take the stability condition or to the strata. So drop. So this is subjective, plus continuous, plus compatible, plus the whole diagram. plus compatible plus the wall diagram wall diagram is compatible with substrate associated to to by stability condition or strata and and there are maps to MGN tropes that are compatible Drop that are compatible with everything. So everything is compatible with forgetful plus stabilization morphisms to energy and with its operations. Okay, so this is the analytic result we have. And then we have also, so I think I started some minutes ago. I just I'll just write a similar statement for the logarithmic point of view. And so B is that there are, as a diagram of log stacks. So far, what this is the situation, this is the point of the talk where I wrote really. Point of the talk where I don't really understand what I'm going to say, but some of my co-authors do. So there's the logarithmic version of JGN, and this is just the same objects that we had before, but where we have instead of stable, like quasi-stable curves, we take log-stable curves, log-smooth curves, sorry. Log smooth curves, sorry. And the line bundles are just line bundles over the schemes underlying your log curves. And so this is the usual, so this is a forgetful morphism of the logarithmic structure to the original space. And then there's a logarithmic structuralization to art instead. Art instead associated to JG and Trop. And so the map here is just so this is just, so this is a log curve and I just take here the just this is just forgetting the logarithmic structure. But the interesting thing is on this side, so this is so what you do. So again, So again, we look at a picture. So this is pick a point here. And so imagine that we have a fiber like this. So this is x over s. And so I have a local description of the local rings of the fibers according to what are the local rings in the base, and then according to the Base and then, according to these equations, I can cook up for you. So, this is going to be again retaining the combinatorial type of the fiber together with lengths, which you're going to leave in monoids associated to your local rings here. So, let me just write this explicitly. So, for instance, if I have in this In this, if I have in this node something of this shape, so the local, so this is n. So, oh yeah, so let me just draw, let me just write this equation here. So, the local ring here would be something like this, m s plus. So, this is the characteristic monoid at the point in the fiber plus m alpha plus m beta. And beta, where these are just so this should be the local equation around the point like this, and this should be something living in the characteristic monoid of your point in your fiber, minus zero. And then what you do is that you so this is going to be the parameter you use to You use to construct a generalized metric to give a generalized length over the edge associated to this node. So this is just as in other situations you might have seen. So the edge, so the n is going to go to an edge and then d is going to be given by just Just built them or something like that. So, okay, so this was very quick, but anyway, so there's a local rethink version of our results, which are really the same shape as you had for MG, the the work of of Cavalier Sean, um uh Cavalier Sean, uh Ulrich and uh Bullish and wise. So it's exactly the same picture, and everything is compatible to maps, to MGM, and again compatible to taking strata or like the substrates where you require stability conditions and things like that. And just one more thing. So, currently, we are working on trying to compute. To compare either this and this with the electropic and log peak that were constructed by Sam and Jonathan, and I hope that there's going to be new also new compactified Jacobians in the original sense out of this book. Okay, so thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any further questions? You mentioned this construction, how you fix on only the
