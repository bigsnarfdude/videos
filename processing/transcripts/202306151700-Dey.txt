The first talk this afternoon is by Subhadi Dey, a former student of Misha's, and he will be talking about some restrictions on the group theoretic structure of Anosov subgroups. All right, thank you so much. First of all, I want to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak here at MISAFEST. So I'm very fortunate to be a student of So, I'm very fortunate to be a student of Misha Kobovich from 2015 to 2020. And I'm so grateful to him for everything I learned from him, for being so generous with his time for all these last eight years. So, today I want to talk about some results and also subgroups. This is a relatively new field, which Misha also has like a lot of influence. In fact, the main result that I'll talk about. The main result that I'll talk about, the proof of it also has Misha has like a lot of influence on it. So, so okay. So, and also subgroups of semi-simple League groups were introduced by Laboure in his study of kitchen representations. So, these class of groups are natural high-rank generalization of convex or compact groups. So, I only So, I won't be able to give a precise definition of NSO subgroups because it takes some time, but let me give you some examples of such subgroups. So, for example, okay, so here is a terminology that I'll be using throughout this talk. By a surface group, I mean the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. So, given such a surface, So, given such a surface with a hyperbolic structure, the holonomic representation of the fundamental group to PSL to R is an example of such representations. Then here is another one. This is by Choiel Goldman. So the holonomy representation of convex real collective structures on such a surface is another example of anosov representations in PSL3R. In PSL3R. And more generally, Laboui showed that hitching representation of surface groups into PSL and R, they are anos of representation. And this is the starting point of this theory. So later on, Gishard and Winhardt extended the class of NOSOF subgroups, namely, given any connected real semi-simple D group. semi-simple D group G and a parabolic subgroup they can define the notion of PNOS of subgroups so for this talk I'll assume this following technical condition that the parabolic subgroup is conjugate to its opposite then later on Misha Kapuri's Leave and Potty they give a lot of geometric and dynamical characterizations of anosoph subnoons and their characterization Groups and their characterization give a lot of the properties of convex or compact clay and groups. So, here are some of the characterizations that they give. So, these are called more subgroups, URU, so uniformly regular and undistorted, RCA, meaning regular, conical, and antipodal, asymptotically embedded, and there are many others. So, there are many other characteristics given by other. Many other characteristics given by other people, but I don't have time to talk about any of this. So, although I didn't give a definition of anosov subgroups, I'll talk about some features of them. So, let gamma be a P NOSOF subgroup of G. So, first of all, such subgroups are what hyperbolic. Then, if I if I click If I fix any base point x in the symmetric space of x, symmetric space of g, then I can get an orbit map from gamma to the orbit of x. And such orbit maps are quasi-isometric embedding, where on the group gamma, we put any word metric. In particular, In particular, since this embedding circuit was asymmetric, it follows that such subgroups are discrete. Moreover, there exist natural gamma equivalent embedding of the Gromov boundary. So this is the Gromov boundary of gamma to the flag manifold G mod P, where P is this class. is this class of Hanauso groups. So this map is called the limit map and this map is first of all it's an injective map, injective continuous map and it also has this extra feature that any two distinct points in the boundary of the group they're sent to antipodal points. I'll define what it means in a special case, but this is a notion of general position in flat manifolds. Poison in flag manifolds. So the image of this map is called the limit set of gamma. Okay, so here is a definition of antipodality. In the special case, G equals to HLN R and P is the minimal parabolic subgroup, which is also called the Baudel subgroup. So such subgroups, one can so the Baudel subgroup of S LNR is up to conjugacy, it's Up to conjugacy, it's the upper triangular matrices in SLNR. So, in this situation, the quotient of G by B is the full flag manifold of Rn. So, points here are complete flags in the n-dimensional equilibrium space, so two such points. So, these are flags in Rn, Vi and Wi. Vi and Wi, we call them antipodal if the complementary dimensional subspaces appearing here they intersect transversally. So their intersection is the trivial subspace. So here are some pictures in the case n equals 2, 3. So what I'm drawing here is a picture of complete flags in drawn in the real projective space. So they can be thought as some projective line. Be thought as some projective line with a base point, and here are two such flags which are antipodal, and on the right-hand side, here are examples which are not antipodal. Okay. All right. So a national question is which hyperbolic groups can be realized as NSO subgroups of some semi-simple Lee group. It turns out that. It turns out that any such hyperbolic which takes NSO representation in some same simple group can be sent to an NOSOF subgroup of SLNR. So you can just think about this question for the Lie groups, SLNR. Here is a short answer that many such subgroups have anosub representation, and here are some examples. Some examples. So, first of all, the fundamental group of any closed hyperbolic N-manifold, they take NOSOF representations because these manifolds, they carry natural projective structures. More generally, close in manifolds admitting strictly context projective structure, they also, their holonomy representation, they are also anoser. More generally, so this is a result by Benoit. By Denois. More generally, we shall show that some global Thurston manifolds have such convex productive structures and therefore their holinom representation is also an OSOF. And more recently, Danziger, Gerrito, and Castle, they showed that hyperbolic right-angle coach setter groups, any such hyperbolic right-angle coachetta group, they also take anosol implementations. So, all these examples, these are and also for some P and this some parabolic subgroup P of S L and R. And in this, all these examples, P is some maximal parabolic subgroup. And it turns out that for such maximal parabolic subgroups, we get like a lot of word hyperbolic group taking an assault representation. So another question is: okay, so if I replace Question is okay. So, if I replace the maximal parabolic subgroup by the minimal parabolic subgroup, which is the Borel subgroup, then which subgroups, what hyperbolic groups can be realized as an also subgroup? So, this is a question that was asked by Andreas Samarino, which says the following. So, let gamma be a Borel-Nosov subgroup of SLNR, and for simplicity, I'll assume gamma is torsion-free. Is it true that such subgroups? Is it true that such subgroups are always surface groups or free groups? Now, it might be non-obvious if you're looking at this for the first time, because SLNR is quite large-dimensional group for large N. So, like for Borel NSO subgroups to be just surface group and free group seems like very restrictive. But it turns out that the answer is yes in several cases. So, this was first proved by Cannery and Soholas in 2019, who showed that for n equals to three and four, the answer to this question is yes. N equals to two pace is classical, so any convex or compact subgroup of PSL2R is such as free. So, the first interesting case is n equals to Interesting cases n equals to 3. And then later on, Sohula showed that whenever n is of the form 4k plus 2, where k is any natural number, then also this question has positive answer. And then three years after, I showed that whenever n is congruent to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 modulo 8, then also this question has positive answer. This question has a positive answer. So, note that this result also contains all these previous results, but the proof that the proof that I had is quite different from what they did. So, as of now, the answer to this question is not known. For example, what happens when n equals to 7? Is it true that boron subgroup of SL7 are okay, that they are always subsulted? Okay, that there are always surface of free groups. Okay, so for the rest of the talk, I'll discuss the proof of the strategy of the proof of this result, which is also very inspired by Nisha. So let's begin. So the proof of this result has the following steps. So, let gamma be a Boda-Lenosov subgroup of SLNR, where I'll assume that n is these numbers, 2 up to 6, modulo 8. For simplicity, I'll assume that the boundary of gamma is connected. The more general case is not too far away. So, under this assumption, I want to conclude that gamma is a surface group. Okay. Okay, so the first step of the proof is to find an embedding of particle of H1 in the boundary of gamma. Now, there is a result by Bonk and Kleiner showing that for any water hyperbolic group which are not virtually free, there always exists a quasi-esometric embedding of the hydraulic plane. Quasi-sometric embedding of the hydraulic plane to these groups. And whenever we have such an embedding, we can look at the boundary map, and that will give an embedding of the boundary of phase two to the boundary of gamma. And boundary of phase two is circle. So then the second step, which is the main step of the proof, is to show that there exists an open neighborhood. An open neighborhood of the image of the circle. So I have some circle in the boundary of the group. I will send this circle by the limit map to the flag manifold. And I want to show that this image has a neighborhood which contains no other limit point of gamma. Which simply means that this image of S1 in the boundary of gamma is isolated circle. And since I assume that the boundary of the group is connected, The boundary of the group is connected, it tells me that, well, the boundary is homeomorphic to circle. And once I know this, then there is a classical work by a lot of people, Tupiya Gabari, and so on, which shows that if gamma is a hyperbolic group and the boundary of gamma is homeomorphic to circle, that implies gamma is a surface group. Okay, so that is the main strategy of the proof. And so, for the rest of the talk, I'll discuss this main step: how to show this result that this circle is isolated. Okay, so here is a more topological statement. So, let n be as above. So, let it be. Let it be a continuous map from circle to Plague manifold of Rn, which has this property that any two distinct points are sent to antibodal points. Then, whenever n is one of those numbers, then there exists an open neighborhood of the image of this circle such that any point in that Such that any point in that neighborhood is not an modal to some point on the circle. So, here is a curtain picture. So, I have a circle here and I send the circle by a continuous map to the flag manifold. And I assume that this map has this extra property that two distinct points goes to antipodal points. Then I can find some neighborhood such that given any point, I can find some. Given any point, I can find some point on the image which is not antipodal. So once I know this, then the property of the limit set of Hanover groups tell me that no other point in this neighborhood can be a limit point of the group because the limit set has this antipodality property. Okay, so this statement. Okay, so this statement then implies the main step in the previous slide. So I won't be able to. Excuse me, Subhaniep, actually, I don't think I'm quite parsing the hypothesis here in your theorem. What kind of a map? Okay, so H is a continuous map from circle to this flag manifold of an n. And my assumption is. And my assumption is that this map has this property that any two distinct points on the circle go to become antibodal points in the flag manifold. So that is the hypothesis. That is the hypothesis. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So if you have this hypothesis, then for n those numbers, the circle has this property. So, Pradeep, it might be instructive to draw a picture, if you can, of the ellipse. Picture, if you can, of the ellipse and why this property is true for ellipse. Otherwise, it looks kind of astounding what you are saying. Yeah, that there are such maps. But if you draw ellipse in the projective plane, then if you can, I don't know. I might be disrupting your talk completely. Yeah, actually, I'm not using my iPad. Okay. Okay. That's an example, though, that I can think of. An example, though, that I can think of. Okay, thank you. Yeah, okay. So, for example, I can okay. I can draw an example later on. Okay, you don't have to. I think I can imagine it. Yeah. All right. So, so, so this statement, I won't be able to give a precise proof of this because of the time, but I want to point out a property of disk fact manifolds. Fact manifolds for this end, which makes such a statement possible. So, this property, I'm calling this inversing property. I'll explain what this is in the next slide. So, whenever flag manifolds have this type of property, then this type of results are true. Okay, so let me describe what this property is. So, let's pick any point sigma minus in the flag manifold. Sigma minus in the flag manifold and let's consider the set of all points in the flag manifold which are antipodal to it. So I'm using the notation C to denote this subset. And this is an open dense cell in the flag manifold. It's also called maximal Suart shell. Okay. Now the stabilizer of this point sigma minus Of this point, sigma minus, so it is uh it is a borel subgroup. So, let's let's take the unipotent radical of this of this borel subgroup. So, like it's conjugate to upper triangular matrices with diagonal entries one. And then given any point sigma plus in this open set, I can parametrize the open set by this subgroup u. And the parametrization is that for any And the parameterization is that for any any point sigma plus in the cell, the parameterization is any element u maps to the translate of that point by u. And this is a different option. Now, let us consider all points in u, all elements in u, such that u sigma plus is antipodal to sigma plus. Sigma plus. Now, what this is, this is geometrically, this is intersection of two opposite Schubert shells. So, this open set has a lot of connected components. It's a very old result by Shapiro and Einstein, who showed that for n large enough, there are three times two to the power n plus n minus one connected components. And many of them have different topological. Different topological properties. So now I want to define a map on omega. So it turns out this open subset is preserved by the map from u to u which sends any element u to its inverse. So I'll say that the flag manifold has inversion property if this map. If this map this inversion map IOTA, it does not preserve any connected component of homeograph. So now here is the here is the here is a result which says that if L is those numbers from two to six modulo eight, then this flag manifold has this inversion property. Okay. So this map IOTA does not preserve any IOTA does not preserve any connected component of this intersection of two opposite short shells. Now, we might wonder like what happens if n is not one of these numbers. It turns out that if n is plus or minus, if n is equivalent to plus or minus modulo eight, then this flag manifolds does not have this property, which is quite surprising. And I don't know. And I don't know whether this property holds for flag manifolds if n is divisible by 8. Okay. All right. So did you prove it that property fails? Yes. So I see because you asked for math overflow, I know, and nobody knew. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, nobody knew whether this is true or false. So I also want to mention like. So, so I also want to mention: like when n is two or six modulo eight, which kind of mostly covered the previous cases, the proof is not too hard, but in other cases, it's quite combinatory. So, I basically used the work by these people who kind of gave some assigned some invariance for each connected component. And I, so those are like some commentary real thing, and then checking that none of this. Checking that none of these things are preserved. Okay. So one might wonder what is the story for other Lie groups. So for example, for which pair G and P, the P and S of subgroup class is always surface group of freedom. So it turns out that the inversion property that I described in the previous slide. The inversion property that I described in the previous slide, it generalizes quite easily to any flag manifolds because we can give those parameterizations of the cells. Moreover, one can also like we can show that if the flag manifold Z modular P has this property, then P and also subgroups are always surface groups or free groups. So this is So, this is a work with Greenberg and Gessenberg, which is very new. And using this result, we proved that if G is the symplectic group, and then we can classify for which parabolic subgroups these flag molecules have this property, and for which parabolic subgroups, these flag manicles don't have this property. So it turns out. So it turns out that, like, if for some parabolic subgroups, this class are always surface groups or free groups. And in the other ones, for which this property does not hold, one can embed three manifold groups as another subgroups. Okay, so I also want to mention that the first statement was also proven along with. Was also proven around the same time by Posatian Schoolers. Okay, so I want to mention another generalization of these results. And this is inspired by Misha, Liv and Potti's characterization of anosov subgroups, which is called URU. So one of their characterization is that a subgroup is anosof if and only if Be sinosov if and only if the orbit maps are quasi-isometric embedding with this extra regularity property, which is called uniformly regular. And so here's a more general statement that one can prove using basically the same techniques is the following. So let X be the symmetric space of SL and R, where n is those numbers. Any of those numbers. If gamma is any torsion-free finitely generated group, and from gamma to x, we have such an embedding, then gamma has to be surface report-free group. So this theorem is more given because here I'm not assuming gamma to be a subgroup of SLNR. It's just some quasi-somatic embedding. Okay. So, an immediate consequence is that. An immediate consequence is that among the rank one symmetric spaces, this type of embeddings into the symmetric space of SLNR for the with respect to the Borel class, the only one which admits such embeddings is the hyperbolic plane. Okay. And these statements are again always true whenever the flag manifolds have this inversion property. All right. So I think. So I think I don't have time to talk about the last slide. I want to thank all of you for listening and to thank Misha for everything and happy workday. Thank you. It's too bad that you don't have the iPad to draw a picture. To draw a picture because picture is kind of a structure just in the case of the projective plane, but okay. Yes. Could you repeat what you said? I couldn't hear. Just too bad that you don't have the technology. Oh, yeah. I can draw a picture in my head and show. A picture in my iPad and show it with my camera. So here is a here is a convex domain. And so this is in RP2. And then so if I take, so the full flags are going to be points on the boundary of this convex level and the line tangent to it. So this is going to be an example of such embeddings. So, okay, okay. Maximum, yeah.
