Okay, I guess we're gonna start. So this is a good thing to start. Okay. Good morning, everyone. Yeah, so today I'll talk about the Tributarov density theorem, and I'll focus on an effective version of this theorem proven by Ligarius and Odlisko in 1977. So I'll try to go over the important aspects. Over the important aspects of their proof. And along the way, Artinal functions and Hepal functions will make a prominent appearance. So I'm going to have to talk about these as well. But I'll talk, there's a lot to be said about these topics, especially about Artinal functions. But I'm only going to focus on the things that are relevant to the proof of the effective Shigetar density theorem. Now, in today's lecture, we're going to depend heavily on the algebraic On the algebraic tools that Kaninika introduced in her talk a few days ago. And I'm gonna use some facts from representation theory of finite groups. But if you have any questions on the spot, please feel free to stop me and ask. Now, in preparing this lecture, these were extremely useful references for me. Of course, the paper of Ligarius and Ovliska, in which they proved their Chipotarov density theorem. There's a new version. There's a version of it that is text. It's available online. Just Google the name of the paper and it'll pop up. And I put that version in the Dropbox folder for my lecture. This book by Ram Murthy and Kumar Murthy, chapter three, I believe, is on art and health functions. And also the PhD thesis of Asif Zeman. All right. Okay. Okay, so let's lay out the algebraic setup that will be with us, stay with us throughout this lecture. What do we have? We're going to be working with a finite field extension L over K. So you have Q here, K, and then L. Now the degree of L over Q, we're going to denote it by N L. The degree of K. By NL. The degree of K over Q, we're going to denote it by NK. Oh, and I forgot to mention, most importantly, L over K is a Galois extension, and the corresponding Galois group, we're going to denote it by G. So whenever you see G, if I don't define it, this is the Galois group of L over K. The absolute discriminant of L over Q is denoted by delta sub L and that of K is denoted by delta sub K. And the norm here, that's just the norm from K to Q. Um, that's just the norm from k to q, so I'm gonna suppress the superscript and subscript here. And throughout the lecture, I'm gonna be using uppercase P for prime ideals in OK and MathCal P for prime ideals in OL, right? So P would live in OK. Here is the ring of integers of K, O L is the ring of integers of L, and I'm gonna be. And I'm going to be using uppercase P for ideals in OK. I'm going to do that. Fancy P for ideals in OL, and just little P for prime numbers for just rational parameters. And almost always when these two ideals appear together, there's a relation between them. So I would want upper, this curly P to be to lie above P. What do I mean by P Lie above P. What do I mean by that? As you've seen in Kaneneka's lecture, O sub L is a dedicated domain. So we have unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals. So if you take P O L, that's an ideal that lives in O L. It's not necessarily prime anymore, but you can write it as the product of prime ideals. If I want to, oh, I don't know, it's here, it's not on my screens. That was what's confusing to me. I thought it's related to what I'm talking about. Yeah, okay, so um. Yeah, okay. So, um, all right. Yes, where were we? So now each of these, each of these, so P1, P2, PR, these are primes that lie above P, we say, okay. Now, because I am in a Galois extension, all these ramification indices are equal, right? So, just in this case, because I'm in a Galois extension, I'm just gonna remove this. Remove this. They all have the same ramification, and that's all right. So that's so, so I d so basically this P is one of these things. That's what I mean. Okay. And also, as we saw in Kaninica's lecture, there are two important subgroups associated with a prime ideal P in OL, the decomposition group and the inertia, the decomposition subgroup and the inertia subgroup. Group and the inertia subgroup. What are these? Let me remind you of their definition. D sub P, so associated with the prime ideal P in O L. D sub P is the subgroup of element sigma in G in the Galois group, such that sigma of P equals P. And the inertia group I sub P are these elements in G such that sigma of X minus X is in P for all X. Now it is not. Now it is known, one can show that ISOP is a normal subgroup of D sub P, and then you take the quotient group D sub P mod I supp that is cyclic and it is generated by what we call the Frobenius automorphism, which we will denote by sigma sub P and it is identified by this property, sigma sub P of X is equivalent to X to the norm of P mod P. Notice here, this P is the prime ideal. Prime ideal is the prime ideal in OK, and this is the prime ideal in OL lying above it. Now, two things that I would like to mention here, sigma sub P is well defined, modulo I sub. All right, so it's only well defined. All right, so it's only well-defined modulo I sub P. Now, if, oh, another thing is that one might ask here: what if we take a different prime ideal lying above P? All right. So if P1, P2 lie above P in the sense that I described in the previous lecture, what is the relation between sigma P1 and sigma? P1 and sigma. What is the relation between sigma p1 and sigma p2? All right, then yeah, so what I want to say here is that G acts transitively on these on these on these on these on the corresponding Fribenius automorphisms. Of Fribenius automorphisms. So, what I want to say here is that our conjugates in G. All right, so this brings us to the definition of the art and symbol, which I will write down here. So, notice that, or recall that. Or recall that the size of IP is E, the ramification index that appeared in that factorization that I showed you on the previous slide. So if P is unramified in L, then E equals one. And so the inertia subgroup is trivial. I'm just gonna say that here. Say that here, referring to just a trivial group, and so P is well defined now. All right, is well defined as an element in G. And what I'm going to do is we will denote by stigma sub p. And what is the difference here? This is the P. Is the difference here? This is the P in OK to be the conjugacy class of sigma sub P H. All right, we use the symbol. Or might just denote it as such: the art and symbol of P. Right? So, this symbol encapsulates information about how this prime ideal P splits in L. Okay. Now, this is these are the definitions that I need to state the Chibitar density theorem. Distributor of density theorem. Distributor of density theorem is a statement about the density of prime ideals in K that split in L in a certain prescribed way. All right, so more precisely, that's the statement here. So I will start by the statement of Chibutarov density theorem as the classical version with no error term. All right, so for that, we need a prime counting function that we're going to estimate. Let's see be a conjugacy class. Let's C be a conjugacy class. Let's C be a conjugacy class of G. Pi sub C of X is the number of prime ideals in K that are n-ramified and whose Arton symbol is equal to that given C with the and such that their norm is up to X. All right, so we're counting the prime ideals up with norm up to X, which are n-ramified and whose art and symbol is that given C. Is that given C? The chimatar density theorem tells me that as x goes to infinity, pi sub c is asymptotic to the size of c divided by the size of g times li of x, where lie of x is our usual logarithmic integral. Right now, actually wanna let me see, I want to add a page here. You want to add a page here? No, that's how I add a page. All right, so this statement is ineffective. It doesn't tell me anything about the rate of convergence of pi of C to this quantity right here. But before we move into effective versions, I want to show you how. Now, of course, again, the sugar tarp density. The Shibatar density theorem has far-reaching applications and implications. But one way to look at it is it's a generalization, you can look at it as a generalization of Dirichlet's theorem for primes and arithmetic progressions. Or it may be a better way to say it is that, you know, the Dirichlet's theorem for primes and arithmetic progression follows as a special case of the Chibitarov density theorem. And so does the prime ideal theorem for number fields. So let me very quickly here just show you how do these. Very quickly, here just show you how do these follow as special cases of Jubitar density. So, for example, if you take L to BK, all right, then what is this? What is this quantity counting right here? What is pi sub C of X? Basically, it's just telling it, it is just the number of prime ideals with norm less than X. There are conditions. With norm less than x, their conditions are anti-really here. All right, and so we get pi of x being the number of prime ideals with norm less than or equal to x. It's asymptotic to, well, size of c and the size of g are both one, so that's live x. We knew that already, but it's just nice to see how that follows together. So, prime number theorem for So, prime number theorem for number field. What's that? Wasn't that proven before the Chibutar density theorem? Just the prime number theorem for, yeah, historically, yeah, yeah. Historically, yeah. No, yeah. I don't know, Connecticut, you mentioned that in your, so now we didn't know that. So now we didn't know that for now. All right. Another application is that if you take K to be Q and L to be Q adjoined, e to the 2 pi i over little q. All right. And if you apply Chibitar density to that, then you'd get the you'd get. Get the you'd get the Deutsche Lacey in four primes and four primes and arithmetic progressions. All right, so perhaps I know I'm going to run out of time. I like this proof, but I'm not going to show you. I think I'll, yeah. So with this, we'll, in this case, the Tributar of density theorem will imply that the number of primes. Okay, let's see. Okay, let's say here let A Q be relatively prime numbers of prime plus 10x is asymptotic one over 5Q. All right. Turns out 5Q here is the size of your Galois group, and the conjugacy classes have size one because we are an abelian extension here. An extension. What's that? Please. All right. Let's make sure here. Now we move to the version, the Chibitar density and perspective version of Chibitar density in the sense that the air. That's the error term, we have effective bounds on the effective upper bound on the error term. So, Lageris and Adliska proved in 1977. They proved two versions, one conditional on the GRH and one unconditional. So, I'm going to start with the conditional version. They assume the generalized Viemann hypothesis for the Dedekind zeta function associated with L. Again, here we are still under this setting. Setting. There exists effectively computable positive absolute constant C1 such that for every x bigger than 2, we have pi sub C of X equals absolute value of the size of C divided by the size of G lie of X plus big O of this quantity right here. Right? Effective in this Effective in the sense that the constants here are either absolute or very clearly depending the dependence on C over C and G and delta L and N L are very clear. Now, there's a refinement by Sir. Wanna mention? Is it 1981? Is it 1981? 84? That's the year I was born. Refinement by Sir 1984, you can remove this log delta under the GRH. Okay. Now, very important corollary of the Chibitar of density, especially this. Tributar of density, especially this version, this conditional version on the GRH with this really good error term, is a bound on the least prime in Chibotar of density. What do you mean by that? Basically, you can think of this as a number theoretic, as a number field analog of Linux problem that Asif talked about yesterday. So, again, assume the GRH for the Dedekind data function of L. For every A function of L. For every conjugacy class C of G, there exists a prime ideal P and ramified in L whose argon symbol is C and whose norm is at most this much. Okay. And they actually show in their paper how we can modify the argument a little bit and remove this. Can be removed. But it would not be a direct corollary of that theory. Be a direct corollary of that three. You're going to have to go over the argument and adjust it a little bit. So that's what we have under TRH. And a really nice, very nice result by Andrew Fiore in 2019 showed that this is under, he showed unconditionally that that's the best we can hope for. So he showed that he constructed an infinite family of Galois number fields L over Q for which the For which the smallest prime p, which was completely in L, has size at least log delta L to the two plus epsilon. Now you tell me, okay, where's the conjugacy class here and how is Chubitarov density related here? So when you're looking at a prime P in Z, so here we're thinking about Chibitarov density with K being Q and L being L. And so P is split. So, B splitting completely in L. It just basically means that the conjugacy class of the corresponding art and symbol is just the trivial conjugacy class. Because the size. Yeah. What's that? Two plus a little of one. Two plus little of one. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. This is, it is little of one, little of one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. Thank you for that wish. Yeah, no. All right. What's going through infinity in the little O of one? Yeah, the discriminant of the number fields. All right. Now unconditional effect of Shibatarv density theorem. So if you don't assume the GRH, you still get something. So there exists effectively computable absolute positive. computable absolute positive constant C3C4 such that if log x is bigger than 10 times NL times log delta L squared, you get an error term of this size. Now, what is x to the beta here? Beta is the possible exceptional zero of the Dedekind Zeta function. If it exists, it's going to be simple and real, and it will be in this region right there, in this little, this rectangle here, close to This rectangle here, close to one. Now, these kinds of bounds, even if this did not exist, even if this doesn't exist, these kind of bonds are not good for getting some bounds on the least prime, like good bounds for least primes. Okay, so now what's going to happen? Let me see how I'm doing. Okay, now back. So, what I'm going to do now is. What I'm going to do now is talk about the strategy in their proof. Some of these slides are already pre-full, but at some point I'm just going to start a new, like open new pages and start writing on it. So when it comes to the proof, I'll be handwriting things. Okay, but what's the idea behind the proof in Ligueris Odlisko's result? Result. All right, see something. All right, so what is it that we're looking for? We're looking for, oh no, before actually I go into the proof, I want to say some stuff about recent, about some work that is being done in this area. One thing here is that, let's go back to the conditional result. If you're willing to assume another conjecture, Arten conjecture, then you Conjecture, Artin conjecture, then you can actually get, you can improve that error term. So if you assume the GRH along with Artin conjecture, I'll say a little bit about what Artin conjecture is, then I think you can improve this bound by replacing absolute value of C with square root of size of C by square root of size of C. And that's, I think, a result due to Kumar-Murti and Ram-Murti. And another thing is that. And another thing is that there has been recent work on computing explicit bounds for the error term in the Jubilee R density theorem. So such work can be found in Winkler's thesis from 2000, early 2000s, I would say. And also Surabdas also did the undervision of supervision of Habiba Nathan in his master's thesis. In his master's thesis, he also worked out explicit bounds, explicit bounds for the error term distributor of density, conditional and unconditional. Actually, they get improvements on these results. All right. Right, so now let's go to the idea, the idea of okay, so we have a prime counting function. So, we have a prime counting function that we're trying to estimate. That's basically what's happening here. So, if you want, let's write pi sub c here. So, if I want to write it this way, okay, so what am I counting here? I'm counting the prime ideals that are unramified. And such that part and symbol is a given C. Okay. Like we did, like we did in proof of the classical prime number thing. Instead of we're working with pi, we're going to be working with, instead of the prime counting function, we're going to be working with the prime child counting function, right? So that we denote by pi sub C in this setting, pi sub C of X. Okay, and as you would expect, we're going log norm of p and okay. So I'm going over all prime powers now. Okay, m from zero, well, m bigger than zero, prime, peep, prime ideal, p unramified and And the art and the art and symbol of p to the power of n is that's what I'm counting here. We're going to work towards obtaining an asymptotic for this prime power counting function. And then, just like in the classical case, partial summation can be applied in a standard way to go from an asymptotic of pi sub C to an asymptotic for pi sub. Of pi sub C to an asymptotic for pi sub C. Now, the idea here, usually, when you have an arithmetic expression like that, right, the start, the point of departure in these kind of proofs is application of Perron's formula, some kind of Mellon inversion, right? So, we want to apply Perron's formula. So, we want to figure out what would be the Dirichlet series associated with this partial sum here, all right? So, very naively. So, very naively, we would say, okay, we would want to relate this. So what Dirichlet series here would go m from 0 to infinity. Prime ideal is okay. We would want P to be unramified and theta. Theta sub m theta just theta to the log norms p over norms p to the m s that would be the Dirichlet series associated whose partial the partial sums of its coefficients would be this would be this this psi function here, right? That's what we would want. That's what we want what you do and this state. we want what you do and this theta theta here is used to single out this theta here is used to single out the primes which satisfy this relation so this Dirichlet series is it related to any kind of L function that's what we want to think about for the next step now Now, if we have any hope, if we have any hope in this being related, so ideally it would be if you remember, let me actually have a little bit of die question. So, from the classical prime number theorem, how did it go? We wanted to estimate this expression. That's log p, p to the m less than x, right? And then Fermi's formula would tell me that this is related to the Dirichlet series associated with that. Stigma bigger than one, of course. Sigma bigger than one, of course, X to the S over S ds plus some error term, right? And then, amazingly, this is minus zeta prime over zeta. And now we move to using the analytic properties of zeta, its pulls, its zeros, to analyze this contour integral, you know, move lines of integration, estimate integral, and get an asymptotic form psi of x. That's what we. It from psi of x. That's what we want to do here. That's the idea. So we would want to relate, we would want to relate this Dirichlet series to some kind of maybe logarithmic derivative of some kind of alpha function that has nice analytic properties. That's the idea. So if we want to have something that has a functional equation, we wouldn't want to exclude any types of prime. We want a sum that is over all primes, not just unramified primes. So let's say. Unramified one. So let's say what we're going to be considering, what's going to happen, what's going to appear is this Dirichlet series, F sub C of S, which is just like the one before, I only included all primes. I included, I put in the ramified primes back in. All right. So what would theta of P to the M be for a ramified prime? I'll talk about this a little bit. I'll tell you where this theta comes from. But for now, just know that this in absolute. Just know that this is an absolute value for a ramified prime, theta of p to the m is going to be an absolute value less than or equal to one. So the contribution of ramified, so we add them in, and then their contribution is going to be negligible at the end, and we can throw them out. Okay. As it turns out, F sub C of S can be written as Of S can be written as a linear combination of logarithmic derivatives of certain Artinal functions. All right. But the problem is that we don't know much about the holomorphy of Artinal functions in all cases. Some cases are pretty much known. But in all cases, the level of generality here, we don't know if this L function, if Art and L functions have an LED continuation, for example, except for a poll at S. Except for a pole at S equals one, for example. So we don't know that. So, what's the way around that? I'm going to explain that's that's that's the point that I would like to highlight most in this in this in this talk. So, let's go over the steps in this proof. So, number one, step number one. We're going to use Perrun's formula, as I very roughly explained in the previous slide. To express sine sub C as a contour integral involving F sub C of S. F sub C of S, that Dirge List series. Let me call this integral right here I sub C of X T. Step number two. Again, as I said, it will turn out in this step, I will show you that F sub C of S is a linear combination, a complex. Linear combination, a complex linear combination of logarithmic derivatives of art and L functions. We want to reduce the problem into a problem about Haeckel functions rather than Art and L functions, because Haeckel functions are functions that we're quite satisfied with with our knowledge about their analytic continuation and their zeros and their poles. This can be done by a process called during reduction. So that's what we're going to do here. That's what we're going to do here for you. And Hackal functions here, number field analog of Dirichlet functions, your usual Dirichlet functions associated to Dirichlet characters. Okay. So what's going to happen is that, let me Gonna write F sub C of S as I think it's gonna go like let me see if I can minus over G sum some one-dimensional characters chi and that's very important here certain sum over one dimensional characters high bar of G Pi bar of G. All right, G here is a fixed element that we choose in our conjugacy class C. Just pick anyone, it doesn't matter. And then L prime over L S All right, these are Hackal functions. Logarithmic derivatives of Hakar functions. Yeah. Yeah. Start from one. You start on to your red from double. That's it. Okay, let me see. Okay, let me see. Is there a typo or something? Fine, typo, let me see where little M. Why would it start from one? Oh yeah, just start. It should start from one. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so say what would be the zero more feet of one with respect to okay. Um, so you said earlier that you want to avoid zero, but what does zero mean in the context of limited, and what's one meaning? And what's one mean and not sure I understand the question? Can you take the logo the druid? Oh, no, sure. I agree with that. But earlier you said you want to avoid zero. So you want the non-zero prime ideals. So what does it mean to be a zero? Well, the zero, the trivial ideal is just zero is zero. Just a zero. Just the zero element. Just zero and one and then and then one would be the full full okay sure yeah trying to figure out how many ease. Trying to figure out how many years are moving. So, what he does is he takes the representative from the conjugacy and looks at the cyclic group generated. That's right, yes. And then that cuts out the median extension. And then you have to apply the reciprocity. And actually, so in this, in this talk, yeah, absolutely. In this talk, I'm going to focus on step one, step two, step three. On step one, step two, step three comes up. Yes. All right, so that's step two. And now that we've reduced our problem into a problem about Heckel functions, we just proceed as you would proceed usually. So at this point, we're gonna take, so you see, you're gonna put this. So, you see, you're going to put this expression back in this integral, all right? And you interchange this summation with this integration. So, you're going to be dealing with, let's look at each one, each integral corresponding to one character at a time. So, we're going to be considering 1 over 2 pi i, the integral sigma 0 minus i t, sigma 0 plus i t. T sigma 0 plus it L prime over L S chi x to the s for s s. All right, we're going to move the line of integration to the left collect residues of the integrant So apply Cauchy's residue theorem and so collect residues of the integrant at poles contains And some within some contour now this integrand here has a pole. It's going to have a double pole at s equals zero, right? It's going to have a simple pole at s equals one. equals one if chi happens to be the trivial character and it's going to have poles simple poles coming from the zero of the alpha function trivial and non-trivial so we're going to count these all right but one of the one of the one of the so this will give rise so among other things so again the residue we're going to analyze it as a sum of four terms one of these terms is the sum coming from trivial non trivial zeros of the al function. Trivial zeros of the L function. All right, this will give rise to a sum. See what I called it here subcon X T Some over non-trivial zeros of the corresponding L function. And the rest of the proof really is trying to estimate this sum. Now, here's where Now, here's where we assume GRH or we don't assume GRH. If you assume the GRH, then estimating the sum isn't difficult at all. If you don't want to assume the GRH, then you're going to have to come up with some good zero-free region to estimate this. So the conditional result is just applying the GRH, estimating the sum. Their unconditional result, they had to obtain an effective zero-fee region for the course for the For the course, for the Dedekindz data function, in order to be able to estimate this sum. Okay, so with or without with or without GRH okay, I need one more page now. Step number five. Now, step number five. Five would be: at this time, we've estimated everything that needs to be estimated. We're just going to have to choose our parameter t in a way to minimize the error term. Step fi step six would be partial summation. Would be partial summation to go from an asymptotic of psi to an asymptotic for pi. So depending on how things go, I plan to cover as much as I can of steps one, two, and three. All right. But in order to do that, I'm going to. But in order to do that, I'm going to have to talk a little bit about HECA characters and corresponding L functions, partner L functions. All right, so Hakkel functions. Again, you want to think about HECAL functions as number field analogs, number field generalizations of Dirichlet al functions associated with Dirichlet characters. So here, let's say we have a finite extension k over q, and let's say f is an integral ideal in k. Let if be Let If be the group of fractional ideals of K relatively prime to F, and let P of F be the subgroup of principal ideals alpha that are, well, where alpha is congruent to one mod F and where alpha is totally positive. So basically, we want the embedding, so the image of alpha under the real embeddings to be positive for all the real embeddings. All right, so you take the quotient group of these of I of F mod P of F. Of I of F mod P of F, you get a finite group. Something to prove here, but that's not, I'm not going to go through into these details. That's what we call the Ray class group of K module F. Now, with a little bit, there's a little bit of work involved, but actually, if K is Q itself, and you just take an integer M in OK, all right, with these conditions, the Ray class group is nothing but invertible elements mod M, the group of invertible elements. mod M, the group of invertible elements mod M. Okay? And HECA characters, the HECA characters of the rate class group of K mod F, well, HECA characters are characters of this group. That's basically how we're going to look at HECA characters. And for a subgroup A containing, for a subgroup A of I of F containing P of F, we will use the notation, somewhere might use this notation, chi-mod A to mean a character chi mod. To mean a character chi of the array class group that is trivial on A. And now a Hat character can be extended to all ideals by just saying that chi of A is zero for all A not relatively prime to F, just like what you would do with the classical Dirichlet character. And here also we have the notion of primitive characters. A primitive character is a character that is not induced by any A character that is not induced by any character coming from a lower modulus. Okay, I'm not going to go into the details here, but you hear me see primitive characters. And I would be looking at L functions associated with primitive characters. But wouldn't, in terms of zeros and poles, the L function associated with a primitive character differs from the L function associated with a non-primitive character by just a few, but finitely many local factors. So it won't. local factors so it's it won't it won't be uh so the in terms of zeros and poles it won't be a problem for us at all all right so the l function associated with the primitive character chi mod f is given by this absolutely convergent dirichlet series so you're summing over all uh you're summing over all um ideals non-zero ideals uh phi of a over norm of a to the s Pi of A over norm of A to the S, and that's absolutely convergent when real part of S bigger than one. And you add in a few Archimedean factors here, gamma of S chi. So A of chi here and B of chi. We don't have to know exactly what they are, but suffices for the purposes of this talk. We just want to know that they're non-negative and they sum up to the degree of the field extension, K over Q. Now, Now, you complete the L-function by multiplying by these Archimedean factors and a few others, and you get yourself lambda of s chi, which is entire, satisfies a functional equation, and has a Hadermart product, the composition. All right. And then from that, from that functional equation, one can see that this. One can see that this L function has trivial zeros. These trivial zeros, we're going to denote them by omegas, and they're located at the point zero, negative integers, even integers. But I separated these cases because in each of these cases, the order of the zero is different. All right. Now, if it happens that chi is the principal primitive character, then your L function is nothing but the Dedekindzeta function of the number field K. So if chi primitive principle character, then let's just And from the Hademart product, we can get this explicit formula right here that you've seen in almost every other talk in this summer school for various kind of alpha functions. Oh, delta of chi here is basically the indicator function of the principal character. So that's one. If chi is principal, zero otherwise. Now we move to Art and L functions. So these are going to also appear in our computations. So what are Art and L functions? Again, let me remind you of the setup here. We have a Galois extension L over K. The associated Galois group is G. We're going to consider a representation phi of Representation phi of the group G, an n-dimensional complex representation phi of the group G. So basically what this is, it's a homomorphism from G to G Ln C. And its character, we're going to denote it for each representation. You can associate a character. This character is defined as such. So I'm going to denote it by chi. And chi of G really, by definition, it's the trace of phi of G. Of G, right? Just very, you know, naively looking at it. Phi of G is an n by n matrix, you're just taking its press. Right? The R and L function associated to phi is given as an Euler product. It's not starting, it's not given as an absolutely convergent rescue shares to start with, and then you do. Rescue shears to start with, and then you do analog continuation, things like that. That's not how it goes for Art and L functions. You define them as an Euler product, as a starting point, right? So the Euler factors here, L sub P of S phi, L over K, if P is n-ramified in L, then this is the determinant of the N by N matrix minus phi of sigma P. Sigma P is the Frebenius, is the part and symbol of P, norm of P to the negative S. P, norm of p to the negative s to the negative one. Now, if p is ramified, then we need to do a little bit of adjustment here. So phi of sigma, so here, this sigma sub p is the Frobenius automorphism associated with a prime p lying above p. But we're going to have to restrict the action to the subspace. So, V here, let's say here, underlying vector space is V. So I'm going to restrict to the subspace of V that is invariant under the action of isop, the inertia group, right? You know, you look at it, you say, well, you know, you're making a choice here, you're choosing one. You're choosing one prime ideal in L that lies above P. What if we choose another one? Because there can be other ones. Well, it's an exercise here. Maybe I don't have learning activity session, unfortunately, but still give exercise. Exercise, this definition is well defined. Okay. Now, of course, I mean, I could just say this because if P is unramified, then Is unramified, then this boils down to this, really. But it's nice to see the separate pieces. Artin showed that Artinal functions satisfy this additive property. So if you look at the Artinal function associated direct sum of two representations, then that's the product of the associated Art and L functions. But more importantly, he showed this inductive. Showed this inductive property. If H is a subgroup of G and tau is a representation of H, all right, there is a process where you can induced from tau and get a representation of G. All right, I'm not going to go through this process, but that's that's going to call this, this is called the induced representation of tau. That's a representation of G now. All right. And the L function associated with the induced representation is more or less, well, is equal to the Well, is equal to the L function associated with the original representation. The Galois extension here is L mod L H. L H here is the fixed, is the subfield of elements in L that are fixed by the action of H. Okay. Now, Brower showed in 1947 an extremely important theorem. If chi is an irreducible If chi is an irreducible character of g, right? Oh, one thing that you'll see in the remaining of, I sometimes instead of associating, instead of having the representation here, I would write the corresponding character. But that's okay because we also, it is known that characters determine the representation up to isomorphism. So that's, so that's, that's, there's, you know, there's a bit of abuse of notation here, but it's. A bit of abuse of notation here, but it's correct. All right, so if chi is an irreducible character of g, that is to say, a character of an irreducible representation of g, then there exists subgroups h i of g, integers mi, and one-dimensional character psi i of h i, such that chi can be written as such. So chi is an integral combination, integral linear combination of the induced characters. Of the induced characters of these psi i's. All right. So we write chi as a linear combination of as a as an integral representation of characters induced by one-dimensional characters. Now, Brewer's induction and Artin's reciprocity actually give us that an Artin L-function admits a mirror mode. An optional function admits a meromorphic continuation. How so? Maybe I can show some of the details here. So we have chi is that's Bruce's induction. Okay, so by the additive property of R L functions I'm applying the additive property and then I apply the inductive property, induction property now, these right here. Now, these right here are Artinal functions associated with one-dimensional representations. Artin's reciprocity tells me that these correspond to Haeckel functions. So, Artens reciprocity here, maybe I'll denote it by I sub psi I, or something like that. I sub psi i, or something like that, and LH here, according to my. So these are Haca L functions. And since we know the analytic continuation of these L functions, then that gives us a meromorphic continuation of the architect. Okay. Now, Arten's conjecture. Now, Artin's conjecture. So maybe, since we're talking about Artinal functions, let me mention Artin's conjecture. Artin's conjecture is the conjecture that if phi is if phi is not the trivial representation. Representation, then the corresponding is entire. Yeah, it's not okay. Okay, yes, yes. Phi yes, phi reducible, phi reducible. Now, if phi is not the trivial representation, then LSF phi is. That tells us all right now I'm going to say a little bit about this Artens reciprocity, this connection between Arten alfunctions of one-dimensional representations and Hecke alfunctions. So not going to go So, not going to go into the details here because I can't, but suffice is to say the following. Suppose you have an abelian subgroup H of G, all right? And then you consider, and then G here is the Galois group of L over, K. Let's consider a one-dimensional character of H and let E be the fixed subfield of L under the action of H. Under the action of H. Right? So basically, here you get a so there exists an integral ideal F attached to the extension L over E. So that's Artin's reciprocity. Artin's reciprocity is the statement that there exists an integral ideal F attached to this extension L over E and a subgroup A of the subgroup A of the fractional ideals, the fractional ideals relatively prime to F, such that mod A is isomorphic to the Galois group of L over E, which is really nothing. I mean, this is nothing but H. This is the Galois group of L, L H, and that's just H by the fundamental theme of Galois theory. Touch that, and because of this correspondence between our abelian subgroup of G and Subgroup of G and this quotient group of I of F, we have a correspondence between one-dimensional characters of H and HECA characters of this quotient group. All right, so this way we get a correspondence, and then just this gives us a correspondence between the associated L function. So the L function of the Art and L function associated with chi can actually be expressed. Can actually be expressed as the alpha function associated with the primitive HECA character, a certain primitive HECA character. So just going to the details, there are some details here embedded in this equality, but we don't have to go through it. But that's what we mean by Arten's recipes. Right. Okay, so now the half hour remaining, let's see how much I can cover of the steps that I. I can cover the steps that I talked about in the proof of the effective version of Chipotarov density theorem. All right, so see, step one. Remember, step one was basically we want the end, by the end of step one, we want to write psi sub C, the prime power counting function, as a contour integral involving that Dirichlet series F sub C of S. F sub C of S. And we want to realize this F sub C of S as a linear combination of logarithmic derivatives of certain art and L functions. That's step one. Okay, so let me remind you of the setup. Galois extension L over K. The Galois group is G. Let's consider an irreducible representation phi. Five of G okay with character con. So, what I want to show you here is how do art and L functions appear to start with from just that arithmetic prime power counting section? Let's define this. define this chi sub k of p to the m I'm gonna define it as such one over so what I have here p is a prime in okay I'm gonna take a prime above it that lives above it and take the corresponding inertia group Now, if P is ramified, what's just for example here, if P is ramified, is unramified, I'm sorry, is unramified in L then I sub P is trivial for all P laying above P. For all p lying above p. And so this definition here is nothing but what? Just chi of you see, chi is a character of a representation as a class function, that is, it is invariant under conjugation. So I can go from sigma sub p to just the conjugacy class sigma sub p. Okay? Okay, but now we had to tweak this function chi sub k in this way to accommodate for ramified primes. Okay, all right. Now we look at the unramified part of the R T and L function. I'm just going to focus on the unramified part for simplicity. I'm going to denote it by such. So the unramified part of the R ten L function. Right. Now let's take one both sides.  Now, what I'm going to do, I'm going to diagonalize phi of sigma p. All right, so there exists sigma such that sigma phi of sigma p sigma inverse is diagonal. And along the diagonals, we have the eigenvalues. But diagonalizing will not affect the determinant. Okay, so this is the Determinant. Okay, so this is the same as. So when I say sigma here, the sigma is basically that matrix that diagonalizes phi of sigma p. Right, so the determinant here becomes a product, just a product of the diagonal entries. What are the diagonal entries? They're of the form 1 minus lambda i. Well, let's just write it like that. 1 minus lambda 1. is lambda one norm of p to the minus s dot dot dot one minus lambda n norm of p to the minus s n being the dimension of our representation. So we're summing over I I'm gonna expand this Taylor series expansion of logo. Taylor series expansion of log of one minus x. That's then the minus, then the minus goes away. All right. I don't need to do pages. There's already a page. We should rearrange. So, what you get here This sum right here is nothing but the trace of sigma to the n. Right and well, basically, that's Which is by definition of character right and should stay here, of course. Should say here, of course, views of notation phi of sigma p to the and that's character which agrees now with that phi sub k with that chi sub k. Sure, why my apple pen is doing that of p to that. Of P to the R. Right? And as it turns out, as it turns out, if you work with the ramified primes as well, so overall, log of L. So be more careful with ramified primes to get.  Let me take one of the next webinars. All right. Okay, so but still, how does that now, that indicator function of the art and symbol being that particular conjugacy class come into play? So let C be a conjugacy class. Let C be a conjugacy class and let G be an element in C. Okay? Now, again, what I would like to do is relate that prime power counting function with Art and L functions. So for that, I'm going to define this function f sub c. This function f sub c. So we're going to go over all irreducible characters chi of G and take this linear combinations of them for this particular little g that I fixed. Okay, so this it turns out it is actually a class function. It is actually a class function of G and by the orthogonality relation of group characters, you can actually show that this is the size of G over the size of C if Y belongs to C, if Y is conjugate to G, that is, and zero otherwise. Otherwise. Now, let's consider F sub C of S. Now, remember, I've already introduced the definition of F sub C of S. I'm going to introduce a different definition and reconcile both. I'm going to consider This linear combination of R and L functions. So here I'm going over all irreducible characters of G. As it turns out, again, this F sub C of S will be the F sub C that I introduced earlier in the talk. Okay. I'm going to use this observation that we just made for the logarithmic derivative. So, what did we say? We said that's the sum over all prime. That's the product. That's the sum over all primes p, we're all m chi sub k of p to the m log of norm of p over norm of p to the ms. Now, what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna interchange summations. I need to keep this. I need to keep this and log normal P, normal P to the M S and then here I have that. I'm gonna write out the definition of chi sub k of p to the m. All right space Space So, what was it? Chi of sigma p to the m alpha, right? I think that's what it was. Yeah, okay. Okay. Now, this right here is this function f sub c that I defined earlier evaluated at sigma sub p to the m alpha. So, according to that orthogonality relation, oh, along with this, let me actually highlight this as well. Actually, highlight this as well. So, if you go back, the definition of f sub c of y right here. So that's what appears. And then the orthogonality relation of characters gives us that this is the sum. Now am I gonna write that? Yes, yeah, yes, yes. Equals C. There is an alpha absence. Yeah. Yeah, this is the thing. That's what I was trying to see if I can separate ramified and unramified. But yeah, exactly. So why not write it like that now? Now we introduce that theta. Now we introduce that theta. Because now theta can be this complicated thing, whatever it is for ramified primes. It is for ramified primes, and you can easily verify the absolute value it's less than one. And it is one if sigma sub p to the m is c because there's no alpha if it's if we're working with unramified primes and it's zero otherwise. Where theta of m theta of p to the m is one zero less than or equal to one. Here, that's if P is ramified. In these cases, if P is unramified, and the conjugacy class of sigma P to the M is C, and that's P unramified, but that's different than C. Okay, so that's basically the purpose of this discussion here: just to show you how art and The question here is just to show you how R and L functions are related to this arithmetic prime power counting function. 10 minutes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do step two, Turing reduction, and that'll be it. No analysis, just algebra. Yes, sir. The absolute value of absolute value of Ferras, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's bad notation. Less than or equal to one in absolute value. How about that? Okay. All right. So, just very quickly, Perron's formula. Well, just choose a version, it's a truncated version of Perron's formula, sigma 0 bigger than 1, strictly bigger than 1, x bigger than or equal to 2. Define i sub c of xt to be 1 over 2 pi i, and then this integral. Because now we know we can do that. Right, so Peru's formula tells me that I sub C of X T minus the sum of theta P to the M log norm of P. Is less than or equal to some. Not going to go into the details, that's just whatever error term the truncated purrance formula would give. Now, the problem here is that psi sub C only counts unramified primes. So I need to take away the ramified primes from here. All right. But as it turns out, if you look at the contribution. If you look at the contribution of the ramified primes you'd get again as we said theta of p to the m is less than or equal to one when the primes are unramma are ramified so you get And that turns out to be less than or equal to log x log delta f. All right, so because basically ramified primes are the primes, are the primes dividing the different ideal of the extension L over K. All right. And if you just do a little bit of counting, that's basically this corresponds. This is less than or equal to the number of primes dividing the absolute. Of primes dividing the absolute discriminant delta L. And that's less than or equal to log delta L. All right, so as it turns out, that's what's going to go into the error. That's harmless. Okay. So now having done that, I will spend five minutes, six minutes talking about urine reduction. All right. So, what we're going to do again, the purpose here is to relate these Art and L functions to Art and L functions of one-dimensional representations. And then these by Art and reciprocity are Hakke al functions. So, again, C is the conjugacy class. And G is an element in C. We're going to take In C, we're going to take H to be the subgroup of G generated by little J. Okay, and we're going to consider E to be the fixed field of L, the fixed field of H. Elements in L fixed by H. So H is cyclic, so its representations are one-dimensional. Irreducible representations. Now here is a claim, and therefore I'm going to leave it to you as an exercise. That's the most important claim in this reduction. That's the idea. Yeah. But it could be, I mean, more or less, this is doable, verifying this equality is doable. Right? Is that this actually on one hand? That this actually, on one hand, this is just this f sub c function that I defined earlier, right? And that you can play around with this. Oh, I didn't say what psi star is, where psi star is the induced representation of psi from h to g, right? Because here you're summing over all irreducible representations of h, one-dimensional representations necessarily, and size. Necessarily. And psi star here is the representation induced by psi to g. So exercise, verify this. Now that we have that, let's go back to F sub C of us. Just now call it chi irreducible representations of G, chi bar of g, L prime of L, S chi, L of agree. We've agreed that you can write F sub C as such. Okay. I should have written it on the second page. On the second page, copy All right And this by itself, just removing the minus here that is the sum. Here. That is the sum over all prime ideals p, all positive integers m of log norm of p, this chi-sub k business that we talked about, p to the m over norm of p to the ms. We're going to do a little bit of rearranging things this circle all the way here. So Here. And I'm going to write down the definition of this again. And here's where we apply that claim. This right here is the same as summing over all the reducible characters of H. Sti star of sigma p to the m alpha rearranging back, going backwards. That's just regular key. What do we get right here? We get We get I don't want this. I'm just gonna say by three of time over hour. And now the induction property of part and L functions tells me that this is the same as the L function associated with the original psi for the Galois extension L over E. So now we've reduced our problem into dealing with Arten-Alfung of Haca alfung. Of Hakke al function. So by art and reciprocity, these one-dimensional representations of H correspond to Hakka character, primitive Hakka characters. So now we're dealing with logarithmic derivatives of Hakka L functions, and we've seen that these are analytic L functions, the sense of chapter five in Vianni Kowalski, then you can apply the usual standard analytic techniques. By standard, I don't mean easy. There are a lot of details, intricate details in these computations. Details in these computations in computing these contour integrals. I will make sure to have a detailed exposition on my type notes, but that's it for me. Thank you very much. I'm a bit worried about the group theory theorem because the The general consensus of the cyclotronic field is the least prime residue class should be all Q1 plus epsilon. See, and the Riemann hypothesis gives two plus epsilon. Yeah. So Andrew Fiore's work says that's the best possible. Yes. But it, I mean, one I mean, one expects one possibility. I mean, this is Ram's question, Andrew? So, so the first, if you're looking at least prime, say just in an arithmetic progression, then Regression, then that's a very specific set of number fields you care about. And so a better result might be true there. If you look at my result, you can also, so my result is stated entirely in terms of the discriminant. You can view it as also being that the least prime is greater than, say, a constant times nl times log of dl to whatever one minus epsilon or something. Whatever, one minus epsilon or something. And in that formulation, you might imagine possibly improving something. But it's very the set of fields for which my counter example comes from is not the same ones that you'd be using for, say, primes and arithmetic progression. And it's also not clear that it's the type of thing you would typically expect. The type of thing you would typically expect, somehow. So they're basically Hilbert, the set of fields that give you this is the Hilbert class fields of quadratic imaginary fields. And you essentially combine two pieces of information. combine two pieces of information. One, that it's hard to be a principal, it's hard to be a small principal ideal in a quadratic imaginary field. And then that and then class numbers of quadratic imaginary fields grow. Thanks, Sandra. Is it this last reduction? Could you deduce from it that the number what the class C is fixed? The number of primes that are verified that you are counting in K is exactly equal to the number of primes that you would count in the E. That you would count in the E. I mean, this reduction, the final is as if you are doing the Chevroletal theorem in E by F. So you can go back to the counting function and the level of the counting function, you tell that this number of practice exactly equals. Benji had a question. Yes, this oh, the mic wasn't even on. Hello. So can you go up to these slides? Just add teeny tiny things to it. Yeah, so in FAFE, you have a first one-first decomposition, and you already show by the Brower induction theorem, you can write any arting-error function. Write any article function as a quotient of products of HEC error function. And use that, you will know that any Arting error function is non-managed and holomorphic for the real power greater than equal to what? So if you combine this one and the first one, and probably we know Ikehara Taborian theorem, you prove the tripletor density theorem without the error turn. But yeah, so in very everyone should I learn this one from Professor Martin. It's a cool stuff. You don't even need Is a cool stuff you don't even need to go through, but this way is that the best main drawback is that the airtung will be pretty bad because you cannot go so a completely different direction again. Right at the beginning, you said that you can Get some saving on the x power by assuming the Artang conjecture. It's C. The C. The size of the conjugacy class. Oh, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry. The square of the conjugacy class. Do you need the full Arton conjecture for that? Actually, you can. You can mellow down the conjecture. And so you don't need the full, you need to assume it for certain subgroups of G, if I remember correctly. But I don't. I think if I remember correctly, but I don't know if you can answer, but you don't need the full power of art and I was thinking like you could probably just get away with just the data king conjecture because Zeta K over Zeta is entire. So it's a special case, but known for some cases as well. Yeah. There's an exact statement, but you're welcome to borrow it after. Yes, yeah. Okay, cool. Maybe we better stop here and think about
