Okay, so here's the theorem. I filled the entire slide with this theorem. These post-sites also have this property. And that's suspicious. Suspicious when there aren't very many post-sets of this property. It's giving you some nice collection of post-sets. So you might wonder: is this everything? And the answer. Everything, and the answer is it's not everything. You can do some stuff to your postet that destroys a lot of the algebra and preserves this property. So, if I have a postet, I can build this comparability graph. So, this is not like the graph that I talked about in the open problem session, which is just take the Hase diagram and think of it as a graph. This is the better thing to do most of the time, which is actually contain, put an edge in your graph whenever two things are comparable, not just for the cover relations. Not just for the cover relations, but for the things that are implied by transitivity. So I build this graph, and then just think of it as an abstract graph, so I forget which thing is bigger than, which other than, if it's another comparable in one direction or the other. And what you can show is that this NRP property is not really a property of the post-set, it's really a property of the comparability graph. So you can take these minuscule posets that we had and you can replace. That we had, and you can replace them with other things that have the same comparability graph, and these will also have to prepare you. They don't seem to come through anymore. In practice, if you just give me a comparability graph, so we start with a minuscule poset and then we can take it to comparability graph. How easy is it to construct another poset that has the same comparability graph? It seems like that could be hard. Well, so there's a way of, you can, there's a way of sort of working. There's a way of sort of walking from any postet with a given comparability graph to any other postet with the same comparability graph. You do it by certain kinds of flips. So you can. Want to give us an example where it is? Okay, okay. So one sort of boring example is that on this quadratic tiper surface here, I could take the chain, part, some part of the chain off the top and glue it to the bottom. And that clearly wouldn't affect any of the comparabilities. It's just they used to be bigger than everybody, now they're. It's just they used to be bigger than everybody, now they're smaller than everybody. And you can do similar things of uh like grabbing some chunk in the middle and like turning it upside down. Or dualizing the whole post-set, but these postsets are all self-dual. Do absolute order and dual order in this property? Do absolute order. Absolute order and lower order of this property. No. No problem. No. Pretty sure. I mean, maybe we should check again, but I'm pretty sure no. I mean, they almost have this property. I'm not sure. We should check again. I'm not sure. Okay, so here's the thing I learned from Sam, which is this heuristic that is definitely not quite true, but is somehow true very often, is that if you take a property of posets and it holds for the minuscule posets, and it happens to be the kind of thing that actually only depends on the comparability graph, then there's this other class of posets where probably holds or like holds after you model. Holds or like holds after you modify the definition enough to make it work somehow. So these are the positive root posets of coincidental type. So anytime in your life that you have proven something about this class of minuscule posets and you see that it's invariant of the comparability graph, you should go look at this other class of posets as well. Yeah. It's funny, because I learned this heuristic from a paper in Hamaker, Petrius, Pachenik, and Williams. Yeah, but we didn't believe it. Yeah, but we didn't believe it. And then you actually proved one sort of one-off instance of this phenomenon and thought it was just sort of like a weird accident. And then Sam told us that it was like actually a heuristic that you should believe. Okay, so we're going to go looking for these things. And so I guess I should tell you what these are. Okay, so cox letters have types. Coxlitters have types. Hopefully, we know this classification of finite coxlitter groups. And some of these are called coincidental. And which ones are coincidental? Well, it's type A, and it's type B, and it's the dodecahedron group, H3, and it's the dihedrals. And this is just some list. And that's not quite good enough. I want sort of a two-parameter family of type B things, which doesn't quite make sense. Things, which doesn't quite make sense. So I look inside my type B root poset and I pick out a particular element and I look at its inversions. And this gives me some sub-poset. And I want to call that the root postet of B K, N. It has this extra parameter stuck inside of it. And so these are my coincidental root postets. It's the positive root. It's the positive viewpoint set of type A, which is exactly the family dict path postet, right? There's this two-parameter family of type B things. There's one. Oh, great. And then for the other two, the normal definition of the positive root positive is the wrong thing. You can't just order your roots by. You can't just order your roots by one is bigger than the other if they differ by a positive root. This gives you the wrong poset. You don't like these posets. Instead, Drew Armstrong made up some posets out of thin air, and they're the right posets. And you're supposed to use those instead. So you use Drew Armstrong's version of the H3 poset, and Drew Armstrong's version of this dihedral poset. Okay, so these are the posets that I wanted to do. And so here's the So here's a picture of how these posets pretend to be minuscule posets. So all of these two parameter family of type B posets, the BKN posets, each of them is pretending to be this product of two chains. And it is not a posset that has the same comparability graph, but it Comparability graph, but it acts in many ways as if it did have the same comparability graph for unknown reasons. And this poset that Drew Armstrong made up somehow for the dodecahedron group pretends to be this minuscule poset that comes out of this isotropic graph module. And these things, well, I guess in this case, these actually do have the same comparability graph. So that's not so surprising. And so that's not so surprising because these should be the same. These things that come out of quadratic paper surfaces and these things that Drew Armstrong wrote down for the light to hang for the dihedral groups. Oh yeah, and so I'm continuing this tradition of stealing figures out of papers. But at least my name is on this paper, even if I didn't make the figure. Okay, so I had this conjecture with a former undergraduate who was working with me, Miles Simmons, which is that all these coincidental reposits, they really are active. They really are acting like the corresponding minuscule posets, and so they all have this NRP property as well. Except that in type A, type A doesn't have a doppelganger on the minuscule side, and it needs this extra factor of two. And if you've thought about this type A root post side a lot, you're probably not very surprised about this extra two. This two just likes to show up. And so this seems to be true. And we couldn't prove it. And we couldn't prove it. And so the paper never got written because we couldn't prove anything very satisfying. But this conjecture seems correct. Okay. So now we have two different families of posets with this property. We have all the minuscule things having this property, and we also have, conjecturally, all these coincidental type root posets. Yeah? Can you say what you mean by extra factor of? Can you say what you mean by extra factor of two? The orbits have an extra two. Okay. Yeah. And when you say it seems to be true, it means you've run numerical experiments and they're true up to as far as you can go. Yeah. And like what's the largest seat that you could have? Is that what you're doing? So somehow from the asymptotic, you don't have to go very high. Asymptotic, you don't have to go very high. It's always true if C is large enough. Yeah, so you can actually prove for any particular post-ite, you can prove this by a calculation. Yeah. Okay, so one thing that I think would be awesome is if we could actually prove this conjecture. And I was talking to Jessica the other day, and Jessica, I think, has good ideas for how to do the type A version at least. Well, great. Yeah, I think maybe that's quite doable. And these you just, I mean, this one's not, this can't possibly confuse anyone. This one you compute. And this is where you have to really prove something higher. This is where we got very stuck. We can know how to prove that. Okay, so this would be a very nice classification of postets with this property, if this was a complete list, and it If this was a complete list and it was not the complete list, I know exactly one more post-on. Or rather, that's not quite true because it's only about the coverability graph. So, anything that has the same coverability of graph as this. So you can take part of the chain on the top and include it on the bottom. That's also good. But essentially, it's one extra example. This is the only other example that I know. But it kind of looks reasonable as far as the post-site goes. So, one question is: has anyone seen this post-set? Does anyone Seen this post set. Does anyone know associated algebra to this post set? Is it a thing we're supposed to also like? Exactly that one, not a longer chain on the top. No, no, you can put part of the chain on the bottom, because that doesn't affect the comparability graph. Yeah, no, but you can't take a dot away or add one. You can't add another dot and then it can't be changed. I don't think so. That's very specific. I think you can probably add a dot in the inf chain and then make the chain on top the appropriate size or something. So maybe no, but I think there may be examples of that form. I see. Okay, so this is not a complete list, but maybe there's. Well, I don't know if it's a complete list. If you move the dot the bottom to the top, you get some colour of the room. It's a special case. Special case outer class. Okay, so it may be some class of like brooms of a very particular size. Maybe these mean something. Okay, so legally we don't have the exact classification, and it would be good to figure out what exactly the classification is, because if you know what the actual process, what those property are, then you can understand where they show up in life, and then you can start figuring out what algebra you should be doing. What algebra we should be doing to understand what's behind all of this. So, I would like to go looking more aggressively for other things that have this NRP property that didn't come off of our previous lists. Who's this post? Are there more of them? What else do they look like? Okay. So I actually have some secret slides, but I don't think I wanna get into them. I don't think I want to get into them. How are we doing? I think we started a little frame. Okay. I have secret slides about the proof, which you don't need to understand. Yeah. You know, for the recording, you can just start beginning again. Yeah. That's true. But you're going to send the round the slides anyway, right? What's that? You're going to send around the slides. Yeah, I was going to send it on the slides, so that's why the secret files are really there. Let's see them, Paul. Yeah, I'll go through them quickly, I guess. Yeah, I'll go through quickly, I guess. I mean, you've been talking about posets that have this property. Do you have any characteristics of posets that fail? It's basically all of them. It's basically all of them. I mean, like, do you know, like, if a poset has this property, it definitely fails? Oh. Oh, yeah. You have large chunks of the complex. Oh, no, I don't have any theorems of that form. Yeah, but morally, it seems to be basically everything fails. Yeah. Early in your talk, you were talking about this property that almost all the ordinates have a certain size, and then that didn't come back. Does it appear to be true for these post-sets? It does it appear to be true for just graded ordinance, almost all the ordinates have the same size. I think it's going to be true for all the graded post-sets. No, I don't know if that's true. I it's It's true for all the minuscules. I can prove that. It's true for all the coincidental type group post sites. I think I can prove that as well. I don't know if it's true more generally. And maybe that should be part of the definition. Maybe this NRP definition is not quite the right thing. I'm not sure. I haven't thought very much about this asymptotics. Very much about this thousand products. Yeah. When it fails, does it freeze? Oh, yeah, it fails immediately and horrifically. So if I don't do this, I can go to the future. You test it very easily. It's like, you know, instead of finding an orbit of size, you know, 24, you get an orbit of size 17. And like, just very bad, very quickly. Yeah. Do you have an example of a positive that does have this property? That doesn't that does have this property without a C, but doesn't with a C? Uh not off the top of my head, but it's just sort of like a Boolean B4, like a times two times two times two. Okay. I mean it should it should be okay to start and then start again. That might be true. But there's a lot of things that sort of have this property, but it looks like an accident. It looks like an accident. Okay. It's just because. But most of the time. There's a lot of small number. Motivated. Your other example is also an accident. Yeah, maybe. And it doesn't have the algebra that the others have. Yeah, maybe. Right, so maybe that goes back to David's question that maybe the definition is not quite right. Maybe you want to impose some sort of extra structure on it so that that one goes away and looks like this actually is the classification. That would be nice. Not really sure. And I guess this would come out if we can find more. And I guess this would come out if we can find more examples and start classifying them, we would see whether they look like accidents or whether they're. Why are they all planar? Yeah, I had no idea. Like, like the condition doesn't have anything about planarity baked into it, but they're just showing up to people in there. Yeah. Um, so I don't remember exactly, but I think that a lot of maybe all of these other, like, the doppelgangers on the Taipei Room postet. The type A recall set. Um A can also be viewed in your your Gmod V setting, like for P not minuscule, like maybe P cominuscule or something. Have you thought about that? No, no, that's not. So the co-minuscule version just gives you the same stuff on the left. The stuff on the right, you can think of them, they're root postets. So you can think of like sugary calculus kinds of things on them, but it's not order ideals that you should be looking at anymore. Deals that you should be looking at anymore. You get more complicated subsets. Because the inversion, so the inversion of a file group element that corresponds to something over here always gives you an order ideal. But the inversion set on this root postet side gives you some sort of more complicated subset. And I'm not sure how to relate that to anything. Okay, I'll need to double-check, but I. I don't need to double-check, but I think that in the paper, like the paper of Stanley on hard left shots and file groups on and so on, when he's studying the order ideals of the type A group poset, it's in the context of something along the lines of G mod D. So I feel like there's something there. Okay, I need to look at that again, too. Yeah. Have you tried to produce the right-hand side from the left-hand side without knowing that? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, you can sort of imagine, like, if Drew hadn't invented this thing, you should be able to, like, find it from the story. I want to have a uniform way of getting the right insight. For example, there's no roots on the non-stop scripture. I mean, you know, the same as number of roots, but you don't know which root is which. That's right. Yeah, I have no idea what's going on there. It's not true that, like, the orbit structure of emotion over here and the orbit structure of a motion over here are. Over here, and the orbits of performance over here are the same. That is not true. They just have some of the same qualitative properties. There's a question in the chat and the queue. Maybe you want to go ahead. Thanks. When you have a graph whose comparability graph is the same as a minuscule posit, I mean, Skioposit. Does it have the same number of order ideals? Yes. Yeah, it's the same order polytope, right? Well, no. Well, no, that's not. Same Erhard function. Because order ideals are bijection of anti-terrors. That's. You have the same chain polytope, which maybe the So the reason I'm asking, or well anyway, it might be interesting to, or it might be rather to look at a paper by Fénédique Chapelbron, which is very much where he has some sort of story that he wants to tell involving millennial fibrillations. And so maybe that's maybe that's relevant. Maybe that's relevant. Anyway, it's a paper of him like, by the way, a couple of years ago. That might, but I think his setting is, I think he is happy to consider more cosets than the ones that you have found so far. So it could be that this is totally relevant. But anyway, it is a kind of algebraic categorical setting where there is interesting stuff going on that includes. That includes at least conjecturally this noseial set. Yeah, okay, thanks, Hugh. We should take a look at that. I think there was another hand raised in person. Yeah, Thomas. Yeah. So these MIS2 cosets, right, we should think of these as plate spaces, right? Some representation. Yeah, yeah, I don't know that story as well. And that connects at all this, like, yeah, I don't know. Right, so there's a representation. Right, so there's a rep theory way of thinking about where these menuscope postsets come from, and maybe that's a better thing to do. Maybe that's why I don't stop coming up on this for you so long. A lot of people here probably are better at that rep theory than I am. Wouldn't take much. Yeah, so these posits arise algebraically in multiple ways, and I'm not sure what the correct context for them is. Okay. Shall we stop? Should we wrap up? I think we thanked Albert for talking. Well, I never exactly stopped. And I think if there are more questions, we should be breaking up. Next talk starts at 10:30.
