Okay, great. Cool. So I'm going to try to keep the chat window up so I can see questions. But feel free to come off mute if you have any questions along the way. And also, I want to give my apologies that I am not there in person and also that I haven't been able to join online during this week. So I knew it was going to be a difficult semester with two classes going back in person. Classes going back in person and quite a bit of service. But also, my horse broke his leg this week and he has surgery today. So I will have to go after my talk and go to Phoenix. So it has been a crazy month. I would have loved to be with you all. So hopefully next time I can be. And since I'll have to run at the end of my talk, feel free to email me if you have any questions about anything. Any questions about anything that I talk about today? So I'm going to talk about a few different problems that I've looked at using computational fluid dynamics to understand muscle-driven movement. And in particular, jellyfish swimming and embryonic and tubular heart pumping. And the general outline, I will talk a little bit about fluid. Will talk a little bit about fluid structure interactions and the immersed boundary method. I think I heard some overheard someone mentioning in MathBio sort of the methods component and the question component. So I will give an overview of the methods, but not too much. Again, I'm happy to answer questions, send papers, and so forth. And then talk more about the application problems and tubular heart pumping, jellyfish swimming, and if I have time. Swimming, and if I have time, the role of trabeculae and the developing heart. And I also want to mention that in my group, we mix experiments and numerical simulation. And so I will try to remember to tell you what is an experiment and what is a simulation. But the better we get at both experiments and simulations when you see the results. Simulations, when you see the results in the velocity fields, it's actually hard to tell which is which. So, we for a while now have been looking at saltwater marine invertebrates, both in terms of heart development. So looking at sea squirts, which are chordates and have hearts that are reminiscent of the vertebra and poranic heart, and then also looking at jellyfish swimming. Jellyfish swimming, and we started to do some field work at the Key Largo Marine Lab and elsewhere. And we have a variety of flow tanks that we use as well. This large flow tank maybe is a casualty of the pandemic, so I was not able to move it from North Carolina to Arizona when I moved out here in summer of 2020. But I hope to one day bring. I hope to one day bring it to Arizona, but we'll see. But we also have small-scale flow tanks, about, I think, six flow tanks in a little wind tunnel right now. Now, to motivate sort of all the problems in this talk, I want to introduce the Reynolds number, which many of you may have heard of from your colleagues in fluid dynamics, or if you work in fluids. In fluids. And essentially, if you take the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fluid motion and you non-dimensionalize them, you end up with a dimensionless number called the Reynolds number. And it gives you the ratio of inertia to viscous forces in a fluid. And it's right here. So œÅ is the density of the fluid. So air or water typically or blood. Or blood. L is a characteristic length scale that you will pick depending on your problem. So for jellyfish, it might be the bell diameter. For hearts, it might be the heart diameter. U is a characteristic velocity. So that could be the swimming speed or the average pumping speed of a heart. And then mu is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid being air, water, or blood. And so there are some really Um, and so there are some really interesting things that you can say using this number, particularly in biological fluid dynamics. And traditionally, people have divided the world into high and low Reynolds numbers, so especially with external flows. And if you are at the micro scale, so if you're looking at unicellular organisms, bacteria, sperm, paramecium. Sperm, paramecium, base swim, and viscous dominated flows. So these are low rentals number less than one. And we are in the high rentals number inertia-dominated world. So birds, whales, even larger insects are all inertia-dominated. And interesting things happen in the middle. So you end up with organisms with these bristly appendages like tiny. Appendages like tiny insects and cobopods, other plankton that move in pretty interesting ways. And this would be around a Reynolds number of 1, 10, where you have this balance between inertia and viscosity. We can also divide internal flows into these two worlds. So at the low Reynolds number viscous dominated scale, we have capillaries, embryonic heart. Embryonic heart. So, when the heart first forms about three weeks post-fertilization, it is a tube about the size or diameter of a hair, so very small. And the flow within it, again, is viscous dominated. At the high end, you've got the human heart, which is about the size of your fist, trachea, larger arteries, and there are interesting internal flows at the Internal flows at this intermediate Reynolds number, like in the frog heart, the bronchi, and different stages of heart development. So the heart has to grow from a viscous dominated tubular pump to a inertia dominated valve and chamber pump, and it has to work through all these intermediate stages as well. So the embryonic heart is an extremely interesting fluid. Interesting fluid dynamic problem. And this is just another demo to give you some intuition for this. So, this is a little swimmer with a flapping tail in glycerin. So, low Reynolds number viscous dominated flows are irreversible. So, if you move with a reciprocal motion, you can't really get anywhere. I believe that there was a study at Caltech. That there was a study at Caltech where they had people swim in corn syrup to lower the Reynolds number, and you can actually still swim. So, we use reciprocal motion, so just clapping our arms and legs. But if you try to swim in molasses, you really can't. So, you can, you know, kick your feet and flap your arms, and you won't really get anywhere. And that's what's happening here. And this is a reason. And this is a reason why you don't see bacteria swimming like fish with this undulatory motion for things swimming with flapping legs or flapping wings. So instead, you have different mechanisms like cilia, more rotational motions, flagella, and so forth. And of course, at the high Reynolds number, this works. If you're right in between these two rentals or high and low regime around a rentals number of one, Reynolds number one. There are lots of interesting things that happen in terms of locomotion and pumping. Okay, so how do we look at these problems? So I have focused most of my career on Reynolds numbers around one. And if you're at a high Reynolds number, you can make a lot of nice simplifications. You can treat the flow as an ideal fluid and simplify Navier-Stokes to get Euler equation. Stokes to get Euler equation. If you're at the very low Riddles number, you can again simplify and get the Stokes equations that are linear, and there are a lot of nice methods. But if you're at 1 to 10 to 100, you're dealing with the full Navier-Stokes equations, and it is computationally difficult. Beyond that, in biology, we're typically looking at very flexible, very deformable things. Very deformable things with complex geometries. So it's also oftentimes a fully coupled fluid structure interaction problem. And there are many different ways to deal with such problems at this point. I am going to use the first boundary method originally from Peskin from the 70s. And there's some reasons to use this method and reasons to do. Use this method and reasons to do use others, and so I'll motivate why I'm using this one. But the challenge here is: well, okay, we're solving the Navier-Stokes equations again in non-linear PDE and 2D or 3D. And so there are lots of mathematical methods where those equations are put in Eulerian form and discretized on a Cartesian crime. Then you have this moving flexible boundary. Have this moving flexible boundary, and this gets treated using Lagrangian equations. So you're moving with the boundary, and those equations are discretized on a curvilinear mesh. For the fluid, you're solving for U, which is the velocity in space and time, P, which is the pressure in space and time, and F, which is body force due to the boundary in space and time. For your elasticity equations, you're solving for the position. For the position in Cartesian coordinates along the curvilinear mesh at different times, and also the force that is acting on that boundary as well. And you assume that there is an equal and opposite force that the fluid applies to the boundary and the boundary applies to the fluid. Okay, so these meshes do not line up. There are some meshes where you do. Where you do things align, but there are issues with that too, like remeshing and so forth, or challenges dealing with complex geometries. But in the MERS boundary world, what we do is to use your favorite Navier-Stokes equation solvers. So here are the Navier-Stokes equations written out. And then we use integral transforms with delta function kernels. Delta function kernels to go back and forth between the curvilinear mesh and the Cartesian thread. And so we want to move our boundary at the local fluid velocity. And then we want to take whatever force is acting on the boundary due to the fluid and apply it back from the boundary to the fluid. So I'll sort of step through this at a high level. So at each time step, again, we're solving the equations of motion for velocity pressure. And in the MERS boundary framework, well, we have, we've described or used some sort of elasticity or models of muscle mechanics for our boundary. But for a given body force density at each time step, we can solve an outier stoic. Each time step, we can solve an Audier-Stokes equations. Then we move the boundary at the local fluid velocity. And then we look at the deformation of the boundary and solve our elasticity equations again to get, okay, what force is acting on that boundary and then apply that force back to the fluid. So the forces spread, so to speak, from the boundary to the Eulerian grid, and then we repeat. So one challenge here. So, one challenge here if you're doing 3D is that you might need a 512 cubed spatial grid and like 10 of the fifth to 10 of the sixth time steps. So now you're doing this on a high performance computer, and it takes days for each simulation to run. So that is another challenge. Walking through a little bit more, there are some errors that get introduced. So here So here's where we're spreading the elastic force density from the mesh onto the Cartesian grid. So let's say that here are three points along the boundary. We have their positions and the boundary wants to be straight. So maybe we have some beam equation describing this and a force gets applied to the fluid in this direction, again, trying to push the fluid to straighten itself out. Just trading itself out. In the numerical method, we use these regularized delta functions to do this, and this has the effect of smearing the force to nearby Cartesian grid points. And so the boundary becomes effectively thicker. And so you often have to use pretty fine grids, especially near the boundary. For the fluid, you do the same. For the fluid, you do the same thing. So, this is a boring cofield. We've got our boundary in it, and we want to move it at the local fluid velocity. So, we also use this regularized delo function to, in a sense, take a weighted average of the nearby flow velocity and then move it at that velocity. So, that's the immersed boundary method in a nutshell. You know, again, some of the issues. You know, again, some of the issues are smearing, effectively smearing the boundary, the number of time steps you have to take, the accuracy, and so forth. The benefit of it is that a lot of people have worked on these methods for a long time. And so there are libraries that are available and lots of different approaches for different types of boundaries. So people have worked out how to make your boundary like a series of springs. Like a series of springs or beams that resist bending, how to add mass to the boundary, how to make the boundaries porous, how to integrate muscle fibers so that your boundary can contract like a muscle, and how to move with a preferred motion. Also, if you're interested in trying out this method, my former grad student, Nick Batista, who's now at the College of New Jersey. College of New Jersey has a relatively easy to use MATLAB and Python version of the MerseBoundary method in 2D that incorporates a lot of these different models. And it's on GitHub. And he has tutorials, lots of examples, and various papers with new features that have been added. So later on in the talk, when I move to 3D, I'll talk about IBA. To 3D, I'll talk about IBAMR, which was developed by Voice Griffith, and that is adaptive, parallelized, really fast, more difficult to use, but you can do 3D simulations. Okay, so I'm going to pivot and talk about my first application problem, keeping a little track of time. So heart development. Heart development. Like I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of interesting things that happen fluid dynamically and morphologically during heart development. And it's been known for a while that blood flow and the pressure and sheer stresses that it generates are essential for the proper cardiac morphogenesis. So lots of things can go wrong during heart development. It's thought that the majority It's thought that the majority of prenatal losses are due to congenital heart defects. And also, what is this relationship between flow and the heart morphology and even the conduction properties of the heart? So what I'm going to show you on the left is a video of a zebrafish heart. Zebrafish hearts are two chambered. So this is the atrium here, which when it moves. Which, when it moves, you'll be able to see it a bit better. This is the ventricle. And when I play it, the atrium contracts, fills the ventricle, ventricle contracts, and pushes the blood through the body. You might notice some backflow. So I believe at this stage, the valve in between the atrium and the ventricle is not fully developed. So you have a little bit of backflow. But basically, this is what that part should. Is what that heart should look like at 4.5 days post-fertilization. And if a zebrafish heart does not be, the embryo can actually survive for quite some time without a heart just using diffusion, but eventually it does die. Now, let's say that earlier in development, I believe it's going to be around 18 hours post-fertilization. Fertilization, you insert beads either in the inflow tract or the outflow track so that you change and greatly reduce the amount of flow that is going through the heart tube. So, what happens is what you get in the picture on the right. So, the heart chambers have never really developed, the valves have not developed, and the conduction properties are quite different. Induction properties are quite different, too. And so people have looked at this and chick embryos and zebrafish, mostly, I would say, but and they started to find genetic specific molecular regulatory networks that genes that are upregulated from shear and pressure that are involved in morphogenesis. Okay. Okay, and like I mentioned before, in humans, this happens three to four weeks post-fertilization when the heart tube forms. There are regions that become the atrium and the ventricle. There's an interesting process of cardiac looping that happens when the chambers start to expand and the valves start to form. And eventually, after many complex stages, you end up with the adult heart, which is four chambers and four valves. So, a while ago, you know, my grand plan was to look at all the stages, and well, that hasn't happened. I'm still, I've been stuck on the heart tube stage for a long time. And I moved on to some chamber development. But the heart tube is actually a complicated problem. So, this on the left is a zebrafish at the tubular heart stage, and you can see how it's pumping. And you can see how it's pumping. You might be able to see the heart walls and the little spheres or blood cells. And so for a while, a lot of the work was on zebrafish. And my group was looking at sea squirts, which I mentioned were chordates that have a similar heart tube. So this is the embryonic sea squirt heart. And you can see some differences. So this heart tube. Some differences. So, this heart tube is much thinner. It's actually only one cell layer thick. The zebrafish at this point is two cell layers with cardiac jelly between those layers. And just the pumping and contraction mechanisms are different too, which initially we didn't quite appreciate. So, how is it pumping? Now, again, going back about 20 years at this point. About 20 years at this point. For a long time, it had been assumed that the pumping mechanism was peristalsis. So, again, peristalsis, you have a region of contraction that moves down the tube and pushes blood flow along. Here is a nice little 2D simulation where the bottom part of the tube has a peristalic contraction wave, and you can see these blood cells that are being pushed along. Along. So there are some common assumptions that are made about Paris pulses. So typically, when it's modeled, you have prescribed traveling waves of contraction. So you enforce a contraction wave. It doesn't emerge from muscle mechanics or anything. There's a linear relationship between frequency and flow. There is an assumption there that the waveform is the same as you change frequency. The contraction wave is unidirectional, and for smaller contraction amplitudes, the flow speed does not exceed the wave speed. Though, this is not true if you have a large contraction. So, 20 years ago, looking at that zebrafish cart, a group at Caltech proposed that the mechanism was not peristalsis, it's actually something called dynamic suction pumping. And this incorporates And this incorporates more of the emergent properties between the fluid and the elastic properties of the heart tube. And the idea is that if you look up here, these black regions are rigid and the red is flexible. So you have a relatively rigid inflow and outflow tract. There is a localized region of contraction. So where these flat plates are. Black plates are they will pump up and down and they would be centered around the pacemaker region. And then in the red region, all the wave behavior is passive and it emerges from the elastic properties of the tube. So peristalsis, typically you would assume an active wave of contraction along the whole length. This is sort of coupled between prescribed motion and the And the dynamics emerging from the elastic properties. So, when this happens, you have a contraction. There's a bi-directional elastic wave that emanates from both sides of the contraction area. And when it hits the relatively rigid regions, it reflects. And then, so the reflected wave. So, the reflected wave on the left travels to the right and sort of combines with the elastic wave on the right to potentially generate really fast flow. So, this is also a very tricky mechanism that is dependent on the parameter choices, but you can get bi-directional waves, non-linear frequency flow relationships, where for some frequencies for a given Some frequencies for a given elastic property and region of contraction, it's very fast, and flow velocities that are much higher than the weight speed. And various groups have looked at this both experimentally and computationally. This is the zebrafish heart. So, let me pause it for a second and direct you. So, here is the inflow track, and as proposed out here, it's relatively rigid. This is the region. This is the region of contraction that's active. This is the outflow track. And so, if you watch the arrows, you'll see the contraction and they'll guide you through what they're observing as this bi-directional wave. So, contraction, bi-directional wave, a reflection, and then sort of a suction that's created, and then a reflection again. And then a reflection again. So there have been physical, simplified physical models. This is elastic region of the heart tube. This is a rigid plast region. So you will see this racetrack loop a lot in these simulations and models. This is modeling the actual heart, and the rest of the racetrack is sort of the circulatory system. But if you watch these bubbles, But if you watch these bubbles, you can see just how fast it goes. I believe that this is an electric toothbrush with the brush removed. So it's vibrating at a high frequency. And here's a simulation from Sue Clim at Cincinnati. So there are some issues, though, that come up. The Reynolds number for the models and the numerical simulations, if you base the Reynolds number, If you base the Reynolds number on the contraction speed, they are quite high, whereas the Reynolds number of the zebrafish is quite low. So much less than one versus much greater than one. And so my group originally became interested in whether or not we could get this mechanism to work at low Reynolds numbers where the flows are reversible. And so first we went. And so, first, we went through the literature, and these it's these earlier stages: zebrafish 26 hours, chicken at hamburger hamlet, stage 15, hamburger hamlet, something like that anyway. And a mouse 8.5 days. So, I think that H15 is a little bit past over two, but in general, the rentals numbers are below. The Reynolds numbers are below one or right at one. And you might also see the Wilmersley number reported. And the Wilmersley number, if written a certain way, scales like the square root of Reynolds number. So they're related dimensionless numbers. And Wilmers Lee omegas the pumping frequency. And then we have density and viscosity. So again, if you define. So, again, if you define the Reynolds number looking at the velocity of contraction, then Wilmersley is going to scale like the square root of the Reynolds number. So low Wilmersley corresponds to low Reynolds number and high to high. So in both cases, we are below one. And so we set up our racetrack simulations just like the ones you saw before. And looks at well, what happens to the flow speed as we vary Wilmersley number? And on the left, this is a numerical simulation set up just like the one I showed you before. We've got the average velocity versus Wilmersley. And we varied the amplitude of contraction. You can also vary the elastic modulus and the liquid. Elastic modulus and the location of the contraction point. Again, there are many parameters, and these simulations are sensitive to all of them. But what we found was that if we're at one worse lead of one and below, so here's a zero point, the velocity is quite low. And then it really picks up once you get to 10 and above. You also might notice that sometimes the flow is in the opposite direction. Opposite direction. The strongest flow is in the highest, and the directionality of the embryonic heart is in this region. So it's actually the negative flows that would be relevant. So it's hard to get strong flow. We've looked at a bunch of different elastic modulus, length of the tube, location of contraction. We also added blood cells. Again, so this is now. Again, so this is now average velocity on a log scale, but similarly, it's quite low until you get up to these higher Woemers Lee numbers. And if you look at experiments where you use, let's say, corn syrup to get down to low Romers Lee numbers, you can contract the tube and release. And it's like you push the flow out. And then when it re-expands, it just sucks it all back to where you started. So you can. you started so you can really see the um your well the irreversibility of the or reversibility of the flow um but there are quite a few people uh especially in engineering who uh really love the dynamic suction pumping mechanism and in math too so it's this beautiful mechanism that really incorporates a lot of the elastic properties and Plastic properties and resonance of the tube, which is interesting. So we wanted to explore this a bit more and think: all right, let's really model this and think about what's happening. And so we chose, again, the sea squirt, cord ape, versus the zebrafish that had been studied before. And honestly, the reason for doing this is as mathematicians. Is as mathematicians, it's difficult to study vertebrates to just have the infrastructure to do it because there's a lot of regulations. So sea squirts aren't the easiest thing to take care of, but it's easier than working with animal care at the med school and dealing with fish. So, with that being said, the heart tube is actually in a lot of cases. In a lot of cases, sort of contained in this U-shaped capsule. Here again is a different picture. This is an adult sea squirt. And the heart actually reverses direction. So if you watch this for a while, the flow and the contraction wave will go in this direction. And then it reverses and goes the other way, which all sea squirts and sidions do this. And asidians do this, so now it's going the other way. And we really wanted to focus on a particular species instead of doing a general model, just because this mechanism is so sensitive to parameters. We had to be very careful with the choices that we were making. And we also wanted to come up with some framework that could capture both peristalsis and dynamic suction pumping. Pumping. And so we came up with this what we called an electromechanical pumping mechanism. So again, we have our tube section with rigid inflow and outflow, and the dotted line shows where it's flexible. Since we're still in 2D, we have these springs that behave like muscles, so they can contract and contract the tube section. Tube suction. And so we can, well, not prescribe some of the motion, but generate contractions using muscle mechanics, activating them with some electrophysiology model, and then also incorporate the full coupling between the fluid and the elastic properties. And if we don't allow the active contraction to propagate from the pacemaker, it's like dynamic. Peacemaker, it's like dynamic suction pumping. If it does propagate, it's like peristalsis. And so we can go between these two mechanisms. So there's not a whole lot known about the electrophysiology of the acidian heart. So we just use Fitzy-Nagumo equations to describe how action potentials travel down the heart tube. It's one of the simpler models. It's one of the simpler models one could use. D is the electro potential. W is a blocking or recovery mechanism. And I is a current that you would inject that could act like a casemaker. And so this becomes a PDE because we allow the electro potential to diffuse down the tube. So we have this term D. So we have this term d, and if you change the diffusive coefficient, this impacts the propagation of the electron potential. So for low values of D, we have action potential in this section of the heart. So this is space and this is the electro potential. And so here we would only be activating the muscle near that pacemaker region. So kind of like the classical. So, kind of like the classical dynamic suction pumping mechanism. If we increase D, then we have action potentials that propagate down the length of the tube, and we can manipulate D and sort of change the waveform. So, then we also used a muscle model to describe the springs and their activity. Springs and their activity that connected the top and the bottom of the tube. And we incorporated some fundamental features of muscle, again, in a relatively simple model. So it's known that there's a relation nonlinear relationship between the force the muscle generates and the velocity of shortening. And so the maximum force generated is when the shortening velocity is zero. Is zero. And then at some point, the faster you shorten your muscle, the force goes to zero. There's also a nonlinear relationship between length and tension, which can be related to the act and myosin dynamics. I won't go into those details, but it has this sort of shape, which we can capture with this equation. Equation. And so, if you want to describe the force a muscle can generate in terms of its length and velocity, you can use AF as the amount of activation from zero to one times the maximum force that can be generated at the optimal length and zero velocity times this normalized force velocity. Force velocity curve times a normalized force length. Flip that around. Okay. And then you can include some of the calcium dynamics as well so that there's a proper delay between activation and generation, of course. I think I'm not going to go into the details of that for time, but that's the muscle model that we used. So if you put all So, if you put all this together, this is just a simple HERT tube that has all of these components. And we are able to get a net flow for low Wilmersley numbers. And if we increase the Wilmersley number, we get different dynamics, but it's robust across Wilmersley numbers, which is nice. And so we wanted to test this model to see if it could critical. Test this model to see if it could predict some of the things that happen with an embryonic heart. So here we have, again, our Ossidian heart, which you'll see here. And I have a little movie to play. Okay. So, normal heart function within the pericardium. So, here's the outline. So here's the outline of the pericardium, and you can see this very thin tube that is pumping and boluses of dye that travel down or boluses of blood that travel down the tube. Now, it turns out, so these experiments were from Lindsay Waldrup, who was a postdoc in my lab, that if you damage the pericardium, Pericardium, just by cutting a hole in it, that the heart no longer pumps. And so, this is a heart tube with the damaged pericardium. So it just sort of balloons out, fills the whole pericardium, and is unable to move blood. She had some nice experiments where on top you see the undamaged pericardium. She injected a blob of dye. Injected a blob of dye, it moves up and around the heart. And in the gamish case, it moves along and then during the expansion, it gets pulled back. So you can really see the reversibility of the flow here in this case. So it moves up and back, and the net flow through the part tube is almost zero. So we did. So, we did a very simple morphologically 2D simulation of this. We have, again, our racetrack model with the heart tube on the bottom. And without a pericardium and with a pericardium, our pericardium is just a rigid box that doesn't move, but it contains the heart tube. And what we found was. What we found was that the rigid pericardium sort of contains the heart tube and doesn't allow these ballooning aneurysms to form. And so here you can sort of see the development of that aneurysm. If we had the full movie, it doesn't really get anywhere. That aneurysm kind of moves back and forth. The thing to look at here is the P. Here is the peak flow speed versus, so she categorized damage based on this PM diameter ratio. So the higher diameter, so this is the diameter of the hearts and the pericardium. This range, 2.5 to 3, corresponds to an undamaged heart. And once you get down to around 1.5, it's quite damaged. So she damaged the actual. So she damaged the actual heart and the simulated heart. The simulated heart was damaged by just cutting bigger and bigger holes out of this rigid pericardium and the numerical model. And the simulation results are the triangles and the circles are the experiments. And black is undamaged, gray is damaged. And you can see that we do. You can see that we do a pretty good job, even with this really simple model of capturing what's happening in the undamaged case and then how the peak flow decreases in the damaged case. Now, let's see. There we go. So, we're moving forward with this project and moving into 3D. Um, and so one of the nice things about working with these sea squirts is that they have been proposed as a model organism for studying heart development. And our goal is to create a model that couples the fluid dynamics, the elastic boundary activation of the muscle, and the generation of force. And there's a big difference from just prescribing the motion of the contraction in the heart. Contraction in the heart, and then trying to generate it yourself. And this can really reveal sort of how the muscle, you know, what properties of the muscle matters, how it's being activated, how it's generating that force and the things that can go wrong. So you're missing a lot by just, you know, enforcing some motion in terms of understanding more of the biology and the importance of the muscle mechanics. Muscle mechanics and electrophysiology. So some snapshots going forward. Lindsay is now at Chapman University and she's gotten better at videography. So here is a really nice video of the C-sport heart. And one thing that you can really see, particularly at this point, coming At this point, coming up is just this twisting motion during the contraction. So it ends up that the muscle fibers are helically bound. She's also been able to start some micro-PID to look at the fluid dynamics within the heart tube. And we've started immersed boundary simulations. And so one of the nice things about Nice things about doing immorse boundary simulations and incorporating the muscle mechanics is that you learn a lot by things that don't work very well. So here we're just having the muscles sort of in these circular rings that contract and it doesn't work super well. We think we really need to incorporate the helically round muscle. So that's where we're going with this. And I spent I spent quite a bit of time talking about heart tubes, which is fine. And I don't want to go over, so I'll just make a quick analogy to jellyfish and wrap things up. So surprisingly, maybe there are lots of mathematicians and engineers that work on hearts and jellyfish. You might think they're very different, but we have this very elastic, nice either tube or hemielastic. Either a tube or a hemiolepse that has muscles and contract. Both jellyfish and hearts have case makers. Re-entry phenomenon are seen in human hearts and in jellyfish. And while it's easier to work with jellyfish than hearts for a lot of reasons, you can do a lot more fluid dynamics as well. So we're applying the things that we've learned with hearts to jellyfish and asking questions. To jellyfish and asking questions about how the muscle models and the force-length relationship and the muscle stiffness affect swimming behavior and performance, how the animals turn and so forth. And I think I'm going to skip. Well, okay, I'll stop here for a second and say we're going to 3D. You really need to worry about. You really need to worry about well-parallelized code and also adaptive mesh refinement. So, I've been working with Boyce Griffith at UNC for a long time. This is our 3D jellyfish in IB AMR. And the nice thing about it is that you can see how the grid is locally refined near the jellyfish. Again, to sort of overcome that issue of the forces being smeared around the The horses being smeared around the boundary by having low like grids that are refined near the jellyfish and coarser away from the jellyfish. And his code is also available on GitHub. We have developed a number of jellyfish swimming models where if you look on the right, the colors are showing you where we have activated muscles. So the jellyfish muscles are near the bottom of the bell here. Near the bottom of the bell here. So, all we're doing is turning on active tension to represent the muscles, and then the whole motion, the contraction of the bell, the buckling that you see all emerges from the fluid structure interaction. So, nothing is prescribed. On the left, you see the forward swimming jellyfish, and the colors are vorticy. The colors are vorticity contours, so just showing you where you have rotational regions of the foam. And we've been able to compare this to the actual swimming velocities of real jellyfish and their contraction dynamics as well. And we can do turning. So, this is a moon jellyfish making a turn. And again, the first time we did this, it didn't work so well. We had a wave of active tension, which is what happens in the actual jellyfish. But this guy does not turn as tight or as beautifully as the real jellyfish that you just saw. So, when we examined it a little bit more, you could imagine: okay, the purple is showing you. Purple is showing you where the active tension is being applied. So you could have a slow traveling wave of active tension, a very fast traveling wave like to the right here, or something in the middle that is just right. And so it ends up that if you tune the activation wave speed to the elastic wave speed of the jellyfish bill. Of the jellyfish bill, you get the tidus turn. And this was work from Alex Huber that we published last year. And if you put it all together, you get a nice jellyfish that swims better than our initial attempts. We could still improve it a bit more. And we're collaborating with John DeBerry and others. DeBerry and others. Oops, well, that video is unavailable, but this is a moon jellyfish. It has had electrodes inserted near its paste vapor regions, and you can activate the jellyfish and make it turn. And it took quite a bit of work for them to figure out how to insert electrodes into a jellyfish, but they were able to do that. And so, again, you know, it is nice, and you can learn quite a bit of things by just prescribing the motion of the jellyfish, making it contract like the real thing. But there's also a lot of other questions that you can answer by not doing that, by letting the motion emerge, by having these coupled models between the elastic property of your jellyfish or your parts. Jellyfish or your parts, and then tribing the motion using electrophysiology models coupled to muscle mechanic models. And you can see like what does it take to generate this motion? And there's quite a lot of interesting questions just coupling aspects of the electrophysiology to the mechanical properties of the bell and tuning them so that. them so that your jellyfishes and your heart is activated at their resonant frequency, for example, or by matching the wave speed of the activation to the elastic wave speed. Okay, so I'm not going to talk about trabeculae, but that's a cool problem. So, I'll just stop here and say that a lot of the things that I touched on were from many, many years of work with collaborators in engineering and physics and biology and mathematics. And so, that has also been very exciting to work with people from so many disciplines. And I'll end thanks there, and I'm happy to take questions. Thank you. Do we have any questions online? I have one. Go for it. So this is maybe more a question about the differences between observations of jellyfish and your numerical simulations. I noticed the edges of I noticed the edges of the jellyfish become like wavy in your simulations. Is that an artifact of the model, or is it something you see in observations as well? Yeah, so you do see the buckling of the bell margin when they contract. You know, is the buckling pattern exactly the same? Not exactly. So there's, let's see if I can show. Trying to get the best. Okay. So if you look at an actual moon jellyfish, they do have these scalloped edges and the bell is not quite a hemiolebs. We've also assumed we've just used a Neo-Hookian model for the elastic properties. So the elastic properties. So, the elastic properties are more complicated than that. The morphology is more complicated. And so, I think if we really wanted to match the buckling patterns, we would have to do a better job with these things, which we're also moving towards that. Well, and you can see that there are tentacles as well, which is something we're interested in too. So, but yeah, there definitely is. But yeah, there definitely is buckling in the actual jellyfish bell, but it's not exactly the same. Do you think it's not involved in locomotion as much? Well, so when the see if I can find another picture. Sorry for the follow-up question. So when the vortex rings separate from the bell here. Separate from the bell here. You can see that the vortex ring isn't a nice symmetric ring. I wish I had a better view of it, but as it separates, you know, the vortex ring is not a ring that kind of rippled. And to what extent that changes the dynamics, it's hard to say. I think there are other jellyfish that, well, Other jellyfish that well, so when jellyfish swim, part of this, uh, the interaction of the vortices aid in propelling them forward efficiently. But also the vortices aid in the capture of plankton. And so the oral arms and the tentacles are usually located in the regions where the vortices separate. So So, if you're a plankton, a lot of them detect shear and that triggers escape responses. So, the idea is like, let's say you're a little plankton over here. You're not detecting much shear until suddenly you get pulled into one of these vortices and you can't escape because the flow velocity here is pretty high. So, you're caught up in this vortex and then you get abvected along. And then you get abucted along a tentacle or the oral arms, and then you're stung and paralyzed. And it's an interesting process. So, and some of the jellyfish don't have these nice vortex rings. They break up into a lot of little vortex rings. And it's some combo of like the buckling and the scallops and the ornaments that does that. And it seems like everything is well positioned and tuned to efficiently capture. Tune to efficiently capture plankton, which jellyfish are very good at doing and out-competing fish and so forth in a lot of contexts. So I think it does matter, but it's a really challenging fluid problem. Thanks. We have a question. I have a question. Very interesting talk. I never think about squeezing booth paint. About squeezing toothpaste out of the tube, but still, my question is a little technical about the two-dimensional computations. When your boundary falls upon itself or when it strangulates a lot, I imagine it creates singularities in the veto field. Do you have issues with resolving that when you update the time scale or the mesh? Yeah, so there are issues. Issues. So the MERS boundary methods can't really deal with at least the versions that I'm using currently with boundaries that interact and become very close together. And so the way that people have dealt with this a lot of times is to add some sort of repulsive force so that they don't get that close. I know that there are a lot of people who are interested in this problem. People who are interested in this problem and coming up with ways with like higher order accurate models, like immersed interface models, and then coming up with, man, I'm just, I'm blanking on the method for the name of the method for dealing with like a little region of fluid in between two boundaries. But anyway, it's that is definitely a problem. That is definitely a problem, and there is quite a bit of work on doing that. And right now, the best methods I know of are just these ad hoc, like ad hoc adding electrostatic repulsion so the boundaries don't get too close. Also, if the so that in this case in 3D, the elastic boundary is discretized using finite elements. And so if you have really large deformations, then Formations, then you can also end up with inverted elements that cause instabilities. And we've had that happen quite a bit too. Voice Griffith knows a lot more about these problems than I would say Alex Huber too. So there are different elements that you can use. Like instead of using a tap mesh, use a hex mesh. And then, yeah, but both of these. Yeah, but both of these things are problems that come up quite a bit. And so then you choose your problems to avoid them, at least initially. Are there any other questions, either in person or online? Well, thank you, Laura, for such a great talk. For such a great talk, and we'll let you get back to your horse. Good luck with the surgery. Yeah, no problem. And Sorry, I didn't get to talk more about the jellyfish. I think I totally missed the amount of time it would take to get through stuff. So, but that's okay. I'll be talking about jellyfish elsewhere. So, hopefully, see you all there and you can hear more about them. Great. Thank you for your time.
