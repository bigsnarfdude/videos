Thank you very much. So, hello, everyone. Thanks for being here. Also, thanks to the organizers for giving this opportunity to present our work. So, I will talk about a classical approach. I want to say this first to the double copy. Maybe some of you know about the double copy procedure, catering amplitudes, and all of this. I want to talk about this work because the heart. This work because the the heart, I think, of the work resides in the scattering amplitudes. Maybe one would say a quantum analysis or the. But yeah, so the results I will present, most of them are classical. There's some ongoing work for the quantum or spring theory perspective I will talk about later. So, my background is not on particle physics, so don't be too harsh on me. If you haven't, you have some. If you have some questions at the end, I maybe can run before you ask them. That's just you. So, yeah, well, let's start with an overview. Over here, more like preliminaries is like I want to give like a background on why this, why we are going to do this work. So, I'm going to talk the double copy. What is it? There is a classical double copy. Also, I'm going to talk about gravity theory by gravity team. Gravity theory by gravity. After this, we are going to mix these ingredients up. So, we are going to talk about the double copy of gravity, classical double copy, some examples, and give some comments of the perturbative quantum gravity, right? So, to start. First, I want to talk kind of more like a historical context. In the context of string theory, and these three people, Kawaii, Leewilen and Thai. Establish some relation, right? Between in the string theory, you can like do some scattering experiments, dispersion over there. And for example, if you are working with closed strings, you get, for example, the graviton, you know, some tachyon for the closed string. And you also have the open string, right? And in the open string, you also have the spectrum. At some point, these were like. At some point, these were like very different sites in string theory, but these people derived this relation. The result is that you can write the open, the closed string scattering amplitudes for three point, at three level, so the classical scattering amplitude. You can write it using some dispersion for the some scatter. For some scattering amplitude for the open strings. Here are the maybe a couple in constant and some four factors, the permutation of the vertices and all this. The important thing here is that these two three level scattering amplitudes in string theory, it seems that they are connected and this is they are connected by the KLT relations, right? So just to give an example, we can have in the close can have in the closed string we can have the the graviton a four graviton scattering and this is connected with the with the open string amplitudes which are for the four photon for the four photon scattering amplitude sorry and yeah these scams uh maybe before before klt did they work uh this was like a known that that we can uh have the vertex Have the vertex operator, and the vertex operator is like in QFT, the one that gives you the propagation of this your particles, your string in this case. And they are connected in the propagator, sorry, the vertex operator, it is related to the vertex operator of the open strings, but with left and right oscillate. So in the low energy limit, that is what we need right here. We need right here in the low energy limit, the three levels gauge gravity, gauge, sorry, gravity amplitudes, you can put them in products of the gauge amplitudes. So this is a gravity amplitude. It will be a product of two gauge amplitudes. The four-point gravity amplitude can also be a product. These are the kinematic factors. Okay, and so on. So this is the important thing here, right? This is the important thing here, right? You have this relation, even that comes from a string theory, but you have this relation in the low energy limit that connects gravity and engage gauge theory. So this is what people say that gravity is like the square of a gauge theory. And that's what there is a paper from Bernie, I think, about with this title, gravity as the square of a gauge theory. Now, Now, the other realization within this work came from Bern, Carrasco, and Johansson. It's the BCJ duality, BCGI double copying. There is a relation between color and kinematic that appear in the scattering amplitudes of gravity and gauge theory. So I will write the end-point tree level in the gauge theory, the amplitude like this. These are the color factors, the kinematic factors, the propagators, the coupling constant. And you start with this, you can have this, and the kinematic factors, this is the BCJ duality, the color kinematic duality, the relation, that the color factors, you can find, you have an ambiguity, right? So you have an ambiguity in these kinematic factors. The thing is that you can find these kinematic factors that assume like a Jacobi relation. Like a Jacobi relation, they will hold this Jacobi relation, and also the color factor will hold its Jacobi relation. So, this is helpful in the calculations on the scattering amplitudes. But what is more important is that we can relate these amplitudes from the gauge theory. We can relate them even better. We can obtain the gravity theory amplitudes by using this simple. This simple replacement: the color factors, you replace it with the kinematic factors, and the coupling constant with the coupling constant of the gravity theory. And you here, you obtain a gravity amplitude. So that is like known from the double copy procedure. And so you have the backwards, the backwards procedure, which is the zero copy. Someone called that zero copy. So we replace the kinematic factor in the gauge amplitude with a Kinematic factor in the gauge amplitude with a color factor in the gauge theory, and we obtain this result. Okay, so this is like a result from I will give an example. So just counting the degrees of freedom, for example, we can have that both gauge theories are pure non-supersymmetric Jam-Mills. Then the gauge theory, the gravity theory, is general relativity coupled to a two-form field and a dielectron. form field and a dielectric. So here you will have two degrees of freedom and two degrees of freedom. This is four. From the graviton you have two degrees of freedom. The caldera month we will have one degree of freedom and one degree of freedom. So four equals four. That's just the degrees of freedom counting rate. So just a quick summary. This is a relation. You have for example the Maldasena conjecture that relates the strong appealing limit with a The strong coupling limit with a weak coupling limit of a CFT and a gravity theory. The double copy relates the weak coupling limits of both gauge and gravity theories. This is a relation that is in the scattering amplitudes. We need the VC gau duality to hold. And it is important in this context that the double copy and the VC judality has been shown to hold at free level. But there is also good evidence that it is also true. That it is also true at loop level. So here we end with a double copy. Let me talk about with a double with a double copy in the scattering ampite. Now we can talk about the classical Kerschill double copy. There are other classical double copies, like the Bayle double copy, for example. But I will talk about the Kerschill double copy. Just giving a quick example here. This is the Kersha Land set in general relativity. This is a family of Relativity. This is a family of solutions in general relativity. This is, you can consider a Minkowski background or you can consider a other background. So if you consider a curved background, it's the generalized scarcely answered. So this is the NSAT, and here we have the graviton. We can see here that the property of this NSAT that factorizes this two Lorentz factor is important and it will be important over the work. Will be important over the work. So, yes, and in this answer, in the Kershill answers, we have that this null vector is null and also geodesic with respect to the background and the whole metric. So, there's just context. With this, we can write the Richie tensor with this form. This is in the Stefani book of exact solutions, for example. And an important thing to say is that we use this combination of the indices, one up and one down. The indices, one up and one down, because this is the combination that gives linear, where the graviton is linear. Okay, so here we see that it is linear. So, and this equation is the one that is going to help us to obtain the different equations of motions for gravity and gauge theory. Let me just. This is a procedure that this is the classical Kerr-Schild procedure. So, you can have the non-abelian field here, and in order. Field here. And in order to get from the non-abelium field from a gauge theory to a gravity theory, we will like change this color factor. We will change it with a kinematic factor and obtain what we had here. And also we can do it with a serial copy. We can replace this kinematic factor with a color factor for my gauge theory, and we will obtain a Viagoint scalar field. So this is just context, and if I can. Just context, and if I can give an example, Montero, in his work with the CONEL, and he used them in Kosky background. And for example, they use the Solchi solution, the Kerr solution. And they showed that if we start with this solution, you can have that this field without a color follows the Maxwell equation. And also, Equation. And also, if you replace another factor, you strip another factor, and you just have this color field, it satisfies the claim Gordon equation. So these are just the available versions of the field. This is in the work from Antero. And now, I will stop here with this classical level copying in Einstein gravity, but Gravity. But the thing is that in general relativity, you can say, for example, you have four assumptions, right? Like, I don't know, locality, you have Lorentz invariance, you have one spin to field, which is masses, right? So if you want to go like beyond Einstein relativity, you can modify one of those assumptions. Maybe someone would like to modify locality or Lorentz invariance. And what we show. And what we chose is that by gravity theory, this has two modifications. The modifications is that we had only one spin two field in Einstein gravity. Now we have two spin two fields and one of them is massive. The other one is massless. Why do we do this? Because you want to give mass to the graviton and one consistent way to do this is Consistent way to do this is like making interact the graviton with another spin-to field. Okay, so this is the you have the Einstein-Hilberten for the for a metric. This is the normal Einstein metric, the G. We have another metric, which is F metric. And this is the Einstein-Kilbert term for the F metric. And there is a potential interact with a non-derivative potential. And this potential maybe. And this potential, maybe it's not so important to remember the form or anything like that. Just it is difficult to find many, to find solutions because it has a square root structure. So if we are going to work with this, we have to be careful with this square root structure, right? So yeah, these are some coupling constants, some functions of the interaction metric. And this is the functional form. And this is the functional form. There is no, it's just like me. It is, these formulas are just to look intellectual. There is no, I will give some examples. The equations of motion by gravity, these are what it is important to us. We are going to define like this effective tensor, you know. But this is important. We have these equations of motion, right? And now in our work, this is the answer that we consider. This is the answer that we consider. We had all of this context, but what we wanted to know is how by gravity would fit in this classical double copy procedure. Fortunately for us, there were some solutions already from 2018, I think, from Ayombeato and Daniel Guita. Practically, those helped us a lot because, in their work, this is the answer, right? The geometric is like. This is the answer, right? The G metric is like a Kerschill answer, the F metric is also a Kerschill answer, but with a proportionality constant. We have the same background metrics and we have the same null vectors over here. The thing is that you can do this more general, right? You can have different backgrounds, different null vectors, but the difficulty lies in the square root structure of this gamma interaction matrix. Because these answers permit you write all the powers. Permit you write all the powers of the interaction matrix in a closed form. If you want to have, for example, different backgrounds of different null vectors, you are going to have many difficulties in calculating this. So this is like clever from Adiombiato and Anagita to have this closed expression. And that is the one that helps us a lot. I'm going to define here some constants, which are in terms of the other constants. Just I want you to see here that P0. here that b1 b2 and b3 can be treated can be seen as the interaction as the coefficients that will give rise to the interaction between the f and the g metric so b0 b0 can be seen like a cosmological constant term for the g metric and b4 can be seen as the cosmological term for the f metric right so these are just constants and this is the these are the equations of motion And these are the equations of motions we get. So here we have the lignerobic operator. Here we have a term that is proportional to the background curvature over here. So these are the equations of motions. And from here, what we did is follow the procedure from Carrillo Gonzalez. She already did this in general relativity. The thing is that we have this equation, right? So we want to get to this. To get to these are spin two equations of motion, the spin two fields. So we want to write to a spin one, for example, a Maxwell equation kind, or a Kling-Orden equation. So how do we get from a spin two to a spin one? Equation of motion. So Carillo Nande said that, okay, let's contract these equations with Killing vectors. The Killing vectors are the ones that give you the asymmetries of your solution, like that. that and this is where the double classical double copy of the gravity we started we we wanted to start we we wanted to to think about how can we um use this massless massive massive gravity theory in in this context of the double copy to later on uh study from the scattering amplitude right so from the classical double copy perspective this is the only thing that is important from here is that we will be treating maximally symmetric space-times Maximally symmetric space-times. We will define these quantities. You will see what these quantities are. And these are the gauge fields defined with the quantities we have defined in our answer. And these are the field strengths. So what are these quantities? These quantities, x, x, and y, are the quantities that we don't want. So we just wrote here like, this is the maxible term, this is the maxible term. So everything that is not the maxible term, we are going to. That is not the Maxwell term, we are going to separate it cleverly. So, yeah, it's just like the difference between the equations that we hope to get. And also, we have, this is for the spin one field, just for the spin one field, and this would be for the spin zero field. Also, another comment I would like to say here is that in the classical double copy procedure, due to the changes of the coupling constant, You do the changes of the coupling constants of the color factors to kinematic factors, but you also have sources, right? You can also have sources in the gravity or in the gauge side. So what this works from Carrillo Gonzalez, they did is that, okay, you can find the correct sources that double copy to your gauge or to your gravity theory, but using the same procedure by contracting this with this case, the Killing Bay. This case is the killing vector, and this case is a killing vector. So, you will find the correct sources for this procedure if you follow this recipe, right? Okay, we are going to focus on specific solutions. Well, the solutions that were already in the literature have this satisfy this equation. So, that is the ones that we wanted to work on. It works on and the classical Keschield double copying by gravity, we would say it is like this: that we have the classical Keschill double copy in general relativity, and we just do this for the two metrics, right? So we just do this change in both of the fields. And we start working with some examples, stationary solutions, for example, like the Hakeer and Swarshild solutions and even their maximally symmetric generalizations. Maximally symmetric generalizations. They hold this relationship in equation 20. So we can see here that these coefficients go away and that is important because the equations of motions we get, the two black holes are like separate or separated in the sense that decoupled. I have to say decouple. Here we don't have the H is the graviton for the F metric and Q. For the F metric, and Couli H is the graviton for the F metric, right? So, in principle, this is not massless, and this is not massive. So, there are like superpositions of massive and massless fields. And yeah, here in the black holes, we see that we don't have any interaction of coupling, right? But in the time-dependent solutions, which are wave solutions, we do have some coupling. Have some coupling. So, this was these solutions were already reported in the territory, but we wanted to have this framework that considers them in the double copy context, right? So now we see that we have equations of motions which are coupled for the field. And we can also decouple these fields by using this redefinition. And this is what Definition. And this is what we obtained, right? In the R equals here, in the zero curvature background, we will have a massless and a massive field, massless and a massive, massless and a massive. And this mass of the massless field is proportional to the Fierce Pauli term, that is the Fierce Pauli mass, sorry, that is the mass term that appears in, when you want to give mass to the graviton, it's like a linear mass term. It's like a linear mass term. So we can also couple a matter, but here we only couple it to the geometric. The thing is that things get complicated because you don't have like the same simple equations of motion. You cannot interpret the sources you get in this context with the quantities you defined in your answers, right? Your in your answers, right? So, this is just a curiosity. Yeah, this is just like a curiosity for you. And for example, here, this is the, for example, the charge potential. It follows this equation in this global static coordinate. So this also you have from general relativity. But it seems that we have like this weird term. We want to work on that also. want to work on that also. But yeah, we have this paper was accepted in JHEP like two weeks ago, so we are happy about that. And I also, I just want to say that in this classical approach, I presented the stationary solutions, which are decoupled, and the time dependent solutions, which are coupled. So in the perturbative quantum gravity context, what is what we expect? Because we want to do this work. To do this work, and we started this work with we think that we answered some questions, but I think that it gave us many open questions more than that we answered. I think that that is good, but also. But okay, you can describe the scattering process of gravitons in flat space by using Feynman diagrams. This is the Feynman propagator, the three and four-point diagrams. Yeah, in the Deyander gauge, the propagator for the graviton has this form. And in that three vertex, it's a very complicated structure. These are like some two terms, but it has a complicated structure. You can do this at a gravity, a tree level, Feynman diagrams. Okay, this analysis is like known, I would say. The thing is that we want like quantum correctional, so we want loops. One loops. And in quantum field theories of gravity, apparently non-normalizable. So we expect that it is like effective field theory. So we could have like loop level Feynman diagrams. And the thing here is that the behavior of these loops is the key for understanding the divergences of quantum gravity, right? And what this double copy procedure helps us is that it suggests a possible way to deal with multi-loop diagrams, but by factorizing gravity. Loop diagrams, but by factorizing gravity amplitudes into the product of gauge theory ones. So, one would say that gauge theory Feynman rules are much simpler than gravity Feynman rules. So, this is why we hope that this helps in quantum gravity calculations. So, I just give an example here that the three graviton vertex can be seen as a product of two giant middle vertices. And this is why a string theory suggests that the three graviton vertex can be expressed in terms of three grand. Graviton vertex can be expressed in terms of three gluon vertex, but we want massive gravity, right? So, the thing is that there is a work on massive gravity and this double copy that relates the coupling limit. Let's say the Jang-Mills and the RGT massive gravity, this is a massive gravity where the F metric is not dynamical. They seem to be connected by the decoupling limits, which is the non-linear sigma model. Is the non-linear sigma model and special Galilean theory? But the three and four amplitudes are good, are consistent with a gravity amplitude, but it fails a higher point. So we should consider an extension for both sides. And this is what we hope to get. The color kinematics duality can be useful in multi-look calculations where they use the unitary method to factorize gravity amplitude. Method to factorize gravity amplitudes into product of gauge theory. There is an example of a tool for 0.2 CT amplitude. In a massive gravity theory, we would expect complex diagrams because we have massive states, we have cells interactions, we can have a sun-rays diagram, I don't know. The thing is that we could expect that BCJ duality can help us solve from the case side. And even though the double copy does not give you a novel way to solve difficult integrals, it provides a Difficult integrals, it provides a manner to simplify these diagrams and calculations in the gauge and even in the gravity side. So, these are the open questions: how to couple matter to gravity and how to treat it in a double copy. There is some, how can we interpret the charge solution in general relativity? Do we need to consider a Calvramon and a dilaton in this metric? How can you get the spectrum of gravity from the spectrum of string theory? What is the interpretation of the other metric? The interpretation of the other metric, the BCJ duality for the F metric. We need more gravity solutions, scattering amplitude analysis. So we have more open questions than what we started with. And thank you for your attention. These are my references if you want. Ah, yeah, yeah. So they call the fat graviton. The graviton is the graviton, the H mu no, the massless graviton. And the fat graviton is like, oh, no, more like, it's like a product of the massless graviton, the caldramon graviton, the caldramon anti-symmetric field, and the dilaton. So it would be like. So it would be like this would be sort. This is like the fat gravity. This would be like a fat gravity. You consider also the dilaton and the calcramon field. That is what you mean. So the question is, should we also consider that the F metric has a path graviton structure? I got lots of information on the string theory origin of the past. I was wondering if you looked at the recent papers of the Munich group. It was Senaku, and Matsumi. I think they were wondering where the Master Pradikon is sitting among the spin-two states that no lack master. Maybe also additionally. Yeah, I think I remember a paper from Luce extracting by gravity from a string theory. I don't know. Yeah, it is, yeah, it is like one of the open questions. What they did over there is like, okay, start from string theory. And okay, let's say where does the gravity, the massless graviton come from, right? It comes from that closed string spectrum. But the thing is that we have a massive Is that we have a massive metric, the F metric, where can it come from the string theory perspective? The thing is that in that work, they use a state from the open string to try to build this interaction. The thing is that, as I remember in that paper, they weren't able to get the behavior they wanted for by gravity. For by gravity. I don't know. Maybe that may be because the Einstein metric has some nature that it comes from the closed string from string theory. I would say that, and I think also Lucan, and they would say like maybe it also needs to, the F metric also needs to come from a closed string spectrum. They work with an open string spectrum. I think that because calculations were kind of less We're kind of less involved. But in future works, I remember in one of the discussions, they are working on trying to derive this F metric from a closed string state. But it is like, it is a difficult calculation, I would say. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Also, one more comment. The F metric, this is maybe like good for personality. Good for cosmologists. I don't know if said like that, but this F-metric may be good for a good candidate for dark matter because it is a massive field, it is an spin-to field, and it only interacts gravitationally. So that may be another motivation.
