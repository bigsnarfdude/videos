All right, welcome back. This is the last session in the last talk in the morning session. And for this, we have Kong Joo, and she will talk about comology of stacks of shutcast 3. So, over to you, Kong Joo. Thank you very much for the introduction. So in today's talk, we will talk about the smoothness property of the cohomology shift of stack of Dukas. So reminder that just That just a short reminder of the cohomology shift and cohomology groups of stacks of two cast for any finite site I and any W representation of I copy of the G height, the dual group of G for any I and W. So for any I will have the variable. I will have the very big stack of Stuka, the unstack of Stuka, which is over I copy of the curve and associate to each W, we have a canonical shift, which comes from a geometric set of K equivalence. We saw that it is supported on some finite dimensional closed substack in the Stuka E. And the support, which this is a Daninia Mountford stack, locally of finite type. And in general, it is neither smooth nor purple. It is not smooth. This does not cause problem because we measure its singularity by its local model, which is the Benningsen June field App and Grassmanni. Associated to I and W and leaves on Xi. And when W is irreducible, the canonical shift is the so since because of the locomotive, so the singularity of a stack of shtukas, this closed one. This closed one is the same as the sanctularity of the Benin Sun Joint field up and grassmanning. So this one, the fiber are the product of Arkan of the fibers are the product of the unschubert cell in the closure the risky aristocracy closure of the unschubert cell. Of the Schubert cell in the affine grass line. So we know where its singularity is. And we saw that we have said that when W is irreducible, this canonical shift is isomorphic to the IC shift of its support. So this is a red object to construct. A red object to consider when the when the stack is not smooth, we consider cohomology of the IC. And for the so smooth does not cause problem. However, the stack of shtuca is not proper because it's not even of finite type in general. And this This relates to the subject of today's lecture. And we will say that even the stack of Stuka is not proper, we can still get some good properties of the direct image of the shift. And we recall that, so we have a complex, of course. Have a complex of cohomology shifts, which is the direct image, derived direct image of this non-equal shift over Xi. So I read it around H without decoration. And then we have a degree J cohomology shift. It's just the degree J cohomology of the Grig cohomology of the complex. We saw that it is an adaptive limit of contractable shifts by the Haddan-Ashman truncations. So this cohomology shift is the inductive limit of the truncated shift indexed by mu. uh mu mu is indexed by the dominant covet of g and each truncated shift is defined as the cohomology for the canonical shift restricted to this open substack which is of finite type so each truncated sheaf is a contractable sheaf but the unductive limit might not be And we have a degree-J cohomology group, which is just the generic fiber of the cohomology shift. Since we consider direct image, so it's the we always, when we talk about cohomology here, it's always the compact support cohomology. The cohomology group, UNE is to the cohomology sheet. So the cohomology shift uroni is denoted by a round H, and the cohomology group is denoted by a direct H. And this is the object Manthana Fog used in his talk today. And last time, we have saw that the generic fiber of the co-homology shift is equipped with a canonical. Is equipped with the canonical action of the partial Fobenus morphist. And by definition, it's equipped also with the action of the pi one of eta i. So here the notation is that eta i is the generic point of I copy of the curve and the eta i bar is a geometric point. And we saw that so. And we saw that, so yesterday we defined a group which called F V, which includes the action of the V group under the petrophobinus morphism. So these two actions by definition give a canonical action of F V group and And by June's first lemma, we get that the action of F V group on the generic fiber of Kohlman Reshift factors through the I copy of V group. So here eta is the generic point of X, eta bar geometric point over beta. So the V group is equal to the V group of the function field. The big group of the function field x. So that's what we say yesterday. And today, we will use this result to prove that our cohomology shift Hiw, it is n n over x i. Over Xi. So here and this just means that it can be written as an inductive limit of these shifts. So it's if yes, so it's just like the property of need. It's just like the property of NIST for contract or shift. Just here we have and everywhere. And as the URL is shift, this condition is equivalent to the following condition that lights for any two geometric point of XI and any specialization map between these two points. Which is two point the induced map is an isomorphism so these two conditions are equivalent for these are the definition of and and miss shift and as the immediate immediate as an immediate colloquy of the theorem we say that the action of an I copy of V group on the generic point factorized by the V group of the curve I copy of the V group of the curve which means that the action is everywhere ungeomified and in And in my talk, in my three talk, I only consider the case without level structure. But in Vansala Volk's talk today, you already see when we have level structure for automorphic forms, if we have a sub-scheme of the curve, if I have a finite sub-scheme. Have a finite sub-scheme of the curve. So we can consider the automorphic form with level structure of n, and we can define stack of Stuka on wind level of n. We have cohomology with level of n. And this theorem, in that case, become that the so the cohomology shift with level structure on n is different. structure on n is defined on x minus n and time i copy of x minus n the result is that the shift is at least on x minus n i copy of x minus n so the action in that case this action factors through the wave group of x minus n i copy of the wave group of x minus n so when there are a level structure level structure over result is for result outside the level one so um so today's lecture uh i will explain how to prove this uh this theory just before Just before go to Ruth, usually if we have a if we have a purple scheme, a purple stack, the cohomology happens. If this stuca is purple, then by theorem of in algebraic geometry, the cohomology is smooth over Xi. And what we expect here is that even when the stack is not awful. When the stack is not open, the cohomology is we still have this option, the cohomology is still smooth over and fine. So now in the following, I explain how we prove this theory. There are essentially two ingredients for the proof. The first one is this result. And this result, this action. And another one is the Zoho lemma and the creation and annualization operator. So you will see it later. So let's begin by some preparation of the proof. So the first thing, so now it comes. So now let's consider a scheme defined like this. So eta bar is the geometric generic point of X. So we take the product of all this eta bar over FQ bar. Sorry, it's FQ bar. I forgot the bar here. The product are over FQ bar. And this is very big. In fact, it's an integral scheme, but very big. We have this scheme sent to an eye copy of the curve. And the geometric generic point of Xi is also a geometric generic point of this game. What happens? What happens on this scheme is that our cohomology shift restrict on this skin, it is an over this skin. And this is so which means that for any geometric point of the scheme, I mean specialization map from geometric generic point for the Point to the geometric point, the induced mic is an isomorphism. This property is almost already proved by Manson Africa. In his paper, he considered a special case where X bar is delta eta bar, so delta is the diagonal, right? And eta bar the geometric generic point of X. So data, the image by the diagonal map is a special case of a geometric point of this scheme. I copy of eta bar. And the proof in Or intentionally use the achieve neural relations. So this is something we can know from isolation relations. And now this we will say that this operation, it is smooth over. It is smooth over and miss over I copy of eta bar and the population we proved yesterday, the action of F V factorized by I copy of V show that the shift is constant over eta bar. Because so our situation is following. So here we have our skin eye copy of beta bar, which is our eye copy of the curve and for any. And for any projection to any copy of X, this send to Italy Bar. Yesterday, we have this commutative diagram. So on the upper line, we have the F V group, the exact sequence of F V group, which sent to an eye copy of that. Copy of that. So, and on the lower line, we have a copy of the exact sequence of the curve. So, we have the one yesterday we saw that. So, here is Is isomorphism have that I copy here and here. And the map of F V to I copy of the wave group is subjective. Its kernel is equal to the kernel of the geometric pi one geometry. And so we take data a generic point. Take delta generic point of our scheme. This scheme, the pi one of the generic point. By definition, it's in the kernel of this one because when it's sent to this, it already lets a data bar. Yesterday, so the We prove that the action of F V factorized by I copy of the V, which means that the kernel acts trivial. So the pi one delta act trivial of the general level. And the overshift is unsmooth, unnecessary on this skin. Skin and the pi one act tribally, so it is a constant shift on the scheme. So, but that's a consequence of these two population. And in general, when we write I come to part, when we write I as a disjoint union of I1 and I2, and if we take I And if we take ice any geometric point over closed point ice of the curve, we can consider this mixed scheme. This scheme, which is I1 times of product of eta bar over FQ bar, and I2 times of product of S bar over F Q bar. And we prove that we can prove that for any this. that for any less for any disjoint union, the restriction of the cohomology shift over this scheme is a constant shift. The proof is just as before. We first prove that it is on this scheme and then we have a similar result says that the Similar result says that the action of F factorized by copy of V. So the pi one of this since act three one. So this is a kind of abstract as a statement how to understand interpret this remark is that now consider a very Now consider a very fair rate situation. Our shift over X I copy of the curve is of this form. So if our shift, if our shift is a product of Fi and each Fi is a shift over X in this case the The restriction of the this shift and in a scheme like this, we can write it as the restriction of each copy of this Fi and in this case we see it's easy to see that the restriction of F on this. Restriction of F on this big screen is a constant shift because it can write like this coffee form, and this each of this is constant. So unfortunately, not all the shift or eye copy of the curve is a Of the curve is a product of other shifts, is a product like this. So this population says that even not cohomology, H I W is not of this form, but the restriction is constantly. So it has some So it has some some good properties and the in fact the key reason is that if this shift has a partial Fogenous Morphis and the partial Fogenous Morphis by Junker's lemma gives us the action of I copy of V. action of high copy of regroup and give us this result. So in fact, everything, almost everything comes from partial forbiddenness action. Now we will see that how to use this property to prove that the shift itself is the itself is and miss over xi. So in the following, I will give an idea of the proof of the theorem, only in the case where I is a sanctuary, which means Michluka with one line. And the proof in the general case are very similar. Are very similar. So let's consider I central tone. In this case, W is just a representation of G height. So we have the Stuka with one light with R X and the cohomology shift H1 tap mu with our X. In the following, to simplify the notation, I will The notation, I will not write this j. I just write this we want to prove that this shift is an antenna for x. Equivalently, we want to prove that for any geometric point v bar of x, and any specialization map from the generic point to this rebar. Point to use rebar. The induced map, we want to prove that this is an isomorphism. What we will do is that we will construct a map from another direction. And to construct map from another direction, we will use creation operator and animation operator. So let's unfortunately. We call creation operator and emulation operator. So W here, we have W the representation of G height. We note W star, the view of the dual representation of W and we note one the change representation. And we will first consider a creation operator which creates so our cohomology already have one like we will create a second and third light and the creation is associated to this this map so this is So this is the canonical map, the unit map yesterday from a trivial representation to this tensor product. The creation operator is the following composition. So first we began from our cohort, from our shift. So all the shifts are our So all the shifts are our x times i. We begin by over h1 w and times the point box times the constant shift over x and this by definition this is isomorphic to the cohomology of shtuca on two legs for For the first like, we give the representation W. And for the second like, the like zero, we give a retrieval representation. Which means there is a like, but the representation, the condition of the modification is trivial one, there's no modification. So on this part, it is a constant shift. which is a constant shift and then so this is a shift over x times i and then by the functoriality associated to this data we send it to the stereo cohomology of stuka in two legs so for the first leg it's identity it's associated to identity Is associated to identity for the representation. And for the second line, like the usual, it is associated to this data map for the representation. So it arrived in this one. And then by fusion. So here we consider fusion for the second and third light. So we have. So we have x times x sent to three copies of curve by identity for the first one. And this one we send it to by diagonal. So the second copy we send it to the diagonal of this. So for the first like, we do nothing always like This line on X, but for this like zero by field, we create a second and third line on the diagonal for this one. And the representation is that we give the dual representation for the second light and the W for third light. It's easier to say from this to this, which means the cohomology of Stukau in three lags, restricted to this diagonal, partial diagonal is isomorphic to one lag on the list representation for second line. And that is the creation operator and the animation operator that we will use is associated to the evaluation net from this to the trivial representation. So for this, we begin by cohomology of Dukan with three legs. Relex restricted to this partial diagonal. So this time we send the first copy to the diagonal and this copy, the last one sent to this tanks. So it's a diagonal for the first and second copy. With this restrict to this diagonal by fusion, so this time is the first and second light fusion for this light. And the third light will do nothing because we can restrict it to anything. So the search light is still here with the protection W, but the first two legs were. The first two legs with bifusion become this leg, and representation become this tension. So now this H03, it selects on x times 5x. And then by functoriality associated to this evaluation map, it gets this one. We have identity for the We have identity for the Daphne associated search line, and this is isomorphic to a constant shift on the first copy of X and times the cohomology associated to the search light. And this is the so that's So that's the annulation operator that we need. And here is the Zoho lemma, which is very magic. It's very simple, but very magic. And we will see how it helps us to prove the theorem. It comes from a very simple. From a very simple statement for the vector space, the composition, the following composition for vector space is the identity. So what we do here, so we send this W by identity to the first one, and we send the QL by delta to the second and third one. And then we compare the first and second one. We add evaluation map for the first and second one to QI and identity for the third one. So it looks like the whole and the composition is. Composition is identity and by the functoriality we get that now. So consider the composition of Moface Mal shifts over X. So we have the creation operator just defined before, create second. Before create second and third likes. What I can do is like so. This one, it is over x times x, but I can still restrict it to the diagonal of in x times x, which means that I ask on all this. I restrict this to the diagonal of this, what we get is this. This so we we create second and third line, and by now everything is over the diagonal. And so, this is a creation operator before, and then for the annulation operator, this one, we can also restrict it to the diagonal of. To the diagonal of x times x. Well, I restricted to x times x. It is this one. So I can compose them before I cannot because this one laps on this partial diagonal. This partial diagonal and this one on this partial diagonal, they are not the same. However, if I restrict it to the total diagonal in X, this and this become the same. So I can put this tool. So I can first create a second and third line and then emulate. And then emulate first and second lag. And the composition is identical. This comes from the functorian for this one. And now we will see how to use creation and animation operator to construct a morphism in the other things in the other direction of this. So we want to. So we want to construct a morphist from the generic fable to special fable. What we do is that, so consider this one. First, we put it, we have the cohomology shift restrict to the generic point. We consider a constant shift of Enser a custom shift on the special point and by creation operator. So on this special creation operator for second and third flag, for this for the special point, we will create two legs on this on V bar. So this line is. So this line is just I restrict the creation operator on eta bar and times weight. So here is the creation operator less on x times x. If I restrict this on eta bar times with bar I get I get this one. I get this one. So, for the first copy, I have Itaba, and the second copy is Wilba. So, here we have creates two more legs. They are on the special point. We want to contract a map from this to another. The another fable. This fable is for first and second leg, they are on generic point, and for the third leg, it is on special point. So, if we compare these two, the difference is that here we have first light on eta bar. First leg on eta bar, second and third leg on weba. And here, we have first leg on eta bar, second leg on etabar, and the third leg on weebar. To go from higher to higher, it looks like we do a specialization map for the second light, go to web part, february to february. February of web R2, February of Eta Bar. And what concretely how to contract this is that by we use the second proposition applied to this cohomology with three legs. So that proposition says that this cohomology is constant over Over all kinds of this product, all kinds of this skin. So in this case, here it says that it is constant by this population, and the cohomology with three legs, it is constant over this, this, this. This, this, so all this kind of product and that property give us a kind of recommend in this one and then we use the emulation operator. So, here it is the emulation operator. Annihilation operator restricted to eta bar times O bar. So we annihilate the first two legs. They are on eta bar. So the constant shift is on eta bar. And for the third leg, we do nothing, which is always on V bar. So the composition gives us the map alpha. So the H1W or H3W, they are the same thing, they are the cohort of Schlukham one night. The mark is that if our cohomology is of this form, if it is a product of three shifts, Then this map, it is just a specialization map for the second factor. And it is identity for the first one and identity for the third one. But our cohort is not of this one. It's not office one, so we need to build this operation to guide some economic command. And the rest things to do is to prove that this map we construct, it is the inverse map of the specialization map. For this, we will. For this, we will do this diagram. We will go slowly for this. So, let's begin by this one. We have cohomology H1W on V-bar times the constant shift on V-bar. Constant shift on vapar by specialization map on the on the constant shift we arrive to h1w on v bar times constant shift on beta bar and then here we have all the map alpha we contract before so it is a So it is a cohomology on V bar times the constant shift on eta bar. We create. So the first slide is on V bar. Sorry, I think I'm very sorry that so I should exchange this with. I should exchange this waiver and this eta bar. In fact, it is a specialization map for this one. So this is specialization map as before. Go from H1W web to H1W eta bar. Sorry, this should be eta bar. Should be eta bar and for the constant one we do nothing so this is we bar like this uh so the first leg should be on eta bar and it is always on eta bar and the third light should be on v bar and and this should be on v bar when we create second and third light. Second and third leg, which is on we bar and then we put the second leg on eta bar and we annulate the first and second line. So this map, vertical map alpha, is just this map I construct before. So it's from H restrict to eta bar times QIR repair. Here is the mistake. So, that is the composition of the specialization mic at the beginning when the inverse mic will contract. And we want to show that this is identical. What we do is that we complete the diagram. Complex diagram. So here we can choose to create two. Here we can also create two legs, second and third leg, but on web. So what we do here is the same as here, create. Create two legs on vapor, but here, since the first leg is also on vapor, it arrived in the diagonal. All the three legs are on repair. Then we use annihilation operator to annihilate first and second leg. But because we have the Yoho lemma, says that. Says that if we create two legs, and if we create second and third leg, and then animate first and second leg, if we are always stay on the diagonal for everything, then the composition is identical. So this one is identical. And the lower line is just a specialization map for the constant. Specialization map for the constant shift, so it's isomorphism. It is not evident to show that the diagram commute and in fact to show that the diagram commute, we need the propagation. We need the operation that the shift when it's relaxed are constant or all these things. And all the maps are canonical. So the commutativity comes from this program. So that is the alpha compose specialization map is identity. And we also want to show that the specialization map compose alpha is also identity. For this, we have a very similar diagram. So the vertical line is of line is always over map alpha the map that from the generic fable to special fable we constructed before and this time we send this first five specialization for this constant shift so we go from this to From this to this one, it is an isomorphism. And here we have all the legs are on eta bar. We first create two second and third light on etabar and then annulate first and second light always on eta bar. And the composition by the whole ma is identical. By Joholema, it's identical because now all three lights are the same. And the lower line is the specialization map. We want to prove that this is isomorphism. So this is a specialization map at the beginning from special point. long special points to generate long special paper to generate people and we as before we use the population two to prove that this diagram commute and use population two to contract all this this economical maps which is not evident because there's no specialized Because there's no specialization between these two points. And what we use here is the property that our shift is constant or all used per sector. So that's how we prove that the so this and this show that the specialization map is attentive. Intentive is isomorphism like this will show that the shift is antimis over X and in general we have a similar result so that is about this this theorem. this this theorem and when there are when when there are level structure as i said before when your cohomology shift with level structure is n smooth outside the level structure is unsmooth over x minus n times i copy and what happened over the level structure is more complicated there are some conjecture about this are some conjecture but with so this is offside over electron so this is the other continuous about the three lectures for the Yes, I think I will. Thanks. Are there any questions, comments from the audience on Zoom? Okay, there is one just thinking of an example that Van Ser LaFour showed this morning to could you do a no further annihilation to a no-leg commolishing chief? And if there is any contact in the other direction. Could you repeat the question? Yes, so you could have, you're doing, well, in the proof, but there are also examples of going to a one-leg from a two-leg. And there was an example of going from the empty and no-leg commodity ship. Do you do annihilation from the one leg to the no leg? So for it's about here from one leg when look like something about Something about this? Yes, so it's in a different context, but and because there was an example mentioned in the first talk. Example of you want an example of shtuka with one leg or you want to know this this. This this is on office. I didn't quite understand the question. Could you just repeat it? Sorry. Yeah, no, it's usually helpful to get an example to understand the passage from a one leg to a two leg. And then I was surprised that. And then I was surprised that if it were possible to go to the empty set. So Stuka with if there is no legs, it's just an isomorphism. The stack of Stuka with no legs, it's just a plastic. classify geitoser which is isomorphism of a chitoser with its inverse image of Fubinius and stuca with one legs is a classifier isomorphism of a G-toser no classifier G-toser which has some which is Which has some modification between the Gitosa and its inverse image of Fubinis. And the modifications, you can give some conditions on the modifications. And if your condition is a very important thing, it's a very If your condition is that the modification is how to say, sorry, I think I already hire so there is this stack of Stuka I didn't Stack of Stuka, I didn't define, and it seems it's not really defined in by Sanger Fox talk either. So for each representation, we have a strike. So a stack of stuka, you have two conditions about legs and some boundaries on the leg. So stuka with one leg, in my lecture. In my lecture, by this definition I used before, it's just classify a point, it just classify you have you choose a point which is the leg, and then a modification between a G-toser and its for venous image, and the modification is on the leg, its isomorphism outside the leg. And this is a very big hand stack. And stack and inside, there are many substitute. Each time when we give a representation, each time when we give some bound on the modification, we have a stack of stuka with one leg, with one leg. So So, if the condition you give is the trivial representation, which means if you said I take no modification between the G total and A provenance, and in this case, the one like condition is the in this case used. Used this is just like a stuka with with no legs times X. However, if your representation if your representation is big, in that case, the shtuca with one leg is the Is much bigger and it has no relation with Stukao without light. So this this tab new here, when you change a tab new, you really only change the usually catch different stack of Stuka. Take our stoker. Thank you. That's very helpful. Any other questions? Okay, let's thank the speaker one more time. And this concludes our morning session. We will come back.
