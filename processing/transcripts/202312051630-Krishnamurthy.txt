As Morten mentioned, this talk is about the n-vortex problem in doubly periodic domains with background vorticity. This joint work with Professor Takashi Sakajo at Kyoto University. So very briefly, I'll just present some motivation. So doubly periodic vortices and lattices are found in a variety of Variety of experimental settings and numerical settings as well. So I've just presented two examples here. We saw various talks on BECs, and I think even this figure was present in one of the talks in the morning. And you can also, so this figure on the left here is from numerical simulations of forced Navier-Stokes equation, where you see the emergence of these coherent vortex structures after. Vortex structures after a long time. So, our aim is not necessarily to explain any particular phenomena, but to just have a general mathematical study of n vortices in a doubly periodic domain with some background vorticity. So, let me provide some background literature on this, what people have been doing. So, So, the first work to consider doubly periodic lattices was by Takachenko, who was inspired by Feynman's and Onsaga's prediction of quantized vortices in superfluid helium. So, he wanted to study rotating vortex lattices, where basically essentially you have a single point vortex in a period window. And because the vortex lattice is rotating, this current. Lattice is rotating. This corresponds to having a quasi-periodic velocity field, and it also requires a special point to be chosen as the origin of coordinates in order to have a rotating lattice. So what Takachenko considered was that the velocity field looks like equation one here, where you have the required point-vortex-like behavior. point vortex like behavior one over z at the origin, which is a special point. And so he considered the Vierstrass zeta function to represent the velocity field because you need a doubly periodic velocity field. But you could also add harmonic sort of functions. So that is represented by this f of z in equation 2. So you can add any regular analytic function. Any regular analytic function f of z to w and the resulting velocity field is what gives rise to the rotating vortex lattice as considered by Takajenko. So the next study is due to O'Neill, who considered instead of a single vortex, n vortices per period window. And also, I must just mention that the circulations of all The circulations of all, I mean, so there's only one vortex, of course. So, the circulations of all the vortexes in this sort of lattice that you get due to Takachenko, these circulations are the same. So, O'Neil considered n vote C's per period window with arbitrary circulations gamma j and the resulting velocity field that you get u minus i v. So you work in the complex plane and And the way he considered constructing this doubly periodic lattice is that you consider n vortices in a window and you sum over all of them and sort of all their images over some lattice, L. But this is not, I mean, it's not the images, but you set some over a lattice and you then take a limit of finite circular limit. Limit of finite circular lattices to get the infinite lattice. So, this is the way he constructed the infinite W periodic lattice. And so, what happens here is that if you want, it turns out, and as O'Neil shows, that if you want your resulting velocity field to actually be doubly periodic, then you have to introduce a rotating frame of reference. A rotating frame of reference whose angular velocity is coupled with the sum of vortex strengths, small gamma. And the velocity field he found is doubly periodic only if the sum of vortex strengths vanishes, basically. And so the next study I'll just describe briefly is due to Stremler and Stremler and RF, who Who again considered the doubly periodic lattice, but with gamma so Stremler considered the doubly periodic lattice with the non-zero background vorticity, which so as I said before, the background vorticity is coupled with the rotating frame of reference, the angular velocity of the rotating frame of reference. So Stremler reinterpreted it as. So, Stremler reinterpreted it as basically a non-zero background vorticity when the sum of strengths does not vanish. But there is still a preferred point, there is an origin of coordinates in this setup. And Stremler and RF, of course, considered the integrable three-vortex problem. We'll have a little bit more to say about this later. But they derived the equations when the sum of strengths vanishes and And solved in detail the integrable three-vortex problem. And the figures that you see here are from Strambler, where you have got a non-zero background, and these are basically the face portraits of the Hamiltonian. Once again, we will see similar pictures later where I will explain what's going on. And so just to end this recap. So, just to end this recap of what people have done before, so Crowdie used a conformal mapping approach to obtain these equations in a rectangular domain. So, the point is that these various people have considered the n-vortex problem in a doubly periodic domain, but typically it involves starting from equations like equation three. You consider n-vortices in the period window, you look at either their images or some sort of a Either their images or some sort of a limit to get the infinite lattice and so on. So instead, what we want to do in our present work is something different. We are going to start by trying to find a formula for the hydrodynamic Green's function. So there are, of course, limitations to this approach, but consider a doubly rectangular domain of Rectangular domain of the form shown here, where the x coordinates are from 0 to 2 pi and the y coordinates are from 0 to minus log rho. Rho is some parameter which is between 0 and 1. So a Green's function that is defined in this domain, it's in the complex plane. So Z, so bars here denote complex conjugates. So the Green's function is a function of two variables, Z and W. Is a function of two variables z and w and it is go uh it is a solution, of course, of this equation here, where the first term is the Dirac delta, and the second term on the right-hand side here is there because of the compact nature of this doubly periodic domain. And the Green's function, the hydrodynamic Green's function, satisfies three properties. The second one is, of course, that it should be. The second one is, of course, that it should be doubly periodic in both the arguments. And then finally, it should satisfy this reciprocity property that is basically it's invariant under if you flip the two arguments Z and W. So the approach we will use is a conformal mapping approach. And this is the conformal map that was basically used by Crowdie. It's a simple map. It just takes from an annulus to your rectangle. Your rectangle. And so we can see now why this rectangle was chosen to be 0 to 2 pi and 0 to minus log rho. So you have got an annulus in some zeta plane with an inner radius rho and an outer radius 1. And so you just consider a logarithmic map which then unfolds this annulus into a rectangle. So you can rewrite everything in terms of these variables in this. Of these variables in this zeta plane, which are zeta and nu corresponding to z and w. And then the well, because of the conformal map, you have to, you know, you'll end up with a modification of the Laplacian. And this is the resulting equation for the Green's function. Two and three are the same properties. They're basically saying that it has got to be doubly periodic in both arguments and it's got to satisfy. Both arguments, and it's got to satisfy the reciprocity property. Okay, so how do we find such a Green's function? So, I'm just going to write down a certain formula, but let me explain first what is the sort of thinking behind this. So, of course, the Green's function contains firstly a logarithmic singularity to account for the delta function. And we can add any harmonic function to this, of course. Into this, of course. But we also need this regular part because of the compact nature of the domain. We have got this term, the area of the domain, which is, of course, 2 pi log rho, or rather minus 2 pi log rho. And so, because of that term, we have got to find a regular term in the Green's function. And so, this g hat is basically the regular part. That is basically the regular part, which is a solution of this equation. So, our claim rests on the use of a certain special function called as the Schottky-Klein prime function. So, this function is defined like this. So, the important thing to note here is that within the annulus, it has got a single zero at zeta equal to one. So, So, if you look now at this formula for the Green's function, it has got three terms. So, the first term is logarithmic singularity as we need require, because this p function will have a zero at zeta equal to nu. So, this gives us the required logarithmic singularity. And there is a harmonic part, but also there is a regular part. also there is a regular part which satisfies the required i mean which has the required behavior uh in order to account for this compact domain and the thing to notice is that everything here the green's function depends only on the ratio zeta over nu in all the terms um and the if i just go If I just go back again, so you look at this conformal map, which is just logarithmic, which means that if in the zeta plane you have got a ratio of variables like zeta over nu, that is basically just like having a difference z minus w in the z plane. So in particular, this means that there is a translation invariance in the physical plane so that g depends only on zeta over nu. So this New. So this Green's function does not depend on any special point. There is no origin that is important here. Okay, so and of course, note that this Green's function is away from the singularity, just to emphasize, it's not harmonic because of this last log square term. Square term. All right, so the connection then with the n-vortex problem is the proceeds just in the usual way. You have got the stream function. So if you have n-vortices with circulations gamma k and with some background vorticity 2 omega, then this is the equation for the stream function psi, and the compactness gives a condition on the background. Gives a condition on the background vorticity, which means that the background vorticity is then coupled to the sum of vortex trends and then the area of the domain as well. And then the velocity field is just obtained from this string function, which itself is just, of course, the superposition of the Green's functions that we just found. So the velocity field becomes going to be given by this formula. So here, this k is So, here this k is also another special function. This is basically just the logarithmic derivative of the prime function p that we saw in the last slide. So, and one thing again to note is that this velocity field is loxodromic, well, which means so this velocity field is doubly periodic, even when the sum of strengths is not zero. So, if the sum of strengths is zero, you notice that the second term drops out. Notice that the second term drops out, and you can have a simplification of the equations. But even if the sum of strengths is not zero, this is constructed in such a way that the velocity field is always doubly periodic. And then further, you can consider the Hamiltonian. This is a Hamiltonian system, and the Hamiltonian is constructed via a standard procedure, which is given, which was given by Lin in. Was given by Lin in these two papers in the 40s. So the formula for the Hamiltonian is basically given by this sort of sum of Green's functions, and then this regular part of the Green's function, which is also, which is also called the Robin function, which is the Green's function of the same variable, basically like g of xx. And it actually turns out. It actually turns out that in our case, this g hat is just a constant and it's not particularly important when you do the actual calculation. So, from this Hamiltonian, you can find the point vortex velocities. And these are the velocities that we get. And once again, you can explicitly check that all of these are have all the required properties. They are doubly periodic and so on. So, notice that these velocities are. So, notice that these velocities are actually the velocities. So, the left-hand side are the velocities of the vortices in the physical plane. These are the wjs. On the right-hand side, we've just got the variables in the zeta plane, but you know, it's just a simple, because it's just a simple logarithmic map, you have to just substitute the inverse in order to get the velocities in the physical plane. Okay, so we can continue on this theme of the So, we can continue on this theme of the Hamiltonian dynamics or the Hamiltonian system, and we can construct two conserved quantities. These are the components of the linear impulse, which we have called Q and P over here. So, now, however, because there is no rotational symmetry in the system, like I have been mentioning, there's a translation where. Is translational invariance, and this means that the angular impulse, which is a conserved quantity, if you consider other point vortex systems, like in the plane or sphere or something like that, then but in this case, you do not have the conservation of angular impulse. And then we can evaluate now the Poisson brackets. So these curly brackets. Poisson brackets. So these curly brackets are the Poisson brackets defined in the usual way but rewritten in complex coordinates. But there's just the usual Poisson brackets. So what you find is that Q, the Poisson brackets of Q and H as well as P and H vanish. However, the Poisson bracket of Q and P is equal to gamma, which is the sum of vortex circulations. So this means that the two vortex circuits are circulation Means that the two-vortex problem in a constant background field is always integrable because you've got these two integrals in involution. Whereas the three-vortex problem is integrable if gamma is equal to zero. So then because you'll have these three integrals in involution. And so if the background vorticity vanishes, then the three-vortex problem is also integrable. Also integrable. This three-vortex problem, of course, I mentioned in one of the first slides, this was solved by in the case, I mean, in the case gamma equal to zero, this was studied in detail by Stremler and RF. Okay, so let's take a quick look at this, also sort of what we can do with these equations. So we can first consider So, we can first consider the two-vortex problem. And so, you can show that when gamma is zero, you can either have translating or stationary equilibria. These are the only possible solutions to the two-vortex problem when the background vorticity vanishes. And when the background vorticity is non-zero, you do not have translating equilibria. You can only Translating equilibria. You can only have stationary equilibria. But of course, there are other possibilities. So, what you see in this plot here is a contour plot of essentially the Hamiltonian. And this is in the physical plane, but also this is as a function of the intervortex distance. So, what you find is that. You so, what you find is that these three blue plus marks are corresponding to the three possible stationary equilibria in this case. So, if the vortex operations are given either by pi or you know pi minus i by 2 log rho or minus half log rho, then they are in stationary equilibrium. For all other cases, you have actually got. Other cases you have actually got some non-trivial motion. So the region gets naturally divided into two parts marked by one and two here. So I've shown some sample trajectories of the vortices in these two regions. So in region one, you have got closed trajectories of the so the red and blue here are the two vortices, the closed trajectories of the two vortices that you can see. Of the two vortices that you can see here. Well, what I mean to say is that they follow the same trajectory, the same closed trajectory. Whereas in region two, you have got the two vortices following different closed trajectories. And however, you can see that they are rotating in the same sense. I mean, in this case, so they're rotating in a clockwise direction in both these cases. In both these cases. This is for a square domain where we have chosen rho to be such that minus log rho is equal to 2 pi. So this is for square domain in the physical space. So if you instead consider a rectangular domain, what you end up is with three regions of the phase space. And of course, you still have just. And of course, you still have just the three stationary equilibria. And these separatrices in red divide them into three regions. And in region one, you have got the same sort of closed single trajectory motion of the two point vortices. In the region three, you also again have the same, not the same shape of trajectories, of course, but the same single sorry, the same. Sorry, the same sort of motion that we had in the square case, where the two vortices move on their own trajectories, closed trajectories. But you also have these regions 2A and 2B. I've shown some sample trajectories here. In region 2, what happens is that you have these open trajectories and you can have an exchange with neighboring cells. And also, the vortices actually move in opposite directions. Opposite directions, as you can see here. Well, 2a and 2b, the difference is only that the direction of the vortices are flipped with respect to each other. So these are the motions that you can have. And we, well, we don't actually say much about the three-vortex problem. Of course, when the background vanishes, this was considered in detail by Stremler and LF, as I mentioned previously. When the background does not vanish, Background does not vanish, it's an interesting problem to try and prove that the motion is actually chaotic. Okay, so then one last thing I want to mention is regarding some stationary equilibria that we can find from the equations we derived earlier. So, these stationary equilibria we can sort of say are coming under three. Say, they are coming under three categories. One is where you have got a sort of staggered fundamental lattice, which is shown by this bold line here. Sorry, the parallelogram that you see. Or you can have them unstaggered. And there's a third category which is with defects, which I will come to in a second. But so the crosses here correspond to point vortices. To point vortices all with circulations plus one. The fields circles here are representing point vortices with circulations minus one. And so you can see that for both the sum of strengths equal to zero and sum of strengths not equal to zero, you can find these sort of equilibrium lattices in this case. So, sort of the third So, sort of the third type that I just mentioned is lattices with defects and with inhomogeneous strengths. So, whereas in the previous case, the previous slide, these vortices all have strength either plus one or minus one. So, in this case, the crosses have strengths plus one, and then the gray sort of hollow circles have circulations minus two. And Um, and these are also stationary equilibria, of course. The it's open whether there are more equilibria with you know more than two species and other different strands and so on. Um, so I'm almost out of time. So, let me uh conclude with a quick summary. So, we have got a non-heuristic Green's function-based approach to point vortex dynamics in doubly periodic domains with or without background vortices. Or without background vorticity. We have described the Hamiltonian structure, conserved quantities, and the two-vortex problem is integrable. And we have a qualitative description of the two-vortex motion, and we have identified several stationary equilibria. One important thing to note is that a drawback is that we do not have rotating equilibria. Well, you know, we don't in general don't have rotating lattices in this formulation. Uh, you know, in this formulation. So, actually, this problem was inspired by some other problem. So, recently, we have some found some exact solutions to the 2D study of Euler equation called Leeuville change, where you have got this is on the plane where we have got a bunch of point vortices embedded in a background vorticity field, which is non-constant, non-zero everywhere, and is. Constant non-zero everywhere and is given by a Levil type PDE. And of course, we are trying to actually extend it to a doubly periodic domain. And so as a so this is like a first step where you consider a constant background vorticity. And so the natural question is what happens if you have a non-constant background vorticity, or more specifically of a levil type. And we can also ask, well, another drawback of this approach is that we only consider rectangular domains where Rectangular domains, whereas, for example, Strembler and RF and later Strembler have considered general domains, parallelograms. And the question is whether you can extend the conformal mapping-based approach like here to a non-rectangular domain. So, both of these questions we are currently investigating. And then, well, so Takeshi actually talked about finite time collapse in various systems and its importance. So, that's one particular question. So, that's one particular question we can also ask. I am not actually aware of anybody who has done any work on finite time collapse in double-periodic domains. So, if somebody knows, please let me know. But this is also an open question. So, okay, I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your time.
