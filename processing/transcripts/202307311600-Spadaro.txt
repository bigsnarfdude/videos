Some results. Okay. I'm going to speak about a project which has been keeping me busy for a few years now, which deals with the impact of topological games on the theory of cardinal functions in topological spaces. Okay, this is a project where A project where several co-authors are joining. Paul Shatiski is one of them, is here. Ljubomir, we also talked about these things with Ljubomir. Angelo Bella, Leandro Ricchi, and the youngest one is my PhD student, Lukas Cuzini de Soza. So let me start with some motivating questions, which are ordered in chronological order, but also in decreasing order of openness. Also, in decreasing order of openness, so to speak. So, the first one is Sussling problem, which asks whether every linearly ordered topological space with a countable chain condition is separable. And we all know this problem is independent of ZFC now. The next problem is a bit less closed, and it's Arkangeski's problem about Lindelof spaces with points G delta. Okay, so if you have a Lindel of Okay, so if you have a Lindelof space where every point is a Judelta set, is it true that such a space is cardinality a MOS continuum? Well, there are various consistent counterexamples by Shella, Gorelich, most recently by Dow, directly from Diamond. But we don't know. I mean, it might be that there is even an example, a counter-example in ZFC. We don't know yet. Final problem is probably the least. Is probably the least known of all of them, but I think it's an interesting problem anyway. And it's by Bell Ginsburg and Woods. And it asks whether every regular Wikilendelof, first cannibal space, has cardinality and mosque continuum. Wikilendeloff means that every open cover has a carnable sub-collection with a dense union. So as you can see, both this problem, both Arkangel's problem and the Bergen-Buker-Woods problem are inspired. Wood's problem are inspired, of course, by Arkangetsky's theorem, which says that every Lindel of space which is first cardable has cardinality and must continue. Okay, so I want to propose a systematic way of tackling this related question, which involves topological games. What kind of games am I talking about? Okay. Okay, well first of all, okay, before getting into games, let me show you some ZFC results which are involved in these problems. Okay, the first one is that every linearly ordered space which satisfies Gnaster condition is separable. So if you strengthen the CCC with the Gnaster condition, meaning every uncarbo collection of open sets has an uncarbo sub-collection which is linked, then Which is linked, then the answer is yes in ZFC. Okay? And here is a positive ZFC result, which regards the second problem. And this is due to Arkangisky and Shapirovsky. If you have a Lindelof space with point G delta, which in addition has carnival tightness, then it has cardinality at most continuum. Carnival tightness means that every point in the closure of a set, for every point in the closure of a set, there is a carnival subset. Of a set, there is a countable subset which accumulates to that point. Okay, and finally, here's a ZFC result regarding the last problem, which is different from the other ones because it suffices to assume a little bit more separation. So from regular to normal, to get a positive answer to the last question. So every normal first countable Wickley Lindelof space has cardinality and most continuum. And must continue. Okay, so like I said before, I want to propose a systematic way of getting partial positive ZFC results about this and related problems, which I think will increase our insight about those problems. And it involves topological games. So I'm talking about selection games, essentially. So we have two families of subsets of X, and we call G Kappa 1AB. The game in Kappa Many Innings, where a rigging alpha. Where at alpha less than kappa, player one chooses an element of the first family, and player two chooses an element B alpha in A alpha, and player two wins if the collection of his choices belongs to the second family. Okay, so A and B could be any families of subsets of X, but if we plug in specific families, then we get different games. Different games. And actually, to get game-therabic strengthenings of those properties, which I showed you before, we just need two kinds of families. The families of all open covers of X and the families of all open collections which have a dense union in X. I'm going to call OD the family of all dense open families with a abusive notation. Okay, so now the CCC game is just Now the CCC game is just the game where you plug in OD for both A and B. Okay, because I mean, if you, so if two has a winning strategy in that game, then the space has the countable chain condition. Because of course, if you had an uncountable family of pairs, disjoint open X, expanded to a maximum one, well, that's a dense open family. The second player is never going to win in omega-many innings because it will never select a dense. You know, a dense subfamily. Okay. And in a similar way, you can prove that that game, which is sometimes called the Rothburger game, implies that X is Lindelof. I mean, if two has a winning strategy in that game, then X is Lindelof. And finally, if you plug in for A the set of all open covers and for B, the set of all dense open families, then you get a game theoretic strengthening of the week. Infinite of the weak Lindov property. Okay. Sorry? I'm sorry. It's always enough that the first one doesn't have wing strategy. Right. Yes, yes, correct. Which is equivalent in many cases to the selection property. S omega 1 or O, for example. That one doesn't have a wing strategy would be equivalent to S omega 1 or O, exactly. Yes. Yes. Okay, so, and here is how we can use this games to provide partial ZFC answers to those questions. Well, the first one, if X is a linearly ordered space such that 2 has a winning strategy in the CCC game, then X is separable. This appears, I mean, the first, the oldest instance of this result that I found was. That I found was in a paper of Daniel Skungen and Zhu from 1994. I mean, it takes some work to prove that they actually proved that, but it's in there, okay? And it also follows from a result which I proved in 2006. It's a corollary to a result of mine. And then, if we do the same thing with the Arkhangelski's problem, so if we have a Lindelof space with point G delta, we're Space with point G delta, where two as a winning strategy in the Rothberger game, and it's sufficient to take the one of length omega one. Oh, sorry, what did I do? How do I go back now? Okay, thank you very much. So if you have a Lindel of if you have a space with points G delta, where two as a winning strategy in the Rothberger game of length omega one, so you don't even need to assume the length that you have accountably many innings, but you can let player two play up to omega one, then the cardinality of x. Then the cardinality of x is a MOS continuum. And note that I'm not assuming any separation axioms in the second theorem. Well, there is one which is Eden. I mean, if you have points G delta, then of course you are T1. But other than that, you don't need Aussie, for example, here. So this is a partial answer not only to the problem I showed you before, but also to another problem of our Kangatsky, which asks whether every Lindelof T1 space, which is Of T1 space, which is first countable, as cardinality administrative continuum. This problem is not as well known as the other one, but I think it's interesting and it's still wide open. Okay, and finally, a result about the third problem. If you have a Eurizon first carbon space where two, as a winning strategy, in the weak Lindelof game of length omega one, then the cardinality of x is a most consistent. Of x is a most continuum. So, I mean, the problem was about regular spaces, but we only need to assume Eurison, which means that distinct points have closed neighbors which separate them. Okay, disjoint closed neighbors, of course. Okay, so let me talk about another problem where this approach turned out to be useful, and that's Arkansas' problem. And that's Arkhangelski's problem on the G-Delta topology, which is another problem which was inspired by that 1969 theorem of his. What is the G-Delta topology? You have any space and you consider a finer topology, which is the one generated by the J Delta subsets of X. This topology is usually very different from the original one. That's a pretty dramatic example. You start from Example, you start from the unit interval, you take the Ge Delta topology, you get a big discrete space. So, in particular, compactness is lost, all the points become isolated, et cetera, et cetera. Compateness actually will never be preserved unless the original space is finite, but the Lindelof property is preserved in some very interesting cases. For example, if you have a Lindelof scattered space, then its G-delta topology is always. Its G-delta topology is always Lindelof. That's a result of Arkangelski. Okay, so what Arkangelski wanted to know how far is the G-delta topology of a compact space from being Lindelof or weakly Lindelof? And to do that, it's a good idea to introduce a cardinal invariant. So call WL of X the weak Lindelof degree, the minimum cardinal such that every open cover of X has a subclass. open cover of x as a sub collection of size no more than kappa, which has a dense union in x. Using this cardinal invariant, we can state Arkaniski's question precisely, which is if you have a compact space, is it true that the Wickland-Loff degree of its G-delta topology is a most continuum? Which is the case for this example, but there might be, of course, a compact space for which this is not true anymore. Anymore and partial positive answers to this question were given by Johas, who proved that this is true for CCC spaces, Fleischmann and Williams, who proved that this is the case for linearly ordered spaces. And Pete Kieff, who proved that this is the case for spaces of countable tightness. And then there's another partial answer by Carson-Porton and Riderboss, which is a bit more technical, so I won't talk about that. So, I won't talk about that. But let me stop for a moment and tell you what is the connection between this problem and Arkangeski's theorem. So, suppose you have a compact first-carnable space. Then its G-delta topology is just a discrete set, a discrete space. And so its width-linder of degree is equal to the cardinality. So if this question had a positive answer, then Arkangesky's theorem will follow as a corollary. And although I will show you this question. And although I will show you this question doesn't have a positive answer, PKF proved that this is true for carnival-tight spaces. So, still we get Arkane-C's theorem as a crawler because every first carnival space is carnivally tight. So, at least partially this worked. Okay, so let me give you some answers to Arkaniski's problem. And the first one involves topological games. So, if you have a carably compact break. So, if you have a carnably compact regular space where 2 is a winning strategy in the Wickland game of length omega 1, then the Wickland-off degree of the G-delta topology is a MOS continuum. So if you add to the assumptions this pretty natural gain theoretic property, you get a bound on the Wick Lindelof degree of the G-delta topology. Unfortunately, or Unfortunately, or fortunately, this question turned out to have a negative answer. And there is a counterexample in this paper of mine with Paul Shatitsky. So there is a compact space where the Wicklandov degree of the genetic topology is bigger than the continuum. And of course, that leaves open a lot of questions, for example, about the structure of such a space. Could it have a, our space, I don't think, have, has a lot of good topic. Has a lot of good topological properties. For example, could it be a homogeneous one that we don't know yet? But of course, there are questions about how far you can push the weak Lindelof degree of the G-delta topology. And that question was answered later by Osuba, only a year later, who proved that omega-1 strongly compact cardinals, which is a large cardinal assumption, provide a precise update. Provide a precise upper bound on the Wick-Lindelf degree of the G-delta topology of compact spaces. So, in a model with no omega-1 strongly compact cardinals, you can push the number as high as you want, basically. Okay, so this is an example of a problem which eventually turned out to have a negative answer, but for which the gain-theoretic approach provided a partial positive result. Okay, and now, of course, you might ask: like, so these results involve topological games. What if I'm not interested in topological games? Do these results tell me anything about mainstream topological properties? Okay, I agree that the use of mainstream is a bit pretentious here because what we do is far from being mainstream, but you get the idea. I mean, non-playful, like. Non-playful like topological properties. Okay, and a thing which is pretty easy to prove is that if you have a CCC space, then two has a winning strategy in the CCC game of length omega one. And that's very easy to see. Let's see if I have some, do I have some choke? I think there was one. Here it is. I found it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So. Yeah, so why in CCC space is player two as a winning strategy in that game? Well, you can build the strategy by transfinite induction. Suppose you have constructed a family of open sets. These are the choices basically of player two in the game, in the CCC game. Okay, remember, a CCC game is the game where player one gives Game is a game where player one gives you a dense open family, player two picks an open set from that family, and player two wins if the set of all its choices is a dense open family. Okay, so suppose that player two picked this open set, a stage alpha, alpha less than omega one. And suppose that along with that, you constructed a family of pairwise disjoint open sets, which is a refinement of the family of choices of player two. Of the family of choices of player two. Okay, so these triangles are, where was this joint refinement of this family of open sets? Okay, so there are two things that can happen. Either the union or this family of open sets is dense in the space, and then we're done because player two won. Okay, player two wants the union to be dense. Or it's not dense. And if it's not dense, there is an open set which misses the union. Is an open set which misses the union. I will draw it as a square. And then at stage alpha, clear one gives you a dense open family. This dense open family is going to intersect the square at some point. Okay, so just let player two play that open set, and then what you got is an extension of your pairwise disjoint open family. So you can't continue up to omega. So, you can't continue up to omega 1 because the space is CCC. So, eventually, you have to stop for some ordinal less than omega 1. So, the strategy is a winning strategy for player two. Okay, so putting together this observation with my game-theoretic partial answer to Arkangas' problem, we get as a corollary UHAS's 722 results, which says that every 722 results, which says that every cannibally compact regular CCC space, the weak Lindelof degree of its G-delta topology, is a MOS continuum. And of course, besides getting a refinement to this, you also get a completely different way of proving it because Johas original proof is an application of the Erdo-Schrado theorem. I mean, that's the most probably. Clear approach to this because I mean you have pairwise disjoint G deltas, you are in a cannibal-compact space, cannibally compact regular space. You can assume that they are closed G deltas. So you can think of a graph where the nodes are this G delta sets. If they are disjoint, then there is a finite sub-families, finite sub-collections, which are disjoint. And then you can color the edges of this graph with omega. This graph with omega-many colors. And if the nodes are more than continuum-many, then the Erdogado theorem tells you that there is an uncountable monochromatic copy of a complete graph, and that's just a family of pairwise disjoint open sets in X, which can't be because X is a CCC space. And you know, this also tells you pretty clearly that you don't need to assume kind of You don't need to assume cannibally compat. You might even as well assume pseudocompat. The same thing works, the same proof works with pseudocompat, although Johas didn't state it in his paper. Okay, so that's why this inspired a project with Lucas, with my PhD student, asked him to, what happens if we replace cannabis compact in that theorem with feebly compact or pseudo, I mean. With feebly compact, or pseudo. I mean, if you don't know what feebly compact is, imagine Tykon of pseudo-compact space. And the thing is, we can do it. So that's the question. I mean, if you have a regular feebly compact space such that two as a winning strategy in the weak Lindelof gain of length omega one, is it true that the weak Lindelf degree of the Judeo topology is a most continuum? We don't know yet, but we can prove that that's the case. We can prove that that's the case if you assume this stronger property, which is the 2, as a winning strategy in the CCC game, which is enough to get you this result as a corollary. So I don't know yet if this game is enough. It's pretty, I mean, my feeling tells me that it should be enough, but maybe there could be some strange pseudocompact space for which this is not true anymore. Okay, we don't know. Okay, we don't know for sure yet. All right. I'm out of for time. I have plenty of time. 25 minutes. You are 25 minutes in. I am 25 minutes in. That's good. I mean, so that's. Okay, so here's another pretty famous result, pretty famous cardinal inequality, which involves the carnival chain condition. Which involves the carnival chain condition. And Shapirovsky's bound, which tells you that if you have a regular space, then the cardinality of x is almost the pi character to the cellularity times the epsilon character. I don't know if you're familiar with these cardinal functions. The cellularity is just the soup of sizes of families of perverse disjoint open sets. The epsilon character is just the minimum kappa such that every point is a G-kappa set. And the pi character Set. And the pi character, well, that's a minimum size of a local pi base. Local pi base means it's like a base, except the open sets don't need to contain the relevant point. So it's a family of open sets such that if a point, if an open set contains X, then there is a member from the local pi base which is contained in that open set, but doesn't need to contain the point. Okay, this is a consequence of. This is a consequence of Shapirovsky's bound on the number of regular open sets and the obvious bound that the cardinality of a space is amongst the weight to the epsilon character. Okay, so that's one of my favorite results about the CCC. So a natural question was to ask whether you can replace the CCC with two as a winning strategy in the CCC game of Len for Medal, which is a weaker. game of length omega one which is a weaker which is a weaker assumption and this turned out to be independent of zfc this again is from joint work with angelo bella and lucas using it as also because i mean the first one is really a triviality so if two to the kappa is equal to two to the kappa plus then um if two as a winning strategy in that game okay the space Game, okay, the space has cellularity kappa plus, and so it follows from uh Chabryvsky's bound that the cardinality is MOS two to the kappa plus, but that's two to the kappa, if if two to the kappa plus equals two to the kappa. So, I mean, at least consistently, the answer to that question would be yes. But on the other hand, we can get from the GCH, we can get for every kappa, we can get a space of pseudo-character most kappa. Of pseudo character most kappa, pi character most two to the kappa, where two as a winning strategy in the cellularity gain of length kappa plus, and yet the size of x is two to the kappa plus, which in this case is bigger than two to the kappa. Okay, so here we need the GCH, actually what we need is that there is an almost disjoint family of size two to the kappa plus on kappa plus. That's precisely what we need for this theorem. Need for this theorem. And then it's a suitable subset of the check strong compatification of a discrete set of size kappa. Okay, and you know, the pretty broad question now is what other theorems about CCC spaces this approach could work? So in which other theorems about CCC spaces can we replace the CCC with a winning strategy for player two in the CCC game? I will give a shot of Mescal. I will give a shot of Mescal to whoever gives me a good recommendation about new results to which to apply this approach. Okay, and here is, the title of this slide is the same as the one before, except I put a question mark there because I don't know yet if this will work. So there's a pretty natural question which is left open by one of the results I showed you before. Before, and is if you have a first countable weekly Lindelof regular space, is it two that two as a winning strategy in the weekly Lindelof game of length omega one? So, if that was the case, then Bergwood's question would have a positive answer just as a corollary to our gain theoretic result. Okay, the point is, and note that this is, I'm not saying anything too artificial because under CH, the two questions are. Under CH, the two questions are actually equivalent because, of course, if you have size and most continuum, under CH, you have size omega one and most omega one. So player two has an obvious winning strategy. Okay, so under CH, these two questions are equivalent. Of course, if this worked, then we would get a positive answer to the original question. And it turned out that this question was open, even without the first countability assumption. The first accountability assumption. And we were able to find even a compact space where player one has a winning strategy in the weak Lindelof game of size omega one. So it's compact, then in particular it's weakly Lindelof. Unfortunately, this space is not first parable, but it's an interesting example. And it's just, you know, 2 omega 2 with the lexicographic order topology. Let me try to sketch you. To sketch you what the winning strategy is here. Let me erase the board there. So the point is that this space, so if you take 2D omega 2 with a lexicographic order topology, then you have a compact almost P omega 2 space. What does P omega 2, almost P omega 2 space mean? To almost p omega2 space mean that a g omega one sets, so intersection of omega one many open sets have non-empty interior. So that's the point. And this takes some work to prove. But once you have that, there is a pretty clear wing strategy for player one, and it's this one. Okay, using the fact that it's almost p omega two space, you can construct a canter tree of closed sets. Of closed sets with non-empty interior in your space, which has height omega one. Okay, let me call f sigma an element of that tree. Okay, just, you know, it's clear how to do it. We're in a compact space, and every g omega one set has an unempty interior, so you can do that. Now, if you take the complements. If you take the complements of this, so I mean, so if you take two nodes, the immediate successor of this node, and these two nodes are disjoint, okay? Now, if you take the complements of these closed sets, let me give a name to those. Let me call them U sigma. Okay, so U sigma is just a complement of F sigma. Of f sigma. Now this time these two nodes form an open cover. Okay, so if these two were disjoint, then this two will be an open cover. Okay, so here's the strategy. Okay, at the first inning, player one has to play an open cover, so I will play just this open cover. Okay, then player two will choose an open set out of these two. choose an open set out of these two for example say that it chooses this one and if player one chooses that one then player two uh sorry if player two chooses this one then player one will choose this open cover okay and then player two will choose an open set here and then so on and so forth okay so uh now let f be the function from omega one to two which codes the choices of player two Codes the choices of player two. Okay, so what is the union of the choices of player two? The union of the choices of player two is the open set UF, which is the complement of FF. But FF has gone empty interior. And so that union is not dense. Okay, so there is no way that player No way that player two can win if player one makes these choices, so yeah. Uh, what you know, uh, what's annoying is that this is not first countable. And I, well, maybe it's not that annoying because there's still a chance for, you know, this approach to work and give you a complete answer to the question that I showed you at the beginning. All right. Okay, so now I'd like to give you a proof. I think I have. Proof. I think I have enough time. It's not going to be a long proof. I picked, you know, the easiest results of all so that I could give you an idea of how we prove this result without annoying you too much with the technical details. Okay, so this is the theorem which has the Sussling corollary. I mean, the partial GFC answer to Sussling problem is a corollary. Okay, suppose you have a space. Here I need a regular space. Here, I need a regular space. Suppose you have a regular space with the dense set points of pi-character and most of small pi-character, okay, such that two as a winning strategy in the CCC game of length kappa, the cellularity game of length kappa, then the pi weight is a most two to less than kappa. The pi weight is small, and that as a consequence, the theorem I showed you before, actually, you don't need compat. You before actually, you don't need compat here because I mean, if you have a dense continuous linear order, then you have a dense set of points of countable pi character, essentially. And you can assume that here you have, you know, a complete linear order because you otherwise take the data game completion. These games work well when you pass to a dense set, you know, everything is preserved. And so, I mean, you. And so, I mean, you can assume that the order is complete. Okay, so this theorem, I can prove it by combining the idea of game duality with a closing off argument, essentially. So the first idea which we use is just translating these games to some more convenient ones. For example, this game that I call GOO Kappa and that Daniel's Kuwait. Daniel's Kuen and Ju called the open-open game. It's a game in Kappa Many innings where, at inning alpha, player one picks an unempty open set containing X. Player two chooses an empty open set containing V alpha. And this time, player one wins if and only if the set of all choices of player two has a dense union in X. Okay? So this game is equivalent to Equivalent to the cellularity game, or I should say to be more precise, that these games are dual. So, what this means is that one player has a winning strategy in one game if and only if the other player has a winning strategy in the other game. Okay, because in the first game, two wants to choose a family with a dense union. This time, it's one who wants to, player two to choose a family. To player two to choose a family of open sets with a dense union. Okay, uh, this is basically Galvin. Uh, I mean, uh, the proof strongly uses ideas of Galvin. And actually, for the cardinal bound, we don't need to prove the full duality. We just need to prove that if two has a winning strategy in this game, then one has a winning strategy in the open-open game. And actually, let me show you the proof of this. It's it's uh quite. Of this, it's quite easy. So, suppose you have a winning strategy for player two in the cellularity game. Okay, so the main claim which will allows us to translate this winning strategy into one for player one in the open open game is that if I have a sequence of elements of OD, a sequence of dense open families, then I can find an empty open set such that Non-empty open set such that for every non-empty open subset of V, I can find a dense open family such that the value of the strategy on this sequence with U attached at the end is the open set U. So basically, I can find. Yes, bet is less than kappa. Yeah. So the point, so I can find an open set such that every non-empty open subset of it can be reached by means of the strategy by a pseudo. By means of the strategy, by a suitable, you know, dense open family. And that's very easy to prove because, I mean, if you call O, for example, script O, the set of all open sets which cannot be approached in this way, then O is not a dense open family. It can't be, because otherwise it could be approached. And so there is a V which is disjoint from its union. But then that V works, because every open subset of V can be reached by means of the strategy. Reached by means of the strategy. Okay, so once you have that, you're basically done. Because how do you define the strategy? Well, let V0 be an open set which satisfies the claim for the empty sequence, and let just player one play that open set in the first inning. Now, suppose you have open set U alpha, alpha less than beta. These are the choices of player two. And because of how we constructed this thing, there's going to be a sequence of Going to be a sequence of dense open families with the property that uα is just the value of the strategy on the initial segment of type alpha of this sequence. Okay, now choose an open set V beta which satisfies the claim for this sequence and define the strategy. So player two, player, sorry, player one is going to answer, is going to reply to this sequence of choices of player two with the open set V beta. Okay. Open set V beta. Okay, and then any choice of player one, of player two, any choice u beta of player two can be approached in this way using the strategy sigma. So this is a winning strategy for player one in the open open game simply because the union of the choices of player two will be dense simply because sigma is a winning strategy for player two in the cellularity game. Okay, so we translated one strategy for one game. One strategy for one game in a strategy for the other player in the other game. Okay, and now everything comes down to a closing of argument. So fix a dense set of points of small pi character. Let M be a, let's take a closed dimension, it's a model of a large enough fraction of the universe, which contains everything that we need, including the strategy for player one in the open open game. The open open game and the dense set of points of small pi character with size two to less than kappa. Okay, so to prove this theorem, we just need to prove that d intercept m is dense in x with the relative topology. Okay, because I mean every point there will have small pi character. There is a small number of points. So fix a pi base, a small pi base for each one of these points, put them all together. For each one of these points, put them all together, and you get a global pi base, a global small pi base for the whole space. Okay, so that's all we need to prove. That's just like in every elementary submodel proof. I mean, it's pretty clear what to do. It's just, you know, sometimes the details are complicated, but that's not the case. I mean, this one, as I told you, is the easiest of them all. Okay, so suppose this is not true, then there is an open set. We're assuming the space to be regular. An open set, we're assuming the space to be regular, although I didn't write it. There is an open set whose closure misses the intercept M. Okay, obvious observation. The intercept M might not be dense in X with the relative topology, but it's certainly dense in X with the topology, with the coarser topology, which is generated by the M open set. And that's the observation which will allow us to use the game. So we now play. Use to use the game. So we now play a play of the open-open game of length kappa, where player one always plays according to lambda. And remember that lambda is in M. So as long as, you know, you don't have, as long as you're not going beyond kappa, everything will be in M. And that's the thing that makes everything work. Okay, so the first play of player one, the first open set which player one will play. The first open set which player one will play is an open set in M, so it intersects D intercept M. So take a point there, take a small local pi base for that point. That small local pipe base is actually going to be contained in M. And so player two can pick an open set in M, which is contained in Lambda of the MP set. So it's an allowed move by the open open game. By the open open game, and which misses G. Okay. And then basically, what you do is you continue doing this up to kappa. So basically, and at the end, what you have, you have a sequence of open sets, which they all miss G, okay? But since Lambda is a winning strategy for player one, the union of this open sets will have to be dense in X. Okay, so you get a contradiction. The contradiction comes from. Contradiction: The contradiction comes from assuming that X in the set M was not dense in X, and so it is, and so you know, the theorem is proved. Okay, good. So I have just one last slide, so I assume I'm not running out of time. Okay. On this last slide. No, I'm not. Now, the last slide is just to give you what I think is an interesting problem and about which. Problem and about which I know very little. So some of you might be wondering: what if in those games I allow player two to pick finally many sets instead of just one set? So this game is just like the weekly of game, oops, except no, this time I can do it on my own. Okay. Okay. So, what if I allow player two to pick finally many open sets? Okay, this is a weaker assumption. And I don't know if it's enough. By the way, I'm assuming the space to be regular. Okay, so although I didn't say it. Okay, so let me, there is only one of those instances where this approach, we know it works. Where this approach we know it works. And it's the theorem, you know, about the Lindelf spaces with points G delta. So, if in that theorem, if in the Toleskipper's theorem, we replace basically the Rothberger game with the Menger game, then we know that it works. And the reason why it works is that basically we can reduce it to the Rothberger game just by changing the. Burger game just by changing the covers. So if instead of taking all covers, we just take the K covers. K covers means that every compat set is covered, not just the points are covered. Okay. Then it can be proved that these two games are equivalent. So the Menger game of Lamph Omega 1 is equivalent to the Rothberger game, but where the first family is not the set of all open covers. Family is not the setable open covers, but just the settleable K covers. Okay, so these two games are equivalent. And then by a Gauding style approach, it can be proved that this game is dual with a compact open game of length omega one, where the compact open game is like the point open game, except you have compact sets instead of points. Okay, so I mean, we are, you know, using basically the same approach with compact sets instead of points. And, you know, using this approach. Points. And, you know, using this approach, Aurike Mbella proved that if x is a space with point G delta where two as a winning strategy in the Banger game of length omega one, then the cardinality of the space is a most continuum. Okay, the point is we don't know whether those two games are equivalent. So whether the WIC manger game is equivalent to this version of the WIC manger game. To this version of the WikiManger game with K covers instead of usual covers. And of course, if that will be the case, then we will be able to give a positive answer to this question. And we also have other partial answers where we make some technical assumptions about the strategy and then we are able to get a positive answer. But so far, we don't have a full answer to this question. And basically, you can. Question. And basically, you can do the same thing for all other theorems that I showed you: replace the Rothberger game with the Menger game. Most of the time, we don't know what happens. And now I'd just like to thank you and to give you just a very partial bibliography regarding this result. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for a nice talk. We have plenty of time for questions. Is there any Is there any question or comments? Player one of the winning strategy. I don't know, but I don't think it will be enough. I don't think it would be enough. Be enough. Off the top of my head, I don't have a counter example, but make a linear
