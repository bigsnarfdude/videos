Okay, so first of all, I probably should define what a cat minus one space is. So a cat minus one space, unfortunately, it does not have anything to do with cats. And if it did, you know, actually, fortunately, because I wouldn't want to have negative them, obviously. So this is. So, this is X with a metric. It's just a metric space such that, first of all, any two points can be joined by a geodesic. And when I say geodesic in a metric sort of order, I'm talking about global isomer. Talking about global isometry. So it can be connected by some alpha from an interval through x, whereas alpha of zero equals x, alpha of t equals y or something. And let's just say that it's an isometry. And so notice I'm saying global, so cat minus one, you want to think of this as a universal cover of something. And if you notice in my talk, I say locally cat minus one. So this is going to be the quotient of x by some group that we get to that point. Right. So the second thing, so this is the important thing. So this is just sort of, well, we have geodesics. So if I take any three points, so it's a thin triangles condition. So it's a thin triangles condition. So I can draw geodesics between them. At this stage, I don't know that they're unique, but they're there. And let's say I sort of mark the lengths here. So all of these sides satisfy certain inequalities that tell you that there is a so-called comparison triangle. And I'll try to draw it a little fatter. Fatter inside of H2 such that these distances are all the same. And I'll call the comparison points with the same letters, but with the bar. And so there's an obvious sort of just isometry at the outside of this triangle. There's no really interior here over 2H2. Over to H2 just by taking these geodesics and just mapping them lengthwise over there. And so that gets me for any point P, any point Q, comparison points, P bar and Q bar. And then the cap minus one condition is that the distance between P and Q has to be less than or equal to the distance between P bar and Q bar. Distance between P bar and key bar. So this tells us that everything inside of a cat minus one space is going to be at least as thin as constant negative curvature, negative one. So that's the negative one there. It's the fact that H2 has negative one curvature. And okay, so this has a lot of consequences. So, first of all, you can So, first of all, you can kind of imagine that if you're allowed to compare with degenerate triangles, you can even already conclude that they're a unique geodesics. Next to one. And then also, so sort of the thing that you expect to, oh yeah, let's say another few things. Oh, yeah, let's say another few things. So, also, X is simply connected. That is settled. So, like I said, think of this as a universal cover. You also have convexity of the metric. So, yeah, given two geodesics. And, you know, I think I'm going to switch over to C's. I like alpha. To C's. I like alpha for some reasons, but I am going to start switching to C's when I actually use the notation in our paper accidentally, so I might as well do it now. So given two gene essence, C and C prime, then this function is actually a convex function of t. See, and then we also know that, so sort of the thing that you expect to happen for Riemannian manifolds is that this really is a curvature upper bound by negative one. So if x happens to be a simply connected Riemannian, then that means that. means that that minus one condition is actually equivalent to all the sectional curvatures being bounded above by negative one just call those kappas so for manifolds we really get the same stuff so this is not anything new for manifolds but the thing is that well some things can happen when you're outside of the manifold case You're outside of the manifold case. So I say here that there's a unique geodesic from any point to any other point, but that does not tell you that there are unique geodesics extending. So yeah, let me actually, first of all, make a few assumptions. So before I start talking about that, so just a small blurb. So we need X to be proper. Proper so metric balls are compact or pre-compact, whatever you want, and then geodesically complete. So, yeah, X for any X and Y, there exists a full two-sided G essay. Full two-sided green essay with X and Y inside the image. So, and yeah, this is actually not equivalent to the metric being complete in general because you can imagine like a boundary or something. In the manifold case, you don't necessarily want to have that. But yeah, so we really require that you can extend it for all time. That is kind of a It for all time that is kind of a stringent thing, okay? And yeah, so there exist extensions, and the thing is that there don't have to be unique extensions. So you can sort of just go from X to Y, and then there's sort of just this. And then there's sort of just this unique C depending on this X and Y, which extends that. So the thing is, you can actually, so I told you that there's a neat geodesic in between X and Y, but going beyond that, you usually have lots of choices. And sort of the example to consider is a tree. Is a tree. So, an infinite tree with no leaves, you want to say probably finite valence everywhere. It's even okay if it's unbounded valence. So, in that case, I mean, of course, you have branching. I tell you an edge, I have no idea how to beat that inside of geodesic without making a lot of choices. Okay, so. Okay, so if that's the case, then how do we define the genesic flow? So normally we define that locally. If it's a Riemannian space, so I have to say. But or a cat minus one space, you actually have to take into account all that info. And that's something that Ben was talking about with cat zero spaces, or I guess these translation services. Translation services. So, sort of the same phenomenon of branching can occur for any cat that you want. So, how do we define the geodesic flow? So I'm going to call gx the collection of all bi-infinite isometries. Now, in the case that Now, in the case that X is a manifold, then if we go C to C dot of zero, this is an isomorphism between G and B1M. But in general, you don't have anything like that. So you can't just describe the GS. Just describe the g d's like just at zero or something, the direction that it's going. So, you really have to have this full space here, and then once you have it described like that, I mean, the flow is actually, it seems kind of stupid. So, I'm going to define flow like this. So, g t of c, if I apply that to s, that's That's meant to be C of S plus T. So, notice that there is a distinguished base point because I'm not saying I'm identifying all of these isometries if they have the same image. So, the geodesic flow is just flowing that base point along. Right, and I should also give you a metric. So, this gx is also metric space using a natural metric dgx of C C prime defined to be the integral of the distance. This is from negative infinity to infinity between c of t c of c prime of t times e to the minus two absolute value t. Minus two absent value. The two there is just to make it so that this is unit speed. So if you actually compute that, when you'll just have sort of time changing, it's easy to draw that you fix. This is equal to that time change. Time shift. All right. And then, so we also need to introduce something. We also need to introduce something that actually causes recurrence to happen because gx as it is, well, x is simply connected, everything just kind of runs off to something called the boundary, which I'll talk about in a second. So, first of all, I want to have something acting on this. So, this is going to be all I'm going to require here is discrete and then also non-elementary. All non-elementary means is that it's. All non-elementary means is that it's not, it doesn't have z as a finite index subgroup. Spell y. So it's not virtually cyclic. And in particular, it is allowed to have torsion. So if you're thinking of this as a fundamental group and don't think about torsion. Don't think about torsion. Please actually just don't think about torsion with no quantifier on that. So let's just say it doesn't have torsion, but it works for torsion. And that was actually one of the insights of Hollypot Holly Piero. Okay, so right, so I'm going to let x0 be X0 be quotient and then gx0 is the quotient like this. Notice that if I'm an isometry, then I send a geodesic to geodesic. So this does induce an action on gx. And if you don't have torsion, then I can also describe this as the set of all c from r. C from R into X naught such that C is a local isometry. It's weirder, you have to talk about lifts of things, and it's really best to. This definition is really what you want to think of it as. It's just the notion of GX, by again. X by again. All right, and yeah, so we also have some metrics here. So I can do dx naught, xy. This is going to be the minimum over a and gamma distance between a x tilde y tilde, where x tilde, y tilde already exists. And then similarly for d sub D sub GX naught. All right, so this is sort of our flow now, and we have a metric on it, so we could start asking our dynamical questions at this point. But yeah, actually, when we do that, now that I sort of have all this set up, let me give you some examples. So it's quite a broad class of things. So, I mean, of course. So, I mean, of course, you have any manifold of negative curvature. Technically, less than or equal to negative one, I should say pinched below zero, but no lower bounds, though. So I guess I shouldn't say pinched, but gamma equals 0.1. So this is sort of your prototypical example. And then this. Your prototypical example, and then this gx naught is going to be your actual flow on that manifold downstairs. You can also have x be a tree, I've already said that, and then gamma just has to be some kind of a graph, nice morphism. I guess it also has to preserve weights of things. Is it should say metric tree? Let's see, and then we'll. Let's see. And then you've also got lots of gluing constructions. So, for example, I can just attach a loop if I want to a surface or a manifold. I can attach five loops wherever I want. Maybe another interesting example would be to take, let's see, I'll say that this is X naught, and then the universal cover will be my count minus one space. So this can be, let's say, I take two hyperbolic surfaces. Let's say I take two hyperbolic surfaces, but maybe they're a little different, but I've sort of identified the geodesic from each of them that has the same length, closed geodesic. And I can sort of just union them together and then glue the geodesic. The geodesic or those two close geodesics together, and it gets me this kind of strange space. Now, I want to say that if I glue two metric spaces together and I hit the place where it's glued, then I'm actually allowed to go in any direction that I would like into the new space. So that's actually how the metric is defined. So if I hit this thing, then whatever the corresponding point is I was using for the gluing, As I was using for the gluing, I can go in any direction. You think of it as being sort of glued perpendicularly, so no direction is preferred anywhere. Yeah, at the level of the space. And then you don't want to think about tangent spaces once you do this because, like I was saying, so you have lots of directions. Right, so it's very general. That's why it's very interesting to try to study this and see how much. Try to study this and see how much actually generalizes. Right, so now we kind of have to go into more of the meat of this and start defining some of the geometric objects that are associated. So let's start with the boundary. So actually, I'm going to say, yeah, let's start with that. Yeah. So the boundary of x is going to be so. Is going to be so there you could you could give this in a lot of ways, but here's one way of doing it. So I can make gx and then mod out this equivalence relation. I could either do it this way or I could do it this way. And I'll tell you what both of these are. So C and C prime are stably equivalent if If let's see, the distance between C and T C prime and t is bounded for t bigger than or equal to zero. And I can do the same thing on the other end if I want. And this gives me two identical definitions of boundary backs, and the reason that they're identical is because. reason that they're identical is because I have a natural flip map of gx sending c of t to c of negative t. So these are identical definitions. And these also give me natural maps Bx to boundary X and then another one for the second. So the first one So, the first one, I would be taking C to its point at positive infinity. So, I think of it somehow as the limiting behavior of that geodesic up in universal cover. And then this one is the minus infinity. So now let's talk about the structure of GX. So, we have these natural projections, but I'll tell you something that isn't natural, but. That isn't natural, but can be always chosen. So you might think that, well, if I know where geodesic is coming from and where a geodesic is heading to, and I know that all the way out at infinity, there's no non-uniqueness between things, right? So once I've specified past and future, then I'm good. And up to that, after that, then all I have is a time direction. And yes, so we have this. You can think of this as just boundary x cross boundary x. Now, you have to take away the diagonal. And then I have an r factor. So this is a little non-trivial because I have to know that between any two of these points that aren't the same, there is a geodesic connecting them. But this is true for cat minus one spaces. And you can obviously see that you can't have a geodesic coming back. That you can't have a geodesic coming back because that would mean that it's bounded in future and past time, and there's no way that it could be a geodesic that way. So, right, so we have this, but this is actually not canonical, though. There are a lot of ways of doing this. For example, I can make it so that my unstable manifolds. My unstable manifolds, which I guess I haven't said what those are, but would expect them to be. I can make them the level sets, you know, with, I guess, with this one, and then sort of a fixed factor here and here. I can make the unstables be like that, but then I couldn't have my stables do that because then stables and unstables would be jointly ineffable. But I could do that with the stables, then, but then the unstables go and have non-trivial times. Trivial times. So, yeah, this is very not canonical, but you can think of it like this. And you can use this to give measures. So there's actually a one-to-one correspondence between Yama invariant measures. Gamma invariant measures and then and also I'm going to call this here boundary squared x so it's not boundary x times boundary x we also take away the diet so again gimme in narrative measures on boundary squared x these are called currents this is in perfect correspondence with um with yeah so i guess Yeah, so I guess gamma cross armor invariant measures. X, let's say. And of course, the gamma cross R invariant measure on GX, if I question out that gamma, I get an actual flow invariant measure on the flow I want to study. And the correspondence is just like this. So you take some new and And let's say so d new of, yeah, say c negative infinity c infinity is equal to, yeah, dt is equal to dm of fc. But this is your horse models. Okay, so So, yeah, and let's also talk a little bit about the fact that you actually have nice metric inisov structures. So, I want to define unstable sets, stable sets. Maybe before I do that, so before I do that, let's define something called a Boozman function. Ah, yeah, actually, before Ah, yeah, actually, before I do that, I should tell you that there's also this space. And this is a compact space. So this boundary of x actually gives you a nice compactification of your cat minus one space. Right, so let me define a Buzzan function. function so if i give you two points x and y and x also c in the boundary then i'm going to define this to be the limit as z goes towards c of distance x z minus distance y z. So, sort of if I picture Sort of if I picture, I have this point out here like C, I have an X and a Y. And somehow, as I let Z go out toward C, I'm measuring how much of a time difference is there getting toward C. So this is telling me stuff about force here. So you can still define all of these things, the Bougeon functions, the Lipschitz, all of that. So, you can use this to give yourself a nice characterization of the unstable stable sets. So, I can go ahead and write a few of those down at least. So, this is going to be collection of C prime such that they have the same backward endpoint, but they They are also synced up with respect to that endpoint. So if I plug in their base points as x and y there, which is their backward endpoint, then this is actually a statement equal to zero. And you can do that similarly for WSS. Okay. So yeah, the other thing is, yeah, this is a metric. Yeah, this is a metric and a soft flow, so you can use the cat minus one inequality, for example, to show that g minus tc prime, it's actually going to be less than or equal to c to the ah yeah, see, I'm going to just put an absolute value, c times e to the negative absolute value t. I actually don't even need to put a constant here because of the minus one and cat minus one. Because of the minus one and cat minus one. So, yeah, we can also do this. Yeah, and this is if C runs in same unstable, strong unstable. Right, and I should probably also tell you how I'm notating weak, unstable, weak, stable. So, there are, of course, the definitions of those. Okay, so the flow is symmetric and soft. Metric and a solve are both going backward. Yeah, those are both negative t. I'm not sure. That's are you. Yeah, yeah, and of course, t is going to pause in today here. Yeah. Yes. What is the topology on xy? So it's called the cone topology. So it can kind of define bases of open. Basis of open sets around boundary points as sort of all of the geodesics which stay close to maybe representative geodesic going there for a certain amount of time. And then as you increase that amount of time, then these basis sets are going smaller and smaller. And that tells you how things work. I can say a lot of these things in terms of a groma product and give you an actual metric, but I'm not going to do that. I know I was this wasn't I it's me so okay so with this sort of observation so again so yeah it also has a local product structure issues and so let's talk about what's known so that I guess I should About what's known. So, I guess I should actually start with the goal. I think I've said that: study thermodynamic formalism on this GX knot. So, let's talk about some things that are known. Right, so the first thing that's actually sort of to do with considering potentials here that did it sort of concretely, I'll start with anyway, because I'm not a very concrete person, so I just want to get this stuff out of the way. It was in 2020. So they considered the compact case, also torsion-free. And they obtained a weak specification property. And this was enough for a unique equilibrium state using the Plemman-Haga-Thompson machinery. So they kind of threw it back to that. They knew that they. So they kind of threw it back to that. They knew that they had this weak specification, and you actually get that from some gromo-hyperbolic considerations somehow. You use something I think nowadays is called the CAN encoding to tell yourself that there's some kind of symbolic system telling you things. So they say, okay, weak specification. They do a lot of applications. But this particular unique MME or Bone. Unique MME or Bowen Sorry, ES And then there's also a sort of follow-up to that. I think it was the same year. So I'll call it 20.5. And they were actually able to show that there is something called a strong Markov coding, which wasn't very clear, even though there's a wonderful paper by Mark telling you that you do get a coding of metric anaselle things. But you need to know that this coding is actually a folder and stuff to actually give yourself some information. Right, so there is a strong Markov coding, and this gives you all sorts of And this gives you all sorts of access to, I mean, Bernoulli property, analyticity of pressure, things like that. There's a strong analyticity for holder functions. Okay, so right, yeah, and I should have said, yeah, this one, I think you threw in that. Yeah, so you can do compact scope and back. There's no way of There's no way of, I mean, countable states, like you know, who knows? So, okay, so you kind of have no access to going beyond with this just discrete and non-elementary situation. But okay, so that's a great connection for me to go into what was done on that. So there's this beautiful book by Paulin. A beautiful book by Colin Paulashapira. You know, actually, before that, let me start with Osola. So this is relevant. This was 2004. So in this case, you have X equals M pinched negative curvature. Negative curvature. And apparently, their argument actually, even though they didn't state this, only works for bounded derivatives of curvature because they actually kind of use folder continuity of stable, unstable distributions to construct a certain partition. This was sort of realized later, I think, by the PPS crowd. So they meet this condition as well. But what they're able to show, so first of all, there's a construction already of this measure, Bowen-Margulis measure, which I'll call M sub B M. This is given by a Patterson-Sullivan construction. So this is, now we're entering territory. Is now we're now we're entering territory that the talk is meant to be on. So, Patterson Sullivan. So, the statement is that if this measure is finite, it's a unique MME. And if it's infinite, we actually get information as well. Infinite, you actually get information as well, you know that there is none. So infinite, then none. And this is really just MME. So zero potential. And so this is your usual Patterson-Sullivan construction. Most papers, if you've read them that had a Patterson-Sullivan construction in it, this is the same as that using the metric of the manifold. But we can generalize that. So, if you want, you can do the same thing with potentials, and that was what was accomplished by this Holland Polykashapira. So it was shown that Shown that yeah, so now we have this potential. It's the first time I've written a bi now. So if you have something now, I'm going to define it on the universal cover. There's some weird things about holder continuity downstairs versus upstairs because it's non-discrete and there's no lower bounded injectivity. But so let's say that we have one of these and it's also Yamma invariant. Yamma invariant and it's folder continuous in in a sort of unbounded way. So it's you want adjectives that might help uniformly locally, but you want to think of this as just being, well, this is holder continuity, but for unbounded potentials. It's not really local holder continuity in all of Local polar continuity in all of its generality. It's just, well, you have all the same constants everywhere. It's just that, like, the alpha, you may not want that to be the growth rate as you go far away of your function. You may want it to grow linearly or something. So that sort of you allow like sort of lip shits on course scales. And that's all this is. But it can be unbounded. That's kind of the interesting thing, especially for non-compact. That's sort of what you want to start doing. To start doing, and you have the same results. So, there exists, first of all, a construction that completely mimics the Patterson-Sullivan construction, but you just add in a bunch of weights. So, I'll call it M sub phi, again given by Patterson-Sullivan. So, which if finite is Is unique M of E, sorry, ES now. And then, of course, infinitely none. And so this is sort of the state of the art on that sort of thing. Right, I am forgetting about one thing, though. So out of your balance. I hope I'm not mispronouncing this first thing. Is it was? Things that was or Roy's, but um Roy's is was thank you, thank you, thank you also Colin, also Parkinen. Let's see what year was that. That was 19. So they did do a construction with lakes. Do a construction with weights for cat minus one spaces, but assuming certain properties that they couldn't show except for in a very restricted setting. But what they were able to do, though, is take X to be just in terms of their equilibrium state results. It's a very long book. They have so many interesting applications of all of this, but it really all kind of boils down to trees. Down to trees. So x is a tree. Let's see. And also, you need your potential phi to only depend, in a sense, you only care about it on the edges. And then the statement is that if finite, then it's unique equilibrium state. They don't have. unique equilibrium state they don't have i don't think they have the infinite then not if finite then unique equilibrium state so the construction is the same but the way that they prove it is actually using symbolic dynamics and with respect to the symbolic dynamics i mean you can imagine a tree being like the geogasic flow of that being sort of a suspension of that so these potential functions are really just locally constant functions on the base so these are really all they're kind of able to do that Are really all they're kind of able to do that for. And so it's hard. Actually, cat minus one has created some problems because of the restrictive assumptions that you need. So to actually do it, they have this property HC. And this is actually, it just ends up being somewhat of a difficult property to obtain. And for me, it's completely outside of what I think. Completely outside of what I feel like is the most natural thing to do here. But so, yeah, let's talk about what Dan and I have. So, this is joint work with Dan Thompson. Because I just want to point this comment about the existing people. So, the first one is the other hand. You know, I'm the guy called the surname. He's related. And I think for the second person these things. I think it could second for us in these things and I was okay. Okay, I'll try to it'll probably become pooling at some point the conference but we're unable to VM. That's for the best, yeah. All right, so All right, so here's our results. So, first of all, how do I want to phrase this? Okay, so suppose I going to from gx to r is okay, so we do need a bounded assumption for this to work. need a bounded assumption for this to work. It's sort of unnatural because we need, or to have unbounded, because we need a uniform Boeing property. But we don't require any conditions like over here. There's also another one that I'm not telling you about because I'd have to explain it. Pulled tempered by some authors. But we don't require that here. It's just, it's a natural condition here, which is It's a natural condition here, which is only stated in terms of the dynamics on GX, whereas sort of these conditions over here don't really have analogs to dynamical systems outside of specifically like G-Vesic flows. But this is a very natural condition to impose, of course. So we have by, and then, right, so there, first of all, there exists a Gibbs measure. And I should also say that these over here, they prove the Gibbs property. There exists a Gibbs measure m phi, of course, given by Patterson-Sullivan. It has local product structure. This is all stuff that they, and that's just a consequence of the construction, actually. And the statement is: so if this m sub phi is finite, then it's a ergodic equilibrium state. So I haven't said uniqueness though, can't do uniqueness yet for this generality. But this is already starting to get somewhere. I had an intuition on how to do uniqueness, but it fell through at the last moment, unfortunately. But we saved it because we, in some sense, because we have some conditions for uniqueness. So if, and I don't want to say them because they're hard to say. So, but if bias. If phi is satisfy some stronger properties, then you get uniqueness finite. And yeah, another thing we also have kind of not touched is the infinite case. So we have to sort of be careful about showing that the pressure itself. About showing that the pressure is equal to critical exponent when you don't have that proof just sort of coming from the equilibrium state. Right. Okay. So in any of these settings, do you have any conditions to determine whether it is finite or not? Yeah, there are definitely conditions, and I don't really know what most of them are, but I think there's a page. Most of them are, but I think there's a paper by Anipol already. You have some conditions. Is it it's not with weights? It's not with weights, it's for the yeah, but yeah, you can talk here today. Yeah, well, very easy to positive condition. So that's all done all unweighted case. Yeah, I'm not in fact very sure. Okay, so let's see what so let me let me sort of say what the two things that we've done are. Two things that we don't. So, first of all, if you recall with what I just erased with the Tel Pennier, there are these conditions. It has to be pinched negative curvature. And they're also the same over here. I forgot to write that, but pinch negative curvature bounded derivatives of curvature. You need all of that to guarantee this regularity that lets you construct a certain partition. The argument of which you can find that, that you can get this is in the Sautal Pennier paper. In the Sautal Penier paper. But so, sort of the first thing that we had to, well, I guess what I'm getting to you first, and maybe not chronologically. So we actually were able to get enough regularity to construct this Hutalpenier partition for cat minus one. And that includes curvature unbounded below. Of course, there's no Of course, there's no natural analog of derivatives of curvature in cat minus one as well. So you can't sort of say, oh, we want those to be bounded. But yeah, so we have this construction in cat minus one setting. And so the idea here is that, so you can actually do it using. So you can actually do it using common stop metrics, you know, something like that on the unstables and stables, and then also DGX, and it only requires Polar continuity of the holonomy maps, not of the distributions. So there's, of course, this famous, I guess, Bauman Brimburns example of it. All unknown means. Okay. So there's, so we were able to prove this, and I guess sort of an interesting setting where that example to which that applies is the Bauman for invertence. So I think I may have forgotten to write down the year for that. Yeah, it's not very detailed. Matt, very deep guys. I'm gonna guess the number. I don't know. It will be a pair just a little bit. I've been all right. So there exists a manifold with pinch negative curvature. Curvature complete, it's C infinity such that the stable and unstable distributions are not older. So, actually, our proof over here does carry over. And also, only assuming pinch negative, you can actually show that dgx is equivalent, folder equivalent to the Sasophony metric, so all natural metrics. And so that means that in all natural metrics for this, we still actually do have holder company of Do you have holder continuity of the holonomies between the unstaples and staples? So that's kind of an interesting thing. You have the distributions not being holder, but you still have holder holonomies. And this is enough. If you also use the Homins shot metrics, it really is important, I think, as well as having these older homonomies that we're using these metrics instead of these sort of induced Riemannian ones. These sort of induced Riemannian ones, because if you don't know things about distributions, then it seems hard to get a hold of those. Yeah, so you're saying the whole anomalies are all continuous in this in the example. I think so. And do you have any objections to that? Okay, okay. I'll lay it. Yeah. That's good. I was actually hoping that I would get some comments about that because it seems kind of counterintuitive. But I mean, if you kind of think Intuitive, but I mean, if you kind of think about it, you're taking the extra derivative here, at least that's how I think of it. Even though you're taking the derivative in the direction of the stables, which are as smooth as low, it could destroy sort of transverse holder continuity in a way. That's how I think of it. Okay, so yeah, so that's sort of the first thing that I wanted to tell you about without details. So, the second thing, this is really sort of what made a lot of things difficult and created like remarks like, we don't know how to do cat base one in this setting. It's because of handling this branching problem. So, this is what I want to give you maybe a little bit more detail about. And this is really at least one of the reasons that cat minus one is so different when you have non-constant potentials. Now, so really it's just doing the construction. So, let's see, I'll have to try to tell you things about. Let's see, I'll have to try to tell you things about how to actually make these measures at this point. So first of all, the way that you get these measures is something like this. So you have two measures, mu, mu iota on boundary, and your Patterson. And your Patterson-Sullivan construction gives you these. And then, working a little with some definitions of functions that you can, like associated weights that you can get, you end up with something like this. So you have a measure dm of C equals d mu of iota of C minus infinity d mu C infinity. C infinity. But this is what you get with some kind of a density function. So f of c here. And you get this description. It's very concrete. This f of c, you have a very sort of concrete formula for what that is. And this m is gamma invariant. Yes, I should probably be saying that. I'm still trying to use same notation because otherwise I'll confuse myself. But yeah, so thank you. Yeah, so classic setting is like this. Well, it's still true in our setting. It's just that this F isn't as exact for us. Yeah. But okay, so this is sort of the goal, anyway, in general, of how. Anyway, in general, of Powers and Solvent, is you get these concrete measures here. DT, of course, is just automatic. And then you get some kind of description of that F of C and you can show that you get an invariant measure. So before I, I probably won't actually tell you exactly how those are constructed, but I will tell you at least what goes into it. So since you're instructing So, since you're constructing these measures that are sort of just individually defined on boundary x, boundary x. So you need some way of getting your potential, which is defined on the geodesic flow, down to some kind of a function that depends on things in x or on boundary of x or sort of just one component things somehow. And so the way the thing that you define is this sort of a weighted distance function or a directed. A weighted distance function or a directed integral. So, this is really the crux of it. So, in classic case, now that this really is classic here. So, when you have a potential, let's say it's T1, M2, R. So, in the classic case, if I give you X and Y, so yeah, first of all, if I just give you a point in. Of all, if I just give you a point in inside of or inside of tilde m, I mean, not sure what to do with that, but as soon as I give you two points, now I can connect them with a line. So now I can sort of get a geodesic or a vector, maybe basic x or something, that I can sort of apply the potential to. And when you're in the manifold, you have this unique VXY. Vxy and I just drew it so you can see it, but it is actually going along the geodesic. And let's say that the distance here is t. So then the thing that you do is you define a directed integral from x to y as being or of phi. This is supposed to be the integral from zero to t of phi of g t. G T V X Y. Should be using the same letters. So this is a very natural thing to do. Of course, if phi is a constant, then you get a constant multiple of distance because it's, as I said, t is just telling you is the distance between x and y. So I don't have to write d and x common. So this is the weight function that you. The weight function that you kind of use. These are the things that go into the Patterson-Sullivan construction. They weight the Planck ray series, and everything is now sort of with respect to this construction. Now, the issue, as I was saying earlier, you don't have a unique geodesic extension of X to Y. X to Y. So, but of course, your potential has to be defined, or it should be defined on the actual flow space, which is something that requires you to know about the entire history of the geodesic. So it's allowed to depend on the entire history. So if I have X and Y, then I have maybe this geodesic C here. This geodesic C here, but then maybe another one, C prime. Well, this is a picture inside of X. It maybe feels like that if you integrate using C or C prime, it looks like maybe you get the same result. But this is not where phi is defined. If I actually draw a picture inside of GX, this is what the picture looks like. So I have this orbit that looks kind of like this. Even line these up better. So it's So it starts diverging already at x, but then near the middle, it gets close if it's a long interval. And then again, it starts diverging already because it sees these things coming. So it starts diverging a little earlier before y and then also after x. It's already diverging. So no matter even like how far apart I take these things, it'll get really close in the middle. Things it'll get really close in the middle, but if I try to integrate, then I'm gonna see all this area here from these diverging from it seeing coming all of these changes. So there's no way of fixing that, in my opinion. I don't think you should try. So instead, well, what do you do when you have lemons? You make margaritas. Make margaritas and wish you had limes instead. So, what am I doing? That was Silopia, the joke. So, right there. So, we're going to define, I'm going to sort of give it a different look to it because it's no longer really this well-defined erected integral thing. So let's kind of just move away from that, make it look a little more ugly. Make it look a little more ugly because it is a little more ugly. And this is going to be defined now to be the supremum over all geodesics. Let's see, of this integral. I'll put a restriction on this, of course, in a second. And I've done the calculus mistake of using the same variables. But we require c of 0 to be equal to x and c of t to equal y. So you just take a supremum. So maybe the integral in this one is going to be bigger than the other one, and you choose. Than the other one, and you choose that one. So fine. This comes at a cost, though. Now, okay, so you at least know that there always exists an attaining geodesic. And by that, I just mean a particular C because the set of C satisfying these two equalities is going to be a compact subset of GX. And I probably should have said it's. X and I probably should have said at some point phi has to be continuous. So knowing that, there is an attaining geodesic. But the thing is that even though you have those, first of all, there might be more than one. And also, they don't have to be well related to each other if you have sort of different segments near each other or whatever. So let me give you some really terrible examples. So this is actually not going to be continuous. Not going to be continuous. Phi bar is not. Even if phi is continuous, does not actually even affect it. So let's say I had this little picture inside of a tree. Let's say I have x, x prime, y, y prime. Now, if I try to do any type of bound on this, I'm going to have to choose geodesics in which turn a certain way for X and Y, and then also geodesics which turn the other way for X prime, Y prime. So this is a bound between whatever the attaining geodesics are, they're going to look like this with this constant amount of error there. And no matter what I do. There and no matter what I do, I can't get this to be small. It doesn't matter how close I take, like, I could take y and y prime even closer to this little vertex here. Does not matter how close I take it. I can't get any bound on this difference because there will always be this divergence ahead of time. Right. So, but the thing is that as long as phi is continuous or holder continuous. Is continuous or holder continuous, you can get a bound, a uniform bound. And at that point, well, okay, I'm not really using holder continuity anywhere. I'm actually just using the Bowen properties. So that's really the thing here. And so let me tell you what things you do get out of 5R. So this is sort of one of our lemmas. So suppose that That I is Bowen. Let's also say bounded. Dan helped with a really, or Dan came up with a clever argument that if you're uniformly continuous then and you're Bowen, then you're probably going to be bounded using like a dense orbit kind of thing. So this is the boundedness really is not asking for much. It's just like. This really is not asking for much, it's just like uniform by 30, maybe. Um, yeah, so this phi will give you some phi bar satisfying some things satisfies. So, there are a few sort of trivial things here. Um, so I want to say local boundedness near the diagonal. Diagonal. And all by that I mean is just, yeah, so phi of xy is less than c if distance xy less than one. So nothing crazy is happening. This comes directly from phi being bounded. I'm going to start running out of room now. So I guess. I guess things over here. Okay, number two, this is just obvious from phi being gamma invariant. So this thing is going to also be gamma invariant. Okay, so the real star of the show here is this third property, though. And what it says is that, so if And what it says is that, so if Y is in the, say, C neighborhood of the geodesic joining X to Z or something, then this difference, and the directions matter here. And the directions matter here. Like, if I flip X and Y, then I might get a different thing because φ can be direction-dependent. But it's basically a triangle inequality. Sort of direction dependent. And this dependence of K on C is uniform over the whole space. So uniform Bowen gets you exactly. So, uniform bow and gets you that uniform dependence here. But okay, so this is called the roughly geodesic property. This is not something we actually came up with ourselves exactly. Might also call it RG, like if I even get to using it anywhere. But this was actually introduced by By steep control and the EG Tanaka Very recently, I think it was 22, they have a few papers that have this property, but it turns out to be super, super natural. It turns out to be super super natural. I can actually give you a really concrete reason why that is. So let's just say we have some general function that satisfies that. So, I can define something like this sign match better. So, I'm going to define a family now of potentials. Maybe I should have used five. Maybe I should have used phi's to make it line up a little better, but yeah. So we can define this by phi sub t of c equals capital psi of c of zero c of t. So it actually turns out that the roughly geodesic property is equivalent to almost additivity of that. Almost additivity of that sequence of potentials plus the Boeing property. That is faith-boohn property. And our theory or our construction really is natural for these things. We do it specifically for potentials that are actually defined on the space instead of a family like this. Of a family like this, but I think this is really the story that's there: is that you have this roughly geodesic property, and it's really you can actually see this in terms of this non-additive thermodynamic stuff. And I can even give you an example now, one just satisfying this, but it's not given by a continuous potential. So let's suppose that gamma is acting on until they convex or let's just say co-compact. So basically I'm saying take a compact negatively curved manifold and let's also let S be a generating set. For gamma, and let's define this guy. So, if I define that, I'll just tell you it has RG, then that means that we also get this sort of almost additive analogy of it. Kind of interesting that you get this from the setup so far. Setup so far. But so you want to think of it as a word metric, except somehow on M. So what you do is you take, first of all, fix p and then take, so for x and y in here, let a sub x and a sub y And a sub y and gamma minimize. I'll do it for a sub x and then it's clear for a sub y. So it's the closest orbit point to x, but you're taking which group element actually gives you that. Say a sub y. And then you can just do the word metric between the a's. This will satisfy the roughly genetic. And this will satisfy the roughly geodesic property, so it gives you some kind of strange potential to work with, which is coming from course and course setting. Write it. It's like, I'm going to put the inverse in the wrong place, but we'll find out. Let's just not think about it. Something like this. Not think about it, something like this. So, this is an ASA RG. And this is a hint already that what we're working with is a course setting. So, we're not working with an exact type of construction. So, now, so this is saying that really our construction. Is his course. And there are a lot of works out there already. I mean, of course, it all starts with Horner. So we use ideas from Hourner. And then, of course, there's Maryushan Tushar. They have a wonderful book just treating the groma hyperbolic setting very generally. So I want to put them in here as well. Symbols. Dash. There's a dated thing. Oh, okay. Thank you. Double in. Thank you. And then. Thank you. And then you are. Thank you so much. Yeah, so, and of course, I'll mention intro and some logic again, just to give a few names. I mean, there's always, there are a lot of precursors to these. I mean, Alex Furman, for example, has a really good paper called Force Geometric Perspective. Of course, geometric perspective. But sort of applying it here with potentials coming from this setting is new as far as we know. And also the application to get equilibrium states, which I don't think I'll be able to get to. So that's kind of the fun of it. So let's see, is there anything else I wanted to say? We're probably close to question by then. Okay, I think I'm good then. Okay, I think I'm red.
