Minutes or so to tell you about how to understand negativity from replica wormholes in a particularly nice concrete toy model of 2D gravity. So this is work that in fact just appeared with my students Sean McBride and Wayne Wen and also related to previous work that I did with Shaoliang Chi and Michael Water. So basically we will start with what is the definition Basically, we will start with what is the definition of entanglement negativity, and I'll talk about why we consider such a quantity. And then we'll move on to a specific model that I think many of us are familiar with that was studied before is JD gravity with end of the world brains. And we will look at negativity in this particular model. We will find four phases for negativity. And in particular, one of the phases will involve new kinds of replica wormholes that break the replica symmetries. Break the replica symmetry spontaneously. And at the end, we will move to a more detailed analysis near the phase transitions. And in particular, we will find some kind of enhanced corrections near phase transitions by using slightly more complicated techniques such as the resolvent Friend-Dyson equation and negativity spectrum. So that's the outline. Let's start. So, what is negativity? Negativity is Negativity. Negativity is a measure of quantum entanglement in mixed state. So let's go through the definition quickly in case some of us are not familiar with it. So we start with a bipartite mixed state, rho R1, R2, two subsystems, R1, R2. And let's choose an orthonormal basis for R1 and do the same thing for R2. Then we can define what is known as the partial transpose of this density. Partial transpose of this density matrix on R2. Basically, we switch J and J prime in this density matrix. Let me see if I can turn on my one second. I want to see if I turn on my spotlight so everyone can see. Here we go. Oops, I've I think I okay here we go. There we go. This should work. It's hard to get the spotlight working. I think the mouse is still working, so you can see the mouse. Okay, great. So the eigenvalues are real for this partially transposed matrix, and in fact, also sum to one. But the point is that it now can they. Now, they can be negative compared to the original density matrix. And it's good to characterize how negative these eigenvalues can be. The negativity is a definition that gives basically the sums of all the negative eigenvalues. So positive eigenvalues don't contribute to the sum, only negative ones do. And there's a related quantity that we often study that is called the logarithmic negativity. Logarithmic negativity that is given by the log of the sum of the absolute value of all the eigenvalues, and it is in fact related to the negativity by this simple function. So if all the eigenvalues are positive, then both of these two negativity measures will in fact vanish. That should be fairly obvious. This is true if the state is in a separable state and in And in basic, roughly speaking, a separable state, this is a situation where there's only classical correlation between the two subsystems, but no true quantum entanglement. And negativity as a measure of true quantum entanglement is not sensitive to this type of classical correlation and therefore vanishes in such a state. However, it's not supposed to vanish if we consider a truly entangled state. An example would be. Entangled states. An example would be an EPR pair. This is a pure state, so it's a very special entangled state. But nonetheless, one can write down the density matrix, go through the partial transpose, and find the eigenvalues. And in this case, there indeed is a negative eigenvalue, which gives a negativity of one half and the log negativity of log two. So this is a very basic example. Now, in general, log negativity provides an upper bound in the amount of Provides an upper bound in the amount of distillable entanglement. This is basically the amount of EPR pairs you can expect to extract from an entangled system. And also, negativity is an entanglement monotone. That means it does not increase under any LOCC. Now, let's move on to the rainy version of negativity. This is very similar to when we want to study the van Neum entropy, but it's complicated, so let's do the rainy entropy first. So let's do the rainy entropy first. We can also do the rainy negativity first, where it is defined as the trace of some power of this density matrix, of this partially transposed density matrix. One tricky thing about rainy negativity is that when we analytically continue from integer n to real n, this is different and we need to distinguish between the even odd cases. Because in one situation, in the even situation, One situation, in the even situation, we don't want to include the sine information for lambda i for the eigenvalues, where in the odd situation, we do include sine of lambda i. So we can define two analytic continuations, essentially analytically continuing from even integers and from odd integers. We recover what is usually known as the log negativity by using the even analytic continuation and take a sort of n goes to one or in here m. n goes to one or in here m goes to one half limit so why do we want to consider such negativity measures um well because in general negativity and its raining generalizations provide useful and fairly tractable in some cases measures of multipartite entanglement here we've said how it describes entanglement between two states in a in a mixed state between two subjects In a mixed state between two subsystems, R1, R2, in the mixed state, but we can include the purifying system and consider a pure state. So it's considering a tripartite system. And we know that in general quantum states, the structure of multipartite entanglement is very rich and not completely well understood. But the hope is that in holographic states, maybe the structure of entanglement is highly constrained and perhaps more attractive. Highly constrained and perhaps more attractable than in general situations. So it's very important to try to understand, for example, these entanglement measures like holographic negativity as much as possible to help us understand gravitational questions that we want to answer, like the black hole information problem. And in particular, what I'm going to say next is going to be motivated a lot by the recent work on understanding the van Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation from replica Warm Hawking. Hawking radiation from replica wormholes. Because now that we understand the Van Neumann entropy, we would, in principle, want to go further and understand more details about the state of the state of the Hawking radiation and in order to fully understand the black hole infrapration process. So this is why negativity is an important part of the story. And now let me move on to the model. The model is a slight general. The model is a slight generalization of the 2D gravity model considered in Pennington, Shanker, Stanford, Young. Just a quick review of what their model is and what we do with it. First, we consider a black hole in JT gravity with end-of-the-world brain behind the horizon. So this is the Euclidean geometry, and this is the Lorentzian geometry. We want to consider an end-of-the-world brain that has a large number of internal states. We use K to label the large number. We use k to label the large number of states there. And to model evaporating black hole, we essentially write down a state that entangles the black hole state with some auxiliary system that models the earlier radiation. So this system is called R. The black hole state is called B. The entropy of the radiation then follows the page curve, as can be shown in this paper. Shown in this paper, and in particular, it's given as the minimum of log k and the black hole entropy. So there are two phases. One phase is the phase where Hawking was correct, and it is dominated by disconnected geometries, where the entropy simply is log k. But after the phase transition, the dominant geometry becomes fully connected wormholes, and the van Neumann. The van Neumann entropy of the radiation system saturates at the black hole entropy. So, this is a very simple phase diagram. What we want to do now is to generalize the discussion so that we can discuss negativity of the radiation. To do that, we need to divide the radiation into two subsystems. Let's call that R1 and R2. Correspondingly, we divide the number of states K into a product of K1 and K2, where K1. Product of K1, K2, where K1 is the dimension of the R1 Hilbert space, and K2 is the dimension of the R2-Hilbert space. Now we want to measure the entanglement between R1 and R2 in this mixed state. So we study the negativities that we defined before, the usual negativity, the log negativity, and rainy negativities. It turns out that this study leads to a very rich phase diagram. Very rich phase diagram that has four faces. We're going to explain that in the next few slides, but I want to show you this as a phase diagram of K1, K2 with S not held fixed. And it's labeled by correspondingly G, which is roughly basically a label that is chosen from the permutation group that helps you construct the geometry. So let's see how to. um let's see how to how to how to understand this to understand this we need to recall how to use the two-dimensional gravitational patternable to calculate the negativity so first we need to generalize the state the state was originally written as an entangled state between the black hole and the radiation now we simply need to write it in a way that respects the subsystem r1 r2 that we defined so it's very natural to write So it's very natural to write these two labels I and J that labels orthonormal basis of R1, R2 separately. And I and J will essentially also be the corresponding flavor indices on the end of the world brain. So instead of carrying just one index, we need to carry two. We have two indices on the brain. From the state, we can easily form the density matrix by trace over the black hole. And so the density. and so the density matrix will involve inner products of the black hole state psi ij psi i prime j prime and then we can take the partial transpose by simply switching j and j prime what this means is that if we want to understand the matrix element of of the partially transposed density matrix we simply need to understand this inner product of the black hole state with j and j prime switched and this prime switched. And this is according to the usual rule of gravitational pathogen given by a Euclidean pathogen of a boundary condition that has an asymptotic boundary interval, sorry, asymptotic boundary interval that ends on boundary conditions that says, for example, here we need an end-of-the-world brain that ends here at this point with flavor index i and j prime. And similarly, And j prime, and similarly, an end-of-the-world brain boundary condition on the other end of the interval. So, this is the boundary condition for the matrix element of rho t, the partially transposed density matrix. We can then form the rainy negativity by taking n copies of these guys and glue them together according to the trace. And in particular, the And in particular, the blue index lines, which correspond to the R1 subsystem, are simply glued together in a normal way because there is no partial transpose on R1. But R2 has a partial transpose. That means the red index line has this funny bluing. One easy way to understand it is if you reverse the ordering of Reverse the ordering of the boundary intervals, then the red line becomes the blue lines, and the blue line becomes the red lines. So they switch positions under a complete reversal of the boundary ordering. If you here we have boundary intervals, if you can label one, two, three, and if you switch them to three, two, one, that's when the rows of the red lines and the blue lines switch. So this is the boundary condition. So, this is the boundary condition for what we need to compute for the remaining negativity. And the rule is then we fill in all possible geometries with end-of-the-world brains that satisfy this boundary condition. So, I've listed four geometries, and there are many more, but these four are very representative. The first one is basically the same, geometrically speaking, as the disconnected geometry considered in Pennington, Stanford, Schenker. Stanford, Schenker, Stanford, Young, where the contribution is equal to one power of K1 because we have one blue index loop, and one power of K2 because we also have one red index loop. It takes more effort to see that, but that's also true. And three powers of Z1, where Z1 is the gravitational patternable. Patternable on the on one of these three small disks. These are single boundary disks because they only contain one boundary interval. And the effect about this JT theory is that all disk geometries has a contribution that roughly scales like e to the s naught, where s naught is a large number. So this goes like e to the 3s naught for the first geometry. The second geometry is The second geometry is a fully connected wormhole. It's the one that was considered in the previous paper as well. We now want to call it a cyclically connected wormhole because there's another one that is like the opposite of it, but also fully connected. So the cyclically connected wormhole is connected to the to basically, you can think of it as the standard generator of the permutation group. And it And it basically makes the blue lines very happy because it forms three blue index loops. So it has three powers of K1, but it only has one powers of K2 because there's only one red index loop. And finally, there's a Z3 that has a three-boundary wormhole, which goes like E to the S naught. The third geometry here is an anti-system. Geometry here is an anticyclically connected geometry. It looks like it's unplanar, not planar, but if you do the reversal of the boundary ordering from 1, 2, 3 to 1, 3, 2, it actually turns into something like the second picture where the red index line and the blue index lines are switched. So actually, it is something that we should consider under the boundary condition that we have as well. That we have as well. And in fact, it makes K2 very happy because it forms three separate red index loops, as can be seen easily here. It only has one blue index loop, so only has one power K1, and also has E to the S naught from Z3. So one can think of there is a procedure that switches cyclic with anticyclic by switching K1, K2. Switching K1 and K2. This is why we only usually need to consider in detail one of them. And finally, we have this pairwise connected wormhole. In general, this would be a geometry that connects as many pairs as possible with possibly a single boundary disk left out if the total replica number is odd. And this is a geometry that has some medium power of k1. Has some medium power of K1. So it's better than just one power of K1, but not as good as three powers of K1. In this example, you can count two loops for both the red lines and the blue lines. So it's K1 squared, K2 square, times Z1 times Z2, because they are two separate bulk components. And in some sense, this is trying to make both K1 and K2 happy. So, what happens is that these four types of geometries compete, and if k is very small, much smaller than e to the s naught, then the disconnected geometry will dominate. This is the blue phase on the left bottom corner here. And this is basically before the page transition for the black hole. Now, if after the page transition, if If after the page transition, if K is large, then the other three wormholes will compete. And which one we have is really dependent on the ratio of K1 with K2. If K1 is extremely large, much larger than K2 times e to the S naught, then the cyclic one wins. This is the red phase on the bottom right of the phase diagram. Phase diagram. And if K2 is very large, the anticyclic geometry dominates. So that's the red face on the top left of the phase diagram. And if neither of them is extremely big compared to others, so precisely that means K1 over K2 is within this large regime. Then the pairwise geometries, the fourth kinds of geometries, will dominate. And these geometries all spontaneously break to replica. Spontaneously breaks to replica symmetry. This can be thought of, this is the green region in the phase diagram here. And this can be thought of again as some kind of compromise between cyclic and anti-cyclic geometries. They both want to dominate, but they fight, and the result is that they settle on two boundary wormholes because those are, in some sense, both cyclic and anticyclic. Both cyclic and anticyclic. The permutation group element that permutes two elements is its inverse basically. So this means that it, so I won't present the detailed formulas to bore you, but basically what happens is one can compute the negativity within all four phases very concretely. And the behavior of negativities that we can scan, for example. That we can scan, for example, in this direction on the phase diagram, where we go from the disconnected phase to the pairwise phase. So it turns on at some phase transition, which is some point on this line. And before the phase transition, the negativity is zero in the disconnected phase. After that, it turns on gradually. And also, we can scan the phase diagram in this diagonal way where this diagonal way where we start with the start in the cyclic phase, we turn on K2 with K1 times K2 fixed. So this is like looking at a particular black hole, but dividing the radiation in slightly different ways every time we scan over a different K2. In this way, we start in the cyclic phase where the negativity goes up and then we go into Up, and then we go into a phase transition into the pairwise phase where the negativity is constant. So, this is also called a negativity saturate entanglement saturation in previous literature. And now we go into the negative anticyclic phase where the negativity actually decreased. So, now that we understand how things work in Now that we understand how things work in each one of the four phases, we can study what happens at a phase transition in more detail. We'll look at the phase transition from the disconnected phase to the pairwise phase first. So this is this phase transition. Near this phase transition, we expect that things to smooth out this sharp transition. And the way they do it is because at a phase transition, we have We have not just the disconnected geometry and the pairwise geometry, they both could dominate because it's at a phase transition, but also there are many other geometries that could dominate. In particular, one can show that the set of all geometries that dominate at this phase transition consists of all geometries that are made out of single boundary disk and pairwise connected wormholes. So, all these pictures suggest. pictures suggest dominate give dominant geometries. The last one does not dominate because it has a four boundary wormhole. So only pairwise and single boundary pieces are allowed. This can be thought of as some interpolation between pairwise geometries and the disconnected geometry. So include all the things between them at a phase transition. And negativity is then found by summing over all these geometries. This is in principle hard. Geometries, this is in principle hard, and we then need to analytically continue, which is either harder. But to do this, we usually just define the usual way to proceed is to define the resolving matrix. We do it for the partially transposed density matrix here. We write down this definition as a Taylor series in one of a lambda parameter in the resolvent and write it diagrammatically in terms of this sum. Mathematically, in terms of the sum, where we keep adding boundaries. The bulk rule is then we sum over all geometries with an arbitrary number of boundaries. This seems complicated to do, but in fact, this can be summed by a very simple Schrödinger-Dyson equation that truncates at the second order. And this can, in fact, you can verify that using this equation recursively, you generate the infinite number of diagrams on the top. And finally, And finally, we take the trace of the Srindon equation. We find this quadratic equation. We can solve it easily and find the negativity spectrum, which is the eigenvalue density for the partially transposed density matrix. And in particular, it can be extracted from the resolvent in this way, and it gives a Wigner semicircle distribution on this interval. The point is that the That the negativity is zero when in the disconnected phase, where one over k is larger than this a defined simply as a ratio of z2 over z1 over k times z1 squared. And at a phase transition, 1 over k is precisely equal to a. So the negativity turns on because the edge of the semicircle touches the zero eigenvalue. Is the zero eigenvalue. And after that, it spills over to negative eigenvalues and negativity turns on. And again, in this case, everything can be calculated exactly. We find that the log negativity is given by some concrete expression. It's not important. It's not important to understand this complicated function, but the point is that it smooths out the sharp transition when we scan in this. When we scan in this direction. And in particular, it means that there is an order one correction between the naive curve and the actual curve at the disconnected parallel phase transition. Five minutes. Sure. So finally, I'd like to move on to the more complicated phase transition, which is the cyclic pairwise phase transition. So this is going in this way, and the first phase transition. And the phase first phase transition between the cyclic phase and the pairwise phase that we encounter. So it's this corner that we want to study in more detail. This is a phase transition that where the dominant geometries include more complicated diagrams, includes the cyclic geometry, includes the pairwise geometry, but it also includes other more general wormholes that connect more than two boundaries, such as this one. It turns out that It turns out that it's in order to do this, we can just in fact sum over all the planar geometries. That will definitely be able to capture everything we want to include at this phase transition. Doing this is in fact an overkill in the sense that summing over all planar geometries is in fact valid in a larger regime. It's valid anywhere away from this. Anywhere away from this anticyclic phase. So it includes a large part of the green phase and a large part of the blue phase and everything below that. So it certainly includes the phase transition we want to capture, but it also includes what happens at the triple point. It includes a large part of the phase transition between the disconnected and pairwise phase that we already studied. So it includes more stuff. The price we pay is more difficult, but as we will see. More difficult, but as we will see, we can still do it. And in particular, once we have done this phase transition, then the other one between the anticyclic phase and the pairwise phase is easy by simply switching K1 and K2. In this case, the Schrödinger-Dyson equation can still be used, but now it has higher order terms, includes things that with more than two boundary intervals. And in particular, one can And in particular, one can write it down carefully. One needs to, so this is the previous Fierdysen equation. Now we include arbitrarily high orders. And the important thing is that each term is suppressed by additional powers of K2. And the precise power depends on whether the number of boundaries even or odd. A sanity check is that setting K2 equals The vanity check is that setting K2 equals one recovers the result of Pennington, Shanker, Stanford, Young. And this can be, we will see that this can be solved exactly if the black hole is in a microcanonical ensemble and can be solved approximately for a canonical ensemble. So let's first discuss the microcanonical ensemble. In this case, Zn, the gravitational partition function on an n-boundary disk, is simply given by essentially e to the s, where s is e to the s, where s is the microcanonical entropy. Well, it in fact has something to the nth power, but that cancels out between zn and z1 to the n. So it's not important. The resolving equation now can be resumed as a geometric series, and this can be turned into a cubic equation for r. So everything again can be solved when one can get an exact result for negativity and the negativity spectrum. And in particular, Spectrum. And in particular, one can see what happens as we traverse this through the phase diagram. As I mentioned, this is valid anywhere away from the anticyclic phase. We can see two phase transitions at the same time. So we start, so we follow this arrow and start in the disconnected phase. So we start with a Wigner semicircle distribution. And this is in this picture for very small k. For example, k equals 2. And then we travel to the right. And then we travel to the right, increasing K while K1 is fixed. Yeah, increase K1 where K2 is fixed. So the semicircle distribution becomes higher, but also shifts to the left. At some point, there's a phase transition, so we get negativity. So we go into the pairwise phase. It's still a semicircle distribution at that point. But then once we approach the interesting phase transition to the cycle. interesting phase transition to the cyclic phase at some point, which is k equals 40 here. So this is simply the same thing with a large, larger set of k's. When k equals 40, we've hit the phase transition to the cyclic phase. And this is where it describes the distribution develop some kind of singularity. After the phase transition, we go into the paralleliz phase. And in this case, the distribution is given by something like k. Is given by something like k equals 100, which is a disjoint union of two Machenco pastor distributions. This is true in the cyclic phase. Also, I want to give a topological aside. So instead of JT gravity, we can also study a topological model of 2D gravity studied by Maroth Maxwell. And they have some topological action. Some topological action, everything turns out to be similar to the microconical ensemble. We can find a similar cubic equation with each of the S-naught simply replaced by the total number of states available. And so it's very similar to the microcanonical GAT model. And in fact, both models are similar to the random mixed states studied recently. We're not into the QA. You won't do the QA. If you want to take a few minutes to finish up, it's fine. Maybe let me use one. Finish up, it's fine. Maybe let me use one minute to finish up. Um, yeah, so finally, I just want to mention the results in the canonical ensemble in the JT model again. In this case, we need to solve things more exactly. So, we need to write down Z in terms of some density of state times some function of S that involves basically information about the brain. And we, in this case, we can do the same. Case, we can do the same resummation in the resolving equation, but it's more complicated because we need to do this integral. It turns out this can be done approximately in the semi-classical limit using saddle point approximation. And the result is that there is some negativity spectrum on both positive eigenvalues and negative eigenvalues. There's an uncontrolled region of the analysis, but the eigenvalues there don't cause a big error. The final result. The final result is that it will smooth out the phase transition again, and one can calculate what is the error between the actual curve and the naive curve at a phase transition. It turns out for log negativity, it is something that is of order one over beta. So it's a kind of very enhanced correction because it's something that you cannot get from a single saddle. This is due to an infinite sum of saddles. And it's very similar to a similar effect of for A similar effect of for the rainy entropy with n smaller than one at a page transition. There they also have a one-over-beta correction. And finally, there is another quantity that is very, very interesting, which is this refined rainy two negativity, which is defined in this way. The reason is that it follows a very similar curve. This is the actual curve and the naive curve. But in this case, the correction is of order one of... Is one of order one over beta. So even though the picture looks the same, but the correction is actually much smaller than the previous slide. This is also enhanced correction because it's larger than the Order 1 naive expectation due to a single saddle. And this is a correction that similar to the van Neumann tropy at a phase transition. In fact, one can argue that this is not surprising because holographically, Because holographically, one can write this refined raining to negativity as a sum of one Neumann entropies. So, I want to just end with a few questions, like what is the interpretation of the one over beta enhanced correction to the log negativity? Can we explain it in a similar way using something like the diagonal approximation? Can we connect these results to other measures? I believe, for example, one of the things that will be talked about. Example, one of the things that will be talked about this afternoon is the reflected entropy. And can we generalize this analysis to other models? Eventually, how do we understand this from a quantum error correcting or some kind of tensor network perspective? So I want to end here and thank you all for your attention. Thank you. Okay, so let's see if there are questions. Maybe let's, either the Maybe that's either the remote. Okay, I can't see the in-person people. So there are questions remotely. Maybe. I have kind of a general question about this model, which I could also be asked of the West Coast Replica paper. Yes. Why don't you sum over loops of the end of the world brain in the bulk, you know, where you put holes in the surface? The surface. So naively, those would be suppressed by e to the minus s naught, but then if k is large, then they'll be enhanced, and so they make they could be important. That's a very good question. I think you're talking about brain loops, right? Yeah, brain loops. Yeah, these are really dynamical brains. They're supposed to be. So let me first mention that in the topological model, indeed, this is done. So the result I'm giving here, in fact, includes all brain loops. Loops. In fact, a good way of understanding the topological model is perhaps that you take first the topological version of the JT model, but then you include two additional things that they didn't include. One is the higher genus surface contributions, which is suppressed in the JT model. But in here, depending on the value of S partial, actually, you need to include it here. The second is the thing you mentioned, the brain loops. Is the thing you mentioned, the brain loops? So it's included. There's a resummation of the brain loops in the topological model. In the original JT model, though, so your question is there. Then the question is, why do we not sum over them? And my tentative answer, and someone should correct me if I'm wrong, my tentative answer is that's because brain is heavy, so you can ignore it in that limit. It in that limit. Well, so you want to say that, well, is that really right? I mean, I can imagine it has some tension, but I thought that that kind of amounts to the S naught or something. Yeah, I don't know. So one maybe needs to play with the limits carefully, but at least so I didn't mention this in the semi-classical. When I say, let me see. Let me see. It is here. So when I say here. When I say this can be solved in a semi-classical limit, actually, I cheated a little bit when I said just beta goes to zero. There is another limit where mu goes to infinity. In fact, mu needs to be much greater than one over beta in order for this part of the analysis to hold. And that's a very, that's a heavy brain limit. I thought, okay, so maybe I'm not remembering. I guess I thought there was some, I didn't think that the tension of this brain was an independent parameter from K and S naught and whatever, but yeah, it's been a while since I thought about it. There is a mu parameter. It's certainly independent. Yeah. So you want to say you're working in some large mu, you know, k and s are fixed and mu is very large, something like that. Used very large, something like that? One probably needs to be fairly careful. And I haven't worked out the details, but I'm hoping there's a regime where mu is sufficient large to suppress the brain loops. But maybe not as extreme as taking mu to infinity, keeping the others fixed. Yeah, it seems like that would contribute to the energy of the black hole or something. To the energy of the black hole, or something, if you just made mu very large. I don't know. I'd have to think about it. Well, this is the exact, this is basically the quantum partition function. So all the mu dependence is included in this gamma function. Other questions? All right. If not, do we have another question? No? Okay. Let's jump to you again. Let's sing to you again. And Tom, you're up.
