First, thank the organizers for the invitation, and it is an honor to speak at Bill Castleman's 80th birthday. So, I think I first met Bill maybe 10 years ago when we both were visiting Beijing. So, it was a pleasure to go to dinner with him. So, I think it was striking how fast. So, I think it's striking how far a personality Bill has because I never had any worry of running out of topics to discuss or for conversation during dinner. So I think everybody agrees with me a lot. So I think I also share the same passion on orbital universe as Bill. I hope he still does. So I haven't seen him for the past few years. The past few years. So, actually, if he doesn't, I think I still share the same passion on spicy food with Bill. So, we'll see happy birthday first. So then, let me write, let me start with the talk of so I'm gonna discuss. So, first I will discuss some applications to so-called. To so-called a p-iadic version of the Beninson, Bennington-Broha-Cato conjecture. So, here, let me take a smooth projective variety over a number field F. Let me take a prime P, which is good in the sense the variety has a good reduction at all the primes above P. So then one can consider the child group. So the child group has a map to the cohomology group where the kernel of this cycle class map is called the group of homologically trivial cycles. So in the case of a curve, so that's the first case where this is interesting already. First, case where this is interesting already. If x is a curve, for example, elliptic curve, then what you get is the cycle class map is simply taking the degree. So it's a degree of divisors. Then the degree zero divisors form a Binan group, I mean modular Russian equivalence relation. So this form a Binan group. In this case, in the case of elliptic curve, you actually get the modular V group for the Group for the elliptic curve. So then there's also a map called a P-I-D version of Abel Jacobi map. So where the target of this map is so-called, well, first of all, it lies in the first Galois cohomology group with coefficient in this cohomology, you know, the periodic. The Piardicohomoloids, Piatic adult cohomology of this variety. So this can be viewed as a, well, so the image, I mean, well, one can do better than just consider the first Gawa Cohomology group. In fact, it is known that the image lies in a smaller subgroup defined by Borot and Kato. So I think Bolo Kartarto. So, I think Boro Kato realized one can actually give a sort of characterization of the image, at least when you only look at the variety of a periodic field. So, locally, they can colorize what is the image of this periodic aberration cobi map. So, what you get is a condition where they put, you know, they put this. called you know they call this this uh index f which indicates that uh uh so so this is a so um so if you think of uh the class in the galois cohomology as classifying extension so extension of of the trivial galois representation by you know by a class by this class in the middle extent extension of this one by the cohomology group so So, look, without this index, this Gawako mode classifies all such extensions up to isomorphism. But then, with this condition, oh, I actually accidentally covered this one. So, with this condition, it requires this extension to be crystalline. So, that's the definition of the subgroup. The definition of this subgroup, this condition, this lower index. So, so you require this extension to be crystallized. So, that condition actually exactly captures the fact that those classes coming from the actual cycles on the right. So, in the case of elliptic curve, so this is precisely, well, its run is actually the rank of the UO similar group and the And the rank of Tedeshaverich group, the P primary part of the Tedesh Afro-Rich group, which of course is conjectured to be trivial. I mean, the Tedesh average group is supposed to be, is conjectured to be finite. So really, in the case of the Euthyphel curve, this group is conjectured to be the same dimension as the model V rank for the Euteral curve. So, in that sense, this is a general. A nice generalization of model V group, or maybe the same group, so the UO CMR group. So, this is called the Bora-Cato Samuel group. So then the Benison and well later on Benison and Brojo Cato they found a generalization of the person. A generalization of the or she so an entire conjecture of a linear curve to higher-dimensional any projective smooth varieties. Here's their conjecture. So the conjecture is that, so on one hand, you have the Hasse V L function. So the L function attached to the to the cohomology of this variety. Then you look at Look at the vanishing order of the L function at a center. So, okay, so this is kind of, I mean, based on the conjecture that all such Hase-V L function should be actually holomorphic, has a holomorphic analytic continuation and function equation and so on. And the order of vanishing should be the same as the dimension of the same or group here. So, again, in the case of In the case of elliptical curve, this right-hand side is really the same as the Moliv√© rank plus the hypothetical rank zero of Teddy Chef-Rich group. Okay, so today actually I want to discuss a P-i-Dig version which only changed the L function. So the L function is replaced by the P-A-G version with L. Replaced by the P algorithm function. So, what does that mean? So, roughly speaking, the PR function is an interpolation. So, it's a package of all the information for the URL function or its special value at the center, but you twist by finite order characters. So, here you twist the L function by a finite order character. So, you have you get a special. Character, so you have you get a special value you have to normalize suitably, then you can p-iadically interpolate to get a actually a function with variable in the p over the p-adic numbers. So here I'm imposing a technical condition called ordinary. It's a generalization of ordinary elliptic curve where, or ordinary modular form, where for GO2 modular form, ordinarity means the pth, so p is a good prime, so the pth. Good prime, so the p uh hecke eigenvalue is a unit. So, in the case of which two elliptic modular form, so it's a generalization to of that condition. Okay, so so that's the conjecture we want to discuss. So, one, let me start with a, you know, one, one result one can deduce from a later discussion. So, one application is the following: suppose I have two, if I take two elliptic curves, both are. Elliptic curves both are semi-stable just for simplicity. So then I take some abilities, sorry, CM extension. So I have a total real field, which is assumed to be solvable over Q and another extension over CM quadratic extension over F0. So then I take those two elliptical curves, I take power of both. So, okay, here is a bit of a. So, okay, here it's a bit artificial. I take n minus one power and nth power. So it's kind of two consecutive power. You will see why I can only do that, I mean, rather than any arbitrary pair of power. And so then I take the, you know, maybe the most interesting part of the cohomology in the middle, in the middle degree of this product. So each, so the most interesting part or the new part, I mean, you can, you can consider. the new part i mean you can you can consider lower if you consider other other comp uh other direct summons of of of this cohomology group they they can already be found in lower in a lower power order so so that's why i think this this is the new part in this cohomology in this uh in the cohomology of this product so anyway so i take this this uh this piece of of the of the cohomology um so which is a gap which carries a gabo representation um so here So here it's interesting that I think Newton and Thor they actually proved those are well before you take phase change for this extension field they're over Q so the symmetrical power actually are known to be to be automorphic so they are attached to automorphic form on GON and GON plus one respectively. So then I use the functorality established Functorality established by Arthur and Cozil for the undersolvable base change for GON. So I also know that those are actually attached to automorphic representation, even if you base change to such extension. So anyway, the point is those are actually automorphic. So the theorem, okay, I put a star here. You will see why. So strictly speaking, it's not yet proved, but I think we can prove it with a bit more work. So here, let's be an ordinary prime. Here, let's be an ordinary prime. So, the theorem is that if the order of vanishing of this PRDL function is zero or one, then the order of vanishing is actually equal to the rank of the same group, as predicted by the periodic version of Venice and Broha-Kato conjecture. So, what is new here is actually the Ronk1 case. So, the Ronk0 case, this was already So the round zero case, this was already proved by Yi Feng Liu, Yi Chao Tian, Yang Shao and Xi Wenzhu and myself in our previous work. So in that case, actually, the PIDL function, when you say that when we have order zero, which really means that the special value doesn't vanish in the center. So in that case, it's really the same as the classical L function. So in that case, remember, the PLA L function is the interpolation. The PL function is the interpolation of finite order placed over the L function. So doesn't really, if you take special value, it doesn't really use interpolation. It's really the classical L function. It doesn't vanish at the center. So here, actually, in the five-author paper, we actually also prove something more than the rank zero case. What we proved was, so the strategy of the proof is actually So, the strategy of the pool is actually to consider certain special cycles attached to unitary in a unitary gangrose process setting. So there is a special cycle on a Shimura variety. And on this Shimura variety, those Galois representations, they show up because we know they are modular and automorphic. So one can use special cycles. One can use special cycle on those Shimura varieties to run a corivagan-type argument, or more precisely, it's the extension by Bertonini-Darmont. They did the argument for GO2. So in the five-author paper, what we did was for the Rankine-Silver L function for this product of U1 times U1 plus 1. So there we actually proved if the special cycle coming from them. The special cycle coming from Gangros-Prasad conjecture is non-torsing. So that special cycle produced one concrete class in this similar group. If that class, well, that class might vanish or might not. If it doesn't vanish, then we proved that the same group is actually the wrong one. So, what this new piece of work today I'm going to describe is piece of work today I'm going to describe is actually to give a criterion when that class is actually non-zero. So the criterion we have will be that if the L function has order one, then that class actually doesn't vanish, therefore provide the input required in the argument in our previous work. So in other words, the real new thing is what do I call a periodic version of arithmetic GGP conjecture. Of arithmetic GGP conjecture. So I will move to that part. So this is what this is about is the setting is already in some previous work in today Raphael's talk and also yesterday Pierre Henry's talk. So here it's so we are we're going to consider the unitary case of the gangros. Unitary case of the Gangor's Prasad conjecture. So I take a same quadratic tension, global fields. I have a pair of Hermitian space called Wn, Wn plus 1. So they will define a spherical variety. So attached to a pair of groups, where G is the product and H is the embedding of the smaller unit. Uh, embedding of the smaller unit triple. So, here I'm going to impose a condition on the signature of the formation space at archimeding place to be to be a very very special type. So the signature looks like, well, at one archimedean place, it's of this type, m1, n minus 1, 1. And all other places, it's positive definite. So similarly for the larger space. So this will induce an embedding of Shimura. A embedding of Shimura varieties that has to. Okay, I have to one has to define the Shimura data suitably, but anyway, so the point is you can define a Shimura data and also embedding, which give you a Shimura variety of dimension given by, you know, well, that's determined by the signature, but it's given by those numbers. Roughly, you will get a half-dimensional cycle. It's almost half. Okay. Okay, this is odd dimensional variety, so there's no half dimension anymore, but it's slightly right below half. So, once you take an integral model of both Shimura varieties, you will actually get literally a middle-dimensional sub-scheme. So, in that sense, it's a half-dimensional, it's in a middle dimension. So, this cycle is what we call arithmetic diagonal cycle because. A arithmetic diagonal cycle because it looks like a graph of embedding, which looks like a you know, like a diagonal. So, arithmetic diagonal. So, this is a cycle which I mentioned earlier where in my previous work, we used this class to run a Colywagon type argument to bound the size of several groups. So, here the periodic Uh the periodic uh NGTP conjecture is is to try to uh try to relate this class, you know, this this class uh when you project down to a automorphic representation. So that so try to relate you know this this class to a p-adic L function uh attached to you know automorphic representation. So more precisely here, let me start with, well, let me recall you that what the cohomology looks like. So we are interested in the middle that middle degree cohomology. interesting in the middle that middle degree cohomology. So here up to, at least for those we are kind of interested, those represent representations, say tempered casual representations. So here the cohort model is expected to be modular some other parts. So it should have a direct summon attached to those temporal cospid orientation. representation uh where as a module uh of the you know of this group the identity point finite identity points and the galoa group is supposed to decompose as as such form where pi is automorphic where this v pi or v pi dual there's a twist um is the global lanes correspondence attached to so the the the gala orientation attached to pi okay of course i'm i'm using this as a hypothesis although As a hypothesis. Although, this, of course, is based on many people's work. On one hand, this relies on endoscopy classification. So, this of Arthur and extended by Mock and also Tasho Sugu and Minguis White. And so on the other hand, this also relies on counting points on Shimura variety. So I think this is also ongoing work. So, I think this is also ongoing work by Sugu with Yihan Zhu and Mark Kissen. So, anyways, so assume I have such a decomposition into cohomology. So, I can take the Galois cohomology. So, the Galois cohomology will also have same decomposition. Particularly, I will get one direct summon from that, you know, from the finite part in the Bohocato Samurai. Part in the Bohem Cato simulator. So we will find that part from that from the Gala Cohomology attached to this simulator variety. So now I'm going to bring in a so-called PID height parent. So this is a height parent defined by Nicovar. It is a bilinear pair with a value in the P-Ali number. With a value in the P-adding number. So I should have pointed out there's also a height parent called Berenson-Bohr height parent, which has real value, which has a value in real number. So that's the Archimedean height parent. So here one has a PLA hydrocarbon. So the advantage of the PLA hydrocurin over the real non over the artimeting hydrocurin is that. Over the Artimedia hydrocarbon is that at least we know that it depends on the cohomology. So it can be described using the cohomology of the Shimura variety, which shows up here, where the Archimedean height parent, so the real value one, becomes less understood because in that case we do not know. So one does have a height parent on the child move, but we don't know the relation to. Don't know the relation to cohomological, so it's a bit actually easier to work with the P ali height theory. But on the other hand, I mean, philosophically, it is like you interchange the row of P and infinity. So those two heights, they behave very much alike. And in fact, they share a large part. So in a sense, once you decompose the height here into local terms, so they can be localized as a sum over all the places. As a sum over all the places, away from p and infinity, we are more or less the same. So, what what's what's different is for the archimeting height, it is very difficult to compute the archimeting part. For the p-adding height, it is most difficult. I mean, it is most difficult to define, or I mean, for the p-adding place. So, so where for our archimeding place, the p-adding height is kind of trivial. So, so there's an interchange of p at infinity here. So, anyway, so here. So, anyway, so here I have this. So, then I, okay, so I get a class coming from the diagonal cycle here. So, this will contribute a class inside here. So, or I mean, or more precisely, so maybe I actually skipped something here. So, if I take cohomology here, I take the Bering Simbler, the Blohokatosim or group of this cohomology of this. Of this general variety. So, this will decompose of sum over pi tensor H1 of V pi du. So, I'm just kind of applying this decomposition here. So, this means if I choose a whole, if I choose element in the, so in automotive representation pi, I can talk about the image. So, I have a special class. So, I have a special class called attached to H, the subgroup. So, this is the class here. So, I just project them using using a vector in the representation pi, or maybe the dual representation, maybe the dual. So, if I take vector here in the dual representation, I can evaluate, right? So, I get a class in here. So, similarly, if I take vector in pi. If I take a vector in pi, I will get a class in a secondary coordinate. So then I can apply this height parent. So, PRD height. So, the conjecture one can make is the following. So, the PRD height parent is equal to the L function, the first derivative of the PRD L function at the center attached to the Rankine-Silver convolution times some local term. So, here, remark some remarks. So, the local term is Marks, so the local term is exactly the same as those appeared in the Ichino-Ichida refinement of GGP conjecture. So, namely the same as what Verget did in the GO2 case. So, it's the integration of the matrix coefficient. So, then there's the L function, so the PRDL function. So, this is the interpolation of the Rankine-Silver L function attached to the base change. To the base change. So I have, remember, I have my group G is a product. So I have two representations here. So then I base change to the G O N over quadratic extension and G1 plus one quadral extension, respectively. So I take the Rankin-Sabr function. Okay, so I can construct a so one can construct a PR function out of the run-conceal convolution L function by interpreting. function by interpolating the special value of the finite order twist of the Rankin-Silver level function. Okay, so the theorem is that, so this is what one can prove. The conjecture holds if I assume, ah, so okay, I think I should also put a p ordinary here. I forgot to say p ordinary. So there's a technical condition here. So the theorem what I prove is that if all can want to prove is that if all the places are all the places of OP are split uh then i also have to impose ramification conditions for the automobile fermentation uh first of all i have to assume the field quadratic field extension is unramified at all the all the all the finite i mean all the finite place and um i also assume um the you know the unique You know, the inert places, the representation pi v is is unramified or so-called almost ramified. So, so that is a so unramified means it has a spherical vector under the hyperspatial subgroup. And in the almost unramified case, I really mean that there is a almost self-dual lattice in the formation space locally at another place, and the representation has a has a Has a vector invariant, non-zero vector invariant under the parahoric subgroup corresponding to that lattice. So it's a very restricting condition, although it's not so restrictive in a sense, I didn't impose any condition for the split place. So for the split place, trends can be arbitrary. So this is a bit like... Can you say a couple of words about the Piadic pairing? About the piadic pairing, what it implies, what's known about it. In other words, and the relation that you know or don't know between your piadic L function that's been interpolated and the usual L function. The complex L function, right? Right. So, okay, so to clarify, there's no direct implication from either side. Okay, so you're not saying anything. So you're not saying anything about in this derivative case about the complex cell function, but you are saying something about this group. In other words, there is a theorem that says that I assume if the p-adic pairing is not zero, then the elements of infinite order, for example. That's right. So this implies if the P-i-D of me has order one, which means this derivative doesn't vanish. Not zero, right? Then this class doesn't vanish. So if you have a land zero class, Doesn't manage, so see how you have a lound zero class in the same order group, so that's what you can get. So, in the complex case, so can you just repeat? What are the properties of this pairing? It's non-degenerate, it's well with actually we do not know it's non-degenerate, so but on the other hand you do know, okay. Well, but if you know if you know this zero, okay, if that's zero, then the right you already have a class which is non-zero, so okay, so you know it's non-zero because I'm all right, all right, I get it, so but but a priority there's no relation. Priority, there's no relation, there's no implication. Although expect one expects they should be equivalent. So one expect this should be land degenerate and so on. And actually, this class doesn't vanish in this in a similar book should be equivalent to the land vanishing as a class in the child book. Is this the first? Do you have examples where this is not zero? Well, there's a GL2 case, there's a PRD grows out here due to parent real. Due to parallel real, so in a modular curve case, so but in higher dimensions, I think this, yeah. So, this is the first case you get a but you actually have an example example in the sense of well where well now you need to know the right-hand side is not zero, right? No, no, I don't I don't know how to give any example, even produce any example of pi where this doesn't vanish. Okay, no, I don't. So there's no, I don't know how to produce example of that here. Example on that. Yeah. Okay. I'm not picking at it. I'm just trying to understand what you know. Yeah. Thanks. Right. Okay. So, right. So now let me move to my last part. So which hopefully will relate to one of the topics in this workshop, namely orbital integrals. So here one needs to relate to the PRDO function. Relate the P-Ri-L function in the derivative with the P-addic heights. So, on the P-RD-L function, L-function side, I have to P-R-D-in-ter interpolate the Jacquiralis relative principle. So, on the geometric side, I have to put the P-R-G height into RTF. So, here, let me start with the analytic side. So, how does one incorporate How does one incorporate the PR L function into RTF? So, here let me recall you very quickly what how does one construct the PR the Rankin-Silver L-function. So, here let me take a representation of a classical automatic of GON and GON plus one. So, recall the classical Rankine syllable convolutional function is constructed in the work of JK, Pioteski, Shapiro, and Shalai cover. uh pioteski shapira and shalai cover uh so that you take you take a pair of auto warving for one on each component and then you you integrate over over the smaller gl n so h denotes the smaller g o n so the bracket denotes the automorphic quotient identical points module of the f points so this is all uh classical here so so you we've got a function so here okay of course you can put a character chi here so you put a character chi chi here so you put a chi ruct on chi here you get a twist by chi here so the p i l function well what is l function i mean l function can be viewed as as a function um um rather than i mean uh okay has has a variable but of course really it is a uh a family uh uh where you can you can view your domain of this function to be all the you know the twist of the representing pi by you know by this s power of a absolute By this s power of an absolute value. So, by the same philosophy, maybe I can view L function as a function on the set of finite order character. So, here, a naive way of thinking of the other function is that it puts, first of all, it is a function on all the finite order character. So, take any character. So, here is the So here is the construction is that you actually modify. So you modify, okay, I'm going to take a vector which is invariant under the Horror subgroup. So I take the special modification where here UP represents a so-called UP operator. It is one special element in a URL HoriHeck algebra. So it looks like following. So you take, okay, for each GO energy one plus one, you have. For each GON and GO1 plus one, you have to do both, but anyway, for GON, it looks like this special element where I is the Yohori, T is this diagonal elements given by power of P, really P to the half sum of the positive roots. So, okay, there's a miraculous. I mean, there's a mysterious element called this element I wrote here. Element arrow here. So I don't have a concept explanation of this element except by saying that it works. So if you plug in this element, you actually are able to produce something which is periodically well-behaved. So here, okay, I'm putting a negative sign, which really means I'm taking an eigenform under the OGOP operator, then I divide it by the eigengon. Under the OGOP operator, then I divide it by the eigenvalue. So, really, it's not really element in the HECA algebra. So, you have to use something which does not exist in the HEC algebra, right? And there's no inversion, no inverse in this HEC algebra. So, what happened is I really take the eigenform when I divide it by the eigenvalue to mth power. So, in this way, you will get actually a measure, so to speak, which when you evaluate those functions, you will get those value. As a value. Okay, so this is understood. So then we have to put this into a RTF. So let me recall you the Jacquiralis RTF and the relative transformer looks like following. So I have the group G G prime being the, okay, really G prime. So it's a product of 2GON. So anyway, it looks like you have to choose appropriate automorphic appearance integral. So, on the spectral side, you get a decomposition where you will see the Rankine server L function. So, then there's a geometric decomposition to orbit the integral. Okay, now you have to do is to plug in a family of pest function where away from p, let's fix one, you know, fix the pay level. So, everything is invariant under a fixed open complex of. Inverted under a fixed open complex of loop. And at archmining place, it's going to be a very special function such that the orbit integral at archmeaning place is a constant. So namely, it takes a very simple form. So what's gonna change is at the P. So at the P, I take, so here is related to what is used in constructing. Uh, what is used in constructing construction of PRDO functions? I'm taking the same one, but now I have a difficulty of inverting anything, right? I cannot invert anyone in HEC algebra. So, what I do is to actually, so intuitively, I do infinity power. Okay, I cannot take infinity power operator in HEC algebra. So, what I do is I take a parameter called n. So, then I take the very large power by taking factorial. By taking factorial, so then I take up to the half power. So later on, I will let n approach infinity. So that's what this test function looks like. So then we have to study the limit, the p-value limit of the geometric side when you plug in this family of test functions. So roughly speaking, the spectral side, if you plug in this family of functions and you let n approach infinity, you will only return You will only return those out of representation, which is ordinary, namely the UP egg is a unit. So, so here we're using this exercise where if you have a number, P-leg number, P-leg integer, when you take n factorial power, let n go to infinity, the limit is either 0 or 1, depending on you start with a unit or non-unit. So, in that case, anyway, if you take this limit in the spectral side, you will get. Take this limit in the spectral side, you will get a PRDL function for those pi which are ordinary. So, in other words, I kill all those non-ordinary out-world representations in the spectral side, only keep the ordinary one by taking this limit. And on the geometry side, I have to compute those orbit integrals, study their behavior when we let this UP power, the operator, UP exponent. For u p the exponent approach infinity. So, so here what happened is now I have to compute this orbit integral. Okay, so what we can prove is that under this hypothesis, if v is split, we can actually compute it. So, in this case, one can show that actually eventually they become a constant periodically. So, when n goes infinity. So, one question we don't know how to do is. We don't know how to do this, we don't know how to do this when there is not split. So, somehow the split case tends to simplify. I mean, as we know, this was the case for the J. Kiralis comparison with the unitary side. So, here, so one can prove the periodic limit of the integral. So, actually, I wasn't really, I was lying a little bit. So, the actual function is slightly more complicated than this one. Slightly more complicated than this one, so but it has the flavor. So, the keys you want to kind of take this limit while very while varying this power as well. So, anyway, so that's a statement for this for the orbital integral. So, so I should have pointed out, earlier work of Eric Urban, he also did a p-iadic limit of the UO author syllable choice formula, but I think he did it in a different way. But I think he did it in a different way. So, here I'm PRD interpret the oriental integral of the P. What Hey did was more or less at Archimedean place. So, he kind of varying test function at Archimedean place and study the PRD properly. Okay, so I have a few more minutes. So, when should I stop? Like 150 or predominant 150. Yeah, okay, so I have five minutes. Yeah, okay, so I have five minutes. So the last five minutes, I let me move to the other side. So the geometric side. So the strategy was to compare two relative traceful. So I have introduced the analytic side, which is a, you know, as so you know, oversimplifying way of, it is a periodical limit of the URL checkerlis. When you apply it to this family of test function, then you take a limit. And you take a limit to the geometry side, I have to compute the PID height pair. So, here, let me recall you that as we mentioned earlier, so the PID height parent share the same some feature as the Arctimedian height, namely if you take two cycles represented by some closed sub-scheme of the Shimura variety, suppose they don't intersect in the generic fashion. In the generic fiber. So then the P-adhyte is decomposable. So this is a feature in all the intersection theory in our Kirov or Julie Solin's definition. So here, what happened is if the if you are If you look at the local height parent above a place away from P, then you can more or less relate to the UU height parent, I mean the Archimedean height parent. Namely, it is really a statement about classical intersection theory. So namely, you take the integral model, you have to take a regular integral model of the Shimura variety. Shimura variety to the varietic integers, then you extend your two cycles to this integral model suitably. So then you can take the derived tensor product of the structured shift. Then you can show that this actually gives you a shift with the finite. Core homology, then you take the Euler Pancake characteristic. Anyway, what you get is actually a well, if you choose cycles with integer coefficients, this will give you integers, actually. Okay, then of course you put a log Qv. So that's the feature of height current. So you actually you weight your integers or rational numbers by a log of prime p or power of prime p. Okay, here the difference. Okay, here the difference is we're going to view this log of Q as a number in QP. So I have to actually implicitly choose a PRD log. So it's really the PRD log. So you get it. So you get it pretty much the same as a classical story. So therefore, one could compute in this, for our interest, one can compute the height. One can compute the height parent away from p reduce the question to the archiminating height parent. I mean, you know, the UO so called Julia-Solin theory. So then one can use the arithmetic fundamental lemma which I proved in the case of QP and generalize to arbitrary P-adgenberry field with Mihaj. So we prove this. So, we put this in the hyperspatial case. So, in almost unrefined case, one has to do a refmitting version of transfer conjecture, which relates those intersection number to derivative of the integral attached to non-standard function, I mean non-hyperspatial function. So, this was done in my previous work with Robert Holo-Smithling and also in my You know, different setting by more cases are approved by my current student, Julie Ming Zhang. So that's about away from P. So above P. So now this is the place I have to introduce this additional hypothesis I made earlier. The place V above P will be assumed to be split. So that is consistent to what the analytic side. The analytic side I mentioned earlier, we could only do something, I mean, do we have Then, I mean, do we can only evaluate the limit when p is all the places are split? So, same thing happening here. Uh, so when they is above p, things becomes very complicated, actually. Um, it is like archiminating height, you know, the archiminating place, the local height of archiminating place for the archiminating height, where you have to construct a ground function or ground current. So, here is the p-adic where I mentioned. Here is the P addic, where I mentioned it earlier, it's interchangeing P and infinity. So at the place P, we're only able to prove something in the case when B is split. In this case, we have to apply this sort of ordinary projection of heat operator. So the power of UP operator, then you let N approach infinity. So this was something Perriel used in the case of a GO2. Parallel use in the case of a GO2, but here we have to kind of argue that in this case, under this projection operator, so the limit of the spiodic height at p actually vanishes. So the limit vanishes. So we don't know how to evaluate without taking this limit. But anyway, after taking this limit, again, the spectral side will only return the ordinary representation pi. So the non-linear one will be alleleted. Be alleolated. So, in the end, so we can match the geometric side and an analytic side and prove the theorem here. So, hopefully, that explains all the conditions. Let me finish by saying that. So, the reason I said this theorem, this application I wanted to have at the start, because of this very strong condition that I have to make sure all the conditions. I have to make sure all the representation to be unramified or almost unramified and inert place. If you take a symmetrical power of a unique curve, it's very hard to arrange that, you know, it's symmetrical power will be attached to automotive orientation, which are unramified at all the inert places. Because there's also local global principle obstruction for the existence of formation spaces which are unramified everywhere or almost unramified. I'm also assuming this field extension is a romified. So there's some local reasons for those. So really, I only have this result rather than this theorem. So for that theorem, I need to prove a little more arithmetic transfer conjecture. Okay, so that finishes my talk. Thank you.
