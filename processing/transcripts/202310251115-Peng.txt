So, today I'm going to talk about basically construction of difference variation by complex and some connections with Lagrange multiforms. This is based on joint works with Peter Haydn and with Peter and Frank here. Okay. Okay. So I think because there are lots of So I think because a lot of experts have talked on the closure things. Also, Peter, he just talked about the impact OLARAN complex and also the co-modern things. It really saved me quite a lot. I think I can go through all the things quickly. So I'm going to go through the anyway the motivation, like the closure things very quickly and go to a a very simple review of the differential case. Of the differential case that has been constructed, in fact, many decades ago, and then move to the discrete picture. So, I think this, I mean, it's already very well known. I mean, after this, I mean, in the previous several days that many people have introduced, I'm going to go through this very quickly. That's the well, if we can see it within quad graph equations, then we have the Equations, then we have the closure relations. But I also firstly have the multi-dimensional consistency, but that can be also understood from the Lagrangian point of view by using the closure relation. And this closure relation was firstly established by Sarah and Frank in 2009. And the idea is that if we have an equation on each of the faces, for instance, this Faces, for instance, this face facing us, and this three of us, then who have the L12, L2, L31, and L23. That's the, I mean, they have lag oranges on each face. And you can think of them as, well, the first paper by Sarah and Frank, of course, they didn't really consider them as differential difference forms, but rather as a closure of functions. So you can write down basically as the closure relationship here. Closure relationship here, okay, and it holds on solutions only. And so, for well, differential variation by complex, in fact, it has quite a long history. Well, not quite long, but it's not so already established firstly, well, it's very hard to say maybe it's firstly or not, but anyway, in the 1970s, and first by Winningodor, well, in fact. Well, in fact, he just passed away, I think, during COVID. And also, by Tsuji, a friend from Tsujita is from Lutamika University from Japan, in fact. He's a pure geometer. They use different methods to prove the cohomology of the Russian biocomplex. Well, mostly from pure geometric point of view, but Vinogodov, he himself was using HT. He himself was using it to study symmetries and console laws. And in Smith Order's book, he also includes this chapter on biocomplex stuff. In particular, I think my talk, the notations, we have based on Io Anderson. I mean, Anderson also appeared in Peter's talk. So Anderson was a professor, or still, he's a professor at University of Yota. And not only himself, he also worked with. Not only himself, he also worked with other people on various complexes and applications. And there's also the invariant version, also Peter mentioned that said by Irina Corgan and Peter himself, so the invariant variation by complex when you have a symmetry acting on the, or you have a group acting on the geo-spaces. That's also very interesting. In fact, so many notations. Uh in fact, so many notations Peter have uh introduced. So now we can see the X as the independent variable and the U as the dependent variable, the most general case. So the geometric, or say the geometric setting, the differential equations will be the Z space. Okay, that you have a true bundle and you prolong the sections to higher Z's. That's the continuous setting for understanding the differential equations. Okay. And the solution then can be understood or integrated. Then can be understood or interpreted as a local section of the trivial boundary. And this is the same basically for the infinite jet bundle. So it's the prolongation of these sections to hijacks to include partial derivatives. And we use notation, for instance, NISTAN notation. Peter also uses NISTAN notation, the UG alpha, basically alpha index for the dimension of the dependent variables and GAC index for uh the number of patch derivatives. The number of patch derivatives. But for the discrete cases, then for the continuous, for the differential equations, then the J has components with non-negative integers, but for the difference equation, then you cover all the integers, both negative and positive, also with 0, of course. Okay. And also, Peter used the notation that U sub n, but we use the bright U to denote. The bright u to denote finite many of the dependent variables. So, means for instance u dashed and u dub dashed. And so, on the gel space, the gel space is a differential manifold, but there are constraints. It's not a free manifold. These constraints are usually called the cutting distribution. So, there are some distributions on the tangent space. So, I'd say differential manifold, then we can define the exterior differentiation. Okay, so you can just say. Differentiation. Okay, so you can just expand it according to the local coordinates, but there's a better way to arrange those, I mean, the components. So, usually, what we do is to rearrange it at a total derivative part and with other parts. I mean, we usually say that all those kinds of bases rearrange when you pull down to the base manifold. And those differential forms are usually called cutting forms or contact forms. Okay, and that's the total derivative I just mentioned. So, by doing so, so basically, an exterior differential exterior derivative is split into two parts. Especially this part usually we call the horizontal part, the other part we call the vertical parts. It's horizontal and vertical. But there are several important properties of such kind of splitting. Firstly, we have the basis for the Well, the basis for the one formed on the jet space, but we can also use the horizontal and vertical forms, well, the vertical form that you recall, contact or cutten form, that I say, to denote or also to express all differential forms, differential forms. And if you want to consider how all the forms or higher forms, differential forms, then you can use just the right product. This, I mean, this is very. This is a very important property that the horizontal, so the D square, of course, is very obvious. It's a differential manifold. But by the splinting, this horizontal part and the vortic part also they will also contribute as cold chain complexes. And there's also this anti-communitivity property, as we can see from the graph later. And if we have a k plus one form, then you can just use. Plus one form, then you can just use the, or you can just write it as, for instance, write as a KL, which means horizontal K components and vertical components. And when you use the horizontal operator, you increase the horizontal index. And when you use the vertical operator, you just increase the vertical index. And this will give us a double complex. The reason is because of this dv squared and du squares, dh squared and Squares dh squared and dv squares are both one issue. Okay, so then we have this so-called virus by complex. So we have the horizontal lines by the horizontal operators and the vertical ones, we have the vertical operators. So they have very strong connections with symmetries, conservation laws, and violation problems, also inverse problems, as Peter also mentioned a bit. Also mentioned the beat. This, of course, I think, I mean, if someone I'm not familiar with cohomology, so basically the cohomology Peter used. Oh, I'm showing Steve. So the cohomology is defined as a quotient of, anyway, the differential or the accelerated derivatives here in our case. Okay, so there is very famous results. Usually, well, nowadays we call Wimingox one, two, three line theories. So if we have, if we consider amputee equations, which means we don't consider any equation, in that case, we consider the vibration problems. If we consider vibration problems, only the last column. So this last column of cohomology will be non-trivial. If we consider the normal equations, for instance, Cauchy covered. Equations, for instance, Kosh-Kovalevsky-Commonwealth equations, then the last two columns of cohomology will be non-trivial. And if we consider other equations, the last three columns of cohomology will be non-trivial. Those results are purely proved by using advertisement. So they are called one, two, three-line theories. Well, now we call them in that way. Okay, so the thing is. For the first case, if it's an empty equation, then we can study regression properties. For this, the two-lane theorem, then we can use it to study symmetries and conservation laws. All conservation laws, in principle, can be calculated by using the cohomology. And for the third case, then you usually have to conceive case by case. It's much more complicated. Yeah. Yes, always for the horizontal ones. Yes, verticals are always true. Yes. Thanks. Okay, so today we only consider the empty case, which means the one line theorem, because we know the last column of the model which is non-trivial. So in fact, you can add another column to make the whole complex trivial. Cole complex trivial. This is called the augmented violation by complex. In fact, this boundary one is called the Bola-Lagrange complex that Peter just mentioned. You see, we also need the same notations, F1, F2. So here we need to define this. This is the projection. The projection is defined in this way. Well, in broken language, you can think of it as integration by pass. And there's a joint operator. And this or joint operator, so if you have a differential operator, you can calculate or joint by also integration by pass. The important thing is here, usually p inform, p is the dimension of the independent variable. So like range are here, and all of the equations are here, and inverse problems are there. So if your equations are given, if we wanted to study the inverse program, for instance, the Hamilton's condition, it's there. And the cosmetology. Okay, and the conservation loads will be the p minus one geoforms. And our motivations were to study symplectic and multi-symplectic structures. So in fact, if we think of multi-symplectic structures, they are in fact here. So it's not necessarily on the Oval Lagrange complex, but the whole thing. So I think I spent too much time on this case. So basically, anyway, we were. So basically, anyway, for instance, anyway, these properties must be satisfied, otherwise, they are not complexes. I'll leave this alone. And in particular, in the three-dimensional case, then I think in fluid mechanics, then we have the gradients, the curve divergence, all operates together, all agrange coefficient, the Hermetic condition for the inverse problems. They're all in the boundary complex, which is called the Oral Lagrange complex. And I already mentioned that the Lagrangians. Mentioned that the Lagrangians and the conservation law terms conditions are all on the Relshby complex. And now Lagrangian curforms related to interpretability, they should be also on the oral and orange complex, which means somewhere between, well, well, I say before the p formed, so on the left. Yeah, so for the difference case, in fact, well, during my PhD, Well, during my PhD, we started to concede the using algebraic geometry to study signatures and the concentration laws. But unfortunately, it took us almost 10 years to get the paper ready. So this year, finally, we got the paper available at El Cab. So if you are interested, you can have a look on that. So for the defense case, there are a lot of challenges, in fact. So first, we need So, first, we need a discrete version of the jet spaces, discrete counterpart of jet spaces, and how to arrange the differential and difference forms to get the bicomplex stuff. And we also need to calculate the cohomologies. So, this with ticks are all finished, but I mean, this two-line theorem and three-line theorem are still open questions. The reason is in the continuous case, to show the two-line or three-line CMG, we need the common. Line CMG, we need the cohomology for differential operators, but in the discrete case, you don't have differential operators, you have to think of differential operators. They are, of course, counterparts, but still you need to change a bit. And I think I will go to this part very quickly. So, what is the discrete counterpart of jet spaces? So, of course, we know that on jets we have shifts, but Yes, we have shifts, but think of the continuous case at a single x, single local x, the independent variable, you will have all the derivatives, rather than not only the section u, but you have u dash all the others. But usually in the discrete case, we just think of n, you have u n, but at the next point you have u n plus 1. But that's not really the counterpart of the jet spaces. You have to move u n u, u n, u n plus 1, for instance, or the other to a single base point. To a single base point. That's the exact discrete counterpart of jet spaces. Well, I will leave this already. I don't have really time to explain this part. So basically, at each point, you will have the same space, same space, which means isomorphic to other continuous space at other base points. And to construct a connection between them. So for that purpose, in fact, we introduced what we called translation. What we call translation, but in fact, it's isomorphism between different j's. It's a bit different from shifts. Shifts is at the single base point, but still it's moving from one base point to another one. Okay, I'm going to skip this hardware quickly. If you well, so basically it'll be different to the pulling back of the uh of the isomorphism between different base points. Between different base points. And I will need the shift operator, and this is the forward difference, shift minus identity, the same notation as Pavel explained or introduced. And the adjoint, basically in the discrete case, then the summation by pass, or it's the counterpart of integration by pass. If you summation by part, you get the adjoint of differential operators. Okay. And in the D3 case, still on differential form. This will case still have differential forms because the dependent variables are considered as continuous, and we also have difference forms. For difference forms, we will use the notation from Mauspeat and Haydn. Also, this was already introduced in Kupshmid's book, but of course he uses different notations. And then we have external differential operator. This is totally the horizontal part. Horizontal part, we also have the vertical part that will be the uh the continuous or differential case. So, I mean, this will be very similar that we have the horizontal components and have the vertical components, and all other properties are very similar to, okay, those are the definitions. I'm going to skip this. So, the properties are very similar to the continuous cases. So, still we have the closure, or say the Have the closure, also, the management of the dh squared, dv squared, also the anti-conductivity structure. Okay, so if we define the x, well, we would say we don't know what's name should they give it, for instance, x-seminarian differential difference, then the delta squared, of course, it should be zero because of these properties. Okay, so I'm going to just skip this. Okay, so I'm going to skip this part a bit. If I need it, I'm going to explain it. But this is also a very important or very interesting result. In fact, this was noticed by Jinping during my survival. So it was already 10 years ago. So Jinping was my examiner. So he mentioned this looks like a lead difference. And we checked, yes, it was a new difference. So it's the difference counterpart of lead derivative. Okay, so now we have the Okay, so now we have the I only show the augmented difference variation by accomp by the convex. Basically, we have almost everything, or say exactly everything for the counterparts of the differential case. We have difference forms. Forgive me that I use the same notation as Omega. I mean, there's no real space to put the triangle thing. So the differential, so the Lagrangian forms, Lagrangian density things, okay? And if you use this operator, you get a discrete orange. This operator, you get a discrete orange equations, and you can get discrete Hamsk, discrete inverse programmes, say the Hammond conditions, and conservation modes will be here, and discrete syntactic form will be there. Okay, theory, one-line theory is somehow easy because if we just modify the bicomplex, then we can show that the whole bicomplex. Show that the whole bicomplex is exact, then it means only the last colon is non-trivial cohomology. So that's kind of simple. So this bit, orange, this bit, in fact, was already proved by Kupschmid in his book, and the whole boundary orange one, which proved by Peter and Liz in their paper, I think 2000. I think 2000, I can't remember, 2004. Okay, so basically, now we just extend everything to the whole byte complex. Okay, so this I already explained. And for the two-line theorem, in fact, that's a very interesting result. I think perhaps not so well received in the Kubernetes group, is that symmetries, we know symmetries can be understood as. Understood as well, the characteristics are in the kernel of the mineralization operator of differential equations. But from the two-line theorem, in fact, conservation laws are in the kernel of the joints of the mineralization operators. This was proved, I mean, by using the advertise geometry. So if your equation is normal, as I said, or Kochka Levsky, then the construction laws you can systematically calculate them by using the Than by using the linearization proton, in fact. So if you think of this H1 equation, also I think Chen also mentioned, in fact, if we take this Laground, well, if we take this Lagrange, then finally, the equation you get is not only on the quote graph, but two pieces, the three-like form of the equation. And so we can. And so you can write down the equation write down the Lagrangian as a Lagrangian form and use the interoperator you get the display around the equation, but I say it is not this equation, but the three-legged form of this equation. Okay. That's I will write as the EL, the same notation as Peter used. Okay, so this could theorem then also can be understood because. As I say, it can be understood because there's a correspondence between signatures and the conservation laws. Basically, the two-line theorem on this variation by complex is the extension of Norton's theorem. Because all energy, if the equations are all orange equations, then the linear addition operators are self-adjoint, which means symmetries and equal to consolation modes. Their colours are the same. But it's not necessary because, for instance, we also have skin self-adjoints. Have schemes self-adjoint operator instance, but they are not all language equations. Still, their symmetries are equal to conservation law. So, somehow an extension of the notice theorem, I mean, the two lengthy. And here, to understand a different, I'll say anyway, the conservation laws, as I said, the conservation law, of course, it's a divergence, a management of a divergence, but that can be understood by using differential forms. This is, as I said, already explained, that's a P minus one real form. Span that is a p minus one real form on the variation by complex. And this management basically means the arrangement of the divergence. Variation symmetry also can be totally understood from coordinate-free manner. Basically, this is the coordinate-free manner of the formula. Peter introduced the PRL acting or PRE acting plus the divergence equal to divergence. So the divergence. Divergence, the divergence variations each. That is, it's a coordinate-free expression for that. And then we have the novel theorem. So as Peter said, integration by parts, this is how you integration by part. How you integrate by parts? So just two lines, in fact, it's very, very simple. Okay. So I think I don't have... Okay, I still have time, so it's okay. So this is quite well. In fact, I mean. Well, in fact, I mean, it's not very recent, but this draft we considered many years ago, I think it was already 2015 or 2016 that we discussed about the connection between bicomplex and Lagrangian K-forms with Frank. And we did write a draft, but it's still a draft. So this is, as I already said, So the sense, as I already said, the k forms, we can think of them as k data forms. So they are on the bottom of the bicomplex, basically. Okay. So if we take this piece outside, so that would be k minus 1, k 0, and there should be another direction we go to k plus 1 0. I ignore that direction. This is the vertical part. Okay, so with this k for So, with this k-form, if we want to get the equations of motion, there should be another direction coming out, the third direction coming out. And this will be the, well, I think you'll call it the multi-timal, multi-ola orange operators, or all of equations will be there. Well, but still, there's still something that we, I think, at least, I think this talk is way out of date. So, there's still something I. So there's still something I don't really understand. It's the boundary things. I mean, Matt also talked about the continuous cases that you have the multi-orange equations. So you have the orange equations with the boundary paths. The boundary paths, are they totally included in this of K1 or are they not? Still, I don't know. I should have checked more examples, in fact. Okay. In fact, in In Corga and Peter was a 2003 paper, when they were studying the invariantized, or say the invariant version of the biocomplex, they also have the third direction. But the difference is that the third direction goes to a Lie group or Lie algebra and they call that the virational, I think virational so now we call bi complex, I think they call it virational tree complaints. They call it a direction of chi complex. It's a sub-direction, but you know, of course, there's also a sub-direction, but it's a bit different from that aspect. Okay, so the discrete source, or of course, there should be also a continuous version of it. So the Multi-Land operators, if you use that, you will get the equations, but there should be also other boundary things. That's something we have to consider. So, the closure relation then can fully understood just by using the horizontal operator. So, it looks like a divergence, isn't it? The closure form I showed you for the equation is nothing but a divergence, or say the divergence-free, or say the vanishment of the divergence form. So, basically, we'll write it all in the horizontal operator. Okay, also, you should kind of. Okay. Also, uh you should consider that also you should have put them on solutions rather than 3D solutions of the uh equation. Okay, so this is the example the H1 equation without this closure. So basically you just write them as a two-form embedded in a three-dimensional space. Okay, so you have that one, that two, and the three, so it means that the independent, the dimension of the independent variables are three-dimensional. By the form of Are three-dimensional. Now the form itself is a two-form. Okay, so it's multi-form. And the closing can be simply simply just diluting this relation to be dh triangle R2 equals V or that would be declared. Yeah. Not necessary. Not necessary. K is, as I said, any smaller than P. Yeah, any integer smaller than P. You know, this is just an example. Yeah, this is just an example. It's not necessary. Not necessarily P manage one. Yeah, thanks. Okay. And then also, I mean, because I'm in the well symmetry community, so it's Uh, symmetric community. So, it's also very, I mean, it would be very interesting to consider what is the uh Norton's theorem for multi-original equations. What are symmetries of the multi or multi-time original equations? Of course, locally, you can calculate them just using traditional symmetry methods. But how to understand those symmetries and conservation laws on the well, on the coordinate free method. On the coordinate free manner. Okay, symmetries, then it's still similar that we can just use well, so Peter already explained. So we use the unificator generator, and this is the evolutionary form, which means that there should be another total derivative part, but usually we think of that part as trivial. When we consider symmetries, we can equivalently consider evolutionary symmetries. symmetries. And here, here is the characteristic of the symmetry. Basically, you prolong the whole, prolong the infinitesimal derivator to the whole jet space in the continuous case. Now you prolong the whole thing to the whole lattice in the discrete case. And the symmetry condition is this one. This means the Lagrangian or Lagrangian multiforms are invariant with respect to this. Invariants with respect to this group or the d at row. But on the coordinate-free manner, then this is how we write it. But a bit more general than this case. It also says that this is the divergence variational case. Divergence comes from here. So it's ignis some eta. This ignites some eta form such that this holes. But if we purely think of this part, then the right. But if we purely think of this part, then the right hand side will be deal. It's a bit more general, more general case of this one. It's the divergence case. And to get the notice here, in fact, it's very similar. How we did for the usual one, not the k-form one, rather than the, I'd say, the conventional variational problems, which means when k is p minus one, in fact, it's In fact, it's an integrational part, but still similar. We can do that in a very similar manner. But, as I say, there are still something I don't really quite understand. It's about the boundary path. How are we going to deal with this boundary path? If they are coming from the discrete or continuous alliance operators, then it's very natural we can do that. If they are not coming from there, which means if there are extra conditions, then we have to take. Extra conditions, then we have to take care of them separately, it should be more complicated. That's I still don't really understand. I need some examples to think about the details. Okay, and this only will be the construction, but written in a differential form. Okay. Okay, so this is the H1 equation. This is the H1 equation, but this second-point equation, then it means it's written in the three-legged form. The lagrange two form I already write it down in the previous page. And the multi-language equation basically uses the multi-multi-time language operator. You get those three of them. The same is, you see, they are different, so which means they are independent. They are different, so which means they are independent. So, finally, you will get three equations simultaneously. Okay, because if this vanishes, you will get the three equations simultaneously, so which means you got the three H1 equations on different phases of the cube. And to get a concentration of, for instance, if you can see the vibrational symmetry, but of course, you have to calculate the symmetries first, right? You have to use some methods you can use in. Methods you can use in the method, for instance, you can use a traditional simple method. But I'm just choose one of the simplest one. I mean, you can simply calculate this. Well, that's one, two, three directions of the discrete well, discrete variables. And then we just substitute this characteristic, well, this is called characteristic. Calcristic, well, this is called calcristic into oh, sorry, another pitch. Into here or there. But the good thing that for this near H1 equation, there are no boundaries, right? No boundary equations. So at the moment, we don't have to consider this part for the H1 equation. Okay, this is the symmetry condition. So you can verify that by yourself. And then notice here, we give And then notice here we give us the constraints for which is the omega. So, how it looks like this is how it looks like. So, if you assume omega, it's a k minus two vehicle form here. So it's technically k is two, so it's a one vehicle. So it's which means there's no vertical part and it's one form along the horizontal part. So it's one form. A1, a2. one form a1 a2 let's if if we assume that a1 a2a3 are the uh are the components for the one form then we can get the concern rules of course this a1a23 can be calculated i didn't show the their formula but you can calculate them from this identity by choosing q as this i mean in this form the substitute inside you can get omega you can get the components and if a sub the substitute the mean side And if you substitute them inside, you can get, in fact, well, three conservation laws simultaneously, because you see that's what the real components. The real components, for instance, if you consider one, two, the one, two case, then it's H1 equation on the facing S. And then the other one is zero, then this is exactly the first index direction and the second index direction. Index direction and second index direction, which means you get one conservation over the H1, and this is another one for the H1, but written in different coordinates only. But basically, finally, we get three of them. Okay. And if there are boundary conditions, then you also have to take care of the boundaries carefully, the boundary equations carefully. And these boundary equations, well, this is because we integrate by part, but in the decase, we assume everything by part. The dispute case, we sum everything by part, but that's why we have to sum this part. Sorry, we have to sum by parts. So, which means that we have to move this Sj to in front of the boundary equations. We've got the adjoint of Sj, which is S minus J. So, that's something we have to take care. So, this FVO will also contribute to the conservationals. Then finally, we should get F plus, let me see, F minus F V O at the console. me see f minus f dual adds the construction okay so uh well so so you see that as i said i still don't don't really really understand all the details about the boundary equations at this talk still are out of date so how to uh for instance how to achieve everything in a coordinate free manner so of course we want some examples we can do this kind of things uh using log coordinates but how to Using local coordinates, but how to understand them by purely using the differential forms, by purely using the co-models stuff. So that's still something I don't really understand at the moment. There are also other questions. For instance, now we had the third direction, okay? We had the third direction. We have multi-orange equations, we have the multi or multi-time orange equations, we have the multi-time. Let me see where we are at. Let me see, where are they? For instance, so this is the original. Well, this is not original. Let me see. Well, this is the k when k equals p minus one case, okay? And this is the original p is, and this is the new third direction, and this was the all-around complex. Okay, but this there is a third direction. So, in the third direction, for instance, if we want to see, I understand inverse problems for Inverse problems for multi-time orange equations, we will need the cohomology. But still, we don't know if this by complex is, or say this new direction, if it is exact or not. We don't have such results at the moment. I suppose that we can construct, for instance, a homotopy to show that. But it's just what I think at the moment. Also, to Also, to as I said in the discrete case, still we don't have the two-line theorem available, but I guess, for instance, if you wanted to determine the integrability of discrete equations or partial difference equations, then we need the closure relation, but this closure relation may be related to two-line theorem because at the beginning we have an equation, right? We have an equation rather than the Radiation process. Rather than the right action principle. If we put the equation into the system, into the consideration, it means that we have a constraint on the battery complex at the beginning. But that's a two-line theorem. Still, we don't quite understand the cohomology for the discrete case. But the continuous case, it's already proved. Also, this is just, I mean, yesterday I did this one, so because when I gave the talk last time, so people were talking about clothing relations. People were talking about closure relation, but suddenly now we are talking about double views and even more views. So still, well, I think it's not very clear how to understand those kinds of properties on the API account. So I think I'm going to summarize very quickly that basically what we do to firstly introduce the discrete counterpart of jet spaces. Jet spaces on that we can construct the whole language for the bi-complex things, well, also the algebraic geometric study for the discrete, well, or for different equations. But still, there are lots of things that are still not understood, but the good thing that we can totally understand differential, sorry, vibrational problems, discrete vibrational problems. For instance, if we think If we think of those a lot of, well, for instance, including KDV Cameron's home, if we think of those multi-symplectic systems, we can understand the numeric methods by preserving their multi-symplectic structure. So that's called geometric integrators. Now we can fully understand multi-symplectic structures on the bioconfects, for instance, if we start from variation principles. So I think that would be all of my talk. Thanks a lot for your attention. Thanks a lot for your attention.
