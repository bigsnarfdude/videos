Okay, let me just put the in the presentation mode. Okay, that's so our last talk of this today's sessions is from Tatiana Hugashin Nak. I always say Tatiana, okay. It's about canonical analysis of general relativity with weakly isolated horizon as an internal boundary. As an internal boundary, please. Yes, thank you so much. So, good evening. In this last talk, I will change the topics and go back to maybe to the first talk, today's talk, which was about general relativity, at least at the beginning. And I would like to talk about, well, the canonical Well, the canonical analysis of general relativity in the first order formalism, but with a special interest in space-times that have boundaries. And this is the work done in collaboration with Alejandro Corricci and Juan Daniel Reyes. So we were considering in this work the Work, the first order of gravity, but in self-dual variables. And as I said, we were interested in space-times that have an internal boundary, and that internal boundary is a horizon. So, this horizon is a weakly isolated horizon, so we have to define boundary conditions for this paper. For this space-time, and perform a canonical analysis and analyze the impact of these boundary conditions in the whole procedure of the canonical analysis of the theory. And then try to recognize which are the boundary degrees of freedom of theory and to Theory and to rid of the energy of associated oblique isolated corridors. So we will start with a phase space with some symplectic structure which we have to define and consider a class of differentiable functions, functionals, such that Functionals such that this fundamental equation is satisfied. And we will see that in the case of the theories that are defined in regions with boundaries, we could have some boundary contribution to this symplectic structure that would imply also the possibility of the boundary contribution to this differential. This is the differential in the phase space. space and uh and uh in that way we like uh um expand extend the the class of function nodes that are permitted in phase space um we will see that we will obtain some in some cases uh some boundary contribution to the hamiltonian for example of the theory and we will see that in some cases In some cases, we cannot obtain that contribution. So, the starting point in this canonical analysis is a canonical action that, like in a general case, when we have, for example, a connection and a corresponding canonical momenta can be written in this way. So, this is like a kinetic term in the action that. In the action that contains typically a term defined on sigma on some Cauchy surface, and in some cases can contain a term on the boundary. This term can appear from various reasons. For example, if the original action has some boundary term that has time derivatives, or for example, when we when we perform a Lexander transformation on the covariant action and obtain a canonical action, the canonical action can in the process obtain this contribution on the boundary. So there will be some well original bulk degrees of freedom and some boundary degrees of freedom that And some boundary degrees of freedom that can be induced from bulk, but can be independent. So this kinetical term in the canonical action defines the symplectic structure of the theory that in the same way that can contain also the contribution from the boundary. And the Hamiltonian equations of motions are given in this way, where this is the corresponding. Where this is the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. So, as we said, as I said, there are two possibilities depending on the form of the canonical action. So, the canonical structure may not have any contribution from the boundary, even if the region of integration has it. So, this is the standard registered. The standard regular Tatel Bohm scenario where we, for example, make a variation of the Hamiltonian and ask that all the boundary terms should vanish. So we impose some boundary conditions, for example. And this is the case that we were looking at, for example, in Maxwell coupled with Pontfryagin or general relativity, asymptotically flat boundary conditions. Boundary conditions, but with no internal boundary. But also, omega can have a non-vanishing contribution from the boundary. And also, in that case, there are some boundary contributions to Hamiltonian vector fields, to Poisson brackets. And examples are, for example, Maxwell coupled to Chain Simons that is defined on the boundary of our space-time. Space-time, or the example that I'm going to that we are going to see today: the first order gravity with an isolated horizon is an internal boundary. So I will tell you a little bit about the definition of weakly isolated horizon. Then we will see like the form of a canonical action instead of dual variables, which is, of course, the linear. Of course, the linear combination of constraints plus some boundary term, and then we'll see that the boundary phase space is not uniquely determined. And we distinguish four cases. And then the question is, but how can we recognize what are really our degrees of freedom at the boundary? And another question that appeared in the Another question that appeared in this route. Let's say it's if we can always obtain energy as a boundary term of the Hamiltonian, because this is a diffeomorphism invariant theory. So the conserved quantities are boundary terms, take the form of boundary terms. And typically, energy is a boundary term obtained, for example, the infinity, which will be AD. Infinity, which will be ADM energy or already at the horizon, and we will see that in some cases we just don't have any boundary term in Hamiltonian on the horizon. So isolated horizons are quasi-local generalization of event horizons that are modeling black holes in equilibrium. And they are generalization in the sense that our space-time does That our space-time does not even have to have any Killing vector fields. And they were introduced more than 20 years ago, and they were like very important for the calculating entropy of black holes. And here we will perform a Hamiltonian analysis of n-action in September variables with a weakly isolated horizon. Isolated horizon as our internal boundary. So, the original papers that were written like more than 20 years ago were formulated in terms of isolated horizon that I will define well just right now, where weekly isolated horizon is like is just putting less restrictions on the boundary conditions and permitting more and more. Conditions and permitting more and more geometries that are compatible with the boundary conditions. So we start like defining a non-expanding horizon, like a null hypersurface in our space-time, and that is diffeomorphic to the product of S2 times R and where the Where the expansion, so these null hypersurfaces are ruled by null geodesics, and the expansion of any null normal to this non-expanding horizon should vanish. This is the main point in the definition of a non-expanding horizon. And also, the Einstein's equation should hold. On the boundary. So, like we can see, for example, this L is one vector that generates, for example, this null geodesics that generates the whole horizon. And so it is usual to use human parentals basis when we work in this context with null. Work in this context with null hypersurfaces. So we have to introduce transverse null direction in order to define a projector on this hyper surface that is perpendicular to L and to K. So, in terms of this basis, we can define a pullback metric on this. On this surface, a transface area to form a rotation one form, which will be a very important object, the part of the connection on the horizon, and also another part of the connection, which is called transverse connection potential. So the definition of a weakly isolated horizon is that it is a null hyper. It is a null hypersurface with a class of null vectors, null normals, such that this part of the connection is invariant under the Li dragging along the horizon. So, and the two normals belong to the same class. Normals belong to the same class if one of them is the multiple of the other for some constant. It turned out it was important to choose some class of non-normals. And this class also singles out a unique one form, which is a part, as I said, a connection. This condition is equivalent to requiring that the extreme curvature. X-rings in curvature to be time independent on delta. Time independent means it just does not change along this null geodesics. This condition is sufficient to ensure that the surface gravity is constant on a weakly isolated horizon, which is the zeroth law of black hole mechanics. So these are all very nice. So, these are all very known results. So, in order to define our action principle, I just defined our boundary conditions. For our action principle, we need to, of course, define the variables that we are going to use, the region of integration, and the boundary conditions of the fields. So, we will use the first order action for private instance. First, order action for gravity and self-dual variables, where Ïƒ are these anti-Hermitian soldering form for SL2C spinners. And F is a curvature of self-dual connection, SL2C self-dual connection. This is one way to write an action for brevity, which was one, let's say, the way Let's say the way that was introduced, maybe probably more than 20 years ago. Now we usually use like tetrads instead of soldering forms and usually work with the real variables. But in this case, we start with this action. Action and its canonical form is like this one. So this is a kinetical term which we see that has only contribution on sigma, so it only has a contribution from the bulk originally. This part will be a Hamiltonian, a proportional to Hamiltonian, which is like a linear combination of the constraints. So of course we are doing a Of course, we are doing the three plus one, the composition of the space-time and the projecting all the fields to spatial surface sigma and the normal to sigma. And in the process of writing the canonical action in this form, we obtain a boundary term. There is a boundary term in infinity. boundary term in infinity, but we are not going to consider it here because it's not relevant and it's very well understood. And we are just keeping here the boundary term on the horizon. So this boundary term has this form and taking account our boundary conditions, it can be written in this form, where T is is proportional to L and omega E and V are parts of the connection defined on delta. So it turns out that this term it and this is a two form of a surface on this two sphere. So this This looks very innocent, but it turns out that it can be seen like in various manner, like just like a boundary term in the Hamiltonian, or it can be rewritten as a contribution to the kinetic term in the canonical action, that then it will contribute to the boundary, to the kinetical term on the boundary, or it can be seen as a mixture of both. Or it can be seen as a mixture of both. And these different options mean the different choices of boundary phase space and the corresponding Hamilton. So in this first case, when we take that there is no boundary term in the symplicat structure, it means that all the boundary terms that appear The boundary term that appeared in the original calonic election, we just put it as a part of the Hamiltonian. So it turns out that the variation of this Hamiltonian has a boundary time. So if and it turns out that since the symphletic structure does not have any boundary contribution, this variation has to vanish somehow. But that would be like imposing too much. would be like imposing too much restricting too much our geometries but the typical thing is to introduce about a counter term such that the variation of the sum of our Hamiltonian in this counter term vanish. It turns out that at the end we can find the counter term. We have some additional condition that we have to fulfill and the total Hamiltonian is the sum of constraints which is typical for Constraints, which is typical for gravity, plus a boundary term that is like a correct known expression for the energy of an isolated horizon. But in this case, there are no boundary degrees of freedom and well, nothing is happening on the boundary. The other way to see these boundary terms is to like is to like introduce potentials, this real part and imaginary part of potentials, such that their lead derivative along t is defined in these two different ways. And then to introduce a part of the boundary terms that were the sum of these two, we can just take the sum of these two and write it like the all of put it all using this relation. Using this relation in the kinetic term in the canonical Hamiltonian, and then it contributes to the boundary contribution, it has boundary contribution in the symplectic structure. So in this way, the Hamiltonian is only the sum of the constraints. The boundary The boundary equations of motions are trivially satisfied. Everything seems to be well defined, but the Hamiltonian has no boundary term, which is like that was like strange for us because then we said, well, how can we determine the energy associated to horizons in this case? And we cannot obtain. And we cannot obtain it in the usual way. And of course, there is like a mixture, and one part of the boundary term is taken like a boundary term of the Hamiltonian, and the other part contributes to the boundary term in the symplectic structure. And this is like a mixed case, which we call mixed case. And this was like an original case that was considered in this paper like. Paper like more than 20 years ago. And it turns out that we also need to add a counter term to make everything differentiable. But now we can make it, everything is well defined, we can obtain a good expression for the mass. And we also have a U2 gauge symmetry on the horizon, which we didn't have in the previous cases. Cases and in the fourth case, we have some similar problems because we cannot obtain the energy as a boundary term. At the end, I only want to mention that in the case of the spherically symmetric, weakly isolated horizon with fixed area. It has been shown that this relation is true. So, the duration relation about the curvature of these two spheres and element of two area. And it permits to thanks to that, we can write the boundary symbolic structure in this way that corrects correct. This way that corresponds to John-Simon's theory. And in this case, also we can obtain a generator of tangential diffeomorphisms. So this is like the first case that was really analyzed with details, and Alejandro Korici will take probably this as his starting point for his tomorrow's talk. So the original pandemic. So the origin of boundary terms in symplatic structure is twofold, as I said at the beginning. In this case, the starting covariant action does not have any boundary terms, but they appear in the corresponding canonical action. And this boundary term can be interpreted in the various ways that I try to explain here. To explain here. And sometimes as a part of a boundary term of the Hamiltonian, some part is a part of boundary term of the sympletic structure. And we really don't have at this level, let's say kinematical, classical level, any criteria which will tell us which one of these four approaches is the correct starting point for the quantization. Point for the quantization, for example, of the theory. So this work can be extended to host action and, for example, to rotating for acid. So these are some of the works that were important for us and the latest works that we did about this subject. So thank you. So thank you. Thank you, Datiana. So are there questions? Usually in the last talk, everybody wants to take dinner. Yes, I imagine. Questions from Zoom? Something from Zoom? Okay, let me think, Tantiana, again. Okay, thank you so much. I will stop sharing. Thank you for saving the time.
