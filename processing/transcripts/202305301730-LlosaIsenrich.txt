       All right, um, right, so this means that equivalently that the universal cover is contractible. And when you look at groups arising as fundamental groups, When you look at groups arising as fundamental groups of CW complexes, you'll see that a generating set for the fundamental group is given by the one skeleton, while a presentation is given by the two skeleton. And conversely, if you start with a group with some presentation, you can build a classifying space by taking a zero cell, attaching one cells for all the generators, and then gluing in disks for the relations, which shows that G is finitely generated if and only if there is a Kg1 with finite one skeleton and G is finitely presented if and only if there is a Kg1 with finite two scale. So, these rather algebraic properties of groups translate into geometric properties of classifying spaces, which are somehow spaces that are naturally associated with the group insofar that they are unique up to a homotopy equivalence. And once you realize this, on the geometric side, it makes perfect sense to go on and say, like, what about asking that a group has? Or, what about asking that a group has a finite n skeleton for some classifying space? And thus motivates the definition of property fn, so g is fn, if and only if there is a kg1 with finite n skeleton. So with finitely many cells up to dimension n. And for complete. And for completeness, let me also mention two other properties that I may occasionally say. So we say g is f infinity, if and only if there's a classifying space with finitely many cells in all dimensions, or one can show that that's equivalent to g being fn for all n. And g is f of finite type if and only if there is a finite kg1. So kg1 with finitely many cells. Sorry, they are in the wrong order. Finite kg1. And as Kai Uber told us, in general, it's most theories the tool to get groups with weird finiteness properties. There are some groups where you can do it in a more hands-on way. So maybe, okay, maybe the first question you can ask at this point, since a group is completely described by presentation, are there even groups? described by presentation are there even groups that have n minus one not f n for n bigger equal to three and as we saw in the talk earlier there are um and as far as i know historically the first examples were due to stallings for n equal three and then bury for all bigger n um so that's for us i think in sixty three and then very generalize those to all n For all n. And what they showed is that, I mean, it was phrased, the groups were constructed in a slightly different way, but now we know that what these groups they produce are is you take a product of n two generated free groups and you map it onto z by just taking a free generating set of all the factors and mapping them all onto one fixed generator of z. And then you take the kernel of this, and that's f n minus 1 not f n. And to give you one group where you can sort of see the whole proof of how you get fn minus 1, not fn in quite an explicit way, let me just sketch how you would prove this here. Well, it's not the original proof, but there is an argument by, well, I learned it from Breits, and I think it appears in one of his papers. So if you take the projection here onto The projection here onto the nth factor, so that's the factor generated by a n and b n, then this is the free product of two copies of z generated by a n and b n. And you can pull back this free product decomposition. And so you can pull it back under the inclusion of SPN in F in the product, and then what you get is that. And what you get is that the restriction of PN to SPN, well, gives you an amalgamated free product decomposition of SBN as so this is SBN. As SPN as follows. So you get a product of n minus one three groups, the first n minus one factors amalgamated over the natural inclusion of sp n minus one with itself. So and then you can do an inductive argument. So you you observe that FB1 is the infinite generated free group sitting inside F2 as kernel of the map to Z. So H1 of SB1 with Q coefficients is infinite dimensional. And then what you see is that when you can construct a classifying space for this by just gluing two classifying spaces of groups of Of groups of finite type, so with finitely many cells along an interval times SBN minus one, and SBN minus one has finitely many n minus two cells. Cross it with an interval, you get finitely many n minus one cells up to gluing things. And therefore, you get inductively that S B n is F n minus one. Fn minus one, and you also get inductively not fn by doing the same decomposition and using a Maevier-Torres argument. So there's some groups where you get around most theory. That's just to give you a very concrete example, the details are an exercise. How these groups can arise. Now, of course, now we do know how to use Besweener-Brady-Moss theory to prove the same result as right. And so these were historically the first examples. So, these were historically the first examples, and since then, many others have been constructed. So, let me just mention sort of one big breakthrough in particular, because it produced groups with various different algebraic finiteness properties were the Beswina-Brady groups and the related or the Beswina-Brady-Moss theory that allowed us to produce them. But we have many more, like we have all the Houghton groups and variations thereof. Variations thereof. We now have simple groups with finite or finiteness type of n minus 1, not fn. And we have fundamental groups of convect Keller manifolds. So we have huge families of such groups that show that they can come in all kinds of flavors. Right, so this is what I want to tell about finiteness properties. Oh, and I should say these are quasi-isometry invariants, so they show up very naturally in geometric group theory. They allow us to. Naturally, in geometric group theory, they allow us to distinguish groups up to quasi-isometry. And the second topic that shows up in the theorem are hyperbolic groups. So let me just remind you briefly what they are. They are groups that act geometrically on delta hyperbolic metric spaces, and the delta hyperbolic metric Spaces and the delta hyperbolic metric space for some delta bigger equals zero is a geodesic metric space so that all triangles are delta thin. And the thing to think of is, well, if you're a differential geometry, you want to think of the hyperbolic plane or real hyperbolic end space. If you're more of a group theorist, I guess, or geometric group theorist, maybe you want to think of tree-like things. The definition of delta thin is that whenever you think of the term, Thinness, that whenever you take a geodesic triangle and you take one of its sides, say that's one, then it's contained in the delta neighborhood of the other two sides. So that's definitely. And so this definition goes back to Gromov in the 80s. And he also defined what a delta hyperbolic group should be. That should just be a group that acts geometrically on one of these spaces, so properly discontinuously and co-compactly. And one way to check this is by looking at the Cayley graph with respect to any finite generating set. And being hyperbolic for a group is equivalent to the Cayley graph being hyperbolic. Right. Right, so that explains all the words in the theorem. So now you should be able to understand what the theorem says. I haven't motivated why I care or why someone may want to care about this. Someone may want to care about us. So let me do this next. But let me start by giving some examples of delta hyperbolic groups. So triangles should be, geodesic triangles should be tree-like. So let's start with an easy example. Let's start with the free group, which acts on its Caleb graph for any free generating set. Which, of course. Is a tree of degrees to n and thus a zero hyperbolic, so the group is hyperbolic. And then if you have more of a background in geometry, I already said you should be thinking of the hyperbolic plane or something like this. So, in general, fundamental groups by comparing with the hyperbolic plane. Fundamental groups by comparing with the hyper triangles with those in the hyperbolic plane of closed Riemann manifolds with negative sectional curvature hyperbolic and in particular today I will be interested in one specific kind of such One specific kind of such fundamental groups of closed manifolds with negative sectional curvature. These are the ones that arise as lattices in isometry groups of hyperbolic spaces say gamma in either PON one which is Which is the identity component of the isometry group of real hyperbolic n-space, or PUN1, which is the robots of holomorphic isometries of complex hyperbolic space. And these act on the respective spaces by isometries. And the point is that these spaces are delta hyperbolic spaces. Are delta hyperbolic spaces. So the way, and they are constructed in the same way. So if you know how you construct real hyperbolic space, then you know how to construct complex hyperbolic space. So the way this works is that you take Cn plus one and you look, I mean, for complex hyperbolic space, and on it, you look at the form of permission form of signature N1, which maps L. Maps element z w to the sum from i equal one to n over z i and the conjugates of w i. And then for the last coordinate, you put a negative sign. And now inside the space, you can look at the set of points on which this form evaluates negatively. So you can look at So you can look at the Z and Cn plus one so that this emission form is negative. There's a subset of, this is a cone in C up n plus one. And you can projectivize this. So you can take complex, you can view this by taking lines in the space as a as a subset of n-dimensional complex. N-dimensional complex projective space. And then there's a way to restrict this for or to induce a metric, a Hermitian metric starting from DAS Hermitian form of signature and one on DAS projectivization, which is again, which will give you a color metric on there. Is negative one? Yeah, because we projectivize, so we take that. Yeah, asking, is that the same as not projectivizing and that looking like this? Yeah, you can, it's the same space up to the right identifications, yes. And yeah, this is another way to do it. And thus has a natural identification with. Identification with the unit ball of dimension n sitting inside Cn. And then there is something, the metric on this that you get by restricting this metric in the right way is a metric that when you take its real part will be a Riemannian metric with sectional curvature pinched between, I think, here minus four and minus one, and depends a bit on the normalization. Depends a bit on normalization. So, in particular, this will you can compare this with the real hyperbolic plane, and you'll see the triangles are there. Right, so and these are the lattices we'll use today. Don't worry, we're not going to go deep into like the complex geometry of them, but these are the players. Oh, and the lattice is just a discrete subgroup which acts which acts with finite co-volume. And co-compact lattice are the ones which act co-compactly. And maybe one final example: if you take random groups and write kind of models, then they are also hyperbolic. Then they are also hyperbolic. So, in some point of view, you could argue that hyperbolic groups are abundant in the nature of all groups. So, that makes it somewhat imperative to try and understand their properties and study them. And while being sort of abundant in the universe of groups, they also all have the proper all share really nice properties. So, Grammar was, I guess, the first to realize that by abstracting this notion of negative. This notion of negative curvature, you can capture a lot of the properties that happen in groups like free groups and fundamental groups of manifolds with negative sectional curvature and prove them all starting from this kind of thin triangle property. So let me just give some properties explicitly. So if G is hyperbolic, then this implies that, for instance, That, for instance, by looking at the so-called Reps complex with respect to a finite generating set, that G is F infinity, and in fact, F if G is totally free. So, hyperbolic groups have the nicest possible finiteness properties, then they are very far from being a B. And they are very far from being abelian, so they never contain a z squared. They have a solvable word problem by the so-called Dan algorithm. And maybe to mention the last one, Bromov showed with details clarified by various others later that being hyperbolic is the same as having linear Dean function. So you can fill loops in the classifying space with linear area asymptotically. And I could keep going. So there's a strong form of the TITS alternative. They have solvable conjugacy problem. And so there are many, many properties that they all share. And now, if you have such a big class of groups which have so many nice properties, I think it's natural to ask if their subgroups which also act on delta hyperbolic spaces in some less nice way inherit all these properties. And when you go through the list, some are evidently inherited, like not having z-squared subgroups is inherited, or having solvable word problem is inherited because you can map words into the bigger group and solve. You can map words into the bigger group and solve the word problem there. But when you think about it, there are some where this is less clear. So, for finiteness properties and for daint functions, it's not so obvious that these should be, whether these are inherited or not. And I guess the motivation for this is the motivation for that theorem here is what shows that they're not inherited. So, they're not inherited in the worst possible way. Possible way. And now, but I gave you motivation for the theorem. Let me talk a little bit about the history. So, we didn't prove all n as first. So, there were some cases that were done before our theorem. Right, so I put. Oh, yeah, maybe. Okay, before I put the history of the problem, let me just say, let me just record the question I already said. The natural question is, or meta question is, how wild can subgroups of hyperbolic groups be, or maybe in a stronger version, how wild can finitely present subgroups of hyperbolic groups be? So, the Swile just made in the sense how bad can their properties be given that hyperbolic groups are so nice. And a specific version of this question that goes back to Brady. And I guess even Gersten 10 years before this, although he phrased it for the algebraic finiteness properties, is given n and n. Is given n and n is there the hyperbolic with a subgroup H, which is F n minus 1 not Fn. And so a theorem should be seen as an answer to this question. Now, okay, why did Brady? Okay, why did Brady ask this question? Well, what was known before? So, this question was first answered before, I guess, I think before Gromov even coined the term hyperbolic group, in the case n equal to by Ribbs, who used combinatorial small cancellation theory to show that every group is quotient of a hyperbolic group. And if you look at the curve. Quotient of a hyperbolic group. And if you look at the kernel of this quotient morphism, then you can show that it's F1, not F2. So it's finitely generated and not finitely presented. And then the case three was proved by Brady. And so he was the first to produce a finitely presented subgroup of a hyperbolic group that is not itself hyperbolic. That was the motivation for doing this because find such a subgroup, it can Find such a subgroup, it can, in particular, not be hyperbolic. This follows on from like Bromov had a suggested example of how this could work, and then there was some flaw in the argument, and Brady fixed it by modifying the idea a little bit. And this was generalized by Lota and Rob Holler using similar constructions. Then n equal four. Last year we managed to do this with Bruno Matelli and PRP. And then all cases we finally did with the RMA. So and I should mention, well, let me. So why did this take so long? So, why did this take so long? So, I guess it's not that people haven't tried. If you look at these two proofs, then they have some combinatorial component that gets hard when angle gets bigger. So, okay, there's so thus, as I said, I put combinatorial and quotation marks. I mean, they're all arguments from geometric group theory, but there's some combinatorics involved. Thus, uses. Um, thus uses small cancellation theory. Where there are approaches to do this in higher dimension. Macarina has an approach to do cubical small cancellation theory, which eventually could produce such examples for higher end, but for now, not yet, I guess. And thus uses Besvina-Brady-Moss theory. I guess which or which involves combinatorics and so far that you have to look at links, ascending and descending links of Morse functions on cube complexes, which in high dimensional connectivity properties get harder to check while juggling thus with the fact that you want to build hyperbolic cube complexes so they shouldn't contain planes. Cube complex, so they shouldn't contain planes, which is not a combinatorial condition. And bringing them together is what Brady and then building on the Slota and Corpolar with slight variations managed to do in dimensions three. And then people tried in higher dimension, but it turns out that there's there are criteria, but it turns out it's very hard to find an example which satisfies them. And in this case, in recent work, Italiano, Martellian, and Urini, Urini looked at fiberings of real hyperbolic n-manifolds arising from gluing together right-angled polytopes between dimension three and eight. And the magic of this is that these manifolds have fundamental groups which are right-angled coccet groups. So you can apply Besvenabrady-Morse theory to them, but you can get the hyperbolicity part by doing real hyperbolic geometry. So you get rid of one of the combinatorial difficulties and thus. And what we do is sort of take the approach and rather than adapt it a little bit to get these examples. So thus uses, again, the Sweeney-Brady-Moss theory now applied to Davis complex of right-angled coxitude groups plus real hyperbolic geometry. Tree. And now I don't have much space left here. So the idea to somehow does have some obstructions in working in high dimension. The first one is that these right-angled polytopes just don't exist past dimension. I always forget. They're known to exist up to dimension eight, and they are known not to exist from dimension 17 or 32 or something like that. So those can never work for all dimensions, at least not in the Dimensions, and at least not in this precisely the same way. And what we do is that rather than using real hyperbolic geometry, we use complex hyperbolic geometry. And in particular, the tools from complex geometry. And for most of the rest of my talk, I want to try and explain why complex geometry is a useful tool to do this. But before I do so, let me maybe just state the main. Just states the main theorem of Italiano, Matilli, and Migurini, on which the theorem builds, because this was really a big breakthrough answering another question that was also raised by Brady and many others, namely what they proved. Well, let me watch the border and stated. I guess in 2021, I guess the paper appeared later, but that's when it appeared on the archive. What they proved is that there is a hyperbolic group G. With subgroup H, so that H is type F and that's important, non-hyperbolic. So there can even be non-hyperbolic subgroups of hyperbolic groups with the nicest possible finiteness properties. And yeah, I already said so, the idea for the proof is. So, the idea for the proof is to make real hyperbolic geometry play together with right-angled coxeter groups, and then you get some relatively hyperbolic group with nice finiteness properties, and then you use geometry to fill the cusps and by the infillings and produce a hyperbolic group which has the same finiteness properties. And what we do is we take another one of these examples they considered, take their vibration. They considered take their vibration, perturb it a bit, and then build a group of type F3 and not F4 by passing to Dean Fillings. Right. So now to the complex geometry part. Oh, now to the part, what are actually our examples that prove that theorem? Maybe I can actually put this here. The theorem is a direct consequence of. Theorem is a direct consequence of what I call theorem B, which says that maybe this is, it's just, can one read this? Or is it slow? So so? I'll put it here since this is important. So take any end based. So, take any n bigger equal to one. And now take any lattice in P1, the isometry group of the complex hyperbolic ball, which is co-compact. So the quotient by the action is compact, which is arithmetic, and which has a positive first Betty number. Then, what we prove is that there is a subgroup of finite index together with a morphism from a subgroup onto Z so that the kernel is F n minus one and minus one and not fn in fact we show that on this finite index subgroup generic morphisms will have kernels of dust form and why does this prove theorem a well because as i explained earlier complex hyperbolic space is a hyperbolic delta hyperbolic space and let's say properly co-compact let's say properly co-compactly on them um Okay, there's a word arithmetic here. I don't want to define us, those who know what it is. Why does what exist? Ah yeah. Good point. This is my next remark. I'm not going to give you the details of how you construct them, but there are many such lattices known to exist and For all, I guess I'll put n bigger equal to two. For n equal one, these are just surface groups, so we don't worry about them. So there are many such letters for all n bigger equal one, but for n bigger equal two, these are the letters of examples are given by the list, so-called letters is of the simplest type. So the way you get them is. So, the way you get them is you take a totally real extension of Q, and then you take an imaginary extension of this, and you take a quadratic form of signature N1 that under one embedding in C and all other embeddings, it should be of type N plus one, zero. And then you take a lattice associated with With such a quadratic form. And these lattices will have virtually non-trivial B1. They are arithmetic by definition because arithmetic lattices are the Z points and the integer points that fix such quadratic form. But seeing that they have positive B1 is not easy. That's a result of Cashden. Like, yeah, this is in Borel Balach and takes a whole chapter and it's highly not true. But they do exist, and once you know their existence, you can use their properties to prove that theorem. Right. Okay. Okay. So but there are many of them. There are like there's countably many different even up to commensurability in every dimension. Right. So the last part I want to talk about. For the last part, I want to talk about some of the ideas involved in the proof of theorem B. And maybe first, okay, there are two things to check. One has to check that the kernel is not Fn, and one has to check that it's Fn minus one. And for not Fn, if you know enough sort of big theorems, then this is just a corollary of throwing them together. So, one way to see this is. Way to see this is by knowing that I think by a result of Borel the nth L to Betty number of such lat Of lattices in PO2N1 and PUN1 is not equal to zero. And then by a result of Luke, whenever you take a morphism, a homomorphism from a group with non-trivial nth L-tubetinum in some degree onto an abelian group, then the kernel is not of type of n. These are two hammers. There is a nicer, more direct way to prove this. So you can look at the cyclic covers induced by this morphism, the finite cyclic covers, and there's a long exact sequence of Milner that relates the Betty numbers of finite cyclic covers with the Betty numbers of the infinite cyclic covers. With the Betty numbers of the infinite cyclic cover. And you can show, since you can show, you can check that the growth of these Betty numbers is bounded outside the middle dimension, or they are uniformly bounded outside the middle dimension. And then Milner shows that one of them needs to go to infinity. And that's how you'll get that the enthomology of these guys is not finite dimensional. So there is a more direct hands-on argument to do this. You don't need these hammers. So, that's somehow these results say that lattices in PO2N1 or in PON1 are a good place to search for hyperbolic groups with morphisms to Z whose kernels have bad finiteness properties. Now, the question is, can we actually show that they are f n minus one? And thus, maybe before I tell you how to do this for uniform LEDs, this is co-compact LEDs in PN1. Let me just mention one other important result on finiteness properties that was proven recently. There is work of Keelag and Fisher that when you look at, that tells you when you look at Riffus groups, which among others, Which, among others, exists as lattices in PO2N1 for all n. Then their finiteness properties are determined by the finiteness properties of their kernels of morphisms to Z are determined by their L to Betty numbers, and one can show one can use this in the following way. One can use this to see. Just to see that for all n the lattices in PO2 and one, which are uniform and morphisms pi from lambda onto z so that the kernel is p n minus one over the rank q. So these are these homological finite. These are these homological finiteness properties that Kayul was talking about. And by work of Martin Besvina and Noel Brady, we know that these finite, these homological finiteness properties are actually different from the homotopical finiteness properties. So I'm mentioning this because somehow this gives even stronger evidence. So here we get not Fn, and this is something that gets us in the direction of Fn minus one. So together, at this point, there was somehow strong evidence that lattices. Somehow, strong evidence that lattices in these rank one semi-simple leak groups are a good place to search for subgroups of hyperbolic groups with interesting finiteness properties. Oh yeah, and to get from here to here, I should maybe also say that what you use here to find, you have to show that these are riffers, and that follows from work of Bergeron, Haglund, Weiss, and Magel. Right, so unfortunately, that's Does not imply fn minus one. And we know no way to strengthen this here. So if I had to guess, I would suspect that these guys will also generically be fn minus one. So someone, some smart graduate student should go and prove this. So, but since we couldn't do this, we shifted to the world of complex geometry. Of complex geometry, where somehow examples are harder to find, but once you find them, you have really strong tools to analyze them. Right. So what's the idea? The idea is to, well, I said in the theorem, to look at co-compact lets in pure and to use complex geometry, namely up to passing to a total-free finite index subgroup. Free finite index subgroup, we know that the quotient of m by lambda is a complex man, a compact, complex manifold. If lambda is total free, else we'd pass a finite index total-free subgroup. And the idea is to apply complex MOS theory to these. Morse theory to these manifolds rather than the more combinatorial Des Vina-Brady-Morse theory or the real MOS theory where we can do things geometrically, but somehow we struggle to find the right MOS functions. As you'll see now, finding nice MOS functions in complex geometry is easy. Well, once you find a MOS function, it's nice. Finding them is not easy. Right, so the idea is to use complex MOS theory on these. Theory on these. And using complex MOS theory is an argument involving two steps. The first step is to find any candidate for a complex MOS function, and the second step is to use it. And I want to start with the second step. I want to assume we found a candidate. And I want to tell you why complex MOS theory is so useful. No, they map to the complex numbers. I'll say what a complex MOS function is in just one second. So assume we're in the following situation. Assume we found a morphism from the fundamental group of n, so that's lambda onto z. Onto z, which is the fundamental group of the circle, which is induced by some smooth function f from m to the circle, such that when you lift this function to the universal cover, so let's say we're here, we have m maybe I'll put this on a different board so that you can actually see. Different boards so that you can actually see what I'm doing. What's the situation? We assume here we have M. We have a homomorphism that comes from mapping M to a circle with the property that when we lift it to the universal cover of M on the one side and then to the universal cover. One side, and then for the universal cover of the circle on the other side, that it lifts the map f tilde so that f tilde is the real part of some complex MOS function. And what does it mean? That means that G is a hollow. That means that G is a holomorphic map from the unit ball to C, which has more singularities, which means but all singularities are quadratic in the complex geometry sense. So this means that for all z, so that the differential of g and z is zero, there are complex coordinates. Complex coordinates Z1 to Zn around Z so that G evaluated in these complex coordinates is just the sum of the squares of the coordinates. So let me just repeat this here in case it's unreadable. Repeat this here in case that's unreadable. So f tilde is the real part of g, where g in local coordinates looks like so around a critical point. And what's the magic of complex MOS theory? It's when we take the real part of such a function, what do we get? Well, It's the real part of all these squares. And what's the real part of such squares? It's x1 squared minus y1 squared plus and so on plus xn squared minus yn squared. And thus is a real Morse function of index n. And that's nice because we know in real MOS theory, if we have MOS functions of index n, then we can reconstruct the whole space from a fiber by gluing n cells. And how can we use this to finish this part of the argument? Well, let's look at the cyclic cover induced by the morphism pi. So this is something. This is some intermediate cover that's sickly parrot corresponding to the kernel of phi. Yeah, sorry. Thank you. Yes. And this is in particular because This is in particular because this is a contractible space, a classifying space for this curve. Now, from that observation, sort of that this is a real MOS function with index n and that does is a classifying space, we're basically done. So what's the picture to go with this? The picture to go with this is the following. So we have the real line, and sitting over it, we have the cyclic cover MZ. And the point is that for the cyclic cover, we haven't unraveled any of the fibers of those maps. So if you take a regular value and you look at the fiber over it, Value, and you look at the fiber over it. This is going to be the same. Let's say zero is a regular value. This is going to be the same up to the feomorphism as the fiber of f over zero. And this is a compact manifold. So it has a finite cell structure by regular real MOS theory. And this function here, the singularities of this function look the same as the ones of f tilde. So here we have a real MOS function with index n singularities. They're discrete because when we have a singularity, we have a neighborhood without any colour singularity. So we see that we can reconstruct MZ from this fiber up to homotopy equivalent by attaching n cells. Attaching end cells, one for every critical value. Sorry, one for every critical point. So this implies that Mz is homotopy equivalent to the fiber of the original map F over zero and some answers attached. They can be infinite, or there will be infinite. Can be infinite, or there will be infinitely many. But this means that we found a way to produce a classifying space for the kernel of phi with finitely many cells in low dimension and then some number in some possibly infinite number in dimension n. In particular, this has finitely many n minus 1 cells. So the kernel of phi is f n minus 1. And this is how a complex MOS theory sort of gives you, once you find the MOS function. Sort of gives you once you find the Morse function, it gives you everything else for free because its real part is just a real MOS function with index and singularities. So I have a couple of minutes left, then I can tell you, or are there any questions on this? If not, then let me just briefly tell you where we get the MOS function from. This is where all Function from. This is where all these fancy words like arithmetic and positive B1 and come in. So they come in via another theorem, although I should say that as But the proof of this theorem is not so hard. It's a theorem by SEBU, which says the following. It says, it says given M a manifold complex wall quotient, like in theorem B. So with the same properties as in theorem. So, with the same properties as in theorem B, meaning that lambda is an arithmetic co-compact lattice with positive B1, then there is a finite cover which admits a holomorphic immersion into a complex torus. And the torus, for those who know a bit of complex geometry, is the so-called Albanese torus of M. So, this is just some complex torus. If you don't know complex geometry, that's enough information, I guess. And it's a complex torus, so that does map on abelianization of fundamental groups and uses the map total to the total-free. torture free to the torton free quotient of the abelianization and so any morphism to z from the fundamental group of m hat you can find by factoring through those torus and then going to s1 um and thus being an immersion has one nice consequence so when you i know um so the nice consequence is that you can actually you know very well how holomorphic forms on a complex torus look like it's On a complex torus, look like. It's just a choice of complex direction and taking the differential of this. And you can show using complex geometry that unless does form vanishes on a proper subtorus and complex subtorus, and there are not many complex subtori of, in general, of a complex torus in contrast to the real situation. Unless it vanishes on a whole complex subtorus, the pullback will be a holomorphic one-form with finitely many zeros. Zeros. And in particular, there will exist holomorphic one forms on m hat with finitely many zeros. So you should think of them as being locally differentials of holomorphic functions on M head. Now, why is this useful? This is useful because we can pull this one from back to the universal cover of m hat. So we and then we can integrate because on contractible manifolds we can integrate for every form. So if we pull alpha back with respect for the At back with respect to the universal cover, and we take some base point and we integrate with respect to the space point, then what we'll get is because holomorphic points are locally differentials of holomorphic functions, we'll get a holomorphic function on the universal cover so that the set of critical points is discrete. Critical points is this crate. So with this crate set of critical values. And then, and now there's some perturbation arguments you can make. So this looks locally like this will locally then look like some polynomial, and you perturb it a bit. Like some polynomial, and you perturb it a bit, and then you get that after some little local perturbation around critical values, you get a function that is actually around every critical value, a complex Morse function. And it's a complex MOS function with the property that, well, it's local perturbation. So if you go back to forms, it will induce the same form in cohomology. And it's that complex Morse function that we take the real part of, except there's one. The real part of, except there's one more little thing we have to do. Now, now we have something that may not descend to the circle, so we have to turb it a bit more to get something whose real part is a rational form, and then you can take multiple. And because this condition of having Morse type singularities is an open condition, you can turn this into something which has real part a rational form in cohomology. And our F from earlier will be the N. F from earlier will be the integral of that rational form. And that's all I want to say. This proves the first part. Are there any questions? So first a comment. One thing that's One thing that strikes me is that these H's are of type Fn minus one, not Fn, but they don't contain a Z cross Z. Yes. So if you look at the previous sequences of groups with increasing finance properties, they always had a Belian sub three Belian subgroups of different rank, right? So this is a new phenomenon. So this is a new phenomenon and why I was initially very skeptic. Okay. Yeah, that's right. A corollary of this is that there are such groups which don't contain. So now that seems to boil down to the lattices, the ambient arithmetic groups where you take the curve. So what do these arithmetic groups look like? These arithmetic groups look like they clearly do not contain a large torus or something. No, so these are well, these are co-compact lattices. So they're not relatively hyperbolic groups, but they're hyperbolic groups on the nose. So they won't contain any large torite. That's correct. I mean, okay, in the complex hyperbolic world, the parabolics for non-co-compact lats wouldn't be torite, be think so. They're modeled on the Heisenberg group, but still, like. But still, like they would have some abelian subgroups. But these don't because, yeah, well, I mean, oh, as matrix groups. I think in small dimension, there are concrete examples in papers. I can't give you one off the top of my hand, but there are papers like. Papers like where people did write down such groups explicitly and for small n. Although, for small n, of course, you won't see these finiteness properties phenomena. For small n, people gave presentations for some of them and they wrote them down explicitly. So, a natural question is, these groups are some lattices that we don't get our hands on that concretely. Um, could we give them presentations and actually find such a morphism explicitly? All we do here is very implicit. Explicitly, all we do here is very implicit. Like it's generic, but we cannot give you a single hands-on example. Related thing, can you push, have you thought about pushing this to one hyperbolic group that contains a whole sequence? I don't think I can that doesn't happen. That cannot happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if you have a phonological non-you know that it represents like what yeah, so so all the great homological dimension of right by properties, but it's something mainly dimension, like mainly God here in the menu so so. So, does RIPS complex construction show that all hyperbolic groups have finite-dimensional space? They act on nicely. The total-free ones actually have finite-dimensional classifying space. For the other ones, there is like some isotropy phenomenon with finite groups going on. But I guess that still gives you a finite rational cohomological dimension, right? And but what is the case is. But what is the case is these lattices, like the forms that define them, are very nice forms. It's forms of the kind corresponding to a matrix like 111 and then minus root of some prime, C does. And they contain, well, restriction of coordinates gives you natural sub-lattices of lower dimensional form sitting inside them. So these groups will contain subgroups. Groups will contain subgroups of type F, K naught, F, K plus one for all K at most N minus one. Sorry, shifted. Yeah. If you take one of these groups, you look at all of the kernels that give you non-Fn minus one that give you Fn minus one, non-FNC groups. Can you tell if those two groups are isomorphic or not? No, I can't. So you can tell that the lattices are not isomorphic because there's some. Yeah, yeah, so you can tell that they are not commensurable because they're like associated to the quadratic forms. You can compute their so-called trace fields. And when these trace fields are not the same, then the groups are not commensurable. But I don't know currently how to pass those on to the subgroups. I mean, maybe there's a way. To the subgroups. I mean, maybe there's a way, but. So, in principle, it would be that we just have one subgroup for each, one example for each particular example. I guess we have, but we have a lot of surrounding examples in which they sit naturally. I'm guessing they're all different. And I guess we haven't tried too hard to sort of use the strace field to somehow say something about the actual kernels being different. But if I had to take a bet, I would bet they are. Bets, I would bet they are different as long as the ambient groups are not connected. Okay, there are any other questions. Okay, so let's start talking again.
