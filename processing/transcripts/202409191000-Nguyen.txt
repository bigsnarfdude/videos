So today I'm going to talk about the world need for some model about Gaussian evolution equation in the fluids and geometry. And yeah, okay. So the equation I have you designed today that is the sky more general. kind more general. In time and it is the functional operator we define by this way. When we fit the coefficient, the coefficient depends on solution. And then this is the order of this is the linear defensible operator of order S. And we can define this by the freeway. Okay. For example, little operator, we can define, yeah, the mean. Yeah, the minus of one plus u square of the Laplace and multiply Laplace U in the U in K here is scalar K. Okay, so it's S equals one and nonlinear N here, that is the non-linear difference of other U and cheaply less than S. And then by this way, we can somehow observe the nonlinearity term by the main term, A. Okay. Manton A. Okay, and for this model, that is contained to the quotient linear system. And also, when we define this patient, that is the local logo, if this operator, that local, and we don't care about non-perturbation term. Yeah, and okay. So let me give some me give some uh some sample for example for the nevsul equation uh we can drive uh yeah dt the nevsul equation for the for any dimension uh for the dimension d d rich then uh r equal to two and we look at this equation that is the local but if we remove for the pressure the pressure here and then we can try but in term of the um the heat uh um heat hit the operator plus some non-linearity term and non-linearity term here just for the the order one or other one of non-linearity u yeah and um and we can check thus for this equation that is recall uh spay that is the mass of space of p minus one infinity infinity yeah and for the for the second equation i i would like For the second equation, I would like to mention this is the free boundary problem. Yeah, that's called the QD mask, and this is very the equation of the interface so defined for the very complicated equation. It did look at here, and it did a chenney tacket. It defied by this way. It did Laplace of A, it did the square root of one of A square. Okay, okay. Okay, and if we write out for the main term and plus the for the non-linearity term, the perturbation term, we can see the interface F, the certify the thrust, the heat equation of the evolution equation of the order three here, and the y the coefficient dt coefficient. The coefficient, did the coefficients depend on solution F, the derivative here? And then we can check this equation have the Liptic norm or based ups by norm that the critical. And for this equation, we call it the non-local come from this one and quotes because we have this term. Yeah. Because the main term that also depends on not linear. Okay. And for the TIM FIM equation, that is the equation in the feces. And this is the we can write down by this form, exponential of minus Laplace U. And we can write out this equation in terms of this way. Yeah, this is the four order. But this equation did the kind of similar than. Similar than for the 2D mascus. Okay, and the last equation I want to mention that the mean curvature in the graph K and with FID vector did associate to the M coder dimension. Yeah, with the match AE given by this formula, and we can check that. formula and we can check that oh or did the curriculum by that they lift it not uh so let one infinity not not two infinity yeah uh so and what is the discounty um uh in the talk uh professor who um he considered for the some model influence but um based on he knew the the energy momentum he can the data enough to term he can that enough to define the which solution but for the uh for the equation uh i i just mentioned here uh yeah firm the energy or momentum cannot uh it's not enough to define the which uh in the viscent yeah so and more well um if we consider equation it's higher uh derivative like the the 3d mass cap with so extension that is the the four order uh the the The four-order, the three-order derivative, and we cannot have the, we cannot use the maximum principle. We only use the maximum principle for the scalar k or for the equation with the fractional of order less than two. And this is the tune for to do with the for the parabolism and this equation. We use the idea. We use the ideal Nastmos or Kislov theorem for the Haudel directory, and from how the direct we can prove for the solution is smooth with the graph coefficient. But for this method, only available for the scalar K and only available for the fractional K with order the Laplace power S with less than order to one. Less than or equal to one with f greater than one, we cannot apply the methods, yeah, or the methods cannot apply for the generalist equation, yeah. And so the tri-aximas, we are, yeah, this one we need the coefficient regular enough. And for the energy methods, this one is the we need to have the harmonics, yeah. have the ceremonies yeah we need to have someone to to to look this yeah okay so and um now in in my talk i i would like to uh to introduce uh uh new uh uh some uh new axiomas for for the uh revolution equation and their application yeah so i will start from the classical equation this equation divergent of a multiply u Of A multiply U and for the fourth term, I decide like the diversion of F and with the A decor A constant. And then we have the soda H mass for radium U in in C in C A and with A naught integer. Yeah, it's positive. And controlled by F in C A, D the optimal eczema. And constant C here, it is plow off when A conversion to integer. Yeah. To integer, yeah. So, uh, and uh, for this estimate, can attend to uh to the equation with the coefficient that uh with the north constant, then we can do the standard argument like uh fission coefficient. We can get this term, yeah. And we we can obtain uh similar H mass here when we have this term, yeah, appear for you, this infinity, because we need to use in infinity to observe for. In infinity to observe for the lower term. So you can see this on the famous book by Akmong Nisenbus. And yeah, we also see this argument in the book of Giga Chung. So and what happened when we consider for Soul Thai and Echimas for the parameters? And HMS for the parallel equation. So, for the shoulder HMS for parabolic equation, many people they do just the shoulder tie in time and in S. But that's not convenient to study for the evolution equation because, as we know, for the evolution equation, if we start from the not for initial time, not smooth, and then we mass solution did the smooth at smooth uh at boss tips time and then uh we design for this one this one um ett norm of u and control by by the radiant of u in c ampha multiply this the the the suitable time here and dd control by initial time of u in infinity and and and and and and plus some fourth term this is the the achievement the optimal Did achieve the opt optimal because we can see here radiant u it looks like f okay, and then radiant u here it is the same size with f here, yeah, okay. And if we consider this equation with the with the with coefficient and then we uh we can obtain this x mass, we can obtain this x mass, we need the time t here small to observe the lower term by this term. By this time, that valid incur is only available for the short time, yeah. Okay, and then uh, with that argument, we can attain for general general non-local parabolistic equation. Uh, we define by this way, uh, ut plus uh ls of u. L h of u, that is the e defy by of all the s. When we check the Fourier here. Yeah, when we take the Fourier here, and then we have we obtain the symbol A, A, C here, symbol A, C here, like C of S. And the nonlinearity at the fork term here, we can define like P gamma, P gamma, that is operator of power gamma. Yeah, yeah. And with this equation, with this question, we have the following axiomat. Yeah, so shouldn't U in C kappa? Kappa be T. U in C kappa, kappa between this belong to this range, yeah, and multiply the suitable way in time, then we can get this. For this question, if we don't have the for term here, and then we can see for the we start from only infinity data plus verbostime terms by this way, of course, this one. By this way. Of course, this one we can can do for any kappa, okay, if we assume for withdrawal for term here. And then this estimate that is the switchboard to study non-linear evolution equation. Yeah, because we expect a positive time solution is smooth. And if we can see the further equation with the non-constant coefficient, then we can get the same result. Okay. And so here. And so here it is some simple application. First, I would like to remind you for the definition of the best subspace. F of P S infinity infinity here, we can define by spike. Okay, and the pole gamma here, that is the square root of the gamma square. The gamma square D equal divided by square root of plus. Yeah. Yeah. D operator mentioned in the talk of Professor Zanit and another professor. So the first example we I want to mention that is the fractional Nevsky equation when we play for the Laplace for classical Nevsky equation in Laplace by the fractional Laplace. The fraction of Laplace, yeah, DD power gamma, big gamma between one and two, and gamma equal two, that is classical Laplace, and P here that is the Luray projection. And we can look thus this equation have whereabouts for the best of spy, yeah, for the base of B of the one minus gamma infinity, infinity. That is the longest by substitute two two. To consistent with the scaling of this equation. And not just for gamma equal one, it is also available, but we need to we can drop a web in the infinity infinity number. And moreover, this result cannot um true for cannot avail um it's not available for for the class for one, gamma for two. For the classical one, gamma for two, because by definition of the base of spy, we can see u infinity power two. That equivalent like t of minus one. Then that's why we cannot define this non-negative term. That's why this problem is for best of the very important construction of Shindo Ken and Hit Corrator. And heat cooperator. And if we assume this smaller space, like T more minus one, this is derived by Koch and Tataru. He can drop the Neptune equation, which we are in P more minus one. This is also a famous result in the Neptune equation. And we have the same result for the Edgu G and another equation model here because this we uh this equation that is uh semi-linear, but I not right now I would like to focus on for the cosine linear cosine linear that is more more um uh molliscal because the coefficient here that is generally yeah so we we can see the the mean culture flow in the graph k and flow in the graph k and we can write down by this term with m m here m m here that is the the vector vector not scalar with with m equal one this is scalar and um and we can check that this equation have the variables uh in the in the um yeah uh we can check that's uh uh lift norm or the sole let s one plus d o two that the critical so to this problem. Political approach to this problem. And the first result I want to mention is the if initial eta here is C1. And for any beta positive here, it's the node integer. And then we can look that solution is units and smooth. Yeah. Certify this normal with final. Yeah, digital mid final. And we can check that with associated to this equation, choke of this equation, we can check that. structure of this question we can check that this norm that is the the the same scaling with the lift chip norm and this is smooth yeah because we we take uh beta the lip chip in s and then we have to pay uh the weight t of one uh beta our virtual yeah and more if we assume smallness yeah then we uh then uh we can do that's this solution it is the the global payload is needed. We only need smones for the F0 in passive space B1 infinity infinity. And multiply the leaf chip norm, it's small. Somehow we change this one small. We don't need the leap chip norm, it's small. Yeah. And not that for the K. Sorry? Sorry. Okay, so this one only positive, chilly positive. If this one is finite, we have this. Okay, wait, basically. Okay, we have this rarety. Okay, yeah, yeah. We can easily check this one actually might firm below by this. One actually made from below by this bar. Yeah. We can deploy it by vector and did it by vector. This whole part only vector. Yeah. True. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So far, the scalar K, this is the famous result by this guy that they wrote. This guy that they wrote solution is smooth and also units start from the leadkeep initial data. Because this equation, when m equals one, that is scalar k, and then we can use the zoxy method to drop this equation that that is the c1 alpha, and from c1 alpha, we can drop society smooth by the standard way. Yeah, and for this uh in the m region one, this is. In the M regident one, this is open. Yeah. And we expect this equation to have the finite time log. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so how we can drop the web using the shoulder tie atomus I mentioned. Okay. So first I write out the equation by this form. Yeah. I defy phi A phi is defined by this. And then I marked A. Well, I'm multiplied AF by A5 and then I boost this one perturbation. And then I assume because I assume initial data is C1 and then we can construct a solution phi smooth and certified strategy. And then to estimate the function f, we just need to estimate the difference of f and phi because phi is smooth. And then we write out the equation in f2. write out equation in f q ta and then we we take the derivative to both side and then here we have the firm lie like uh like in the theorem of solar of solar type atoma and and then here we just apply the atom to get the ability at mark of course uh we have to to to look for the lip chip nerve yeah to mark the two different equations and then we can do the same way and uh by And by this way, we can do buttonship agreement. Then we can see here f2 tau t equal conjoined by this. And when we take epsilon small here, then we can do buttonship agreement to make this one still small. And then this one can absorb by this guy. That why we can obtain the ability achievement. F2 t in T can be controlled by by epsilon. Then that enough to refer variable distance. Yeah. Yeah. The this is the way we apply. Yeah, this is the way we apply. Okay, and you see the same method we can do that for the more complete kitty equation. This is the VMO flow with the U here, this is the scalar function in R2. And it did the four order. And we can this equation hit the local website for the initial data, this is C1. And if we assume And if we assume the leap chip number is small, we can do this equation global web of this. But for in this equation, many numerical results, this equation have the finite time loss. If we start from the smooth and last data, and bust right now, then not redress mathematical route for to construct the finite term of this equation. And for the surface, the Surface diffusion flow that is the same structure with this equation and also the tinfield equation. And note that our method can apply for the equation on the boundary domain or on the homogeneous boundary condition. And we can drop that solution with the smooth up to the boundary, but this equation that not standard. That not standard. And we only look for the solution smooth. Root for the solution is smooth up to the boundary for some kind of equation. For example, for natural equation, if we consider delay boundary condition, even for the star form smooth initial data, we cannot solution of natural equation that is smooth up to the battery because the projection is not smooth. Okay. So, and next, I will move to the non-nocal question evolution equation. That is the mass. That is the mass cat equation. This is the free battery problem. We can see the two fluids, two domains, and then in this domain, we satisfy the Dacian law. And we have the jump pressure equal that is the minus mean curvature. And for the on the interface, this satisfy the evolution equation. And then we can write down the equation. Down the equation, we can write down the equation of the interface following. And here we can check that the lipkeep that is predictable. And because it is 1D, and we have the D TO2 that is also predictable associated to this problem. And then the first step, we can write this equation by. Uh, we can write this equation by this form, yeah. This firm, okay. We we don't have the all f here, we have this term, this is the question, yeah, and then we uh to drop the webinar, we have to to mark motivation of this term. For some, if we assume uh if we want to drop the uh this web for the smallest data, we can map this one motivation by by yellow, and this one is the equal one, and then we can view the. And then we can apply the shoulder tile at the website for the critical data. And for this HMS, we can see for the most time socialness. Our result can apply for the 2D pesky equation. As here, that is the vector. Yeah, that is the vector. Yeah, that is the better that is the applied for the this is the model you did the for the 2D in the fluid with the free move with the fluid vorticity here and to define this equation we have to assume actual assumption we have assumed this guy it is very broad because we have the S here okay totally Uh, s here, okay, throw this by here, and municipal this guy. We have this guy, we have to defy this guy, it is not shared choice, not share, not share a choice, yeah, okay, certify this for any s and v here, dt delta, dt, the finite difference, okay, and the cheatly positive, and uh, that the Lymus gas we can see here that is the the the critical lead chip norm, okay, so and then we can drop uh So, and then we can first we rewrite the equation like the Cohesion linear, and this is the equation for the fractional of the Laplace here, this is square root of Laplace, and we can drop the variable sniff. And for this question, that is more hostile because we have to estimate from below of the curve here, the curve here. This is not shared choice for the whole time, okay? And when t equals one, we can do revolution for the We can do revolution for the best of sign. And we also turn this result for TD. TD, that is the more complicated. This is the fear defied by two. Yeah, and we have the same result. Yeah, apply our method. We can give for the software, but this is not sort about Gen 3 basis, but for the original, they refer the separate. They look for the sublical data and with almost 100 pages. Okay. So, and I stop here. Thank you.
