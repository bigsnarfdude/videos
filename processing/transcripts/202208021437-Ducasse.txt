You have a population, the population is fixed. You have no deaths, no births. You assume that there is a disease, and the disease, and you assume that each individual in the population can be of either susceptible, infectious, or recovered. Susceptible, it means that you don't have the disease, but you can get the disease. Infectious, it means that you have the disease and you can transmit the disease. Recovered, it means that you had the disease and now you don't have it anymore, and you are immune. And you are immune. Okay, and so the dynamic is the following: the probability that a susceptible becomes infected is proportional to the probability of encounter between susceptible and infectious. So this is why the first equation here for S dot is minus alpha SI, and alpha is the probability to get infected when a susceptible meets an infectious. So this, what is lost by S, is gained by I. Okay? The infectious. Okay, the infectious individuals are not infectious forever, and this is important. There is a recovery rate, which is a positive constant mu. So, with some probability, with some rate, you cease to be infectious, you become recovered. And so, what is lost by I minus mu I is gained by R. You sum these equations, everything, the mass is conserved. Okay, so this is a very simple model. A main problem is that it's not a special model. Problem is that it's not a spatial model. So, of course, we would like to take into account spatial effects. So, in order to do so, many models were introduced. I would like to, I will use this model. So, this model introduced by Callan in 1984 is a diffusive SAIA model, a very simple one. You see that Callan took the same model as before, but he added some diffusion here. You have a diffusion term on the infected individuals. Diffusion term on the infected individuals, all right. So, this means that the infectious individuals can move and then the disease can be transported. So, let me just mention that there is no diffusion in this model on the S individual and on the R. So, on the R, it would not change anything. On the S individual, it would complicate a lot of the analysis. If you are interested in this topic, I can refer you to a paper by Arnold Ducrot from 2020. Sorry, 2020. 2021, and the reference is not particular. We just consider this model. Okay, so what's the main point of the SIR model? So you probably already know, but there is what we call a threshold phenomenon. Threshold phenomenon, it's a very nice property that tells you that if alpha zero minus mu is positive, strictly, then the epidemic spread in a sense that I will explain. And if this is negative, it doesn't spread. It doesn't spread. This is rather easy to see, so I explain it very quickly. The equation for i, you can rewrite it as a heat equation, dti equals la pass of i, plus a gross term. The gross term, the in orange here, alpha s minus mu, can be positive or negative. If it's positive, i will grow locally. If it's negative, it will decay locally. Okay, so if you start with a population S0 for the susceptible, which is such that alpha S0. Acceptable, which is such that alpha S0 minus mu is negative, then it will stay negative because S is decreasing. And therefore, the gross term in the whole range here is negative. Therefore, high will decay, the epidemic will not spread. Okay. If it's positive, what happens? What happen? So imagine that you have A0 which is constant. This will be the case in all the torque. You take I0, which is compactly supported. It will be the case in all the torque. Then, if alpha S0 minus mu is positive, the growth. is zero minus mu is positive the growth term is positive at least for small t so i will grow this is what happens i will grow but if i grows this means that it consumes some s individuals so the s has to decay at least locally here near the center so the s decays so you have this gap that appears but now s is very small here in the center if it's small alpha s minus mu will be probably will be negative at some point if it's negative the gross term here becomes a The gross term here becomes a decay term. So I we have center. So this for i that will travel to the right and to the left. And this is what happens. You have the formation of two bumps. And the i population forms two bumps that will travel to the right and to the left. And the s population forms this type of inverted double inverted front. And you can also show that the R population forms this type of usual double front. Of usual double front, okay. One front to the right, one front to the left, the standard setting. Okay, so this is all summarized in this result. Okay, so there are some epsilon missing in the result, but for the sake of simplicity, I took some liberty with the statement of this result. Okay, so the main result for this model is that if alpha a0 minus mu is positive, then you can define c star to be twice the square root of d high times alpha. square root of d high times alpha s0 minus mu it's the speed of propagation just like in KPP equation and the epidemic spread with this speed in the sense that s the density of susceptible is equal to some s infinity so s infinity you can compute it but it's not explicit and this will be important in the sequel so s is approximately equal to s infinity if you are on the region where x is lesser than c star t and s capital s is equal to s zero its initial is equal to S0, its initial value, where x is larger than C star T. So this is represented on this drawing. S is equal to S0 on the right and on the left and to S infinity on the center. Okay, so again, S infinity is implicit, but there is a formula. Okay, so this is the usual SIR model from CALED. And so the question we had was the following. What happens when you have several diseases, multiple diseases? Multiple diseases. So I say multiple diseases, but it can be strains or variants or mutation of a disease. Okay. So we wanted to study this question. So we started with introducing a model. And this is the model I will tell you about. So I say this is the most natural thing to do. So I consider n strain, okay? So n different epidemic diseases. Diseases. So now the equation for S is the following: because now S can be contaminated, the S individual can be contaminated by each different I individual, and the rate of contamination depends on the type of the disease. So the disease number K has contamination rate alpha K. So each epidemic has its own way of spreading. So you have a diffusion which can depend on K, why not? And you have a contamination rate, alpha K, and the rate. Rate alpha k and the remission rate mu k. All right. And then you have for each k, you have an equation for rk. So the rk are not so important in the sense that they don't play any role in the dynamic, but it's important to keep them, to keep track of them for the analysis. Okay, so there is a little drawing here, a sketch to show you what, to explain the situation. Okay, so I think it's the most simple model. And the interesting thing was that this model had some. Interesting thing was that this model had some nice properties. So, in order to convince you, I will start to show you a simulation. So, let me just quit my screen mode for one second. I will show you a video. Yes, you can see my screen. Okay, perfect. So, I did a simulation where, oh, sorry. So, I did a simulation where I took. So I did a simulation where I took S0 to be constant equal to 1, as I said. Okay, so there seems to be. Okay. So S0 is constant equal to 1. This is the black line you see at the top of my simulation. And I took four epidemics. So there is a red, a green, a yellow, and a purple epidemic. They are all located at zero on the left. And if I start the dynamic, And if I start the dynamic, this is what happens. Okay. So let me start the dynamic again. The simulation again. So as you can see, what happens is that the epidemic separates. Each epidemic seems to propagate with some given speed, as if, okay, with some given speed. And the density of S forms this kind of terrorist, if you want. And one thing that is interesting is that you can see on the simulation that the Is that you can see on the simulation that the red, the purple, and the yellow epidemic propagate, but you don't see the green epidemic. The green epidemic does not propagate. Okay, so this is the first thing that I think is interesting with this model. So let me come back to my slides. Okay, so this is what I think is interesting. The first thing that is interesting is that you have some kind of selection phenomenon. I start with four people. Phenomenon. I start with four epidemics, but one doesn't survive. Okay, and so this is what I would like to explain to you. First, I would like to explain why we have this selection phenomenon and what is the dynamic of the system. And then I would like to tell you some qualitative properties of the system. So first, let me start to explain this phenomenon. So we call this the selection via propagation. You will see why. So let me give you an aneurysm. I will not give you a proof, but I will give you an answer because the heuristic. But I will give you an heuristic because the heuristic is very easy to understand. So, assume that you have an epidemic, okay, and you have the susceptible which are initially constant equal to S0, the susceptible. So, among all the epidemics, so I wrote the heuristic here, among all the epidemics, one must be faster, right? So, the epidemic which is faster, the trait which is faster, it will start to propagate. So, because it is faster, it will escape. Faster, it will escape all the others. So it will go away and it will propagate as if it were alone. So, in my drawing here, this is the situation of the red bump here. The red bump, it starts to propagate and it goes away and it lives its life. Okay. But as I said, as in the case of one epidemic, you expect that it will consume a certain proportion of S0. Okay, because the susceptible in some sense are the fuel that the In some sense, are the fuel that the eye needs to propagate. So behind the red grap, the number of susceptible will be given by S1. And as I told you before, S1, we have a formula, but it's implicit. So then you are in the same situation as before. You have N minus one epidemic that would like to propagate, but the N minus one epidemic which are left behind, they see in front of them only a number of susceptible equal to only a number of susceptible equal to S1, not S0. But the speed of propagation depends on the number of susceptible, if you remember the formula of C star before. So you expect that now you compute the speed of each epidemic, knowing that the number of susceptible is S1, and you expect that it will propagate with this, the faster it will propagate. So maybe it's the blue one, it will propagate and so on. It will consume a proportion of S1, it will leave behind him a number of receptibles equal to. A number of susceptible equal to S2 and so on. Okay, so this is the heuristic. So I don't know if I convinced you with this heuristic. I found it very convincing, but maybe I presented it very fast. But the problem is that I was very convinced. And unfortunately, it's not always true. It's generically true, but not always. And we need an extra hypothesis to make this work. And this is our result. Our result. So, our result is the following: basically, you can prove that there is an integral p, and there are k1 up to kp, which are indices, and c1 up to cp, which are the speeds, such that if each speed, so the c high will be the speed of the traits that propagate. And if you know that the trait, the speed of each trait is slower than, say, half the speed of the trait before, then you can prove that the heuristic is true. Prove that the heuristic is true. That is, the K1, Kp will be the indices of the trade that propagate, and Ci up to Cp will be the speed. Okay, so basically, if you have this separation of speed hypothesis, so I call it the separation hypothesis, the heuristic is true. So, actually, this, what I wrote here is a bit, is not a very good hypothesis. Actually, we have a better separation hypothesis, but it was not possible to present the real hypothesis. Possible to present the real hypothesis, so this is an approximation in some sense, which is not very good. Uh, okay, so why is that so? Why do we have this? Uh, why the heuristic is not always true? So, this is the first thing, which is a bit surprising, uh that the heuristic is not always true, but actually, this was already observed in the literature. Um, actually, basically, this comes from the fact that when you have the heat equation, you have mass that can propagate up to infinity with infinity speed. And also, there is a connection with the fact that. There is a connection with the fact that for KPP equations the fronts are not unique. Okay, I will not go into details, but I would like just to mention that this similar facts were observed in the case of competition system. So it was a very different case, but the core is the same. So this was observed in some paper by Girardin and Lam in 2019, 89, 19, and by Lam, Liu, and Yu in 2000. Lam U and Yu in 2021. And so basically, yeah, and they observed something a bit similar. And okay, to make things short, basically, using their results, I'm rather confident that we can have counter example to this theorem. If you don't have the separation hypothesis, you can have some unexpected acceleration of some bumps. Okay. This could happen. Also, I'm also. Also, I'm rather confident that using the result of Lam U and U from 2021, I think we can remove this separation hypothesis and have a complete theorem. But okay, this is ongoing work, let's say. Okay, so this is the main result. I will not present to you the proof, but I would like to give you a bit an idea of how it works. So, the idea is the following. So. So, the idea is to rewrite the system. So, this is the same idea. Actually, this is exactly the same idea, the same thing you would like to do if you have only one epidemic. The idea is to try to write a single equation on the recovered individuals. When you have only one epidemic, you can prove that the R individuals satisfy the KPP equation. Here, it's not completely true, but you can do the following. You can get rid of the S and Can get rid of the S and I equations, and you can end up with a kind of system that involves only the RK, the Rk functions, the recovered. So it's a system with an equation. It's a parabolic type system here in this lemma with a strange integral term. Okay, the integral is not very important, actually. What is important is what I wrote in orange. Okay, you can see my equation. I have the product of the exponential of all. Have the product of the exponential of all the recovered. Okay, this is very easy to see. It's just some computation, so let's admit it. Okay, and basically, as you can expect, if you want to prove our result, you have to control this orange term. And this is the color of the proof. Okay, so I will not go into details, but I can just say that the proof is a long recursion. Basically, you have to build some estimates on each RA. Each RA, use these estimates to get better estimates. So you bootstrap the estimates, and in the end, you can prove the result. Yeah, okay. So I don't want to give more details on the proof. I think, yeah, I don't want to give more details on the proof. I would like to present to you some qualitative properties now. Because this result here, it tells you what happens, okay? But it doesn't tell you. But it doesn't tell you how the parameters of the system influence the dynamic. And this is my last section. It's very interesting when you have such models to understand how the parameters influence the dynamic. So this was a type of question, for instance, that was mentioned yesterday by Professor Zhu in his talk. He was studying what happens when you have SIR type model and you increase the diffusion, for instance. So this is the type of question we can ask. We can ask what happens when you change the diffusion, when you change the contamination rate, when you increase the susceptible S0. Okay, so unfortunately, this type of questions here is rather hard to answer directly because, as I said, a lot of things are very implicit in our theorem. The indices of the sequence of the strains that propagate, they are very implicit. We cannot compute them directly. Implicit, we cannot compute them directly. Yet, we wanted to study some properties, and I would like to show you three very simple properties concerning this model. Okay, yeah. So, the first property I would like to show you is a super easy one once we have the theorem, the main theorem. It's a super easy property, but I think it's rather it's a bit interesting. So, I would like to share it with you. So, as you probably know, in epidemiology, there is this quantity, this magic quantity, which is the basic reproduction number. Quantity, which is the basic reproduction number, R0, R0, which is defined as being the ratio between alpha S0 over mu. Okay, and usually detects the behavior of the dynamic in many situations, actually, well, in many homogeneous situations, at least. And actually, when you have several epidemics, this trait is completely useless. This feature is completely useless in the sense that if you have at least two epidemics, so several epidemics, if they diffuse with the same speed, If they diffuse with the same speed, you can build examples where you have the one epidemic, say the epidemic number one, which has a low, a small basic reproduction number. You have the epidemic two, which has a big reproduction number, as big as you want, actually. And you can prove that yet the first epidemic will propagate and the second will vanish. So this means that the R0, the basic reproduction number, doesn't give you any information. And once we Any information. And once we have the theorem, it's obvious actually because the things that discriminate between which epidemic propagates and doesn't is the speed. But the speed is twice the square root of alpha A0 minus mu. And alpha S0 minus mu can be very large, even so alpha S0 divided by mu can be small. Okay, so it's just an obvious observation, but I thought it was a bit interesting. So, a bit interesting. So, the second property I would like to show you, very different and a bit less obvious, is the following. Very often in epidemiology, so this is something I hear very often, when you have several variants or mutation of a disease, you hear that each disease that propagates is less dangerous than all the strains that propagated before. So, when a disease mutates, usually we say that Usually, we say that the new mutations are less than the ruse. So, okay, I know perfectly that epidemiologists don't agree with that, or there are a lot of subtleties. Okay, I don't know. But what is interesting is that actually this is somewhat predicted by the model. In the following sense, you can prove that if you have all diffusions which are equal, which is actually rather natural, I think. If you call ki the sequence of the indices that propagate, you can show that each You can show that each trait that propagates has necessarily a smaller contamination rate and a smaller remission rate than all the traits that propagate before. So the contamination remission rate decay along the dynamic actually. So this is not direct from the theorem, the main theorem, because our main theorem tells us that each strain strain Each strain strain that propagates should have a lesser speed. Okay, so the speed is square root of alpha, alpha S0 minus mu, or Si minus mu. So the speeds are combination between alpha and mu. So using only this, you don't have enough information to conclude this corollary, but still you can prove it using other information. You have to use the definition of the levels of the Terra. Uh, the levels of the terrorists that I didn't talk about it much, so uh, okay, but you have this result, and to conclude, I would like to show you a third result. So, this is maybe a bit more interesting. So, there are a lot of words here, but you don't really need to read the result. So, okay, a natural question is to ask how many individuals will survive. So, let me define S infinity here. S infinity is the Here, S infinity is the limit when T goes to infinity of S. Okay, there is a small approximation here. So, S infinity is the number of susceptible after all the epidemic have passed. So, the number of individuals who survived. Okay, I assume that mu1 over alpha1 is lesser than mu2 over alpha2 and n equal to. Okay, so without loss of generality, I can assume that. And I assume that d2 over d1 is much larger than 1, because in this case, the situation is more interesting. In this case, the situation is more interesting, actually. You can prove the following. So, let's just look at the graph at the bottom of my slide and not at the text. So, I draw here S infinity as a function of S0, the number of surviving individual as a function of the number of individuals initially present. So, as you can see, when S0 is between 0 and μ1 over alpha 1, S infinity is equal to S0 because in this situation, Infinity is equal to S0 because in this situation, no trait propagates. So no propagation, no disease. So everybody survives very well. When A0 increases a bit between mu1 over alpha one and some s underline that I do not define, then you have only the trait one which propagates and you have the population decays a lot. And then, so there is this dashed line here between S underline and S underline because epsilon, where you can Where you cannot apply the theorem. But when S0 is larger than S underline plus epsilon, you can see that S infinity is increasing. And this is surprising because in epidemiology, usually, when you have this propagate in a big city, the proportion of deaths is much larger than if the city were small. This is usually the case. And when you have several epidemics, because here in this, if S0 is between S underline plus S. 0 is between s underline plus epsilon and this s overline, which is defined somewhere. The two traits propagate, the trait two and the trait one, in this order, and they compete. And doing so, they do less damages. But if you increase again S0, then you start to decay again. You increase again S0, only the trait to propagate and the population, everybody will be contaminated at some point. At some point, so this is only the also we can prove that S underline goes to mu2 over alpha 2 when the ratio of diffusions becomes very large and this epsilon goes to zero. So this region where we cannot apply the theorem, we can make it as small as we want. Okay, so this is just the case n equal to when you increase n, the situation becomes much more complicated. Actually, it seems that you have some some, yeah, you have some very complicated shapes that appear, but I will not enter Shapes that appear, but I will not enter into details. I will conclude now just by presenting some open questions, some things that are left to do, because so first, obviously, we would like to remove this separation hypothesis on the speed. I'm rather confident that it's possible. Another thing which will be very interesting is to consider heterogeneous situations. Because, in heterogeneous models, for instance, if S0 is periodic in dimension two, say, Dimension two, say the speed of propagation depends on the direction in space, and because the selection depends on the speed of propagation, the selection will depend on the direction. So it will be very nice because you would have patterns, I think, if you have heterogeneous situations. And it will be very interesting to study some models where you don't have diffusions, but where you have non-local contaminations. So there is a huge literature on this topic. Okay, so I think I'm out of time. I will stop here. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Is there any question for comments? Yeah, can you hear me? Yes, yes, please. Yeah, you mentioned briefly in the beginning a reason why you allow the infected individuals to diffuse, but not the others. And if I think of, for example, the COVID pandemic, I would hope that the infected individuals are the ones who are quarantining. Are the ones who are quarantining, and it's the others that are moving. Would that make a big difference? So, in my model, I don't know. In general, so I think we will have more details in some coming talks probably. But in general, in most results that I know, when you have some diffusion on the S, the analysis is much more complicated, but the results are the same. For instance, the speed of propagation is the same, it doesn't depend on the diffusion on the S. Same, it doesn't depend on the diffusion on the s always on the diffusion on i, usually. Um, yeah, so in my model, I don't know if it changes a lot. Basically, the difficulty, so let me come back to the model, the model by Callan. If I have diffusion on the S, actually, it's really not obvious to prove that the solutions are bounded. If the diffusion on S and I are equal, you can send the equation, parallel comparison, and it's obvious. If you have diffusion on S, which is not If you have diffusion on S, which is not, if you have a diffusion on S, basically, this gap here in the S population can be filled by the individuals that arrive from infinity. And so you could have, it's not clear that I will decay actually. It's true, actually, you can prove it. So I mentioned the paper by Arnold Ducrot. I think he has a proof of this fact. So it's the case of a cylinder, but it's more general, I think. But yeah. Okay, so this is the difficulty. Thank you. Thank you. There's a question, comment. Oh, I have a question. So, in the last slide, you have several keys. This one? So not the last maybe. So not last many before yes. So then the peak which peak is bigger. The what sorry? Which peak? You have two peaks. The peaks are the same. The peaks are the same. And this is mu1 over alpha one. You cannot have if you have more than more individuals than mu1 over alpha one which survive, then the first epidemic could still propagate actually. Could still propagate actually. So, here the peak on if you and if you have several peaks, which is the case if you have n larger, then you have always the same the same maximum. We have a break, but the polyson is supposed to be a supposed to be a speaker after the break but actually getting better about that you can't still aim at the salt so you cannot if you couldn't it can't speak to it today so so we have a break at this point it cancel so maybe So maybe we have any
