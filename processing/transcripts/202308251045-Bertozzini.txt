Shall I tell you? Yeah, I can, I can. So, shall I tell you 10 minutes before then? Or you prefer or not? Yeah, you can alert me when it is 10 minutes or five minutes. Okay, please go ahead. Okay, so first of all, thanks to the organizers for the invitation. Invitation. I cannot be there in person, but it's already good to be able to talk online. This is a work that is a long-term collaboration with Roberto Conti, my long-time collaborator, and Matti Razak from El Samprin. This is the full abstract of the talk. So there is some kind of trend in quantum gravity recently that assume that space Assume that space-time geometry is emergent at the macroscopic level, and macroscopically, there might not be any space-time available. Of course, in the conferencing on commutative geometry, this is not often the point of view taken. So, we want to claim that there is still a possibility to give a meaning to space-time geometry also at the fundamental level somehow. Fundamental level somehow. The specific approach that I am proposing is that the geometry is induced by a notion of state. So every state is inducing some geometry, and this geometry might be non-commutative. The main ideas are mutivated from algebraic quantum field theory when algebraic quantum field theory is somehow freed from the background of the many. From the background of the manifold space-time on which it is formulated, usually. The main techniques are making use of to meet Takizaki modular theory and non-commutative geometry in a certain categorical sense. This picture here gives you a quite concrete idea of the purpose. In a very informal sense, if you start with a fixed space-time geometric background, there is a notion of locality. This one, for example, is a geometric manifold. And on this geometric manifold, if there is a Riemann tensor, you have a notion of geodesic, a sort of notion of free motion over it, free dynamic. And you can think about local equilibrium states that live on these dynamical systems. System. We want somehow to invert this error. And instead of going from a fixed space-time background and obtain some local equilibrium states, we want to start from local equilibrium states, use modular theory in order to extract the dynamics. And then the difficult part is contained in this green arrow that from the dynamics one wants to extract a quantum geometry. At the end of the story, if you start with a At the end of the story, if you start with a classical geometry and you apply to a situation where you have, for example, algebraic quantum field theory, and you complete this turning, you will find that the geometry that comes back is no more the original one, it is a quantum geometry. Since I'm the only one that is talking about modular theory here, as far as I understand, I As far as I understand, I have to specify something about modular theory. So there are many other treatments in non-commutative geometry where modular theory becomes relevant. The study of Fourier and type 3 for Neumann algebra started with Alain Kahn in famous work. The modular class of Poisson manifold has been studied by Weinstein and collaborators in Poisson manifolds. The notion of real spectral triple in Alan Con has been inspired. And Khan has been inspired by the conjugation to meet Takazaki modular theory. Thermal time in the paper by Conan Rovelli is again related to modular theory. There are several notions of modular spectral triples that have been proposed specifically by Conan Moscovici using twisted spectral triple that has been mentioned several times here. There is another notion of modular spectral triple. Another notion of modular spectral triple that was pursued by the Australian school. And recently, there is a lot of activity in modular curvature with several people contributing: Moscovici, Calcalli, and his collaborators, Rafa, Ponge, and so on. The point of view that we are taking here is quite different. We are taking a point of view that is more inspired by the directional right quantum field theory, where Direction in algebraic quantum field theory, where long-time work has been pointing to the fact that modular theory in quantum field theory is strictly related to the formulation of geometry. It's starting from Visoniero-Wickman in the 70s and then Schroer and Wiesbrook and then Burkers. A reconstruction of Nikovsky space using Mobura theory has been achieved by Buckel, Summers and White and recently the result of activity by Morinelli Neb and Ola. By Morinelli Neb and Olafsson about the position of modular subspaces and geometry. So first of all, what kind of quantum geometry are we going to be interested in? In non-commutative geometry, usually we take a point of view that is a spectral, but we usually deny the existence of a spectrum in the classical sense. Sense and this might be not the correct complete answer, let's say, to this thing. Here, for example, you see a typical picture of what could be in the spectrum in a commutative case. So here is an algebra C3, okay. And the spectrum is given by three points, and you see that it corresponds to diagonal matrices that are the sections of this line bundle over this. Line bundle over these three points. On the other side, if you have the two by two matrices with complex numbers, you see that the two by two matrices with the line by column multiplications are obtained as the family of sections of these line bundle over this pair group point. Okay, so one can further refine this kind of picture, and there is a theorem that was proved for the moment. Theorem that was proved for the moment published only in the discrete situation with Roberto Conti and my ex-student Nati Pittiwan. And the full spectrum theory for sister algebra is not yet out. It will be out hopefully soon. And the spectrum is a kind of fair uniform bundle that satisfies certain saturation and certain saturation properties. Okay, so there is an Saturation properties. Okay, so there is a notion of spectrum that we can think also in the case of non-commutative geometry that is providing an extension of Gelfand-Neimer duality, also in the non-commutative case, if someone is interested to have a notion of spectrum. From this kind of picture, one can understand that, as in the classical case, where the notion of geometry is somehow containing two kinds of Containing two kinds of data: a data about gluing local information that is usually called the Schend theory, and when geometry, in the sense of Riemann metric, or more generally, covariant derivative is available, we have a notion of covariance that is in the study of transport and holonomy between different fibers of space. So, very likely, only. So, very likely, also at the quantum level, one has a similar description. This is to motivate the kind of geometry that we are going to find. What is the strategy that we propose? Here there is four points that is strictly following the development of the following talk. The first point is how to extract the notion of localization. This is a big problem in quantum physics, in quantum gravity. In quantum gravity, there is essentially no accepted notion of localization for observables. Okay, so we propose a notion of modular localization where the notion of subsystem is strictly related to the modular property of the subarject. Then, the second point is the extraction from these local modular data of a kind of geometry that looks Kind of geometry that looks like spectral triple, although consisting of an evolutive algebra represented on a Hilbert space with a self-adjoint operator typically unbounded, but these self-adjoint operators satisfy axioms that are typically of order one operators, not of order, not of order two, as one would expect from modular theory. And J is a kind of real structure that comes from modular theory. The ingredients. The ingredient that corresponds to the transport in the previous slide is provided by a notion of groupoid of holonomy transformation between these local modular geometries. The last part that is the part that is more problematic and is still controlling, if you want, since a long time, is the extraction of an actual space-time non-commutative geometry from this kind of the shant and Of the shant and transport data that come from modular theory. I apologize in advance because the talk will be partial and you will not see final results. So let's go to the first point. What do we mean by localization in the modular sense? In algebraic quantum field theory, it's well known that we have a factor that two spaces associate unit and sister algebras. Unit and sister algebras. So these spaces are typically in algebraic quantum field theory open sets, non-trivial open sets with non-trivial Kaushal complement in Minkowski space-time. And these algebras, local algebras, are unit of sister algebras. What is interesting in the algebraic quantum field theory context also for free fields on Minkowski space-times. Or Minkowski space-time scalar-free fields is that these local algebras have a mysterious modular property that has never been physically understood, apart from some special cases, of course. The rich leader theorem assures that all these local algebras have a cyclic separating vacuum vector, where the vacuum vector is restricted to these local algebras, it becomes cyclic and Local algebras it becomes cyclic and separating. I will be more precise in a moment. And thanks to this Rieschlier theorem, all these local algebras are equipped with a one-parameter group of transformations, that is the modular group. Unfortunately, this modular group has been geometrically interpreted only in some specific cases like formal three theories and in certain specific geometric situations like wedge region. Geometric situation like wedge regions, the famous Bizonian-Wickman theorem. It remains a problem, still open, what kind of physical interpretation this canonical modular flux has in this context. So, what we propose to do in the case of modular localization, we propose to reverse the previous function. So, starting from a Starting from an algebra, big A, and a certain state omega, we propose to abstract a certain net of subalgebras. What are these subalgebra? These subalgebras are such that the GNS representation provides the GNS vector that is cyclic and separating exactly as it happens in the previous theorem. Theorem. Okay, so in practice, all the local algebras that are available in free algebraic quantum field theory will be modular in our case, and many more algebras that are not local in usual algebraic quantum field theory, but still have a cyclic separating vector in the GNS, will be considered to be good examples of local algebras for us. Now, the problem is to understand if these modular nets can describe a certain quantum field theory on a new geometry. Let me quickly review what do we mean by modular theory since I'm the only one that is mentioning this kind of mathematical topic. Modular theory was introduced by Tomit. Modular theory was introduced by Tonita in the end of the 60s and the perfection by Takizaki. And typically, it is stated in the case of von Neumann algebras already represented on a Hilbert space, where there is a certain vector that is cyclic in this precise sense. So the closure of the space generated by acting on the vacuum by operators in the Fernand algebra is creating all of paper space and separating that is this non-triviality condition. So under this kind of Under this kind of cyclic separating, we already get a modular one-parameter group on the Hilbert space and the modular conjugation that is an anti-linear operator, an anti-linear isometry that satisfies the following two properties. The modular group is leaving the algebra invariant, so it is a canonical dynamical look and the Loop and the conjugation by J is transforming the algebra in its commutant. Well, the commutant, of course, is the family of operators that are commuted with all the elements of the original algebra. There is a different way to look at modular theory that might convince you that modular theory is not only something that has to deal with from Neumann algebra, but is something that is deeply concerned with geometry. With geometry. It is not evident from the formulation in terms of Neumann algebras that it is so, but it is quite clear from this first quantized version of modular theory. This frequentized version was originated by Riffel and it produced a different proof of the modular theorem before. When you have a Hilbert space that contains a standard real subspace, so it's a Real subspace. So it's a real subspace of a complex Lilber space that satisfies the following two properties: a non-traditionality condition and a saturating condition like here. Automatically, the TOMITA conjugation, that is the operator that is just changing the sign in the second term of the direct sum, is clausable, and you can use Hilbert-Pollard decomposition. Use Hilbert polar decomposition, and you obtain this polar decomposition here where J is conjugate linear and delta is a positive operator. And the real space is stable under the action of this one parameter group, unitary one parameter group, and J is moving the real subspace to the simple. Symplectic or symplectic complement that is the family of vectors that are orthogonal in the imaginary part of the inner product. So you can see that modular theory is intrinsic anytime you have a complexification of photosymplectic spaces under certain conditions of compatibility between the orthogonal inner product and the symplectic inner product. So it has a deeply geometric meaning. Geometric meaning. This one simply recalls what is the link between the one particle formulation and the usual modular theory for Leumman algebra when you use the second quantization function and you transform the symplectic space in the Weyl algebra and you obtain again the one parameter group that you have in the free field theorem or the level of formal algebra. Okay, the point number two. Okay, the point number two: how do we extract modular local geometry? This was the content of a paper that was published more than 10 years ago. So to our to any one of our local modular subalgebras. Subalgebras and the original vacuum state restricted to this modular local algebra, we associate what is in mathematics the standard representation. So we consider the GNI silver space of induced by the state omega by the cyclic separating property of the vacuum vector restricted to the algebra. We obtain our modular data. Our modular data. So we obtain the one parameter group delta IT that has a generator kω that is this set of adjoint operator appearing here. And we obtain the antilinear conjugation j that is the operator that appear here at the end. The algebra A omega is restricted from the algebra A contain all the operators that satisfy these conditions here. So the commutator state. Condition here, so the commutator stay in the von Neumann algebra generated by the GNS representation of the algebra. Notice that this operator here satisfies a first-order condition. So this looks very similar, and this was the motivation for the original study of this kind of things. Okay, it looks very similar to a spectral triple where J looks like a real structure and K looks like a Dirac operator. Looks like a Dirac operator, but this is actually quite different. First of all, it's not an irreducible representation. This one is a representation that has a very big commutant. You see that here there is an anti-isomorphism with the commutant. So it's a very non-irreducible representation. And the operator K has spectral properties that are quite different from the D-Rec, and so on. So, what we have been doing so far, and it is relevant. far and it is relatively solid is to associate to every pair of algebra and state a certain family of local modular algebras and modular spectral geometries over them. In the previous paper it was pointed out how these structures are related to the notion of modular spectral triple that was studied by Carrie, Rennie, Philips and Sukochev in Australia. In Australia. With my ex-student, Titikon, we have been working out what was already partially contained in the 2000 paper, that is a physical interpretation of these kind of data. If we use the formalism of covariant quantum theory, as it is often utilized in, for example, loop quantum gravity and other approaches that And other approaches that quantum gravity use in covariant language, we can think of A omega as a local algebra of partial observables, not observables. So there is a big difference between observables in quantum gravity and partial observables. So that's why we are able to localize somehow here. This GNS vector is interpreted. Vector is interpreted as a covariant vacuum. It corresponds to the covariant vacuum in the language of covariant quantum theory. The Hilbert space that we have been creating from the GNAS presentation corresponds to what they call the boundary Hilbert space. And we would like to interpret this K omega, the generator of the modular transformation as a constraint, a dynamic constraint. And this J, that's quite important. J, that's quite important, is an intrinsic CPT symmetry operator that comes built in in the structure always. Okay, so all our modular algebras are intrinsically equipped with a canonical CPT operator. At this point, when you have a dynamical system in the covariant case, we have two routes to determine what are the observables. One is to find the invariant observables that are the fixed observables. Observables that are the fixed point of the modular group. In this case, they always exist. Xi omega is always an invariant vector. But they might be very few. They might be degenerate. So the physical hybrid space might degenerate to something that is physically finite-dimensional or even one-dimensional, or for non-trivial. And so it is much better to go to covariant observables that consist in taking the That consists in taking the cross product and examine the inverse space that is natural for the representation of this cross-product algebra. That's what exactly what they do now. The third ingredient of the construction is the modular holonomy group point. So when you have two A1 and A2 that are modular local algebra. Are modular local algebras that are contained in another modular local algebra, we have an inclusion of the GNS spaces. And we can think of all the possible unitary living in the biggest Hilbert space that is transforming by conjugation the first algebra in the second algebra. So you see that the joint action of the unit is transforming the algebra A1 into the algebra A2. Into the algebra 82, so it is transforming the GNS space accordingly. And we restrict two operators that are somehow commuting with the modular group of the biggest input space. These two have some control on the kind of perturbation that the unit is inducing on the modular generators. Now, the problem is what we want to interpret this kind of group of covariance holonomy group in the case of geometry. So, what kind of geometry is supporting this kind of holonomy? The conjecture is that we are dealing here in the non-commutative situation to the typical case that we have in Klein-Cartine geometries. Okay, so we have to specify the geometry. We have to specify the geometry using a kind of bundle and transport alone between the fibers. Here we have been concentrating only on unitary morphism between the spectral geometries. It was already conjectured in the old paper that one has to consider suitable bimodals, although we never went to exhaust the possibility open by this kind of opportunity. What could be the meaning for quantum gravity of this kind of setting? Being very wild and conjectural, you can think of Tonita-Takizaki theory in this sense as a kind of quantum version of Einstein equation. You start from operational data of observable states, and when you fix a state, you immediately obtain these modules. These modular covariant geometries and their groupoid of transport. And this is describing a quantum geometry. So we are extracting a quantum geometry starting from our operational data. The identification will likely be that the modular generator is related to a quantum. To a quantum version of the T-mule in general relativity. So it describes the local matter content. And we would like to try to guess that the role of the geometry, so the genie-new in the Einstein equation, is here contained in the specification of the modular holonomies that we have been just describing. In the past, there have been some proposals by physicists, Korici, Rayan, and Sudarsky, that one could be satisfied at the quantum level to describe geometry just by these intercorrelations between operational data. So it's not the first time that this appears in the literature. The holonomy groupoid that we have been just holonomy groupoid that we have been just describing is producing fluctuations so for every unitary that is for example going from the algebra to itself we obtain a fluctuation of the modular operator so the original modular operator that is induced by the vacuum on the algebra is perturbed and it produces a fluctuation so this looks like a fluctuation of the Timu nu due to quantum effects Due to quantum effects. And if we act on the vacuum state, we see that we get a family of perturbed vacua that are obtained by acting on the vacuum state by these holonomy groups for every local modular algebra. And we get for every local modular algebra, we get a one-parameter group of relative modular theory. Relative modular theory that is a is giving star functions of a W star category that is this W star category here. In algebraic quantum field theory, especially in the free case, we start with symplectic space of solutions and we obtain observable algebra. And we obtain observable algebras that are second-quantization algebras. In our case, the generalization of the equivalence principle is something like this. So, we assume that all of the singularities of the theory and the interaction of the theory are contained in the background geometry that is induced by the state. Okay, so we are pushing all of the interaction level of geometry, and we want to interpret. Geometry, and we want to interpret everything as a locally free evolution on these complicated background geometry that is determined by the vacuum state. Okay, so this is what the equivalence principle will look like in this case. The final point in the development of the theory is still very problematic and we'll just We'll just quickly go through it. Okay, so we think of identifying the points of our space-time geometry using the filters of very maximal of these local model algebra, we'll correspond to the summers and others to prove that Minkowski geometry. Prove that Mintowski geometry can be posteriori from the net of local algebras in field theorem. Of course, in this case, they are commutative geometries. So, in our case, we claim that our construction will produce non-commutative geometry. So, we will produce what is a spectrum of a non-commutative algebra with extra data. Extra data and how can we recognize the existence of these we recognize from the fact that if you have two local algebras and the modular the two local modular algebra have modular evolution that do not influence each other then we say that the the These two algebra correspond to points that are not connected by an error in the base group point of the spectral space soid. And as it happened in algebraic one, two, three theory, anytime you switch on, for example, a double cone, and this A1 could be the algebra of a double cone, and this S2 might be the algebra of another double cone, the modular theory is perturbed. So even if the two points are fine. So, even if the two points are far apart, the modular theory of the union of the two regions is not equal to the modular theory of the two separate regions. So, points are talking to each other quantum mechanically. Okay, so we can recognize the quantum correlation between different points from this modular effect. Modular effect. Okay. So, although this idea has not been purchased in a rigorous way, there is nothing written about it. That's the way we plan to recover the space-time geometry. Paulo, 10 minutes, Paolo, let me skip 10 minutes, yeah. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yes, so let me skip. Yes, let me skip the part that is more conjectural about how to recover, for example, gauge theory in this case. And let me go simply to say two things about what kind of implication this seems to give to the notion of geometry. For the moment, we see that we obtain a picture of local algebra, local modular algebra. Algebra, local modular algebras, or local modular geometries that are connected by this kind of holonomy group point. In principle, there is nothing that stops R from considering higher holonomies in this case. So once you have level one, you can go up to further levels. So in this case, the fear is that we are missing some important concept in mathematics about the shant. About the shame in the non-commutative case and transport in the non-commutative case. So I'm not aware of any discussion of non-commutative Descheme theory. The only paper that I know is a paper by Flory and Fritz that will be discussing the generalization of sheaves in the non-commutative situation. And it is the only paper that is mentioning this kind of opportunity. And also in the case of transport, the situation is not. The situation is not so clear. So, mathematically, there is probably to explore the relation with infinite categorical algebraic geometry. So, for the moment, there is no notion of derived and non-commutative geometry in the sense of con. Okay, so if one has to go in this direction, we are missing serious mathematics. Before concluding, let me mention Before concluding, let me mention some important developments that might create some important trend in this kind of context. Recently, with Roberto Conti, we discovered a notion of modular flow in classic Ariemanian geometry that deserves to be explored significantly. Usually, people say that modular theory is something that is only quantum, and in a certain sense, it is correct. sense it is correct okay so modular theory disappear the modular flow disappear when the algebra is commutative it becomes trivial okay but it is incorrect to say that in classical geometry there is no notion of modular flux first of all because I already mentioned the Weinstein theory about Poisson geometry where there is the modular class okay this kind is another example you take This kind is another example. You take a Riemannian geometry, okay, a classical Riemannian geometry, where G is the metric tensor, and you consider this kind of extended tangent space, the complexified of this generalized tangent bundle. And we see immediately that since this one is the complexification of an orthosymplectic space, we get a free modular theory that is acting as a gauge in every fiber. In every fiber. Okay, we are exploring what is the meaning for quantization of this kind of geometry. This is a quite interesting development, it is relatively recent. Since it was mentioned by the talk by Lantam Boyle recently here at the workshop, I would like to stress that these kind of representations are not irreducible and I already mentioned. And I already must say that they are already equipped with the CPT symmetry that is canonical. So the possible relation with the cosmological models that have been proposed where the CPT symmetry is fundamental might deserve to have a more detailed exploration. The last thing that I want to mention before I close. Is that I became aware very recently, I've been to the Nibegen Quantum Gravity Conference to attend several talks in quantum gravity, and there was essentially nothing related to quantum gravity proper in the sense of non-commutative geometry. Okay, a lot of talks about all the other approaches, but almost nothing about non-commutative geometry. But I was quite surprised that learning. Learning that there is this proposal of experimental verification of quantum gravitational effects. Of course, I know that there are a lot of proposed tabletop experiments, okay, of every possible interaction, the sense of entanglement, and the interaction between entanglement and gravity. There are many proposals of experiment. I was aware of that. I was not aware that there was a proposal to Aware that there was a proposal to directly measure modular fluctuations to geometry induced in free conformal quantum field theory. First of all, because since even Ulru radiation is quite problematical to detect, it was given for granted that the analogous gravitational effect was even more complicated to kind of pinpoint. But apparently, something. But apparently, something serious because the experiment has been proposed by Catherine Zurek after theoretical investigation with Eric Derlinde in these kinds of papers. And there is an experiment that is called GQuest that is gone in a collaboration between Caltech and the Fermilab in which Catherine Zurek with Adi Kari, that is the experiment main experimentalist, are trying to verify Are trying to verify the kind of fluctuations induced by quantum geometry, even in the case of an algebraic quantum field theory, free quantum field theory in Kosky space-time, okay? That is induced by fluctuation of the modular Hamiltonian. So they measure effects that are directly related to the fluctuation of the modular Hamiltonian. So, I thought the origin of this kind of experiment comes from string theory and holography, and the calculation that they do in order to motivate this kind of experimental quest is motivated by a slightly extension of the holographic paradigm that they have in ADS CFT. Okay, so they try to stretch it in order to apply to the causal region that is. The causal region that is delimited by the surface of the causal diamond in Minkowski space. Okay, so they want to consider the causal diamond in Minkowski space as a kind of horizontal. Anyway, if positive results might come from this kind of experiment, this one is also an immediate verification of the quantum effect on geometry related to modular theory because the effect is measuring the fluctuation of the k omega that we will. The k omega that we were mentioning before. Okay, so one could try to stretch a lot and to try to interpret the purpose of this theory as a kind of geometric holography. Usually people in holography talk about boundary and bulk theory, and holography is connecting the conformal field theory on the boundary to the quantum gravity in the bulk. And the people do not even. In the bulk. And the people do not even mention geometry in the bulk. They are just satisfied to know that the quantum gravity is described by the corresponding conformal field theory. Here you can read the proposal that we have been giving as a kind of geometrical counterpart to holography. So you start with a classical space where the conformal field theory is living and you try to find out a non-commutative quantum space that is coming from the Quantum space that is coming from the modular theory induced by this CFT. Okay, I am ready to conclude giving you the final remarks. Okay, this is the summary of what we propose. This is just the general formalism. We are not selecting models. It's the specific choice of algebra and vacuum states that will determine the geometry. And physicists and Okay, and physicists might do the analog of action and use the techniques of spectral geometry in this case. But this is just the general language that from operationally defined data that are partial observables and Partial observables and a state on partial observables is deducing some modular categorical non-commutative geometry. We do not need to start with a classical space to quantize or a classical theory to quantize. We just start with operational data that are already quantum. The space-time is spectrally reconstructed, is reconstructed, but it doesn't mean that it is emerging in the sense that it exists only classically at the macroscopic level. Only classically at the macroscopic level. It's a space-time that exists at the deep quantum level and it is non-commutative for this purpose. The techniques, as I already been stressing, modular theory and some kind of categorical non-commutative geometry that very likely need to be further developed in order to be able to describe concretely all the intricacy of this thing. For people that would like to put objections, I already put here a small list of objections. Okay, so why we are using local algebras, because usually local algebras in algebraic quantum field theory already contain information on the background geometry. Okay, the local algebras in quantum field theory are obtained on shell. They are usually in the free field theory are just the second quantization. Theory are just the second quantization of symplectic spaces of solutions, okay? And the solutions, the simpletic space of solution of the field equation, are sensitive to the geometry. Here, no, we are not starting with on-shell algebras, these are off-shells, so we can actually start as my colleague. Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, sorry to interrupt, but you are already in your questions part of your talk. So, if you could okay, so these are the So these are the idea is no problem. This is the papers on that are related to this approach. It's not much, there is something forthcoming. And I thank for your very special thanks to my longtime collaborator, Roberto Monti, that has been very patient with the intricacy of this kind of thing. So, thank you. These kinds of things, so thanks again. Thank you very much. Uh, and again, sorry to put you pressure, but the day, uh, the week is people have to leave. So, I would like to please absolutely keep the time. So, questions or remarks or Fidelia Chiao Paolo. Do you think that there can be some concrete applications of this modular theory? Modular theory to the almost commutative geometry cons approach to the standard model, and in particular to the fact that the Lorentz version of it, but I mean by concrete, I mean terms in the action or something of this kind for the action, I'm not sure, but that there might be a relation between these and gauge theoretic. And gauge theoretic data like the one in CON approach. And also, what you already studied with your collaborators about twist, the Lorentzian version that is corresponding to the Euclidean version. This yes, there might be some strong relationship with that. There was a slide here in the middle that I jumped where I was. That I jumped where I was exactly asking, let me come to it here. For example, I was exactly asking what could be the relation between this kind of canonical crime structure that is implicit in modular theory and the possible notion of reflection positivity or Of reflection positivity or weak rotation for twisted spectral triplets. Pressure of the chairman made skip exactly the thing that I was asking. Okay, thanks. This is something that I was planning to mention. And there is also the possibility to start with these local modular geometries and make you know this modular operator is an operator of order one, okay, but it is an operator of order one on phase. Is an operator of order one on phase space. So these modular local geometry are phase space geometry. Okay, so they're not geometries on space-time. So one has to polarize, and polarizing, there is a slide here that I jumped. The procedure will go in this sense. So we have this first order phase space geometry. There is a still quite mysterious notion of modular polarization in order to obtain a second order operator on configurations. Order operator on configuration space. Okay, and then from here it is relatively easy to get Direct operators and spectral triples in the sense of Alain Kahn on space-time. Because when you have a Laplacian, then there is a way to introduce tensorization with the Clifford algebra and extract the square root as a Dirac operator. Okay, so there is a root that, in principle, can be obtained from a first. In principle, can be obtained from a first-order operator in phase space to a second-order operator in configuration space, and from there extract the square roots and get spectral triples in the most usual sense. But the road is still complex and deserve that there is a lot to be done here. Okay, is there any other comment or question from people in the room or online? I don't see anything online. If someone online, Anything online? If someone online wants to ask a question, please go ahead. No? Anyone in the room? No. So thanks, Paolo, again, and we will have a 30-minute break for coffee sharp.
