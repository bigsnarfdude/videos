The title of my talk is Algebra Geometrical Solutions to Naturalist Potential Multiplied KT Equation by John Chauwe, Professor Sao Zhou Wen, Professor Zhang Ajun, and Professor Michael. It mainly contains three parts. First is a multi-dimensional continuity. And second, we go one example, the latest potential modified distribution. Finally, some concluding remarks will be discussed. Well, the multi-dimensional Well, well, the market dimension concentration was given in 2001 by Professor Meihau. So, and this concentration has been introduced more in the previous talks. So, here I will not spend much more time on it. So, this is the 3D concentration. Yeah. And in two And in 2003, Adola Bobunko-Suez gave the ABS list. It contains nine equations. Here, we have given the final genius solution for the H1 equation, H30 with the parameter delta equal to zero and the P1 equation equation. When the dimension is higher, the octahedron time-based equations is classified. It contains five equations. Also, the algebra geometric solution has been given by us for the lattice potential field equation and the lattice potential modified field equation. Here we remark that all these equations already observed in literature in the 1980s and 1990s. Then, much progress has been made, such as a blu-ray lag language structure, display solutions, data information, contribution laws. Information, contribution law, symmetry, continuum limits, etc. And there are many papers here, at least some of them. Well, to my knowledge, this book written by Heda Winter, George and Neyhoff, I think it's very important. So it's easy. Well, what about our work? Our aim is algebra geometric solutions by which we would like to study the quasi-periodic. The quasi-periodic behavior for the integrity for the displayed integral systems. The final gap integration method was created for solving the PDV equation with periodic initial value problem by non-code machines and developing is the chamber in 1970s. And this theory had a strong impact on the modern mathematics. The modern mathematics and theological theories. Well, in the 19th century, Akira Nan had made some work on the band gap integration for the display in the global system. In 2005, Tolima is out for geometrical solutions for the For the discrete deviation by the hyper elliptic cone. More details can be found in this paper and this book. So what about our work? Well, Well, in the continuous case, professed tautone use provides the non-linear nadising proceed and combining it with the final web integration, many algebra geometrical solutions have been given for solutions equations. Inspired by this, we would like to develop the We would like to develop the method of algebra core in the discrete inter-global system. Fortunately, in 2012, a final gene solution for the H1 model was constructed. So besides this, on the last table, we have done some works. This is the Some works. This is a part of our some recent our recent work collaborate with Professor Download and Network. So now we will use this equation to explain our method. For the lattice potential, the modified T B equation. Potential modified TB fishing, we use the cognitive special problems and then the display special problem is constructed. By these special problems, some continuous semi-distributed and fully distributed equation can be constructed. This is a continuous time. This is a continuous time. Here, by U1, U2, the direct non-linear treatment equation is derived. And by U1, U2, U3, the potential, the continuous potential multiplication is derived under this parametricization, double x equal to UV. This is the disc group and the same disc groups have the same display that the same display that values the linear shading location under the pure purely displayed case is also dot. Well, by three, basically of the above special problems, the relative potential, the multiplied p equation. Potential multiplier peak equation with one, two, and three discrete variables is also obtained. Here we all give the solution for this equation given by Neil Hoff, Pepper, Westman, and Quedo in 1984. Interestingly, we found that the continuum limit for The continual limit for these three equations is the same, namely the continuous potential take equation. Well, one key to our method is the integral sympathetic map, where we use this Lux matrix. Well, present, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe our Luxembourg. Our last metric will have some leading with yours. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What? Yeah, it oh yeah, yeah, it also has the R match with R. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, by considering the determinant of L lambda or have a half elliptic curve is defined, its thinness is n minus one, and the corresponding lemon surface have had two shifts and two. And the two infinitesimal also from the determinant of L lambda A, namely F lambda, the integrals for the integrals can be deduced. Then based on this relation, on this commutative solution, We found that this map is integral and symplectic. Initially, it is linear, but under this constraint, it became non-linear. So we always called it the non-linear antiglope symbol map. By this map, the discrete globe can be defined by Defined by iteration. Along this flow, the discrete cognitive spectral problem given before and the discrete last equation can be rewritten as these two equations. Here, we denote the fundamental solution matrix of 2.2 equation by capture M lambda. Well, based on this computer trivial relation, we found that the solution for the 2.2 equation, the solution space for 2.2 equation is invariant under the linear operator L M lambda and the trace these L M lambda allows two Allows two eigenvalues. So the corresponding eigenvectors can be defined by HM lambda, which satisfies these two equations simultaneously. So we always call H M lambda the common, the common eigenvector. Well, noting that the Well, noting that the round is one, so we can write the eigenvectors each and parameter by 2.6. And the concentral vector can be calculated by this method. Now Now we can introduce the metamorphic function H1 and H2 on the square total given before. To associate them with the image function, we investigated the analytic behaviors and their dividers. So we introduce elliptical variables by the zeros of these two equations. Here is the For here is the element of L and lambda. Then, by some calculations, we got this formula. They give rise to the zero, the zero, and some zeros and some poles for H1 and H2. And these equations give the these equations give the uh post in in the neighborhood of infinity of infinity so uh we can write down the um dividers for the meromorphic meromorphic functions h1 h2 this is very important because we uh from this we uh we can uh introduce the Introduce the RBL Jack variables by side psi. Then from the total dipole technique, we found that the discrete flows defined before can be linearized by the Abel Jacobi variables. Then we Uh, we then, uh, by the theory of demand service, the uh demand situation function, especially for the melomorphic functions, can be got here. P is a Riemann constant vector, and omega p kl is a dipole, which has only simple holes at p and k with radius one and minus one, respectively. Respectively. Our purpose is to derive the expression for the potential VM. So we consider this limit and get a 2. And also we consider the and we consider this equation then by some Then, by some calculations, okay, we got the limited function expression for the Zm. Then by this parametricization, this one, we got the formula, the formula for W M as well. So, the above discussions also valued for M i bit i equal to 1 to 3, then we can construct three integral integral symptom map. They are commutative in pairs. And then the The algebra geometric solution to the Legal Potential Multiply equations design. Well, in order to understand the quasi-periodic behavior deeply, we gave an example in the case of G equal to minus equal, sorry, equal to one. In this case, the Riemann C. The Riemann CD function is degenerate. It becomes the Jacobi function C3. Now we want to get the map for this solution, for this special solution. Notice that due to arbitrariness of 000, then we can get the decomposition. Gets the composition for W equal to W2 plus W1. W1 is the linear background for the solution W. Then the quasi-periodic behavior will be provided by W2 0 W2. Then, by some calculations, we get the map for W2. Okay, we explain it. Yeah. We can see that a periodic wave capture with apparent linear background that is different from W1. This is because. W1 this because uh in our example all omega k and b one one are pure in general and the jacquard function has a j dependently alt multiplier with respect to b one one so the linear big ground uh is given by the period of the multiplier yeah okay Finally, we give some concluding remarks. Well, we all know that the discrete integral system always are defined on the full stage. However, the solution here with given are defined only on the virtual part. So we would like extinct solutions to two space. Also, Also, we want to construct algebra geometrical solutions containing two solutions parameters for 3D left equation because here the solution we given only contain one solution parameter. Another is that we want to apply our method to other ABS regions and 3D letter decision. I think maybe we can. I think maybe we can use our method for the pluralism. Finally, we will use the theory of tribunal curve for more disgrace, more high-dimensional discrete integral system. Because here, the curve we use is a hyper-editive column. It just has only two shapes. Only two shoes. Oh, that's all. Thank you.
