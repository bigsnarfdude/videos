So, the title is: say, a Deline-Simpson problem for irregular G-connections on P1. Let me abbreviate it like this. And let me mention that all of this is. And let me mention that all of this is joint work with Ju Wei Yun from MIT. So before I talk about the Stilling-Simpson problem for irregular collections, let me just give you maybe some basic introduction to this problem and also tell you a bit about the history. So this is somehow an introduction to the Dillian-Simpson problem. And so, somehow, classically, the setting would be as follows: You consider, let's say, a puncture p1 over the complex numbers. So you remove finitely many points, and let's say we label them by x1 up to xr. Okay, and so very basic fact that really I'm sure everybody has seen is that the fundamental group of this space Group of this space has an explicit presentation in terms of generators related to these points. Namely, if you pick an x0, which is not an s, then you can write this group as being generated by elements gamma1 up to gamma r such that the product is equal to 1. Okay, so the basic picture is like this: you have your sphere, it has an equator, maybe. Maybe and you punch out this point x0, and you punch out all these other points, maybe x1 up to xr, and then each of these gamma i will give will be a path from this x0 around x1, x2, and so on until xr. We choose some orientation here, counterclockwise. Okay, and this question is about local systems on this space. So, what is a local system? So, classically, So, classically, a local system is a locally constant sheaf of C vector spaces. But there is another way to describe them, namely as representations of this fundamental group of the space. So, this is the same as finite-dimensional representations of the fundamental group. So now you see this fundamental group, it has a very explicit description. So actually, this kind of datum is the same as just giving you a tuple of matrices A1 up to AR. So each AI is an invertible matrix, and the product is equal to 1. This is the identity matrix. And the question is now: if you specify If you specify some local things about this local system, so let's say you specify the conjugacy class that each of this AI lives in. So given conjugacy classes C1 up to CR, say, so these are conjugacy classes of matrices. Can you find Matrices like this that satisfy this equation, such that every matrix lies in this conjugacy class. Okay, so can we find matrices A1 up to AR with AI and CI product equal to one? And maybe to make it more interesting, we also want that this. We also want that the local system that comes from this is irreducible. So we don't want these matrices to stabilize a proper non-zero subspace. Okay, so somehow this is. Somehow, this seems to be a question in topology, but actually, this looks more like a linear algebra problem here. So, this problem in this setting is solved to some extent or reformulated in a computable way. So, let me give you some history how this problem was attacked. So, basically, I think I mean the name goes back to the fact that Deligne was the first one to ask this question and then Simpson was the first one to study this in some systematic way. In some systematic way. So, this goes back all the way to 91. So, he first systematically studied this and came up with some solutions in some generic cases. And then there's a situation in which this problem, this equation, has a unique solution, which is called a rigid. So, this was looked at by Katz in detail. Maybe, I mean, he did. I mean, he developed this theory that he uses not exactly to solve this problem, but it is used to solve this problem later. So he gives a construction algorithm. Let me just write it like this when the solution is unique. Okay, but this is of course not always the case. So, really, like the major solution of this problem was given by Crawley-Bovey in, I think, 2006, or maybe around that time. And somehow, there's a way to kind of reformulate this solution in terms of Lie theory. So, what he does is basically, so you take your conjugacy. So, you take your conjugacy class Ci. So, it's basically given by a Jordan decomposition of matrices inside there. So, from that, you can extract some kind of numerical data, and you can attach what I call a leg. So, this is like a linear diagram with a couple of vertices and edges connecting them, and then you put some multiplicities or some labeling where these ki are integers like this. I are integers like this. And you do this for every conjugacy class, and you glue them together at one node, so you get a star-shaped quiver out of this. Let's call this quiver Q, maybe. So let me just, I mean, I don't really want to go into this too much, but let me give you an example. So, let's say You an example. So let's say you have three singular points. So you take three classes: C1, C2, C3, and let's say they have eigenvalues lambda i and mu i, and they are assumed to not be the same. Okay, so basically this means the situation is we look at x being equal to p1 minus three points, so maybe 0, 1, and infinity. 0, 1, and infinity. And if you follow this procedure of Crawley Bovi, then you will end up with a diagram which looks like this. So you have one central node with label 2, and then you have four other nodes corresponding to each conjugacy class. So this is probably a diagram that you have seen before, because this is the default Dinkin diagram. And basically, the existence of a solution to this problem is now equivalent to this dimension vector. So you have this labeling with integers. You glue everything together to get a star-shaped quiver. So you get some kind of dimension vector for this quiver. And like here, for example. And the existence of a solution. And the existence of a solution is equivalent to the dimension vector being a root for Q. So this Q is a star-shaped quiver. You can attach to it some Katzmoody root system, so it makes sense to speak of roots for it. And you can, and what Crawley Bovi proves is that you find this solution. You find the solution if your dimension vector is a root for the system, and in addition, there is some condition on the eigenvalues that necessarily has to be satisfied. Okay. So, for example, in this case, you see there is a solution here, and this solution will correspond to the Gaussian hypergeometric equation. Very famous complex. Very famous complex ordinary differential equation. Okay, so this is all about local systems, and we would like to. I mean, now I was promising to tell you about irregular connections. So we generalize this as follows. Yes? Yes? So I didn't quite explain this, but it is related to the Jordan decomposition of the conjugacy class. So I will not go into detail here. But you can extract these. It's not quite the multiplicities of the eigenvalues, but it's more related to this. Is that okay? I can tell you more precisely later, but it's not going to be important for the rest of the talk. Of the talk. So, we're going to generalize in the following way. So, maybe you know that if you look at local systems on X, they really arise as sheaves of solutions to differential equations, this is the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. And there is an equivalence of categories between local systems on X and let's say regular single. And let's say regular singular algebraic G connections, algebraic connections, no G yet on the space X. And so basically what we want to do is we want to look at this condition here, we just drop it. So instead of looking at regular singular algebraic connections, we are going to look at everything. Maybe let me not give you the formal definition of what it means to be regular singular, but I will give you an example of two connections that differ precisely by this. Maybe these examples are very easy and you've seen them before, but please bear with me. So first example, you look at the affine line and you just take the trivial line bundle on there and you're gonna put a connection which is which looks like this. Which looks like this. Okay, so this does not have a pole at zero, but it may have a pole at infinity. And indeed, if you make a change of coordinates, then this becomes d minus dt over t squared. So you see in the connection form, you have a pole of order at least two here, which means that this is irregular. That this is irregular. And one other way to see this is that if you look at the horizontal sections of this, it's going to be spanned by some exponential function, and this has exponential growth at infinity. Now, this is an example of an irregular connection. So basically, it means in some trivialization you see a pole order of high order. And an example of a regular singular connection, let's look at the trivial line bundle on A1 minus 0. On A1 minus 0. And we just take NABLA to be D minus alpha DT over T. And then it's clear that this connection has a pole of order 1 at 0 and at infinity. So this is regular singular at 0 and at infinity. Okay, so the horizontal sections here are local. Are locally basically given by so wherever this function is defined. And you see really the difference between these notions. So being irregular and regular is the growth of solutions to this equation. So this is polynomial growth, but this is exponential growth at the singularity. So I told you that if you, I mean, to formulate the Dynastension problem, you fix kind of these conjugacy classes here. And you see when you deal with regular singular things. And you see, when you deal with regular singular things, it makes sense because they are basically classified by this residue term here. You can take the exponential, that gives you a conjugacy class. So, if in the regular case, you have to specify a bit more information to make sense of this problem. So, let me tell you what these information are. So, this is a part about formal decomposition. So, I don't know how familiar this is. I mean, in the school of people who study these regular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, yeah, regular Riemann-Hilbert, this is like basic knowledge, but I'm not sure this is true outside of that bubble. So this is basically a statement that goes back to labeled and Turitan, which tells you that when you take a connection locally formally, then you have a very nice description of this. Description of this in terms of some kind of normal form. So we're going to work locally. So let E nabla be. So this is a formal Meromorphic connection. Let's say, okay, so this lives over some form of disk. So actually, it's a vector space over some field of. Some field of Laurent series. So let me be precise what I mean by this. So E, this is a k vector space, finite dimensional. And then you need some connection form. Everything is local, so it's only a map from E to E. And it satisfies the Leibniz rule. So if you apply it to F times S, so this F is a f is an element in k, so function on the formal disk, then this is the same as f prime s plus f times nabla s. And by prime, I mean differentiating in k with respect to t. Okay, so this is kind of the basic object of study. So whenever I take a connection on p1 with a bunch of punctures, then I can restrict it to some formal disk and I obtain an object like this. And I want to describe these objects in some way. These objects in some way. And the statement is as follows. So here's a maybe not so nice formula, but in the end, I will tell you that you can forget most of the things that appear there. So this connection can be written as a finite direct sum of certain connections in a very simple form. Okay, so there's these modules that I denote by E m i what else? Phi i r i. So I need to tell you what are these things. So this mi is simply a positive integer. Phi i is a polynomial in T inverse without constant term. without constant term then I will also use di to denote the degree of phi i and this ri here this is just some regular singular formal connection say formal connection okay so Okay, so there is some data involved. So somehow this controls the regularity, and this Mi tells you something about quote-unquote ramification. So really the most important thing that you should remember about this formula is that when you look at a single block here, it has the following property. So you can look at the following map, which is just the degree MI covering of the formal disk, and you can take this thing, which is something downstairs, you pull it. Thing, which is something downstairs, you pull it back to this covering. And somehow the idea is that over this covering, this will attain somehow a diagonal form up to this RI part here, which may not be diagonal. So this decomposes into a direct sum over roots of unity. And then there is something which I denote by a And then there is something which I denote by exp phi i zeta i t tensored with ri. Okay, so there's two things here. This ri is the same as before, and this x pier is somehow a formal exponential connection. So it looks basically looks like this first example, but it's also like this example here. Like this example here, but you insert maybe this, so I abbreviated by phi, so you put in this phi prime here. Okay, so the solution is really e to the phi of phi of something, which is this phi i of zeta i t. And if this Ri is of rank one, this is of rank one, so you really have a diagonal structure on the covering. Okay, so really So really like the precise meaning of these things is not so important, but really once you basically the upshot is you take your connection, it may not be so accessible on your base, but once you pull it back to some covering, it attains a diagonal shape somehow. Okay. So, really, the important invariant here are these ratios, say di over mi. So, this i is running from 1 to k. And these are called the slopes of E lablin. Of E nabla. Okay, so some of these phi i are some refinement, very refined information that we don't really care about so much. The upshot here is: so a slope tells you two things. If you present it in like a minimal way, basically it tells you, so this MI will tell you what is the cover you need to pull back to diagonalize this part, and this DI tells you how irregular the connection is on this cover. So they tell you on which cover you can say diagonalize up to the RI and how bad the irregularity is. Okay, and maybe second remark. If you look at this formula, if all the slopes vanish, it means that these phi i all zero, then you're only left with some direct images of some regular singular guy, so the whole thing is regular singular. So this connection is regular singular if and only if all slopes vanish. If all slopes vanish. Okay, so really, upshot is the slopes, they give you some refined measure of how irregular your connection is. And let me give you an example why, well, of a famous connection that will fit in the framework of this talk. So let's say you just take as your underlying vector space k to the n. So I need to give you some connection form on this. form on this and this is going to be delta d plus and then some connection matrix and it looks like this so on the lower diagonal you have ones in the upper right corner you have a t inverse and then you have a dt over t okay so you see this has a pole of order two so this is something irregular and this actually has a name it's called the formal Frenkel-Gross connection Connection. Okay, so this was, I mean, the name comes from the fact that the global version of this was constructed by Frenkel and Gauss. So there's some irregular connection on the projective line. And it's played a role in geometric Langlands program, for example. This was kind of say so. Eladic analogs of this connection were constructed using methods from geometric Langlands by. Methods from geometric languages by Heinlot and Gohan-Nun. So, this connection, let's look at this. So, I will tell you the following. So, you can apply a pullback. So, after applying pullback along n-fold covering, so you can show that you get the following: namely, this nabla is formally isomorphic. Is formally isomorphic to a connection that looks like this. So you have D plus, and the connection matrix now takes a simpler shape, namely, it is diagonal, so the leading term is, and the entries are roots of unity like this, and then here you have some constant term, say rho, dt over t. Okay. Okay. So this is somehow the guiding guiding example, which will tell us how to set up this Delin-Simpson problem that we want to study in the general group case. So this is what I call the leading term. So whenever you write the connection like this, you will have a term which is the coefficient of the highest order term. I call this the leading term. Highest order term, I call this the leading term. And you see, this leading term here is regular, semi-simple, right? So it avoids all the root hyperplanes for SLN. And this row here is like the half-sum of positive roots, so positive co-roots. So in this E notation, we can write this as follows. Namely, this E nabla exactly. Looks like this, so it's E T inverse and then some power of minus one. Okay, when I write the scalar here, I just mean it's the rank one connection whose monodromy is this scalar. So minus one to some power. Okay, so with this example and this formally With this example and this formal decomposition in mind, let's say we can set up an irregular Dylan-Simpson problem. And what we need to do is, so we don't just need to fix conjugacy classes. We fix what I call the formal type. And I think I forgot to tell you what is the formal type. Tell you what is the formal type. The formal type is this kind of information. So, this is the formal type. Or if you want, you can also think about this kind of thing here on the covering. Okay, so this problem was actually studied before us, but only in the integral slope case. So, this community is sometimes referred to. So, this community is sometimes referred to as unramified, so this connection already takes this diagonal shape downstairs. So, this was looked at by Philip Bulch and then solved by Heroy in 2017. And they again use quivers, so they come up with a way to encode this information of the formal type in some kind of quiver. And then you can study quiver representations of this. Okay, when then the only other solution that we were aware of when this is not integral, so let's say you get an actual rational number, and then there was a solution when basically this thing is as ramified as possible. So, in this decomposition here, you only So, in this decomposition here, you only see a single block. So, this Mi is the rank of the connection. So, Mi is equal to N, is the rank. Okay, and you only look at two singularities. So, this singularity is regular singular, and this one has slope R over N. And this solution was given by Was given by five authors that I will write down and maybe not try to pronounce. Sage, and this is from 2022, so a bit more recent. Okay, but one thing that all these, I mean, I will not tell you what is the solution because you will see by what I will tell you later for general groups, because so far everything has been for honest vector bundles with connections. So the structure group is GLN. So far, everything is for GLN. Okay. So let me explain to you how to generalize. So, let me explain to you how to generalize this to maybe a simple complex group. Let's see timing is good. Okay, so Okay, so let's generalize to a simple group of complex numbers. Okay, and so basically there's two kinds of difficulties. One is this irregular singularities, which we maybe don't know how to encode when there is ramification. So we have the problem of irregular singularities. The problem of irregular singularities abbreviates like this. But the other problem is that we don't really know how to deal with multiple singularities. I don't know. So no, actually I know something. So Philip Bolch has this procedure where he attaches a diagram. A diagram to a formal type like this, but it may have edges with a negative multiplicity somehow. I mean, I don't know this too well, but there's the quiver you don't always get, but you get some kind of diagram, but I'm not sure you can make sense of kind of moduli of representations of this. But if you want to look at this, Philip Bolch's papers are okay. And then, right, so the second problem is that we don't know how to. Problem is that we don't know how to deal with multiple singularities. So you see, for GLN, as mentioned again, everything is decoded and encoded in terms of quivers, so you just need to say what is the quiver of a formal type, and then you can glue everything together. But for a general G, we don't know how to attach a quiver to this kind of situation. So the solution is just to restrict basically to the same setting that these people work in. Work on so here's the setup. So let's say this G is a simple group. And then visual data, so we have a maximotaurus and the Porelstar group in G, right? So diagonal, for example, diagonal matrices in upper triangular in. In upper triangular in SLN, so e.g. like this. And then we have attached to this a Lie algebra and a maximum Carton in this. And then we also have a while group, which for SLN would just be a symmetric group. And we're going to look at the space which is x. So this is p1 minus. So this is P1 minus two points. And we choose a coordinate at zero. Coordinate at zero. And tau is its inverse. So tau is a coordinate at infinity. So maybe one short thing to remark is that it's not on the board anymore, but if you were to study the actual classical Delin-Simpson problem on this space, it would not be very interesting because the fundamental group is Bibelian. But here, once you allow this. But here, once you allow this irregular singularity, the situation is already very rich. So, I will tell you what the connections that we are looking at. So, for this, I will introduce the notion of what I call isoclinic irregular type. So, this is basically a formulation of this idea that in this Liberturitan decomposition, you have a single block. Written decomposition, you have a single block, so it's as ramified as possible, but for a general group. So the setting is as follows. So we're going to look at a formal disk around infinity. So this is the spectrum of formal Laurent series. And then for every integer, as before, you get some m-fold covering. So d infinity m cross. M cross mapping down to the infinity cross as a covering group which is cyclic of order m. This is a degree m covering. And moreover, let's fix some positive integer co-prime to m and then the ratio is denoted by nu. Okay, and to say what is an isoclinically regular type, I will write down some expression and explain to you what it is. So let's say we write down this thing A. So this is somehow the replacement of these phi's there. So some refined information about the radio. So, some refined information about the irregular singularity. So, this is somehow a Laurent tail. So, we have a leading term. The pole order of this is d over m, and it has a coefficient like this. And then you go up all the way to the pole order 1 over m term, or pole order 1 on the covering. But here I need to tell you what are these coefficients, and these are all elements from this Cartan, which is. Which is the algebra of the maximal torus that we choose. And we make one crucial assumption which mimics what happens in this Frenkel-Gross example, namely the leading term of this connection, so this A minus B over M. This is assumed to be regular semi-simple. Okay. And again, it means that it avoids all the root hyperplanes in this carton. All the root hyperplanes in this carton. So, for what's still on the board, so for SLN, you have seen here all the eigenvalues are pairwise different, so it means it's regular semi-simple. And then here's our definition. So, we say that a formal G-connection, say E-Nabla. We call it IsoClinic of type A and slope nu. So isoclinic referring to the intuition that somehow all the slopes that you see are the same. So in this Frenkel-Gross example, you only see slope 1 over n. So here you only see the slope u. Only see the slope u. And though it may be, strictly speaking, it doesn't make sense to speak of slopes of a G-connection without realizing it in some representation. This is some of the intuition. Namely, as I explained before, the idea is that you take this connection, you describe it by pulling it back to a cover. So you pull this back to this M-fold covering, and you require this to be isomorphic. And you require this to be isomorphic, so formally isomorphic, to a connection of this form, namely the connection matrix is this A. And then there is some other term which you do not control, so you denote by lambda tau 1 over m. And this lambda is some element, so some lambda which does not have a pole at infinity. At infinity. Okay, so the good thing is you've already seen an example of this, namely this Frenkel-Gross connection here is an example. You take your connection, you put it back to the n-fold covering, and then here is your A. The A is just this leading term, which is regular semi-simple. Actually, the lambda in this case is this. Actually, the lambda in this case is this uh half sum of positive core roots here. Let's see how much. Okay. Okay, again, maybe just let me write it down. So, somehow here is a linguistic remark. This is supposed to mean that all slopes are the same. Okay, but maybe a more interesting remark is. Okay, but maybe a more interesting remark is the following. So right now it looks like you just choose some you just choose some number here, some rational number, you write down this condition, you find a connection there, but actually, especially the denominator of the slope is not arbitrary. So m is not arbitrary. And the reason is the following. So, when you take your connection, it lives on the base and you pull it back, then it naturally acquires an action of the covering group. Okay, so this covering group, it acts on this regular type A, let's say the covering group of this thing. So, this is the covering. Covering it acts on A, and the way that it acts is through an element of the while group. Say W small W and W, and moreover. And moreover, so this A has this decomposition into monomials, and every coefficient that appears is actually an eigenvector for this element w. So each A minus I over M is an eigenvector. Minus I over m is an eigenvector. So the question is, how does this restrict your m? So remember that we have chosen this A in such a way or prescribed it in such a way that the leading term of this, so A minus D over M, is actually regular semi-simple. So what this means is that you get a regular semi-simple eigenvector of this W. Eigenvector of this W. So this W is a regular element in the sense of Springer. So, in the sense of Springer, really, and the definition is really this: a regular element is one. A regular element is one which has an eigenvector in the reflection representation, which is regular semi-simple. And moreover, the order is what's called a regular number. Okay, so there is some restriction on this M, and actually, it's This M and actually, it's not just some restriction, it is very explicit. So, let me say a few words about this. Well, anyway, now it's too late. Okay, so really the point is that these regular numbers they have been classified completely by Springer. They have been classified completely by Springer in the sense that he gives formulas for classical groups and for exceptional groups, there are lists of all regular numbers that you can get. So, here are a couple of examples of regular numbers. So, one is one which I unfortunately just erase, but if G is SLM and W is the symmetric group, then one regular element is, for example, the end cycle. Okay, and I just erased the eigenvector here, but basically the eigenvector looks like this. And when you act with this n-cycle on this, it shifts everything down, so it's the same as multiplication by a root of unity. And this n-cycle has another property, namely it is elliptic. You could take an n minus 1 cycle. You could take an n minus 1 cycle that has one fixed direction, this is also regular. Or you can take powers of this because they see the same eigenvector somehow. And maybe for more interesting examples when g is the symplectic group, then you can realize the while group as a subgroup of permutations of signed integers from 1 to n. From 1 to n. So there's a condition here, namely that it sends minus k to minus sigma k. So one specific element you have in here is the 2n cycle. Okay, and again, this 2n cycle is going to be a regular elliptic element. This is not a coincidence. So 2n is the Coxeter number here, and this n is the Coxeter number here. So the Coxeter element is always regular elliptic, and then you can Element is always regular elliptic, and then you can construct other regular elements by taking powers of the coxeter element. But anyway, if you want to look it up, there's an old paper by Springer, and you can find a complete classification of these regular numbers for several groups, for example. Okay, questions so far? Okay, so let me tell you what is uh the result that we can prove. So we spent some time setting up So, we spent some time setting up the problem. So, here's the result. So, let's say we look at slope d over m as some positive rational number and assume m to be a regular elliptic. And then, moreover, And then moreover, we are going to take O to be a new potent orbit for the V algebra. So we need to do two things. We have two singularities. So we need to specify some local information at 0 and 1 and some at infinity. So we are going to look at connections basically that are isoclinic at infinity of this slope. Are isoclinic at infinity of this slope, and we specify the residue to lie in this specific orbit. So the statement is that the following are equivalent. So the first thing is the thing we want to solve. So this is the Dylan-Simpson problem with respect to AO. So A is some irregular type like there. So maybe let's say A is an irregular type. Isoclinic. Isolinic irregular type of slope μ. Okay, so the statement here is there exists an algebraic G connection on P1 minus two points satisfy. Satisfying the following properties. So, first, it is isoclinic of type A and slope u at infinity and moreover it is regular singular. At zero, and the residue lies in this orbit with residue in this orbit. Oh. Okay, so this is some of the problem we want to solve. And in modern terms, maybe a better formulation is that you can look at a certain moduli space of connections where you prescribe some local information, and then the question is whether this moduli space. And then the question is whether this moduli space is empty or not. Okay, so maybe so. This is a question about the moduli space of connections being non-empty. Okay, so let me give you, so we have two basically criteria, so two real formulations that help us solve this. That helps us solve this. So, let me give you the first one. So, the first one is maybe more geometric in flavor, and then the second one is representation theoretic. So, here's the second one. So, this is maybe the geometric version. You will see in a second why I call it like this. So, basically, the statement is. Basically, the statement is there exists an element C which has the following shape. So it lies in the closure of this orbit O and you are free to add non-constant term formal power series and you require the C to be homogeneous or homogeneous Of slope u. Okay, so this homogeneous means the following. So, i.e., so when you look at this looply algebra, you have two C star actions. One is loop rotation, so it acts on this formal parameter, and the other one is just scaling. Okay, and they are assumed to behave in a certain way on this C. Namely, when you take some non-zero complex number, Complex number, then you get that C of s to the m times t, so this is action by loop rotation, this is conjugate to s to the d times psi of t. Okay, so here this loop rotation here is the scaling action. So in the adjoint quotient, it means this p is fixed by some version of this gm action. And well, if you have seen an affine springer fiber before, then maybe this kind of statement means something to you, because you can think about this as non-emptiness of a certain affine springer fiber with specified reduction type. So, when you look at this affine springer fiber, you get an evaluation map to nilpotent orbits, assuming that this P is topologically nilipotent, and you rank Nilipotent, and you can require this map to take values in certain orbits. So, this is why this is called a geometric criterion. Okay, and then probably for the experts, they have an idea of where this is heading once they see our fine springer fibers, namely. Springer fibers, namely here is our representation theoretic criterion, so algebraic. So we need to know two things for this. So for representations of the while group, we have the Springer correspondence, which relates irreducible representations for the while group with nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebra. So remember, we have fixed this nilpotent orbit, so we can consider the associated spring. The associated Spring representation. So let me denote it by EO. So this is an irreducible representation of the while group, which is attached to O under the Springer correspondence. Okay, then something holds. Maybe I need more space, so let me go to the next board okay, nearly a certain base of intertwiners for this W action is non-zero. For this W action is non-zero. So you look at the space of maps from EO to a certain object, which I denote by L nu triv. And this is supposed to be non-zero. So this is a certain W module that probably is familiar to I mean, more familiar to the audience than to me. So it requires some explanation here. So So this L new triff is the finite-dimensional simple module for the rational churatnik algebra. Of central charge nu. And as I said, I'm sure that the audience knows much more about this, so I'm not going to try to say too many things about this. So maybe two facts that are important here. So remember that in the statement of the theorem, we start with this regular elliptic number. Regular elliptic number, and that is important because only then will we find this finite-dimensional module. So, this L new trif is finite-dimensional if and only if M is elliptic. And second statement that to make sense of this, we need to know that you will find the group algebra of W inside this triangle. Inside this geometric algebra. Let me denote it by hν. So, what this means is you take this module, you restrict to w, you get some finite, you decompose it into irreducible representations, and then this statement means that the Springer representation occurs inside this as a W module. And as I said, I don't really know much about the rational Truetnik algebra, but the good thing for us is this is very explicit. This is very explicit. So, in the sense that if you give me a nipotent orbit, which could be given as a partition, or maybe you look at a list for exceptional groups, then I can tell you what is the Springer representation. And then also people have computed the restriction of this to W very explicitly, so you can decompose it explicitly and you can use it to use this representation-theoretic criterion really to check that there is such a connection. Okay, and maybe And maybe there's also an easy consequence from the geometric statement. Namely, if you have two orbits, I mean if you have an orbit O and an orbit O prime and one lies below the other in the closure order, then it's clear that if you can solve this problem for the small orbit, you can also solve it for the big orbit. So DSAO implies DSAO prime. Okay, so which means that if you want to solve this problem completely, you only need to find a minimal orbit for which this has a solution. You need to prove it's minimal. Okay. So maybe let me just give you a very rough idea of how to prove this statement in the last couple of minutes. The last couple of minutes and maybe before that, just let me mention that actually we have like almost complete solutions to this problem. So we have complete solutions, complete solutions. Complete solutions in classical types. And we have solutions when this m is the Coxleta number in all types. And then we can also do F4 for arbitrary regular numbers. Basically, the strategy to prove F4 to solve this problem for F4. Prove F4 to solve this problem for F4 is really this representation theory. And this is kind of, it's like lots of computations, and basically the strategy would also work for other exceptional groups, but we haven't carried out these computations. Okay, so a few words about the proof of the statement. So there's two steps. So there's two steps. One is we go from this problem one to this problem two, and then from problem two to problem three. And somehow the idea is to use certain non-abelian Hodge moduli spaces which were first considered by Pez Rakovnikov. Pezrukovnikov Bushida Alvarez Michael McBreen and Ju Weyun. I mean, we use like slight variants of these, but the idea is really contained in the paper of these four people. And so the idea is that you can write down this. Write down this Hodge moduli space. So, what does it do? It classifies, so it classifies lambda connections. Okay, so this is a like a connection, but you deform the Leibniz rule by this parameter lambda. So, it has a map to A1, which just remembers this parameter. Which just remembers this parameter lambda, and then it has a one fiber. So this is one. This is, well, if you do form by one, then you get just the usual Leibniz rule. So this is some moduli space of connections sits over one. And then on the other hand, you have a moduli space of Higgs bundles that sits over the zero fiber. And then moreover, this comes equipped with some C star action. So you see, when you start here. So, you see, when you start here, you can just follow the flow to the Higgs bundle space. And actually, this also has a Hitchen vibration. So Hitchen map. There's a central point in here. And it's even contracted to the central fiber. And, well, this is a result of these authors that the central fiber is homeomorphic. Central fiber is homeomorphic to an affine Springer fiber. Okay, so you see, this is how this affine Springer fiber comes into play. And then maybe let me just write it here. Then we use some, so this is basically how you go from this one to two. And to go from two to three, we use work of Oblankov Un, which let me write it like this. So basically, they show that this L new trv L new trif appears in the cohomology of some affine springer fiber which maps to the one we're interested in. Okay, and then you need to use some kind of springer theory type argument. Okay, let me stop here.
