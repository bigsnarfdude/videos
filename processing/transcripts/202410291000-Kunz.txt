So, without further ado, let's get started. And I should mention all of this work is done in collaboration with Rafael La Sia and André Shanin. And I know we have seen a few talks on diffraction theory yesterday, but it never hurts to have a brief refresher as to what the general framework for the problems that we are considering is. This. So, in diffraction theory, we are interested in studying the interaction of a prescribed incident wave field with some prescribed obstacle omega. This interaction of the incident wave, which could be an electromagnetic or an acoustic wave, for example, leads to a scattered field. And the dynamics of the scattered field are described by the Haymotz equation, where here phi is the sum of the incident and the scattered field. And the scattered field, and k is the wave number, which is linked to the wave propagation speed outside of my scatterer omega. So, the prime objective in my research area is to find this scattered field by See. Of course, we need to specify the boundary conditions, where for the context of today's talk, we are considering Dirichlet boundary conditions. You could, of course, also consider Neumann boundary conditions or some mixed boundary conditions. Or some mixed boundary conditions like acoustic impedance, interface conditions where the incident wave is allowed to propagate into the scatterer, etc. So the boundary conditions really depend on the physical context which you are interested in. Finally, for such a problem to be well-posed engineering solvable, we also need to impose a radiation condition, which tells you that the scattered field should propagate away from the obstacle, and some Excel conditions, which guarantee. Conditions which guarantee that the energy of the wave field remains finite everywhere, which is particularly important near those sharp edges that our obstacles could potentially have. And of particular interest to our research are so-called canonical diffraction problems. And for example, in the context of wave scattering by an ice crystal, which this blue obstacle omega is supposed to depict, the zoomed in Zoomed in batch problem over here would serve as a canonical diffraction problem, so it would serve as a building block. And if we have exact knowledge of all of the building blocks that make up the more complicated geometry, we can approximately understand the field that is scattered by the overall obstacle. And in fact, it turns out that it is enough to have very good knowledge on the canonical this zoomed-in problems. This zoomed-in problems target asynchronous. So, this is the general setup, and today I want to talk about a three-dimensional canonical diffraction problem, namely that where an incident plane wave interacts with this quarter plane shown in blue here, of course, subject to the Hermance equation and subject to direct boundary conditions on the quarter plane, and of course, some radiation and Pleichner conditions, which Which do not really matter for the remainder of the talk. So I will not go into the details of these conditions, which nevertheless can be pretty tricky to correctly impose on the quartet line problem. And this would be a building block for three-dimensional geometries such as turbo blade fans, more precisely for the tips of the turbo blade fans. And as I already mentioned, availability of Availability of these building blocks requires a very good knowledge of the corresponding perfect asymptotics. So, our goal is to obtain, ideally, an analytical expression for the quarter plane problems perfect asymptotics. And I want to, before we go into the technical details, I want to give a brief overview of what the pathie structure encountered in the quarter-clan problem looks like. Encountered in the quarter plane problem looks like. So, this far field structure is depicted on the right here, and I will now briefly explain this picture. So, first, we assume that the incident wavefront comes from this region one here. When the far field is as simple as possible, if I would have incidence from other regions, I would get one or two secondary conically diffracted waves. Anyway, in this specific scenario, the scattered field splits as the sum of irreflected waves. As the sum of a reflected wave, which is due to the interaction of the incident plane wave with the face of the quarter plane, two primary diffracted waves, which are due to the interaction of the incident wave with the edges of the quarter plane, and a spherically diffracted wave, which is due to the interaction with the vertex of the quarter plane. And in this asymptotic expansion, everything except the spherically diffracted wave is known explicitly. However, we know and we can prove that the spherically Know and we can prove that the spheroclude of bracket wave can be expressed as this coefficient d, the so-called diffraction coefficient, times this scaled spherical wave. Here, x and x0 are both elements on the real 2-sphere. x corresponds to our observation direction and x0 corresponds to the direction of our incident wave. So, in trying to get as good Trying to get as good of an understanding as possible for these perfect asymptotics, we really want to find this diffraction coefficient. And the big tool that we are using in our journey of trying to find D is the following theorem due to Valery Smishliev, which expresses the diffraction coefficient as this inverse Fourier type integral where we integrate over this contour gamma. Over this contour gamma, and the spectral function in some sense for this diffraction coefficient g has to solve the following Laplace-Betrami boundary value problem on the real two-sphere. So we now have a point source forcing where the point source is located, exactly where the direction of my incident plane wave is. I also require G to solve, sorry, to satisfy directly boundary conditions. Boundary conditions on the intersection of the quarter plane with the real 2-sphere and some regularity conditions along the scatterer. Roughly speaking, this formula is obtained by using a separation of variables Anzatz, which leads to this sphere, and then clever rewriting of the series resulting from the separation of arrivals in terms of contour integrals, and then performing some clever steeper. And then performing some clever steepest descent analysis. The details of all of this are by no means trivial. And if you are interested in this, I would refer you to Smishlier's original paper. So in our journey and trying to find the diffraction coefficient, we now really want to find this spectral function g. And I want to briefly outline the strategy for finding g, really. And the next two slides are probably the most important part of my talk. Are probably the most important files of my talk. So, if there's any one thing that I would like to take away, it's this and the next slide. The very rough idea is that we want to generalize the Sommerfeld-Mayusenitz technique from the circle to the sphere. And I hope that by the end of the next slide, this analogy will make sense. As a brief interlude, as we, or as some of us know, the Somme Fed by using this technique in the context of By using this technique in the context of wedge-shaped scatterers, it is equivalent to the Wiener-Hoff technique. So, in some sense, what I'm about to present is a generalization of the 1D Wiener-Hoff technique, but look at through the lens of the Sommerfeld-Malusen framework. And this Sommerfeld-Marieusen technique starts by considering the real circle parametrized by some real. Parametrized by some real angular variable. And the first step in this technique is to pose a plane wave decomposition of my physical wave field by allowing complex angled theta. Phi is then written as this contour integral where gamma plus and gamma minus lie on this complex theta space. We integrate some unknown spectral functions and this obligatory E function which corresponds to our Which corresponds to our complex plane waves in two dimensions. And an important fact, maybe, to keep in mind if you know it, is that this formula can be derived through Green's theorem. The second step in this classical summer fit my using this technique is to then study the analyticity properties of this spectral function in this complex theta space, and finally to find the spectral function from its singularity structure. Its singularity structure. And this is, of course, only a very crude overview of all the details that go into these techniques. And I think if you want to have a more detailed look, if you are not familiar with this technique, these two are some really good review articles which I will properly refer to by the end of the talk. So this is, roughly speaking, one desume fed my username. And now I want to briefly outline how what we are doing. What we are doing links to the philosophy of the 1D simple users technique. So, we will need to use some preliminary steps to remove the scatterer that we have on our real two sphere. I will talk more about this on the next slide. Roughly speaking, this is so that we can study the propagation of singularities instead of trying to do something weird, as in trying to study propagation of scatterers, which I think we can make sense of. Which I think we can make sense of, but I don't think it's useful. Anyway, so the first step will be to analytically continue G from now the real two-sphere minus the real singularities of G to some larger ambient complex space by allowing now two complex angles, theta and phi, which really corresponds to the first two steps of the summer felt by the usernets technique, namely allowing complex angles and studying the And studying the analyticity properties of our spectral function. The second step in our research program is to obtain an integral representation formula for g with a yet unknown integrand. However, this will reduce the problem of finding g to a scalar one complex variable problem. And this is not necessarily analogous to any particular step in the Summer Fedma users technique, but it is linked to expression. It is linked to expressing the summer fed my username spectral function in terms of plane waves by using Green's theorem for wedge-shaped 2D regions. The third step of our program is then to find an explicit monotromy representation for this unknown integrand, which still corresponds to the second step of Sama Petmausen's, namely to study the analyticity properties of our unknown spectral function. Of our unknown spectral function. And then finally, the fourth step, which at this point is future work, would be to solve the corresponding monotony problem by linking it to the theory of Fouxian ordinary differential equations. And this would correspond to the final step of the Sommerfeld-Naiusenist technique, namely finding the spectral function from its singularity structure. I should also say that all of this is ongoing work, so take the details in what's about to follow with a bit of a About to follow with a bit of a grain of salt. Okay, so as for our setup and step zero, really, we use the Schwarz reflection principle adapted to our two sphere to take two copies of the real toolsphere, one with our usual point source forcing and one with the reflected point source, and we glue these two copies along the scatterer S according to the rule that goes as follows. So we identify That goes as follows. So we identify sides of our slit corresponding to identical Roman numerals. So it will give us a two-sheeted ramified covering space of the real two-sphere. And the endpoints x1 and x2 of my scatter now become branch points of G, where G has been extended onto my covering space. And this extension still solves the Laplace-Beltrami equation on. Equation on the extended covering space. And to study the analytical continuation of G, we will study the propagation of these four real singularities. The main tool that we will employ in doing so is the following Green's theorem on the real two-spheres. So we can express small g as a contour integral over gamma, gamma being shown here. And we integrate g and then in some sense this Green's combination where big G. This Green's combination where big G is linked to the Legendre function of the first kind, and Nabler is this operator sending a function f, which is either big G or small g, onto this one form. Now, we can use this representation to study the analyticity properties because we can exploit the known analyticity structure of this Legendre function of the first kind. So, all functions where x All functions where x is plugged in on the right-hand side of this equation are explicitly known. Now, first, I need to specify what I actually mean by allowing my two angular variables to become complex, or more formally speaking, I need to define the space within which I would like to analytically continue my unknown. And I don't only take the complexification of the real truth here. The complexification of the real two sphere, which is this space, but I add onto it in some sense a sphere at infinity. This sphere at infinity is importantly not in C cubed, but you can think of it as the set epsilon equals zero, where epsilon is linked to z in c cubed by this change of variables. Of course, if I just plug in epsilon equals zero in this formula, it will make no sense for z. It will make no sense for z, but this really just means that is not, or if z is in ψ, it cannot be in c cubed, and that's exactly the point. You can make all of this precise using projective geometry, but I think there is maybe more tangible interpretation of this sphere at infinity, which requires us to look at the following characteristics. And these characteristics are going to be incredibly important for everything that is about to follow. That is about to follow. So let's spend a bit of time in trying to understand these things. First, I look at one specific point on my way to sphere, namely the North Pole. I have two characteristics, which at this point we should think of as just complex planes. So for now, let us ignore this point at infinity that we will eventually add onto it. So then, yeah, as I already said, we have two planes that intersect the sphere at the north pole. And if I'm now Sphere at the North Pole, and if I'm now interested in the characteristics through any other point anywhere in my complexification, I can take a complex Euler rotation that rotates my North Pole onto wherever I would like to be, and I can drag my characteristics along with this rotation to obtain the characteristics through my new point Z. And of course, this works due to rotational invariance of the Laplace. Rotational invariance of the Laplace-Per-Crami operator, which still goes through after complexification. And now, if I think of all of these characteristics that are attached everywhere onto my real 200, I can add in a point at infinity on each of my characteristics. This will one point compactify them into characteristic spheres, and the sphere at infinity then becomes real. Infinity then becomes realized as the union of all of these infinitely remote points on my characteristics, whereas the real two-sphere becomes realized as the union of all of the origins of my characteristics. Also, this implies that the characteristics tell us in a direction in which we can move if we want to reach the sphere at infinity. And this will also be important. And this will also be important later on. So, we care about this because our characteristic spheres determine the complex singularity structure of G. And as I already hinted at, the interaction of the real 2-sphere with the sphere at infinity through these characteristics will give us our sought-after integral representation formula, and it will also tell us the monogramy of our integrand. Okay, so now we have made. Okay, so now we have made sense of what we mean by allowing complex angles on the VL2 sphere, and we can proceed with the next step of our program, namely analytical continuation. So our goal is to represent G through some contour integral on the sphere at infinity. And the a priori rational for this is that it will allow us to use the asymptotic properties of the Legendre function of the first kind to simplify our To simplify our integral representation formula, which at this point is simply Green's theorem. So I will only roughly sketch the ideas, but as I already mentioned, we take our Green's formula, we use the analyticity properties of the Legendre function of the first kind to study which values of x we are allowed to plug into the right-hand side of this equation and use this knowledge to analytically continue g. Analytically continue g within my spheres complexification. After I have done that, I can use the new form singularity, sorry, analyticity structure to move my contour gamma away from the real two-sphere within this complexification. However, in doing so, I have to be careful that I avoid the characteristic spheres through the red dots shown at step one, which are the real singular points of G and singularities propagate. points of g and singularities propagate along characteristics so the corresponding characteristic spheres have to be avoided and i also have to avoid the characteristic spheres through x which will tell us how the singularities of my read's function big g propagate so long story short if i am sufficiently careful with all of this i can repeat this procedure iteratively until i have actually eventually reached the sphere at infinity and i end up And I end up with some new contour big gamma, which has to, of course, avoid all of the corresponding characteristics, or more precisely, their intersection with the sphere at infinity. The payoff for all of this is that we find the following integral representation formula of g, which is in some sense a plane-wave decomposition. So, g can be written as a contour integral over gamma, where c1 and c2 are explicitly known functions. Too are explicitly known functions, and I integrate these elementary functions w, which are of course obtained from the asymptotics of my Legendre function. W is what we coin a spherical plane wave, and I still have two unknowns in my integral, namely F1 and F2. These spectral functions, or directivities, as we also call them, depend holomorphically on beta, which lies on the sphere at infinity, but the sphere at infinity can really be shown to be. At infinity, can really be shown to be biholomorphic to the Riemann sphere. So, for the remainder of this talk, let us think of F1 and F2 as holomorphically depending on a complex parameter, beta. And I now want to briefly outline the next step of our program, namely how we can use the framework that I roughly gone through previously to find the monogramy of F. The monogramy of F1 and F2. So we will simplify the problem a little bit by removing the point sources, but we can always add them in later with only minor modifications. We then need to find some basis functions with respect to which f's branching can be described. And finally, we use the interaction of the real two-sphere with the sphere at infinity through characteristics to study this branching. So. So, first, if we simplify everything and remove the point sources, we are left with these two singular points x1 and x2 on my covering space of the real two-sphere. And f1 and f2 then have four singular points on the sphere at infinity. These singular points are the intersections of the characteristics through x1 and x2, respectively, with the sphere at infinity. At infinity. We also need the following lemma, which tells us that the directivity can be represented inversely in some sense as a contour integral on the real 2-sphere, where d is our unknown spectral function for the diffraction coefficient, and w as a reminder is this elementary function here. And as another reminder, x1 and x2 are singularities of g. So in some sense, Of g. So, in some sense, at this point, we understand half of what determines f's singularity structure, and we still need to understand the singularities of this elementary function. And really, for the purpose of what we are doing, it is enough to look at the singularities when we freeze either x or beta. More important will be when we freeze x, but just for completeness, when we fix x. This is when we fix x. Sorry, it will be more important when we fix beta. But when we fix x, the singularities of w on the sphere at infinity are the intersections of the characteristics propagating from x with the sphere at infinity. And if I fix beta, the singularities of my elementary function, my spherical plane wave, on the real two-sphere. With on the real two-sphere are the intersections of the characteristics propagating from beta with my real two-sphere. So these just shows two copies of the real two-sphere, which, well, the reason for this will become clear in a moment. But anyway, I can take these intersections of characteristics with either the sphere at infinity or the real two-sphere, and these will define maps, and not only maps, but Will define maps and not only maps, but they will define diffeomorphisms. So, these ways of looking at intersections of the two different spheres with the corresponding characteristics are how the sphere at infinity in some sense communicates with the real two-sphere. And conversely, it's how the real two-sphere communicates with the sphere at infinity. I hope that roughly makes sense on an intuitive level. And also, up here, I have drawn four loops which are based. I have drawn four loops which are basis loops for the fundamental group of the sphere at infinity with respect to which we will study the monogramy of F. Of course, any other basis would also do. And to study the analyticity properties relative to analytical continuation along these loops, we will study the monogramy of these two basis functions where GA is the quantor integral over this quant A and G B is the quantor integral over. And GB is a contour integral over this contour b. So the game that we play to find our monogamy matrices goes as follows. As B travels along this loop, for example, on the sphere at infinity, the singular point P plus of beta will travel along a loop on the real two sphere that winds around x1 once as shown over here. So during this analytical continuation procedure, I have to change my To change my contour of integration such that I never such that my singularity never hits my integration contour. And if I do this, I will eventually end up with the contour that looks like so, which can be shown to be equivalent to the contour B by flipping it in some sense around at the other side of the real two-shear. And of course, I can repeat this procedure for the other loops and my other loops. Yeah, for the other loops on the sphere at infinity and for the other basis loops on the real two-sphere. Finally, we need to be careful of how the phase of our elementary function changes along A and B after analytic continuation. I will not go into the details of how we do that, but we know how it can be done. And after all, if we do this for everything carefully, we will find this. Carefully, we will find this set of monotony matrices for the non-point source problem. And maybe, as a final remark, these matrices can be symmetrized by rescaling our spectral functions. And this symmetrization and rescaling will, in fact, make it easier to track how the phase of our spherical plane wave changes upon this analytical continuation procedure. And yeah, I know I'm out of time, so maybe. I know I'm out of time, so maybe I will just show you the summary slide and leave the rest of the time for questions. So, yeah, thank you.
