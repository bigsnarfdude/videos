Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the augments for the invitation. So it's a good pleasure to speak at this very beautiful place. So today I want to talk about the constraint KP and vibrated coda. So this is the topic contained. The talk will contain four parts. So, in the first part, I will explain our way to study power functions in systems. And so, I will use the KDB hierarchy as an example to explain the matter. And the second way, we talked about colour functions for the constraint KP hierarchy. And the fourth call, we talked about colour functions for the diabetic KOBA hierarchy. And then finally, Hierarchy, and then we finally started the relationships. So, of course, in the thing of intersystems, how functional is the value of Yoton motion is mostly well known and it's from Yoton emissions and cytometric co-function. Today, we'll talk about the call function from another point of view. Sorry. So we know that the KDV equation is a linear admission PDE discovered in the study of shadow waves in the 19th century. So this is the KDV equation. And so this equation can be extended to a function of parallelized commuter administration systems. Administrative PDUs called the category hierarchy. So these are the Iraqi. So these are the first two photos. Yeah. So we know that let L be the linear differential operator called the Lux operator. Then the whole family of flows can be, all these flows can be written by using the Lux formalism. And so here, So, here the positive part is to take the non-active parts of the pseudo-differential operator. So, these are well-known formulas. So, I just keep the details. And so, let us denote by A the differential polynomial ring of U. U is our unknown function. Okay, so let's come into the main notion. To the main notion in our understanding of tau function. So it's related to the structure called the tau structure. So the tau structure, by definition, is a collection, is a family of differential polynomials called omega pq. So omega pq is indexed by non-negative integers. So omega 00 is required to be u and omega pq equals omega qp. So symmetric and also. That QP is symmetric, and also the derivative is also totally symmetric. So, here, of course, because PQ omega is symmetric, so here we only need this one equation to ensure the total symmetric of the derivatives of omega PQ. And the existence of this tau structure is known. We can use Saturn theory and also many different ways to prove the existence. To prove the existence and uniqueness. So, the uniqueness is up to a sequence of symmetric constants. So, for example, the first few omega PQ is here. The omega 00 is U and Omega 01, Omega 02, Omega11, and so on. So, once we have the tau structure, we can also define the omega P1 to Pn. So, these are the derivatives of omega PQ. Derivatives of omega pq. Okay, and so if for any uh solution of the kdb hierarchy u uh from the tau structure from the definition of tau structure we know that there exists a function we call it tau function such that the second derivative of log tau equals this omita pq and we call the tau the tau function of the solution and so by definition we know that the higher omita know that the higher omega P1 Pn is just the multi-derivatives of log tau. So in 2016, they gave a detailed proof this tau function is equivalent to the Saturn tau function of the KDB hierarchy. Okay, so let's also give a proof of the existence of this tau structure. So let us denote by calligraphic. Denote by calligraphic L, this matrix duck operator. So we just write the original linear shedding operator in this two by two matrix form. Okay. And also we introduce the gradation in this loop algebra of the SL2C. So the gradation is the element of E, we get degree one. We get degree one and element of f we degree minus one and lambda has degree two. Okay, so in this gradation, we can prove the follow you using this gradation, we can prove this existence of the so-called matrix resolvent. So we use this as a definition of matrix resolvent. So by definition, a matrix resolvent is a element in the loop algebra of SL2. In the loop algebra of SL2C. So the coefficient can be differential polynomials. So it's always local. So yeah, this is the main feature of matrix resolving. So it's always has this locality. Instead of using wave function, we have non-local. So here, the first condition is this R should commute with the Lux matrix Lux operator. And here is the boundary or the initial condition. Or say initial condition, and this is the normalization of this matrix resolvent. And here, this lower-order term means with respect to the principal gradation. So, we just introduced the previous page. So, the definition of matrix resolvent actually dates back to Dicky or maybe even to earlier references. So, using this matrix resolvent, we can We can from Nicholas resolve, we can define the tau structure. And also, in some sense, this is a definition theorem. So for when n equals two, when n equals two, for the tau structure, we just define omega pq from the right-hand side for when n equals two. So when equals two, this is the symmetric group. So we only have two elements. So we only have two elements divided by quotient by this second group. So we only have one element. So the answer is just trace, choice of the product of two matrix resolvent. And then they do the expansion, Taylor expansion, we get the definition of this omega PQ. They are differential polynomials. And you can show this satisfy the tau property of the tau structure. So these are, so satisfy this. So, satisfied this axiom. So, one can show this. And for n bigger than or equal to two, using induction, we can prove the higher derivatives can always be expressed by this matrix resolvent. So, it means when you have this multi-derivatives, of course, we need to do derivatives. But actually, maybe we don't need, we just need to do multiplication and take. Do multiplication and take trace. So, but that derivation, the derivatives can be replaced just by algebraic manipulations. Okay, so this is the content of this theorem. So, using this theorem, we gave an application in 2016. So, we showed that actually the generating series of Generating series of psi class, some cohomology class on the moduli space of stable curves. So these are also called the Gromov-Weighten invariants of a point, so or the Konsavich-Weighten numbers. So in 2016, you showed that the generating series of Konsavich-Witton numbers can be expressed by using a two by two matrix and take the matrix and take the trace. So this is the application of our follow-up of the previous theorem. So originally we proved this in 2016 using Sato's notion of power function, but then we also gave later we also gave a proof without using a Sato theory just from power structure. Okay, so now let's go to the constraint KP. Go to the constraint Kp hierarchy. So, the constraint Kp hierarchy is also defined as these Lux equations. It is introduced by Cheng Yi. And so, here, n is a given integer. So, if n equals one, this hierarchy is nothing but the nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy. And so, equivalently, we can also write this pseudo-differential operator using a matrix form. Matrix form. So here, in this matrix form, these are n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrices. For example, lambda is this matrix. So the last go is all zero. And V is this matrix. So these are the unknown variables. So when M equals one, we only have Q and R. So it will become the traditional number. Become the traditional nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy. So, similar as before, we will introduce some degrees. For example, we get degree Q equals minus one and R is one and so on. So, and also degree at the entry EIJ, we give the degree J minus I. And we also introduce some particular elements of M plus 1 by M plus 1. m plus one by m plus one matrix called lambda a. And similar as before, we can show that there exists a unique system of solutions R1 to Rn such that they all commute with the Lux operator and their initial condition is given by lambda A and also they are normalized in some way so that we can uniquely specify this Uniquely specify this so-called matrix resolvent. And then, and also similar as before, we can use this matrix resolvent to define the tau structure for the constraint Kp hierarchy. And from this way, we can show the total symmetry for this omega AI Bj and the derivatives of omega AI Bj. Okay, and similarly, we can. Okay, and similarly, we can define the higher-order derivatives of omegas. And again, for arbitrary solutions of the constraint KP hierarchy, because of the definition of tau structure, there exists a function tau such that the second derivatives of log tau equals this omegas. Okay. Right. So then our theorem says for arbitrary k bigger. For arbitrary k bigger than or equal to 2, this multiderivatives omegas can be expressed by, again, by this matrix resolvent in this purely algebraic form. Okay, so the proof is also similar to the KDD case. And as we already remarked, when m equals one, this constraint Kp is just the nonlinear shooting hierarchy, and that's the theorem for. That's the theorem for m equals one was already proved by DeWorld and Fu and myself. Okay, so now let's move to the biogradi Toda hierarchy. Actually, biogradi Toda, there are two parameters. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, all the tau tau functions. All the derivatives of log tau. Of log tau? Yes, by doing Taylor extension. Yeah. So it looks like there is a pole in the diagonal of these multiple variables, but actually one can show that pole is all canceled. So there's no pole. So it's yeah, it can be this can be proved directly. Okay, so yeah, similarly, we can we now move to the directory code hierarchy. So usually there are two parameters. So, usually there are two parameters, capital M and capital N. But in our case, we only consider M1 type. So, for M1 type means here, we start from T to the M and here is T to the minus 1. So we don't consider more. So, if you had, usually it can also do T to the minus N. But okay, so here T is the shift operator. So, sending any function of Fx to Fx plus one or in some other. one or in some other in particular in people study uh quantum or so sorry in study quantum groups uh sometimes people use x times q so these are exactly equivalent and uh so this is the uh Lux equations written by written down by Grido Carlich and this hierarchy is called biodi-Toda hierarchy. So again they write the lux operator in the matrix The Lux operator in the matrix form. Okay, as before, everything is the same. I mean, it's similar to the previous cases. And we also introduce a gradation on the matrices. So now degree lambda has m and the degree eij is again i minus j. But this here we use bar because all these indeterminates want to get degree just zero. Also, eight degrees as zero, okay. And now the lemma says there exists again a unique system of solutions such that they satisfy this equation. So essentially, this equation is the same as requiring R commutes with the Lux operator. But how to get it? So you consider the equivalent of the commutator of R with the Lux operator acting. With the Lax operator acting on the wave function and required to be zero, then you will find this equation. So, this is in the discrete case of the matrix resolving. And here we also have this initial condition and also normalization. So, this unique system is called the basic matrix resolvance of L. And again, from this R, we can define a sequence. R, we can define a sequence of differential polynomials, and the set is again, they have this total symmetry property, and we can define the multi-ohmigas. And in this way, we define tau function. So our tau function is again, we call to Broadway and John type tau function. The definition is the second derivatives of log tau equals this omegas and we. Omigas and we in this case, since we have also a space variable x, so we also need to give the second. This is essentially also the second derivative of log tau with respect to x and t. And this is also essentially second derivative of log tau with respect to x. So then we can, in this way, we give a local formalism of definition of power function. And then the theorem says And then the theorem says the derivatives, multiderivatives of log tau can be expressed by this using matrix resolvent in an algebraic way. And so the remark is that again, when m equals to one, the by the total hierarchy is nothing but the infinite total chain. And this theorem was obtained in a joint work with Doris Borvin in 2006 or 17. And in this way, we have an application because we know that the partition function of Gaussian unitary ensemble is a particular tau function of the codeletics hierarchy. And then using this formalism, we can give explicit generating series of these correlators of Gaussian unit ensemble. And so here we can compute. Uh, we can uh compute explicitly this matrix resolvent. So, evaluated at all-time variable equals zero, we get this explicit expression. So, this A and B are hydrogenetic polynomials. And yeah, so this is the application of this formulism. Okay, now let's go to the new applications. The new application says, so the important thing is this key line. So, the important thing is this key lemma. So, let us denote by A. So, this A, there's abuse of notation. This A is not a depleted polynomial ring. This A is the L A pair A. So, the lemma says there exists. So, if we let A be the matrix such that L A form the Lux pair for the T10 flow of the bite-weight todock hierarchy. Byte-blooded todah hierarchy. And then there is a gauge, unique gauge transformation of this type, such that after the gauge transformation, this A becomes the next operator for the constraint KP hierarchy. Okay, so this is what we call the space-time duality. So which means that so here this T10 is the time variable for the directed total hierarchy. Now it becomes the space. Becomes the space variable for the constraint KP hierarchy. So, this is a space-time duality. And in this duality, the proof here is also interesting. There is a block structure so that we can prove this by using, surprisingly, by using June-Soclov reduction. So, use the fundamental lemma of Junta and Soklov. It's a purely algebraic lemma. And it's surprisingly solves the. Surprisingly, it solves completely this problem, this unique and existent problem in a very simple way. Okay, and then the main theorem says for the arbitrary solution of the bracket total hierarchy of n1 type and let tau be the tau function of this solution, and then this tau tau is also a tau function of the consumer KP hierarchy. Consume KP hierarchy. Okay, so after the space-time exchanging, the tau function of the bilateral total hierarchy becomes the tau function of the consumed KP hierarchy. But actually, it is not just a tau function. It's actually, this tau is a family of tau function of the consume KP hierarchy labeled by the space variable of the dipole tota hierarchy. So it's a smooth family. It's a smooth family. Of course, there is a discrete family. Actually, it's a discrete variable, but somehow it's not difficult to understand it as actually a smooth family of the constraint KP hierarchy. So when M equals to one, the kilometer and the proof of the theory was given by Fu and myself two years ago. And so we also gave an application to So we also give an application to Gaussian, to GOE, to Gaussian unit ensemble. It basically says from the space duality, space-time duality, in original GOE, you do integrations over n by n coordination matrices. And then basically, if you know how to integrate on this one line, know how to do integrals on any recognition matrices. So it's a space-time. So it's a space-time change. And so similar results are also obtained by Carlt van der Leek Patsuma shadowing. They use Herodota linear relations, and so it's different from our approach. And also they didn't give this explicit map from this gauge transformation. But their result is earlier than us. Okay, so let's finally see some examples. Finally, let's see some examples. When equals to one, this is the nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy, and the first flow of the nonlinear Schrödinger hierarchy. This is the first flow of the total lattice. Now, let us consider T10 as X. We consider the time as a space. And then we define Q and R in this way. So the theorem says. So, the theorem says if for any tau function of total diatus, I define Q and R in this way, and then Q and R satisfy the nonlinear Schrodinger equation hierarchy. Okay, now M equals 3, this is the constraint KP hierarchy, and here is the first non-trivial flow T20. And this is the bi-graded TODA hierarchy of 3,1 type. And then you again. And then you again you consider t10 as x as the capital x. Sorry, we also have little x. Little x is the little x is the shift in x. So the space-time exchange is to consider t10 as the new x, capital x variable, and you do this math. Now it can be written explicitly, and you consider this math. And then from any solution of diagnosta, you obtain. Solution of diplomatoda, you obtain q v0 v1 r, they give solution to the constraint kp. So I stop here. Thank you.
