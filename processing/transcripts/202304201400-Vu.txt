Good afternoon everyone. So first of all I would like to thank the organizer for inviting me to land and I'm happy to be here after a long trip. And so I will talk about the stability and spectrum theory because you know that Yeah, because you know that uh in the theory of dynamical system, the the spectrum theory uh is very closely related to the stability theory. And because the title of the workshop is DIEs and operator pensive. So I have been working on mainly on dimension on DIEs only. I have to say that I I have to say that I am quite a beginner in operato fencing stuff, and that's why here some open questions for DAEs. I mean open questions for Operato DAEs. At least for me. But after listening to some talks during the the workshop, I I realized that uh some questions uh uh have really already solved uh Have uh installed uh actually sold. Okay, um before talking about the gaze, so I would like to dedicate to my talk to Steve Capell, who was a leading expert in the theory of DA theory and numerical analysis of DNA. So, before So, before working on DAEs, so actually Steve was an expert in openet theory. So, I think he would have been happy to hear about the topic of this workshop. So, my talk is divided into three parts. First, I give a very quick I give a very quick overview on stability theory for linear time invariant system. And then I talked about spectral theory for linear time varying system, including different notions of exponent like Yerbo Merbon and an exponential equal to the exponents and some extension to DNE that have been uh opened recently and Recently, and at the end, I would talk about the open questions. So, following the advice of the organizer, I try not to give a list of a reason, uh, research reasons, but some instruction and and some uh suggestion to open proplex. So, consider uh consider anol in ODAs and And we may assume that this system has a GVL solution XT equal to zero. And one important question is to check its stability. And for constant coefficient only, it is easy to check because the bit leads to the eigenvalue program of constant matter. Program across time matrices. So we have the necessary and sufficient provision for the asymptotic stability is that all eigenvalues of I have negative real part. So the spectrum of matrix I determines the exit locking stability as well as it gives information on the accent lock. Gibson information or the taxi topic that we have here, the growth right at the show shad. Okay, and this spectrum-based stability criteria have been extended to other linear time invariant systems. For example, for time delay OEs, for time linear time invariant DAEs. So here Sorry, triang linear triangle and EAEs. So here Es singular and also for Es contains a small parameter. So the later one includes singularly products ODEs as well. And the next is the direct high invariant delay DIEs. So here we consider the simple the sim the simple case when Simple case where the system has one time delay, okay, and it is singular. But this delay deli was investigated a long time ago. But I have to say that not yet, we have not opened yet the complete analysis. Concerning the the classification, because Because when E is singular, then the dynamics of the system is mixed. It has not only the differential continuous dynamics, but also discretionary dynamics. And the only topic is only in Manax basis. And of course, besides the Besides the continuous time system, there are reasons for history time system as well. Now we talk about the stability of linear time volume ODEs. So this is about this while for people who work on the theory of OEs. So when the coefficient matrix depends on a type T. Matrix depends on type T, then the I can values the matrix IT for fixing does not give information for the safety. And one of the first counter examples was given by my penoun a long time ago. Maybe not exactly this one, but for example, in this example, the matrix A has a double, I can tell you minus two, but the solution. There are two, but the solution satisfying the ignition condition is which is not stable. Okay. And instead of eigenvalue, so in the thesis of Lyapunov, he suggested the notion of the so-called characteristic exponent. Later it is called Lyapunov exponents. For this in the form for a non-trivial assertion, we calculate the the We calculate the limit soap upon the 40 over the normal XC. And similarly, we can compute the values give us information about the exponential growth rates of the solution. And it is easy to get this result if the greatest value of the upper layer production. The upper layer product exponent also is negative, and the system is asymptotically stable. And we can also construct the spectrum containing the Lyapolo exponent. Given a fundamental metric solution X, capital X, for each column, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent and we also have there or the And we all show that the Lia order decreases related. And if the sum of the Lia Coulomb x for n is minimized with respect to all possible fundamental assumptions, then the coulomb of x are set to form a normal basis. And from a normal basis, we can define the spectrum. Okay. Also, interesting and important properties in the Important properties in the theory of Lyapunov excellence is the Lyapunov inequality. So, the sum of the Lyapunov excellence satisfies this inequality. And usually, at the same time, the people consider the adjoint equation and the fundamental social matrices of the two systems satisfy the so-called Lagrange identity. And we can imply that the relation between the exponent of the original system and the over the adjoint one. Okay, as I mentioned, you can define the Lyapunov spectrum as the union of Lyapunov spectral intervals. This is the interval. This is the interval which have the end toys lower and upper Lyapunov exponents. And if the Lyapunov inequality becomes a divergent, then the system is regular in the Lyapunov sense. And in this case, each of the Lyapunov spectral intervals trains to a point. This means that we have a string. Means that we have a strict Liapuno exponent. And for linear costume coefficient systems, the Lyapunov exponent are simply the real parts of the eigenvalues matrix I. The next important question is the stability of EFOLOM exponent. This means that how EFOLOM exponents move under small perturbation and Small cultivation, and this problem is also called continuity or robustness of a Lyapunov exponent. So, we consider a perturbed system, okay, and we compare the Lyapunov exponent of the two systems: the original one and the perturbed one. And the Lyapunov exponent are stable if of any epsilon greater. Greater than zero, there exists anta such that if the size of the perturbation is less than data, then the gap between the neoponomic exponents are less than exponent. And the question is: so, are the Niapon exponents stable? The answer is in general, no. So, this means General knock. So, this means that under very small perturbation, the effort of exponents can change. And an important property we ensure the stability of the epolum exponents: a fundamental social metric X is called integrally separated if there exists a constant positive constants B as C such that is. Such that is inequality force. This means that the column of fundamental matrix X are separated exponentially. Okay, so the answer to the question on the stability of the apology exponent, and we can have it in some File in some books and paper, and for example, the second one and the third one are important. An integrally separated system, x spa y distinct upper and spare y is in lower exponent. So, this is similar to the case of distinct eigenvalues in the case of cosine matrix. And this thing after Leopoldo explains. These things after Leopold X-Men are stable if and only if they exist only cannot matter. And so this research was due to Milo, Isovo and Milio Chico in late 60s. And the simplest guys, gene-constant coefficient system has stable the optimal experiment. It's easy to develop. Experiment. It's easy because if you know that I can reuse the cost matrix are continuous as a function of coefficient. And there are also some other characterization of stable system. Oh, this means that for the stability, we have to expand the interconnect. The intertrans separation plays the key role. So, not the regularity, not the slip, we have exponent. Okay, another important notion of exponent is born exponent. So, bond is a real mathematician and it defines upper bond exponent, a non-trivial solution, is the least upper bound of all those. Apple out on those numbers row for which there exists number add row such that this estimate goes. So this means that here we see somewhat row characterize the uniform exponential rows rate of the solution. Similarly, we identify the lower bound exponent and we can get the formula for the ball. Can get the formula for the bond exponent. Here we see that this is when we set s equals zero, we open the formula for the neopoulo exponent. Here is that we calculate the gross rate, but not the exit rate, but the uniform gross rate of the solution. Okay, the relation between Lyapunov and Bone Exponent. So, bone exponent characterized the So, bone exponent characterize the uniform growth rate of shoulders. And if the greatest bound at the upper Yapodo exponent is negative, then the system is asymptotically stable. And if the same pose for bone exponent, then the system is uniformly exponentially stable. And unlike the opponent exponents, bone exponent are stable without any extra perception. This is why, usually, bone exponent is used. That's why usually bone exponent is used as a measure for robust stability, not the exponent. And this also means that the uniform exponential stability is robust. And exit for time burning system, the Yoko exponence is not the executive stability is not robust. Okay, the last notion is the so-called exponential equal to me spectrum, or satellite spectrum. So first we introduce the exponential equal to the metric system, fundamental metric solution of the system. So if there exists constant amphibian beta, some alpha and beta and K and L such that this equal estimates all and we said that the mathematic admits this potential equal to me. It means that the columns X are separated. So the first one into two groups. The first one is exponentially decaying and the second one is exponentially The second one is exponentially lowering. Okay, and we can define the circle cell spectrum for a system by those values lambda such that the CT system does not have exponential equal to me. And the complement of sigma s is called the resonant cycle. Okay. Okay, and uh a proper A probability is that the saccur cell spectrum contains the Yaponop spectrum. And the subtle cell spectrum is also the union atmos and HI closed intervals, and it is stable if the system is integrally separated. Separately. Okay. And so the three notions of exponents are integrated because they are efficient tools in the stable analysis or timering in the timering system and they can also be numerically approximated provided that they are stable. Okay. And so the the numerical methods for approximating Lyapunov exactly cells, the spectral retail bursts were proposed by and analyzed by Rukas, DLC, and Alec Parkolet in the early 2000s. And later, the theory, HINS, Later, the theory actually numerical methods have been carried out to linear timing DAEs. And first, the spectrum theory for linear typing DAEs in strangeness reform. And the numerical methods, which are based on QR factorization as SPD, were given by Poker Mehman and myself in 2009 and 2011. I have given. And later, the opponent's spectra for properly formulated DIEs took arbitrary index and the age rate was analyzed in a paper by both Ida Mess and myself again. And under certain assumptions, the spectra of DIE and the spectra of it assumption under the OE are the same. And besides the time. Besides, the Thai turnup of my talk has been challenging a bit. I would not mention the asymptotic behavior because it does not fit with the high PB. And asymptotic, we have a solution for system under smoke novia observation is another issue and also a proverb's stability analysis. Okay, there are There are a few open questions for first for linear time invariant system. We consider open EIE. And the first question is the solvability analysis. The classification interpreting the normal form. And during the previous lectures, and in particular, lectures and in particular in this morning we we listened to the talk by my Karen. We saw that we we know that so some have been sold some cases have been sold partially sold. The next is the stability analysis based on the spectrum of the open auto can see and the question is is there assertion underlying openato For metrics, since matrix pencil, we can construct the underlying metrics. So, for example, into the corona form. But for in the open setting, I I do not know. Okay. And the next uh uh open question is uh perturbation. Is perturbation analysis. And this is maybe interesting from numerical analysis point of view. If we want to calculate the spectrum of a local pensive, and usually we apply the reduced to finite dimensional chemistry and calculate, and what is the relation between the two? For example, different numbers. Okay, for example, even uh uh uh uh a PDIE, if you apply specification, then the spectrum information we get are related to those of the original system at all. Okay. So similar question to the carbon system, but uh it is uh more difficult. Multiple issues. Also, solvability classification and stability analysis and spectral theory. So, for operator VAEs and the robustness of the spectra. And similarly, when we approximate the operator pension by a finite dimensional operator pension, then what is the relation between the And what is the relation between the spectrum? Okay, and it would be quite interesting if we look for the spectral analysis of some examples in a real-life application. So, in this also, we have done many real-life applications that lead to DDIPs. Okay, so we have summarized the stability and the Summarize the stability and the spectrum theory theory for OE and for average system various notions of exponent are designed I definitely and we have discussed recent extension to DNEs and we propose some open program for open radical DNEs. Thank you for your attention. Oh yeah, okay.
