Paulina, studio in general civil mechanic in the Universidad de Chile, ten Mathematicas, also the Universidad of Chile, and ten un doctorada Matemáticas in the University of Santiago de Chile, Junto with the Universidad de Paris de Viderot. Actually, there is a position of investigador postdoctoral in Centro Model Mathematica in the Universidad de Chile. And complexity of equivalence orbit in symbolic dynamics. Mucha gracias, Liz. Secucha, bien. Yes. Mosa 1. Per bueno. Pe vero que esa cuche. Gracias por invidación, mucha gración particular, miení Andrea que mi invido este taller en el que er brendía mucho. In the very beginning, if you very mathematical. Today is very generally what I work, but it is marked in what symbolic dynamics and what referees at the interaction is combinatory, as the complicated, and the application, and dynamic projects as a project that is. So, I promise more than what the system dynamic system, or what we will understand here, we will medieval system and topological systems, we will see forms of here valence form, or system dynamic system, and we are based on the world of symbolic dynamics, we apply that symbolic dynamics, and what is their motivation, we are going to see how relationships prepare combinatories. Relations combinatorial basic dynamic projects, and we can see the point concrete of what is the complexity, and we are what dynamic. So, it is dynamic. Well, there was a dynamic model of what is studying the evolution of the arbitrage of a space, a space that evolution, because it is not. In the space that evolution, because in space, vajuna transformation or iteration in a transformation as va-evolution, if it is qualitative. So, depending on the structure of this space there are different areas of the dynamic that the study. So, for example, a systemic medieval system is a space of media, a space with a simple probability or finite. Only a little bit. And they will transform, which will consider invertible to more facility and that will preserve the media. It is with this referral that the transformation will preserve the structure of the space. Invertible queen and activity inverse areas, also medium, we have also mediated. And the important thing that I preserve. And the important thing that preserve the structural. So I applied the transformation of the space and the media of the primary media of an element of simple elements and value of the conjugate media. Or we can consider topological dynamics, where in relation to considering simple equipment compact and here will be a morphism, and there is a continuum of inverse continuum. So, that world and topological vanishing for theories and topological dynamics, but interactive animal interaction. Because if I have a topological system, we have to consider the same thing, and if you have a variant of a problem, that is invariant that preserves the very, so that definitely. So, that means definitely a medible system. So, the topological system because admittances a system, so that we are learning from this interaction. And we are talking about the transformation that defines a set in the space. When the action of an element is implemented in a point here, application of here. So, that is a set, and in their DECEDA Y 'Suda's majority of the system in study, and actions of groups or space groups where action present structure, structure, medieval strategies, topological structure, etc. When we cast the study of medieval dynamics, topological dynamics of groups about topological groups, and differential dynamics, or else we have the area that accentes groups on the various differential groups. So, in mathematics, one of the most irreducible queer representatives the prototype of the general prototype is in dynamic. When one of us is topological, you consider the simplest and very queer preservation of your information. So, this idea God, when all this is invariant, then I do or tiene total. So, this is a system that is like independent. I guess I'll pass the visar because it doesn't have to be. La visara because I can retrieve and the transformation revolve, and it loses with a complement. Yes, it is invariant. So if the media is positive, but it is totally reduced the problem, a system. If you are not reduced, they are irreducible systems. That is why they component in their systems. In terms of medieval systems. And topological, the notion that in these components, The notion equivalent of independence or irreducibility is that the system is minimal, so everything with all here, if it is that serving and invariant, so it's all passive. But I would say that this is here, that is the monochromatic monopoly to the doctor. If it is minimal The system is recurrent, for all their confundo deposits and no sixty vaccine interu es noci. Se preva volver, ya sequita, de la vertú. So this. So, this is a time of return, and what if this with minimal systems in? And one is for the system. One could change the focus of attention to what their son has recurrencily. Those who are conjugate recurrence of recurrence. Y for all systems minimal and all exist unene, but in error of interun es no sí. Yes, so one podium. Yes, one could say that with recurrence, porridge porridge want to recurrence, for a perfect, that relations with the solution monocramatic solutions of problems, usage of questions for if you have topological. Y solo y para todda colorción inita dene llamos ene una union, cedo union color se esuca. Existen ene yeme enerre di tintos del mimo color. Calculate the difference. If you have solution monogramatic solutions of this, to infinite colour. There are a connection between dynamic recurrence and this area of. And this area of solution of questions that correct the dominance of theory. Yes, but it's not a very important thing. Exactly. That's the thing. Yes, that the conjugate recurrence is for everything that is minimal, and for all the variables if it is. In especially with recurrence, because I have. Yes, but I have recognized that they are rare and just what it differs. So, every part of the passage, well, one dynamical interest when two systems dynamic. The form of equivalence that is topological dynamics. If the passes here and my morph, like topological, but also exist a field function between here and here that will mutate collection in cases. Polydento, we But the phi function that will be here and one. Mando orbitas de unaction in orbit of the attraction, but not necessarily form ordinades, but the mandate is another orbit, but wait. So, a little like no, the The minimalistement of the colours all here in the context of topology. So, this is what I would say. No, not periodic, because the finite system came. Minimal porosity study is a minimalist, because I can see a minimal component that is dynamic. So, this was the orbital entonces: this is a little bit. What is that when one of us is minimal, two minimal systems that are vitally quiet, and I am perfectly pointed here, the application of one as vital. How are they here? I know that the image of one of these here will be two of the image of here in one. Certainly, and when they are minimal, that is a definite function definitely a function, certain set. And if it is continuous function, so we are mimic, and it flips conjugate flow, that say one conjugate. That one conjugate or inverse, but igual very similar. So, the minimum queue could be a positive that is continuous, it is to be the most discontinuous point. If you have a point of continuity, we will say that the system is only orbital, but it will be orbitalment. And thank you, when the system are connected, if they are vital. If they are orbitally, it is conjugate. For this orbital, only interest when we totally disconnect. How you could use symbols. And so that symbolic system. We consider a finite question, which we will say, and the two. And we consider all the sequences b infinites with that. And that's autarogen here, but we are going to talk about the topology product, the topology of A. And that is a space of canter. A compact, new metric, but totally disconnects. All these connects and here in the case. And here you can see the transformation in that space will be the function that. Pasio baser la functions that are shift que simplemente correspondent in correlation sequence a position. Yes, so when I shift voyago, it laid because you correct the sero de la sequences. Yes, and when you have a sub junta of the set, that is invariant for the shift, we are going to say that it is a symbolic system or subshift. The grandeur, the passion. The grandeur of sequence with simple enough with the transformation of chips and full shifts. Ok. And what else motivation of this? Well, the motivation is original for us, with the work of Morse and Headland, is in the codify to simplify, codify system dynamic systems. These voyages for example a rotation, and a system. A rotation. There we have a simple, but not trivial. Yes, like more simple queens are not trivial. So, here it is, that the pipe like one, when the identifier with one, and what my rotation is rotating in angular alpha. So, in a point here, the roto angular alpha. And what you can do is. And what you codify a orbit, so you can have a here, voyage if I apply the rotation point, and if it is that in the interval 0 at alpha, I associate a other interval of alpha establishment, I sociero. So, this is a point, and I applied the transformation, you have here. Push here, technical department, por aquí tengo ta alamenos one, and that meadow definitely symbol, it would. But you have one, sero, sero, one, and that. But, I consider a system that are all codificacions of orbitas, that are with all sequences in one, and the tombo la class. And the tomo la closure, here. So, the gracias, the same aquí que no dicho que que un facto, nicer casion one, but the gracias that, for the shift, so the gracias that entre entre el shift que medin la qualificación esta orbit yon regional transformation. Regional information there is a relationship, they are mixed. So, important things that symbolic systems, more facilities, and all the relevant information original information required symbolic system. That is the modifiation of symbolic modules. And these sequences that obtain qualifications, you have to derivation, because if we have alpha in erroneous, these are sequences. This is your mienas. They are super important in symbolic. So in the minimality in symbolic system, we are going to supreme there in it. We are going to say that a factor of a sequence is a That's a finite de la sequence. Yes, you have a sequence here. Gracias. Ten sequence aquí aquí aquí el sero, you do a percito aquí double verbor example. Oh, ya una palabra finitita pa qua apare sel la palabra infinita. Ya y el conjunto de two es palabra finitesama el language de ya y. And then we have uniformly recurring, if not all their death, for all the factor, I will infinitely escape when it comes to the chief paul or palatro, but more distances. What the same thing is, if I am a double vaccist, a man of double veil that I qualify. So that is also a majority voyage to the palace of the level. So two existing, so that whatever other palabraque sufficiently, then it uniformly recursion. If you see arbitrarily, and I can't say this equivalent. And this equivalent here that the shift aquí una es minimal, y, a shift vase minimal if uniformly recurrent. That's going to minimize that all the orbits will be. So, a combinatorial symbolic system is what we are factoring. And it is a lo that is a factor. So, what you will do is complex implementing a function that will count when factors of a determinate. When factors of a determinated existence, a sequence, the function that you will see is that they will sociar the number of factors of the argument. Because this has to be there, all of them, the palabracia, one, so that's the letter, but one of two cunts. Pequis 2. Cuntas palabras de la Guido Hay. Well, it's periodic in a concatenation of union. So, in a parallel in one zero, podo solamente two palabras de la god, the one and one. And you can see that there are to be in one, if you only do palabras from the colours, that is a second complexity because periodic complexes. Simplement una concatenation of chip. And if you have a shift in general, this function will continue the number of factors of the argument in all the sequences of my system. Claro, what you can do is the minimal shift, create a toddler sequence in the same language. Sequences have in the same language. Yes, like the word so that one sequence also. So, this is all about the same factor, and what reference is that function of complicated function is to factors of the argument in which. So, if you don't have a periodic security, this generalization of what is difficult to secure that I have. One solo la palabra, that the palara said, voya dener tantas, letters, like letters have the alphabet and if you consider the notation that the word like primitive palm is concatenated, so that you are in cantidad in the double palabra, which is the function of constant functions to ensure that baser alomat. Siempre baser of the, if the exponential because of the transformation, and that is complexity and that I consider all the sequence. The function of complexity is not and only the definite observation of it, because there are many functions that are going to have a good one that one and many cardinal algo. That the cardinal of Alguala, and not represented. So, I told a studio dedicated to understand data a function in which verifications appropriate when it functions the complexity of algae of a sequence. And the codifications of terminals have complexity vaccine, ten minimum complexity that you can say, this is a This is a unimportant queue that is a dichotomy, which have a symbol their complexity with this dichotomy here. If there are the sequence in terms of periodic terms, a principle, but the final principle is a concatenation of a periodic concatenation, or the functional complexity functions that are strictly integrated. And a correlation of that is that if there are some complexity in it, but not. The complexity, but not rigid. So, the function is obligated periodic function, so the minimum complexity that one can see for the system is not trivial, we have no periodic system, and so the question is: there are sequences that have been minimal, and the request if the codifications of irrational is tiengia minimal. Tien la complexia. Complexia minimum, ten complexity more than that necessity to have a thing trivial. And then the relationship is coming from the complexity with the dynamic. Well, the more noticeable that preserves configuration, so I can guide between their functions of complexity functions, but the important thing. So, here we go between them, not the same function. In particular, their view. If a polynomial exponential is preserved by conjugation, and a thing interesting that the function of complexity restricts the quantity of invariants that can make a system, and there will be when I have a system in topological system, a measure and. So, to a system, one can present when these meditas there, media developed or that preservable transformation. And that, well, there is a junta, the media here, if all the media are preserved by innovation, there is a invariant that. So, you know, our aquí well, in a little feeble, if the function of complexity satisfaction is condition, is the complexity in the concept. So the number of chemical systems is agoto. Infinite por el valor este limit. So I can realize the media queer if you have a complicated vaja, that is how the morale is. And the point is if this condition is optimal, because Because this is a sufficient condition, so if this limit inferior is alpha, and it's not infinite, so you can have a finite change. But this limit was infinite, but you have a finite meditation, but in this condition that the question and what we are going to create and say the Braina Cravancirl Laño 20 is that the cota is optimized in the sense that if I tomorrow what do you think? Certo vaccine infinite. So I can contradict a chief minimal queue admitting a non-numerable meditas and where the complicated vacuum vajita que essociation que medía. So here So, here is the condition of Chernitan, 3 aquí vasote una finite media, and a riba, if you will contradict a chief that has complexity more than that, and that meets a non-numerable media. So, there is a number and the condition of condition. And that passed with equivalence. Well, I have equivalent servitude the conjugate invariant of a shift. In shift is preserved by survival, and also here a class, all the shifts that live there in the same way, because it is structured given. But the same thing is not interesting that they must be the complexity of restrictions. Dequés the complexity or restriction that the class of inheritance can give the orbital class have the complications that we're saying. And that is the question. The first responders, no, no, you cannot have the complexity that we have, because if you have the condition of Nitzan, sobre la complexity, so finite finance, and so. Medidas, and so the media are preserved for here in your vitality. I can be what they're saying. But we want to say, although, for example, what I want to say, but a postures because there are no relationships only with the media, but with the service in general, and what we are optimal in a sense for, and if I calculate their session, super. I tomorrow what is superline for where this limit value and what is the difference and we calculate shift minimal so minima classes of equivalence orbital other things other minimal or first and with yes And with the complexity, baser arbitrary based on superlines. I can go because I have no affinity, but passing the same thing. If I correct an epsilon direction of a superline, I can relate to what is a mimic class of here to the class. So If not the talleno están grabo, the idea is more combinatory, like the factor complex will determine restricted or not a dynamic of the symbolic system. That's very gracious. No, me, me a gusto much, platica paulina. And that is the mejor me, but it's a little, but your object of study or son of minimal ships, and the studio as perfect, but it is not clear, and if you are the difference with the ergodic systems, and if you can send analysis or explicitly that. Analysis o a la mejor explicas que es lo mismo cuando definiste. Ergo dico aima. Podrias taja. Clara, lo que pase que son son notions analogas en el sentido de que definen systemas irredúcible pora sí sila. Certo? So God. So, if the system is ergodic, like I here, so you can see that I can part in and complement and study the parts for separate parts. If the minimal system is and everyone, it is a full porch because exigendo que. What else have you made omega total? If you don't want to see the topological minimum. Already. If you have a system topological minimal topology, and consider a vorelian, that is preservada, it is important. If you want to preserve the transformation, if I have a minimal system, and we have a borrowing money that will preserve the transformation, then it will be good. Poor information, you're going to componido in the media. That has to do with the factors, but a factor is sequenciades of letters. One es factor as their palabra, and this tours the qualification is when the factor referring to a topological factor, what is a continuous objective continuity. Continue objectiva between the shift and circulation. So here, the function, the transformation of the shift, the rotation. And you have this function that will make a conjugacy, so it's a function continuous objective that will be used. Projectiva that will mut collection and also in the case of that significant factor. And I know that in the foundation project in this other dynamic, and we are going to case one, that are the precise, but in the world, the number of primaries that have been. So, they are like, and the relevant issues that I can recover all the information of cases.
