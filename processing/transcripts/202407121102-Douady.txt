The last one. Okay. And uh so uh I didn't know how to choose the title, but since we heard a lot about rivers, okay, I think I'm going to show something which is meandering because the path is not straight with their looks, easy ideas. So I'd like to show you that we have many ideas and they turn on to be wrong or not exact. So it's a big fun to turn around. And also there's a lot of subjects and so I want to put And so I want to put them first so that I don't rush at the end to be too quick on that. So there's many people. So I won't talk about all the subjects actually. And I underline the youngsters, with the PhDs as a postdoc, but as the important people. It is work. And the only thing I will under, there's also a group which we worked on cities. And we didn't publish anything. We worked for 10 years. Very nice. We work for 10 years, very nice work. And we still have to do this, okay? And I just, so this is Camille, you recognize Claire, CÃ©line, didn't care, I'm sorry about that. And then there's Philippe, and I'm very happy to show him because he's a town planner or architect, turned anthropologist. And we worked on him and so it was very interesting to work with someone from a very different field. And I'm very proud because I turned him physics instruction. Because I turned him physics instruction. So now he did 300 experiments in his kitchen. So it's really good. Okay, but let's start. So we have a lot about, Isha was the last one, you have nearly everything already. So the question, one of the questions from this, that I was struck when I saw this beef. And I was struck, like, how to, why are there these loops? How can we describe them? That's the first step. Because you can make a model that looks like that, but easy to read is the same. So you have to be quantified. And what is the morphogenesis? So, how did it appear? And you see, so it's very contrast with the tree network. It's a river network in the United Arabia. But since we discussed a lot already, I realized that here you see that there is revolution between the tips. They never connect. Done it, okay? But you see also, right apart from the description, it's a space, we would space in system. There's no space with no rivers. Actually, so that was the question of Boulig. If there's no space with no rivers, we will be in the river all the time. So that's not the case. There was a finite scale. But also, you see, that if we found out that there's a discussion that you have to have that, you don't need a global field, external field, because that would uh favor some some Father some borders and some parts inside will die. That's not the case. This means that I never thought about that before, but in reverse, there's no bubble view. It's a local rules. Because you thought about topology usually, but no, if it was topology, you would have a different. But what about the groundwater height? That was one question. That's uh okay that's a good question. No, I human. If you go to, I'm sorry, I'm only talking. If you go to describe the patterns, now you see that you see that Claya found a very nice way to reconstruct something that we know just truths. And it's really intuitive. And then from that, actually you can see how the streets collected. You can see the real structure we go. So that's really that's really nice. And okay, you saw these movies already. Already to show that the precious fees, the tree, and the rate curated are very different. And really, Ni just shows you how it can be optimal. And here, actually, there are different types of going there. Okay, so she describes some case which is more in the blood vessels, that you start with a foam and then you structure you structure it. Okay? And our question is more if you don't start from a foam, if you start something that's going to be branched, how you can reconnect to get the phone? Can we connect to bits of people? It's not a problem of optimality, but of more genesis. And so, why was it hard to understand at the beginning? Because when I was young, I was raised with this seismant error problem. And this semantic problem is precisely the global field effect. So, as you see, that each point that grows actually captures some other side field. And then it means as it captures the side field. As it captures the side field, there is an inhibition of around, but also inhibition between fingers. And there's huge competition, and you see there's the rudder space during that. So here is a crystal growth. It's the same except it's structured inside. And you see that the tip actually shadow a bit inside. And the side can grow, but this growth will kill the others. They don't grow anymore. So there's very strong competition and I was raised with dice. You know, like capitalism, okay. So that's win. And uh and then the other dice, okay. And uh and then the other dice, okay. And uh and then you see that even when you see stable, this finger, you see that they they grow, but this one is going to be better, so this one stops. There's even a very high square of you could predict actually the space that was left to the side, you could predict what was done with Ederic, but you hear now that you could predict when the other one was going to die. Okay, so of course the reality is a bit more complex, that's why it's fun. Is a bit more complex, that's why it's fun. And you see that stash X should know it's not true. You forgot some important events. You forgot that when there's a breakthrough, all these feeds change, and then you can have reconnection. So this hierarchy, this impossibility of reconnection is a really good impression, but that's fine. And now, but at the time we thought, okay, so if you want to have look, another analogy is crux, because scratch percentage has an ADMIC, you really You release the tension in one direction, but you keep the tension in the other direction. So you can clearly reconnect. And there's lots of quad patterns like that. So that was the work of Yves Kid, who was a magic chain for experiments. So he could choose experiments. I don't know how he did that. He could choose the experiment so that he could reproduce a pattern. That's okay. Actually, I have no idea how he did this one. This one I understand. Except this one you might not. He did it. He did it. And so you say, okay, cracks always reconnect, but actually, Selen shows, no, it's not the case, always. It depends, it is a bit more complex. So if you have the drying front, so a very strong separation between something which is humid and something which is dry, then you can cl you can lock the cracks in this front, which is then 100, and then they don't have space to open. Then you have your finger lights. Then you have your finger lights. And so you see that's this one here. So it brought here, it bifurcates, and then they will propagate without interacting with this one. And the central part is human. It's psychiominia. And then I don't show the last one because it's bit disappointing. There's only one or two that we connect and nothing they just talk. And okay, but and what he showed is that even in the case where it's reponets, Three planets, even a bit more complicated because you see that okay, it grows in time, and you see something strange. You see at this one turn around instead of connecting. And if you look at the detail here, what happens? Is that okay? You see this crack, the turning, this one. Okay, you see, okay, this one is going to connect here, this one, you know, one connect here. Look, this one connects. Ah, I got this one. Turn the road. This one connects ah and this one turns the wrong and then you connect to zero. So what happened here? Actually there was a revolution, not in attractions. And if you want to go there, if you want to see what Selen showed is that actually two recent scraps, these cracks were too recent, they are being heavy at the same time, and then when they are recent, there's a reduction. Because you have to look at how the crack is Look at how the crack is going, what drives the direction of the crack, which you forget, when actually it has a tendency to go to the higher stress. And when there has a young crack appearing here, it releases the stress in this direction. So even globally, the stress is lower. So the crack turns away from the low stress and go to go to a higher stress. And after it changes, because it because this crack actually enhances the evaporation, so at the end the stress becomes bigger and then it starts rotating to the Stress becomes bigger and then it's attracted to. So it's attracted to old ones and replace from young ones. And of course, to make life simple, it's the opposite in a geofish. Okay? So what you have is that precisely what I shown on the group is that the young canal is attracted to the youngest one. So then you have to think a bit more and you have to realize that actually it's the same effect of how the tension How the tension evolves with the crack, but it's reversed, which means that what you saw in the cracks is that the young crack release a lot of tension and then increase again through the old cracks. And here, the young canals, they don't release so much attention. It's only the old one that release completes attention, then you can you just change the way the attention evolves and you have the opposite effect. So now I'm going to talk to you about. So now I'm going to talk to you about my various subjects with your phones. It's really nice because nobody works on phones except for voice maybe. And when you voice, of course, don't make it now anymore. Okay, so let's see. So you see that you have ferns that are like a tree. Very nice. And you see even that there's a structure inside, which means that there was a bifurcation, like Jamie showed you. Like Jamie showed you. And then you see that the first bifurcation, the growth finally stops. So you have an indentation of the leaf that is clearly connected with the successive bifurcation model. Nice. And then you're happy with it and you go in the middle of the tropical forest in French Guiana. And then what you found is a nut gentleman leaf like this. And you see that it should be branch, but actually you see there are some connections. Connections. And that's what's really strange. Okay, I don't see the picture is really horrible. I didn't attack to find the original one. But you see that the connection, maybe, you see that even there's something strange, which is that the lamina, so the part of the liquifor is really squeezed. So there was some special effect. And in this species, I still don't know the name, actually, didn't find it out, depending on the place where it was in the ground, Ground, scientific ground. You see that near the stream, very humid, it was nicely branched. Half hill, there's some reconnection. On top of the heat, there was much more reconnection. So it seems to like that there was, there's in this same species at different places, there's this gradient of reconnection. Is it the same plant or same species? Like the same. Just growing at different three different places. Just growing at different three different places. Near near the river, a behavior and on on the top of the so it's just a bit drier and then he did did that. But it's not just one plant all three. Same species, but three different. So then it's it's really nice because it brought back, I found after the articles of Kevin, it brought back, you saw that he had this transition between branch, continuous, but branch, continuous, branch. Uh uh continuous branch on anisotropic, okay, and then from there you go to rethylated, like a foam, or you go to something more complex like a loop with spirals everywhere. And here what you what you can see is that we are trying to explain the transition between C and D. So this you can ex you can understand by joining actually the lamina together and then having different rate of blows. But then having different rates of growth. And here, what you see is that if you add this junction side junction, you can do that. And you see that this addientum does this a lot, because we have this perfectly branch. This one that was in between, and this one which is completely glued on the side. Bundle yeah. I know I want to go to it. So, okay, you see that it's a bundle here because you see that there's a there is a yes. The veins actually are not fused. They really crack together, but if you look closely, there are teeth two tubes. Then they reseparate. That's why you see it. Okay, and there's one case which is very interesting, this is Ligodium. I see one of the exact species either. You see that this is the one I showed, which is completely reticulated. But when it goes to fertile, which means at the end it grows more the tip to make a suspens, and then it goes back to completely tree. It goes back to completely tree with even indentation and the first bifurcation. And then, when it's a half leaf, half fertile, you see that the fertile part is a tree and the non-fertile part is the basic tree. You see that you see that you can really go from one side to the next. Next, transition, which is actually different, which is to go from this solution to the reticulated one, the more complex reticulated one. Complex what you can get to grow. What you can understand is that actually ferns have a problem because they grow essentially on the surface and it's very fragile. It's immature tissue, embryonic tissue. And they are outside in the air. They don't grow inside, but like the other plants. And then they have to be in very humid environments. And they have to grow quick to grow out so that it doesn't dry up. So one solution is that if it grows on the ground, One solution is that if it grows on the border, like Tamri described, and I gave him to, then the growth is very slow because it's the speed times the perimeter. So one way to increase the speed is to make this instability. So you have the first growth, then the second growth, then the third growth. And then you increase at each step, you increase the perimeter. So if it's an instability like that, the folding goes exponentially, so actually you're Folding goes exponentially, so actually you recover an exponential and then you go quicker, which is good. So you can do it. You can split one, two, three times. Okay, and then here you see that it's still instable at the third time, it's getting stable, and then it pulls, you get finally this one, which is so it's cut four times. And then it's going to give this nice fractal structure, which people love of right. But if you do that, you see that you have. Do that, you see that you have a problem which means that the leaf can superb. That's not good because you're losing a lot of you, you spend a lot of energy to make a tissue which you can okay. So one interpretation is that it splits like that and then it wants to finally reclose it to avoid this problem. So if you look at the fonts, ferment fans are nice is that they have all the different steps. You see that here you start to grow against the tissue in between. You have one reconnection. You have one reconnection, you're closing it, you're closing pinot, three reconnections, and then in three connections. And then you can still try to analyze it. So if you have this, actually you can analyze it and find back the tree that was reconnected. And if you do it, it's really nice because you you see at first as a Juvia a stereotypical pattern and you can recognize here you make one bifurcation more and you put them together or And you glue them together for two bifurcations and you glue them together for three, like this. But then it opens again, not no, it closes and then opens? Actually, I understand this pattern like if it was this system that grew closed, but you never see the in-between system. So it means it's like if it's growing with a border, but the border is already closed during the growth. That's why still then this leaf That's why still then this leaf is like a normal leaf, it's growing exponential. But you don't see the intermediate stage in the morphology. But structurally it's really like that. And here you go back to the cracks and we have a bit the same system, which is that you see that if you go in this front, when two driving fronts collide here you can have a reconnection. And then you see that like if you have this these three lobes You have these three lobes, they can reconnect in the central part with the same system. But unfortunately, okay, so that would be the same. Yeah, then it will produce the first rate, but of course, life is a bit more complicated. That's what I'm going to say, so I have to look at it and if you look at the transition between these fingers on a fully reticulated, so you look here you do the transition because you make a gradient in CS. So here it's very thin, so his fingers are very thick, so it's a nice usual cut, and you see what's happening in between. Cut and you see what's happening in between, then you find that it's actually sub-critical, which means that you have your fingers that go here, and then at the same time, everywhere far away, you have logs that appear right away. So you can't go continuously from matrix to the other one, that when you mix. And that's what you can do. So to do a bit, I would like to review that. I found that this week was really great. This week was really great, and because precisely we had this discussion about the global feed and that I started to do it. And here you see, that's what we saw yesterday, some marvelous work of Justin. And then you see that actually it looks really like cracks. So it's dense on cell phone interconnected. So it's dense, you say that it's an internal feed, it's not imposed by your side. That's what I got. And then you see it's reconnected because actually it really looks like trucks that connect. Actually, it really looks like tracks that connect right now. And then, if you go and then if it's actually self-connected, what you see here everywhere, then it's not hard to understand that it can connect with another one. Because if myself is a stranger and I connect to it, and stranger, I connect to it too. So, that's what I found really interesting in this work. And then I wanted to show you a last time, the last example that is done by someone in our lab at the end there. So we saw that there was a lot of distribution from this field, but also from the tips. Because we had these phase filling models. And that grow in all directions. Yeah, they are both on there. We have these phase filling models, which is actually directed only by the movement of the By the movement of it, you even can forget feet. You have just the tip for fluid. And here, once it's case, it's a bacteria that reproduce. And this bacteria actually creates a surfactant. So it's on a gel. It creates a surfactant and then it glides on the gel. And then, so you see here, it's a wave of surfactants spreading. And you see that then they really go out, and you have exactly the same feeling that. And you have exactly the same feeling that actually each tip has its own dynamics, and then when it collides with the rest, it doesn't see the rest in a way. So you just bump in the rest, and that's nothing. So in this case, there is really a tip dynamics that is not driven by all side field. There's just a slight, that's what the moment shows, is that there's still a directionality, but it's just a point that it's a bit better to put that like that, but it's not a strong. That kind of like that, but it's not a strong force. So you see that here, the field is a kind of gradient of probably surfactant concentration that gives them a global direction, but it's not completely strong because you can still go in here. Minus one? Minus one. Just a movie, because it's nice to see a movie. So you're going to see the colony growth. Then it's going to estimate the software entry. Nice fingers. Nice fingers. They see they are instable and you see that they can connect without any problem. They just touch each other, they keep going and then they're boom. I show you guys the end going. So what fluid is that? The fluid. I don't know which affectants. But it's a shared meaning? Probably. Ah, yeah, yeah. Because it can go from fingers to needles. Ah, yeah, okay. No, it's what is produced by the bacteria, so I have no idea. It's biological, you know. And but it's finite. Okay, so I nearly finished in time. Yeah, you can keep going now that I'm negative. Okay, so I want to say that we see results many different paths. We saw many different patterns, and I thought that the discussion was really twisted between external field, internal field, or no external field, directional fields, or dynamics. And I will keep that from the session. Very good. Stand it up. So I don't know if it's your question or maybe a comment more uh but I think you can also have this uh feeling Feeling patterns. I think Julio was also mentioning yesterday with external fields, but which is not very directional. So if you have this Daplacian group and you have only inlet output, then of course you have this ringing, etc. But if you include the source terms and you have Poisson equation and you have the production of it everywhere, the field is still external, but you can the patterns can be more field straight. In a way I call that internal, which means that there is internal source. That diet internal source everywhere is it will live inside. Okay. That's that. That's how I interpreted also the experiment of Shusi, which is that diatolation creates a field inside. And that's a very important feature. Is it only driven by outside or also the part inside? Which is this tax? Exactly. And that's very important distinction that you have before. Questions? So you said it, but I didn't understand it. You didn't definitely. So you're saying for ferns, we go from the separated ones to the ones that look like intact leaves, but we don't see the integration. But we don't see the intermediate transitions, but that you mean evolution, and you said morphology. Can you clarify a little bit what you meant? So, actually, actually, I saw this transition that I showed here. So, here you see the transition. Different species? Actually, it's quite a different species. But this leaf, I know nothing about ferns. This leaves grows like that or it just generated and it fills in. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, it grows like that. So, that's what's questioned exactly. But you see, what's nice is that in different species you see some kind of intermediate steps. Evolutionary steps. So, but what we are looking at, and it's exactly, and what we are looking at is 10 seconds, is okay. You know that there's this Heckel theory that ontogeny resumes phylogeny. Actually. So this in different species you see different steps with that. Not all the steps. But the steps are more complicated. I never saw intermediate. Maybe I didn't look at all the plants. That's why I wanted to discuss with scale it. But you see that in one plant. In one plant, when it grows, the first leaves, usually they are more ancestral types, and then it goes. More ancestral types, and then it goes to more complex machine. So, I wanted to look at that. But right now, so fans are very nice, but they are very slow to grow. It takes already six months to make the first leaf, and then it goes slowly. So, we didn't see to see the growth of the intermediate transition, but actually, that's a problem with plants or even animals. It's the same like with humans. The morphogenetic state. Humans, the morphogenetic state is very early, and then after there's another state which is just expansion. But the human embryo is a few first weeks, it's already everything is there, then it's just expansion. And in the plants, it's the same. So actually I hope that with this lateral growth, I would see I could follow the morphogeny morphogenic steps. But actually this morphogenic steps that are really early and then this it's a differential expression more than uh more than uh really early formations. More than that. We have to continue with the general discussion after we open it. So we have
