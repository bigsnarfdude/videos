Again, it is a pleasure to announce Kun Wang. He will speak about the N-vortex problem on a sphere. So, thank you. All right. Thanks very much for the invitations from the organizers. My pleasure to participate in such a wonderful conference. In the next 40 minutes or so, I will invite you to distract a little bit from the embody problems and. From the unbody problems, and I will try to recall some of my recent progresses in this unvertext problem, which from a certain point of view shows some similarities as interactions of many different particles to the unbody problems, but seen from a variational and geometric perspective, it has its own properties. So, to start with, let's do a work. Let's do a very quick recall for this Euler equation where you have Vt plus V dot gradient V is equal to the minus gradient P, where V V is equal to zero. So it's a divergence free, meaning that the volume is preserved along with the flow. If we take the curl on both sides of this operator, of this equation, let's say, This equation, let's say if you have W is the curl of V, then what will happen? This equation becomes Wt plus the curl of V V is equal to zero because when you compose a When you compose a curl with a divergence, it gives you zero. But recall that V with V is just one over two, the reading of V modulus square minus V product with sorry, hero V. So it's just the W as defined. As a result, when we take When we take this equation, finally we get WT is just equal to minus Wv. So the letter is the so-called Euler-Holmholtz equation, where the bracket is a Poisson bracket, not for two functions, but rather for two vector fields, wherein local coordinates. Where in local coordinates, these vector fields can be written in the formula 3. So you see that we have switched from the velocity equation to a verticity equation. And now, if we want to consider the vertex problem, we can take a look at the two-dimensional case where v is equal to v1, wave2, 0, and w is equal to 0, 0, w, or w this time is scalar a. Or w this time is scalar equation. We put these settings into the previous equation, and the previous equation now becomes w dot, which is a dot of a scalar function, is equal to minus the Poisson bracket of two functions this time, for P and W, where this P C is a stream function which is related to the velocity field V by the following relations. The following relations. And now, by using the fact that W is a curl of V, we can see that we got actually a Poisson equation with W, which is the vorticity function as a source of this equation. So, this is what happens in Rn. And what will happen if we switch to Riemannian manifold? Well, oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. So, before that, let's also consider the finite dimensional proximation. So, in the previous equation, I got an equation that governs the movement of W. Now, if I consider W as concentrated on finitely many direct measures, the previous equation actually translates into a Hamiltonian system where this H is equal to minus 1 over 4 pi. 2 minus 1 over 4π, which is just a normalization constant with the summation of gamma i, gamma j logarithm ji minus j j square. So now you see this logarithm actually emerges very naturally because we got to solve for the green function of a Laplacian operator. So, this is what happens in R2, and what will happen if we And what will happen if we just look at the integrabilities? So, the three-vortex problem has first been studied in detail by Groby. And people have noticed that when n is smaller or equal to three, due to the invariance and the rotation and translation, this model is actually integrable. Where when n is larger than four, in general, Is larger than four in general, such a system is not integrable in a Liou-Weil-Arnold sense. And there are studies regarding the stable behaviors. For example, Canin and Selati and Falukolini and also Li Mu Chao, they have studied the existence of K and Tauri. On the other hand, there are studies showing the chaos of this system following. System following initially Zieglin, followed by Couler and Calvalo, and Castillando. So, this is the general picture for what we have for this vortex problem on the plane. But what if we move to a Riemannian manifolds? Well, all the previous discussions actually still make sense. The only difference that we got to consider from a multi-metric point of view and use this. And use these Holtz operations to replace many of the naive tensor calculations in the previous section. So, actually, in the framework of OILA of naught, we can consider this equation as an equation on the dual of the Lie algebra. And here I have briefly listed the analog. The analogs here. So originally you have an Euler equation in R2, and now you still have Vt plus this covariant derivative with respect to, for example, the connection of the Vt beta. And originally, your W is a scalar function defined in this way. In this new setting, the 2D case, you can consider first to use the flat musical operator to get this. flat music operator to get this one form. Take this one form, you get a two form, and then you take the half d to get your scalar function. So again, you can try to use a finite dimensional approximation for this model, and this gives you a n-vertex problem evolution of a Riemannian manifold. Now, why are we interested in such a Interested in such a topic because mathematically it might give quite some information, for example, for the construction of steady vertex patches and it helps us to designularize our Euler equation on these surfaces. It can also serve as a tool to study the singular limits of some Louvre type equations, for example. And of course, in And of course, in the real world, there were some applications, say, in geophysics. And also, recently, I see someone in nanotechnologies. They study this motion of fluids on a cell membrane. So all this might serve as some motivations. But we will see such a model itself gives us a playground where we can see the interaction, different geometric. action different geometric structures. I think from that point of view, it is a nice object to study by its own right. So let's look at the mathematical formulation. Of course, I have my Hamiltonian system which follows the Hamiltonian equation here. And what is my Hamiltonian function and what is my symplectic form? Well, first, if you consider a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold, Two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. This phase space will be given as the direct products of n copies, depending on the number of vertices you're going to study. Taking off this collision set where two of this or multiple of these vertices will collide into each other. So we don't want collision to happen. This will be our phase phase. What will be the symplectic form? Well, you have a Riemannian structure G here, which gives you a volume form. Gives you a volume form, but we're in two dimensions, so volume form is naturally a symplectic form, and we take the sum of all these syntactic forms. However, we will give it a weight. This weight is nobody else, but exactly this circulation vector, which we also call intensity. This gamma i could be positive, could be negative. And what is a high? And what is a Hamiltonian function? So, a Hamiltonian function can be written as two parts. So, the first part is what we call the green function, and the second part is what we call the robin function. As you can see, in this green function, it evaluates the interaction of different vertices. So, this robin function somehow depends only on a single vertex by itself. Vortex by itself. So basically, this jobing function considers the dynamics generated by the compensation of the background vorticity. Now, more precisely speaking, this green function, we just solved the Laplacian equation with this Dirac here. Of course, since we're working on the closed manifold, we must subtract one over this. Subtract one over this volume of this manifold. And we know when Z and U, these two points are becoming closer and closer, the dominating part of this green function will just be one over two pi minus multiplying logarithm the geodesic length between w and z. So So here, this robin function is defined as a green function taking off its singular part, and we will get a robin function. In particular, this robin function has no singularity. It is a regular function. Now, with this setting, let's look at how can we study the dynamical behavior of this problem. So, first, there is a very simple, it might be A very simple, yet might be quite useful observation that if you consider the impact from the Riemannian metric, it has impact on both sides, isn't it? Because on the right side, you have the green function, you also have the drawing function, all this depends on your metric. On the other hand, it also impacts the left-hand side because for the individual symplectic form, it's just a reminder. Symbolic form. It's just a Riemannian volume form coming from this same metric. So G is impacting on both sides. Somehow, this circulation vector gamma also impacts both sides as well. On the right-hand side in the Hamiltonian function, we see gamma i, gamma j before this green function, and we also see gamma i's. see gamma i squared before this log function. Somehow on the left hand side, we know that our symplectic form is actually the summation of gamma i. So gamma i also involves in both hand sides. So such a mixing might make this problem a little bit more complicated than should be. But a nice observation is that although both sides will see the impact, they are actually separated. I mean there are kinds of I mean, there are kinds of isolation because it's just terms involving the products of gamma i, gamma j with gj. So you can say somehow they were isolated. So this gives us some space to play by trying to manipulating each of them individually. And some of the naive examples might be Examples might be, for example, the standard sphere where you have a SO3 symmetry, a surface of revolution, which according to the symmetric axis, you're going to have this S1 symmetry. Perhaps you can also study, for example, this three-axial ellipsoid, which gives you three axes of a symmetry. Symmetry, either pair of them are different. So this gives you a Z2 symmetry. This is no longer a continuous symmetry, but just a discrete one. And finally, in the more general case, we can study whatever a topological sphere equipped with a metric without any explicit symmetry. So we'll try to go through this from the most symmetric one to the least symmetric one. The least symmetric one. And one thing I want to remind you guys is that since we are working on S2, so conformally speaking, there is only one equivalent plus. Every metric on this S2 differ from each other only by a change of conformal factor, if necessary. So sum of the known results. Suppose that G0 is a standard metric of G0 is a standard metric of your sphere. That has SO3 symmetry. Then we know that when n is smaller or equal to 3, this 3-vertex problem is integrable. If you take symplectic coordinates locally, then you can represent your symplectic form as well as your Hamiltonian function. So, what will be this Hamiltonian function? If you give two vertices i and j on this sphere, we can calculate their chart length, right? And the Hamiltonian will just be the summation of a gamma i, gamma j logarithm applied on the chart length square. In particular, if we want to use this symplectic coordinates, we can write it in the following way. This is an example. So, if we're given whatever a single vertex on the sphere, it will not move because due to the symmetry, the vertex does not know where to move. Or in other words, the rolling function is a constant. So, the vertex does not have a particular preference in the direction towards which it might move. And you can also find a lot of relative periodic orbits on that. To resume some of To resume some of the literature, this problem is studied by Bog Molov since 1980-78 and Newton Kidanbi in 1998 and Sakajio in 1999 showing the integral probability of this three-vertise problem of a standard sphere. And when n is larger than three, backrests and backgrounds. Bagrets and Bagrats have shown the existence of chaos, and Lin Chow has studied its KM Tauri as well. So for the study of equilibria and periodic orbits, in particular spiriodic orbits, some work has been done by Borisov, Mama Ev and Killeen in 2005. In 2005, by using the quotient of the symmetry. And Carvalh and Cabral has used the Lyapunov family bifurcating from this N-ring polygon. And recently, Renato Dodello and Cassia Aspinzia have taken one step further by carefully analyzing. Further, by carefully analyzing this Lyopno family bifurcated from there to show the existence of abundance of choreography. So what will happen if we go to a surface with less symmetry, say if we go to a surface that is just a surface of evolution, now the isometry group will just be S1. So if you rotate around this axis of symmetry, a system Symmetry, a system is invariant. Somehow, for such a system, this integrability should be, I mean, at least for two vertices, right? And if you put a vertex for the end of the one symmetric axis, you can imagine to stay invariant. And for periodic obvious, we can, of course, study the vertex rings. If you put n vertices on the If you put n vertices on the same latitude of your sphere, you can imagine that they will rotate around the axis of symmetry due to this symmetry between them, among them. So a detailed analysis for such vertex ring dynamics as long as how the geometry of this surface, in particular, how the curvature will impact the stability of this vertex ring, can be found in the article of. Can be found in the article of Trichell and Boato in 2015. So, what if we go one step further and take a look at a surface that is even less symmetric? For example, if you look at an ellipsoid where three axes are of distinct length, then since it's still ellipsoid with It's still a solid with a tree axis. There is a Z2 symmetry. If you put your initial positions on a symmetric position, you can actually imagine that these vertices will keep symmetric along the flow. So in that case, you got some extra help. But in general, one could expect that when n is equal to 2, this might not be integrable. Integrable. I see that in an article of Couler and Rodriguez, there is a numerical analysis on this chaos theme, but I'm not sure if a theoretical proof has been available or not at this moment. So at least numerical evidence suggests. Empirical evidence suggests strongly that this is no longer integrable, even if you consider only two vertices. And finally, if you just move to whatever topological sphere equipped with Riemannian matrix that's without any symmetry, then what can we say that there might be some fixed points? Because after all, you can consider the critical points of your logins function, right? That gives you at least some fixed points. That gives you at least some fixed points. But in general, how to find the fixed points for multiple vertices as well as the periodic obvious might be a challenging issue. So why this model might pose some obstacles to apply the variational methods? The reason is that if you look at the Hamiltonian, it's a singular Hamiltonian where you're going to have singularities at the collision. Have singularities as a collision, right? On the other hand, you have some indefinite property because if you consider the action of the functional, the alternating vertices, for example, from positive to negative, positive to negative, these combinations will make your functional highly indefinite. And moreover, there is no convexity that is known for this Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian. If you want to use a geometric method and look at the topology of your energy surface, then a priori it is not compact and no contact structure is yet explored for such a problem so far. So it is not straightforward to apply the evaluation method. And what we try to do is to implement some syntactic methods. Some symplectic methods. To this end, let's see if your V is a closed symplectic manifold equipped with a symplectic form omega, and your F is a smooth map from S2 to V, we can define the symplectic action as integral of the pullback for the symplectic form on S2. Of course, we are looking at a closed symplectic manifold. Thus, such an action depends only on the pi t. only on the pi 2 of f according to stocks theory. So now if we define minimum, actually infimum of all those actions for lighting I go through all those smooth mappings which gives a positive strictly positive action. We denote this value to be m v and w and we will say m v w And we will say mvw is infinity if the pi 2 of your manifold is equal to n. This is some definitions for a basic object to study. And the well-known Weinstein conjecture, which basically claims that if you have a compact hypersurface of contact type, then your Hamiltonian is going to have at least one closed characteristic on it. Characteristic on it. So, this is proved by Hauper and Viterbo by using pseudohomorphic spheres for CPN, the complex projective plane. And their method is to study the modular classes of these pseudo-holomorphic spheres by looking at the minimal action, by looking at the class that gives you the minimal action. Why we need to focus on such a class is Focus on such a class that when we want to show the growing compactness result, this can help us to finish the blow-up analysis. And there is a key fact. This is very important. So if you are given two points on this CPN, then there is only one CP1, which is actually homeomorphic to IC2, right? To S2, right? Connecting these two points on the CPN. So since there's only one CP1, you don't need to spend a lot of time discussing what will be the minimum of your, sorry, what will be the class which gives you the minimal action. You can just look at this pi 2 equals to 1, right? And then Two equals to one, right? And then everything is finished. So this somehow indicates that such an analysis can be naturally generalized to more general manifolds. In particular, this suggests that we can also consider manifolds of this type, so which is a direct product of S2 multiplying P, where P is another symplectic manifold where you want. Manifold where you want this symplectic volume to be not too small. Maybe let me briefly explain the motivation. So if you consider S2 goes to S2 multiplied P, then a natural method of generating this holomorphic sphere is that you fix the P part to be a constant. And now you can just follow. And now you can just focus your analysis on S2 to S2. And we know that S2 to S2, of course, there are non-trivial holomorphic spheres. But the thing is that how can you make sure such a restrict will give you the class that have the minimal action? Well, the idea is that if the symplectic volume of P is large, then of course you want to rule that out. So that's basically what happens. Uh, what happens for this consideration? So, by using this argument, we have the following theory. So, if your P is a compact symplectic manifold and omega is a volume form of S2, then you consider this MPWP, which is what we have defined before as the infimum of all symptomatic actions of smooth mapping scaling a positive. Of smooth mapping scaling a positive action. Let's say the action of this S2 with a given symplectic form W is dominated from above by this inferior. Then if we consider a product symplectic manifold and we can find a hypersurface which naturally separates Which naturally separates two things. So the first thing is a single point, and the second thing is another point multiplying this P manifold. So you have the one part is a single point, Z0, P0 is just a point, this product space. And the other part is actually a copy of this P manifold. So if we can find a hypersurface that separates these two, then With these two, then we'll be able to use some classical arguments to show the existence of periodic orbits near this hypersurface. So with this in hand, let me just give you some motivation of how to prove this in a very simple toy model, which also explains the full idea. So let's say we are looking at ellipsoid. Looking at an ellipsoid, where this ellipsoid is a very thin one, then what will happen is that if you have Z1 and Z2, Z1 with the vorticity to be gamma 1 and Z2 to be the vorticity of gamma 2, a natural observation, so if gamma 1 is smaller than gamma 2, then there were two observations. So first, if you put So first, if you put your Z2 at the North Pole and you let your Z1 to move anywhere as you want, this Hamiltonian cannot be too small because we know the Hamiltonian is in general minus one over two pi logarithm matrix function plus some regular terms, right? So if you just put the two to be a far end, that you'll be not too That you be not too small for this Hamiltonian, no matter where Z1 moves. But what does it mean, no matter Z1 moves? It means that if you consider a copy of Z1 while fixing Z2 at this point, then it cannot be smaller than certain energy levels. This is the idea. The next idea is that if you look at the natural volume, then the volume multiplying gamma one will be smaller than the Gamma one will be smaller than the volume multiplying gamma two. So, in spirit, the proof of the more complicated case is just a way of generalizing this very simple argument. So how do we try to guarantee the separation? We will multiply or g and how do we control the action? We will just manipulate this circulation. Circulation vector. So, I will go a little bit faster on these details. So, first, we want to know that what happens if we change the metric? Well, the change of matrix will change your Hamiltonian, and this has been studied by Boato and Coiler in 2019-5. Actually, I believe this result is already known in 2008, but this published version is a little bit. This published version is a little bit late. So, this is the formula we can use. So, basically, we know what happens for a Hamiltonian if we change the metric. And now, we want to consider some non-degenerate fixed points. So, how can we guarantee like a MERS property? We have some intuition. The first intuition is that if we permit my Hamilton to To variate as my metric to switch from one to another in the same conformal class, then this parameter space is like a space of functions, right? This is infinite dimensionals. A lot of weapons here. And if we can also show that vertices in general do not have a clustered collision, so that will give us some. Us some kinds of arguments permits us to conclude the Morse property. So, for the first intuition, we want to use an infinite-dimensional version of Smile-Dung transversality theory motivated by the study of Bach, Michelaiti, and P. Choya in 2018 on vertices in a bounded domain. And we also need a version of Schube's lemma, which is motivated by Which is motivated by the study of robots on vertices on the plane in 2018 as well. So, roughly speaking, we can compute this linear relation and we can show that this linear relation is Gado differentiable with a continuous derivative. As a result, this is also Christy differentiable. And once it's Fréchie differentiable, you can try to implement a nice version. Implement a nice version of this transversality theorem. So, briefly speaking, you can show that in general you have an open dense subset in C infinity where your Hg equipped with this G is a MOS function and there are finitely many fixed points of your N-vertex problem. Now, let's see what will happen to fill in this dominating In this dominating condition, we just need to choose a lucky guy. So, who will serve as this one single copy of IS2 in your IS2 multiplying T? Because IS2 to the power of N is just S2 multiplying S2, multiplying S2, multiplying S2. So, my idea is that you just need to find some appropriate guy, depending on the verticity, to serve as a special rule. To serve as a special rule of the first S2 and then put the others into the bracket. Well, to this end, we will define a notation called Fin vorticity, saying that the k vorticity is thin with respect to the whole circulation vector if the greatest common factor of all the remaining guys is larger or equal to this one. The motivation for this definition is actually very straightforward because we know. Forward because we know that by a Bayes identity, if all those right-hand side great common factor is larger or equal to this gamma k, then all those linear combinations with integer coefficients on the right-hand side, you never give a value that is smaller than the left-hand side. So that gives us the dominating condition we need. So, yes. So, yes, so by interpreting this condition, we can nicely fit in the framework that we discussed before. So, I'm going to look at this special vertex eta, which corresponds to a theme verticity. And I'm going to first fix this theme vertex at the position of eta, and then I let all the other guys to move. I count what is the minimum value. I count what is the minimum value, then I will take two values, which is the minimum of all these values, and with C2 is the maximum of all these values. So, of course, with the non-degeneracy of fixed points, you can see that C2 is strictly larger than C1. So, that tells you if you choose in particular any point C and consider the energy surface, then by the way, Surface, then by the way we get this C1 and C2 by definition, we can construct a separation condition where this single vertex with copies of all the remaining vertices will be bounded on one side of this surface. Of course, there were some topological details where you need to apply a generalized version of Joden-Brow separation theorem, but that's how the details. But that's other details. The general idea is just like that. And in this way, we can fit in the framework discussed in the beginning when we talk about the symplectic method. So finally, some of the remarks. Can we try to evaluate the minimum number of Fangahe polynomial? Well, Polynomial. Well, we know that in celestial mechanics, by applying this Fadel-Newrich theory, we can actually get this bound. Unfortunately, if we want to do the same thing for this vortex problem on a general manifold, it might be complicated because it involves some computations of spectral sequence, which I so far do not have a good view how this could be done. Could be done. There is some recent progress in this hardhead homology, which might shed some light on it. And how can we generalize these vertices to object sign? Because if you move to the object sign, on the one hand, you no longer have this compact surface, right? You do not have this compact energy surface, but somehow you will be able to. Somehow, you will be able to still guarantee this recurrence because your surface is compact. So, that tells you it's a finite volume, which gives you the recurrent phenomena as well. So, maybe something could be done. Recently, Batch and his collaborators have shown the existence of fixed points for a general setting by giving some alternating conditions. Some alternating conditions on this verticity or this intensity vector. And to finish, this result depends on strongly on the arithmetic property. Should it be expected like this? Because a result we got for the conditions of this circulation vector is not an open one. So is it reasonable to believe that? Is it reasonable to believe the existence of periodic orbits or more like general invariant sets will depend on the arithmetic property, which I do not have any clue at this moment, but I hope that I can explore a little bit more in this direction in the future. So, yes, that's the end of my talk. Thanks very much for your time and participation. Your time and participation. Thank you to you. Thank you. Are there some questions? So maybe let's see if there are some questions for distant people. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah. No, I think no. So we thank you. So we thank you. We thank you once again. Thank you, guys.
