Okay, thank you very much for the introduction and I would like to thank Naido for the invitation to give this nice workshop. So I introduce Logoza packet and with Rosa augmentations. So first, let's introduce you to some notions. So we focus on in archiving local field, not view, yeah. So and for the And for the groups, so we focus on these class-based classic groups. And if you switch roots and co-roots, we consider the complex canary data group corresponding to it. And these are called Lamat Do group. So SP2N corresponds to this. And so for the Lamat L group, for these two groups, they are split. So just take the two groups. And for this platform group, you have to take this semi-group. Have to take this separate direct product. Okay, but then after all right, so local asset packet, the point is to parametrize local component of automobile plantation in the displace spectrum. So after you introduce the local asset packet with a finite multi-set, we reduce the user representations. So what are local local asset packets corresponding to so-called local asset parameters? So So, these are homomorphism from this V, the link group times another SL2. And this is called the Link Sl2 and this is us SCL2 to the L group. And so it has its combination. And this phi is a representation of the WF, we require to be bounding. And we also require there is an exponent here. This is less than half the reason to do this because we don't. Do this because we don't require one. So there could be some export. And this SK, this K-dimensional representation of SR2C. And because this is a representation lies in the L group, so there are some requirement on the dimension summation. So in general, this set of other parameters, we use this plus and this plus just meaning that so you put some exponent. meaning that so we put some exponent non-zero here and if this n i assail to x trivially we call this parameter generic and additionally if all this exponent are zero then this this part we indeed we bound it and we call temper okay and uh so here if we remove the plus we're just meaning that those all these x i is zero okay so it means this part is redeeming part is temporal okay Part is temporary, okay. All right, so local other parameters naturally can attach some local parameters to it, okay? So, the first one would be uh, so this is VTL group, okay. And so, here you map the asset SL2, take this value at this point, so you get a uh look at air permit, okay? So, basically, just break the second SL2, okay, the other SL2, and this for side to it. And this facade to this 5, this is the injective. And the second way to attach the AR parameter is through this diagonal bedding. So it's two cover beds, so which is the diagonal purpose. And so for each here, let's consider this. I mean, there are no plus here. So for Pasai, ASHA define this local ASHA package using the carrier relation. There are finite multi-set users. If there are finite multi-set, you use unitary potential. And this is called local as a packet. And inside, there is a local L packet. Okay, remember the fact we just defined? Okay, this is subset. And if we consider plus parameter, so there is also localized packet defined, and it's a conjecture to be unitary. So you see, this definition localized packet is where this capture. Is where this capture relation is not explicit. So explicit. So later, so McGlan constructs local art packet explicitly and showed that it's indeed market-free. And the work of McGlan she showed that this other packet indeed match ASARS pattern in relation. And later, she gave the non-vanishing criterion and also computed LB9 and cardinalities of other packets in certain cases. So recently, so based on So recently, based on Machline construction, so Atobe gave a reformulation of Machlan construction for these two groups split, and this makes it easier to compute the L d all right. So we know that local L packet, they are strong. Okay, so unlike local L packet, local art packet may overlap. So now the question is: given two parameters, local other parameter, and we have two other packets. So is it, I mean, do they have an Is it, I mean, do they have a non-trivial intersection or not? Okay, so McLaren gives some necessary conditions if you have some non-if you have non-zero intersection. So name is easy for size diagonal. Remember this IR programme we just defined. So they're equal. That's a necessary condition, but not sufficient. And given any precise local author package, one can certainly check the intersection problem by multi-line construction or auto-bit formulation. But now the question is. Formulation. But now, the question is the difficulty to find a systematic way to determine the intersection. One question is: so, say we give a local asset parameter, so how to systematically determine all the other local asset parameters such that they have nothing to be intersection? These kind of questions. So, why we care about this? So, this is the example, and we have some motivation here, man. So, this shows the complication of the intersection of both aspects. So, here we list the three. So, here we list the three local packet, and they're both there as we turn. And you can see the inside like this. So, we'll come back to these colors in a minute. Okay, so in particular, this pi, eight, nine, ten, eleven are not other types. They're not in any other package. And this pi one, pi two, they three other packets. So, we're going to come back to this. All right, so. All right, so why we care about the inception problems? One motivation is this non-tempered gangrose-process projector. So, say we take these two groups. I'm back to the classical gross process setting. So, say we have two local outside parameters that are relevant. So, this is defined by control-forsage. So, just want to want to reflect the GDB pair. The GDB pair in other packet, etc. So, um, so roughly speaking, uh, these are two representations, right? So, uh, they have in these two microspaces, they have a so-called correlator. So, they are degree one homomorphism, and composed with its joint, they are roughly like acting like the unipotent element of the asset, roughly speaking. So, say we have clear relevant look. Say we have a pair relevant to local other parameters, then this is a conjecture, right? So then there exists a unique pair in this L packet asset type. Okay, remember this is L packet, this is L parameter associated to Possibly one. Okay, so here we call this warn L packet because we have to take the union of the packet corresponding to the pure number. Okay, so because you see, so for the tamper, So, for the tampered L package, so we know that the local GDP have improved, right? So, and so now move on to non-tampered local L packet, et cetera. So, this is one step. Okay, this is one conjecture by Dr. Bossat. And so, the conjecture for this L packet as a term. Okay, these are just part of the non-tempered L package. So, there is a unique pair. But that is not it all. Relevant, just if you have two local other parameters, so in this two-back space, we have a correlator. So there is degree one homomorphism such that this T composed with T adjoint, they are acting like the Euten element of the RSL2. Yeah, okay. So you can see that these are not all non-tempered. Not all non-tempered look at air packet, just the part of this part of that. So, however, if you move, if we consider the organ asset package, remember that this asset packet is bigger than this air packet asset, this is subset, okay? So, again, here we take the union and consider problems. So, then this uniquely spinological, okay, and in Ken Krospad, in this 2020 paper, we give some discussion on this. Give some discussion on this and this non-uniqueness exactly due to the non-true intersection load aspect. So, roughly, they construct the non-tempered RSA parameters, namely the other SL2 as some action gear, and hence this L packet also non-tempered. And then they construct simple GTP pair in the complement of L packet in the other packet. L packet in the other packet. Okay. And it's conjectured thing that in the L packet of the other packet, they also exist a unique pair. So hence CCU add up, then expect that this is totally for this other package. This GV pair, we call the same true. This is expectation, but this is like the heuristic. Okay. All right, so you can see that. So this inception problem that flows related to downtown by GDP. All right, so you hear some recent results. So, this result is by Atobe and also John Wiggs-Hazard and Law independently at the same time. So, for these two groups, they exist algorithms determine whether Gibbal representation is of other type or not. So, whether any other packet or not. If pi is author type in the packet, then pi is astotile in the packet then this algorithm determines all of the packet containing pi okay so roughly speaking so we construct a complete set of operators on autopy's data so each data will give you a representation it could be zero okay such that if these two data give you a similar representation then they are related by these objects okay All right, so we have some applications. So you are going with us, and I'm trying to write, and I'm trying to understand what you say. Okay. And so what is the algorithm based on? See? The algorithm that you are describing, what are the basis? So you give an representation, you have the L data, and so from the L data, you can determine what is asset. So what do they use in the proof? They use in the group? But how do they get the algorithm is based on what? It's complicated. Using derivatives here. Okay. So we have some applications. So one is so given as a parameter, so we can precise count the number of temperatures inside local package. Potential inside local package and discrop the R data. So, this is very interesting because it's in tempered GTP is done. So, now you move on non-tempered packet. So, you want to see this in the secondary temporary package. And so, we also produce a more similar example such as that volcanic apex and the uniqueness of GDPM manifolds, similar to the example of GDP. So, the second application is this enhanced Shahidi conjecture. So, namely, pipe psi contains a generic Pap psi contains a generic member if and only if the psi is generic. So the classical Shaidi conjecture saying that tampered L packet had generic member. Here is if and only if. Here I this is generic or tamper to determine this xi, this exponent is zero or not. Just the two cases to condition. All right, so the third application is to say pi is of other type, then we give a definition of this Z. Then we give a definition of this z local other parameter for pi. Because pi could lie in several local other packets, and yet there are several local other parameters related to pi, and which one is entitled to be called the local as a parameter. So this question is back to when I was graduated at the University of Minnesota. So whenever I say the local as a parameter repetition, then people are asking me, what do you mean by this? Because there are several. So now there's some answer. I hope it is satisfying. It is satisfying. So, and so we give many representations, theoretical characterization of this path, the percent max pi. And we believe this is a correct definition because, so among all the local other parameters related to pi in this set, so we define like five order. And no matter which order you take, and this max pi would be the best one. Pi would be the best one. It's a maximum. And so, in other words, among all these local parameters, some x pi is the most tempered one. Okay, and you satisfy these conditions. So, first, the pi should be in the packet. And second, if this pi is in the L packet as a type, then this semax pi just. All right, so let's back to this example and discuss these colors. So, these colors exactly show the percentage. Examples show the percent max of the interpretation. For example, for Taiwan, Taiwan lines in three local asset parameters, right? So, Taiwan, the local asset parameter is Possi 2. Okay, so you can see this is the most tempered one compared to other two. And so, you see, pi six, z look after the pi seven, but you see, because the problem is because you have several, yeah, and um. And that's the meaning. And during the multiplication, this max pi, this conjecture, you can call it a chloro ordering conjecture. So it says for given conductive double group G, so assume logo-packet theory. Then for any pipe in this packet, so this is this is order. So, this is this is ordering, okay? This is called in the organ variety. So, I'm related to this talk this morning. So, so roughly speaking, you given a pie, given a parameter, you consider the network character. So, then there's some GY space and there's some reduction groups to act on threat space, and they compose some packed orbits. Each orbit will give you an error parameter. So, and among So, and among all these L parameters, you can define some ordering just using the plural ordering of obvious. So, there's some partial order. Yeah, so and this conjecture says that if pi is in pipe psi, then this phi pi is bigger or equal than pipe psi. Okay, so in other words, it packeted, right? It's a packet. There are several conditions, and each has one L parameter. So, all of these would be greater than 5 psi. 5 pi would be the lowest one. Okay. And so, how we show this is we conjecture this Possibs is, you see, no matter which Pasai, Possum X pi, that's the biggest one. Yeah. And we will show John with Hesterton law and John. So we show this conjecture for these two groups. And we exactly using the SMX pipe property. So now that you see given the package. So now that you see given the package, then the five side is the smallest parameter occur, right? So now there are several error parameters bigger than it could be in the package. So now the question is, what are sufficient conditions for a local error parameter showing up in a packet? So this is not known and I expect to be vertical. Okay, and so you see, previously we mentioned that we improved the in-house ID conjecture for those two groups, and there are some applications of it. And there is some application of it. So, there is a general, in general, there is a conjecture like this. So, you say pi is an osmorphin in this free spectrum. If there is a finite place such that pi v0 is generic, then almost all places is generic. Okay, so this is without assuming a Romanian conjecture. If you assume a Romanian conjecture G L, so this will be tempered almost of this. And so, using the So, using the proof in Hazrati conjecture, we show that this conjecture is true for these two groups. So, roughly speaking, you see this pi has a global as a parameter for psi, and then you have a local component, psi d. And this genericity will tell you the information of this psi d which reflects the property of the psi at data places. That's roughly speaking. Roughly speaking, the RSL SL2. Roughly speaking, the other SL2 should activate it globally. All right, so this is another question related to local packets. So given local package, could they contain each other or not? So overarching local field, so one can find examples given by Baba Spitzba and Madbawinar over C, so at one time contain another one. Okay. However, Okay, however, for not being the configuration, we don't expect that. So, you have their destroyed. Okay, you don't expect the local species to contain each other in here. So, this is very interesting because we're going to based on the work of author, so each local packet, so using the repetition, you can come up with a stable distribution that compatible with the lifting. Okay, so now the question is: given a packet, then how many ways you can construct this? How many ways you can construct this stable distribution compatible with the lift? It seems just one way because they only contain. All right, so now let's switch the gear and talk about VFRAN set. And so let's recall this. Shining contain tempered local packet, I do not remember. So tempered local packet is exactly local air packet. So the enhanced one thing that is this if and only if. And then jump conjecture is a generalization of Chinese conjecture from tempered Laplace packet to non-tempered Lawrence, to general Laplace packet. U this is two called WiFron set, which are invariant to matter size or conditions. So a brief introduction to WiFron set is you consider the cat expansion. And the interesting part is in the category expansion, there is involve this all these new point orbits. The original new point orbits. These are risk-newpon orbits. And you collect them, non-zero, let me relate to pi. You consider geometric orbits, namely over the f-bar. And you take the maximum one. And this is called Wayfound set. So Wyphon set are code related to the so-called best of rejected models. So sometimes it could relate to GDP problems. Okay, that's why we consider them part of the reason. So let's make a precise jump conjecture. So given the parameter, Given the parameter, then the following codes. So, for any pi in this packet, the reference set orbits are bounded by this one. This opossi is orbits corresponding to pi just restrict to the other SO2. And this will be orbits in the dual group. Okay, then you apply this power show. You get the orbits on the group itself. And in other words, this will give you upper bound for any plan. And second, we'll see that the upper bound should be non-trivial. Example one it should be non-trivial, okay. And this conjecture can be made for any quasi-specific groups and also their pure uniforms, okay. And for interforms, we don't, and the second part may have an issue. Yeah, so uh, so with Shahidi, we partially study junk conjecture, uh, local junk. By the way, so there is a local version of this conjecture and the John Lewis junk. And so this first part can be. So, this first part can be proved for all classic groups. All right. So, recently, Wasaboti and Sibertaro, Madison Brown, Okada, we proved a special cases of gem conductor for unipotent intertensions. And joined with Low and Shahidi, so we give a description of the fiber of this DBV map. And using this, we prove this so-called weak local potentially conjecture of supertar messing brown colour. What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Sorry. What do you mean by the weak? So just to say we construct the unipode, so the unique representations, the conjecture is a destroyed union of local factors. Union difference on the dual k and the comp. Yeah, it's not a local packet, it's a union. It's the union. And then we have a conjectural description of which packets and how to. Yes. And how to parametrize the special impact in terms of the the two SL2s? Yes, yes. And you prove that? Yeah, we proved the first three classicals. And you can explain what happened with this two SL2 and how they over Dohani pre-free circulus. You can do that. We can talk. Can we talk later? So we can send it. So I want to see that. Sure, sure. So, I want to say that. Sure, sure, yeah. So, uh, recently our Kada Grevich has an independent process, okay. All right, so, uh, okay, so motivated by the work of Superman Broakada, so uh, uh, Super Taro came and independently joined with Hazelton, Low, and Shahidi. So, uh, we made this conjecture. This out-round conjecture we transact. So, uh, G is connected with group, but then for any pi, the we transact. For any pi, the wind function is bounded by this one. So, this is the L parameter of the dual pi. Okay. And this L parameter, you restrict to the linear CO2, you get obvious. You take PBV. Okay. So here is theorem. So both the upper bound conjecture and the junk conjecture part one can be reduced to any discrete representations. Okay. And these two conjectures, they are equivalent. You see, although this one is for the admissible due. Okay. This one is. But admissible do okay. This one is the other do, and they are equivalent because they both can reduce any discrete. So, independently, say with Hurricane, they make this conjecture and they also do the reduction for any tempered, just meaning that do is tempered. So, they verify this conjecture, they have a conjecture for depth zero to counterputations. And so, so you see, the Said conjecture is for temporary package, then jump conjecture is for local. Packet then jump conjecture is for local as a packet, right? So here's one of generalized shiny conjecture to a arbitrary local packet, okay? So, and for this algorithmic conjecture, there exists many examples showing that it may not be sharp, this one, but we expect sharpness when we consider repetition in packets, okay? So, this is a Chinese conjecture from local packets. This is one version of a general Chinese conjecture. So, if you consider the L packet, okay, so you see for each one, you have a upper bound and One you have a upper bound, and then you take it back. This will be the bound for the packet, and uh, this is the upper bound. For the quite unfortunate, this one may not be singleton. So it's bounded by some orbits, and each orbit here can be achieved. So that's a difficulty. This may not be singleton. All right. So this makes it very hard to study. So we provide some remedies. The first one would be, the first one would be, so we consider it's One would be so we consider it's this L packet just not big enough. We consider some enlargement, namely the ABE packet, so which also mentioned in Latino's talk. So this ABE packet, roughly speaking, this HL package, you add some representation in your logic. So for this ABE package, there is bounded by one approval. And this fat hat is defined by PSSK in 1975. KSSK in 1975, and it's not expect to be non-trivial. AB package is not coming in defined by other organ and are not immediate by Tanya, Theory, Mosari, Morrisack, and then Sui. So this part one, this upper bound part actually can also be reduced to any discrete repetitions and the equivalent to the other two repentations, to two other conjectures, upper bound conjecture and junk conjecture part one. Okay, they're all equivalent. They're all equivalent. The second remedy is you consider the dual of local local L packet. All right. Then you will see that because you see the remote upper bound is considered by five pi hat. So now it's already you are considered pi head. So the parameter just five. And this will give you unique upper bound. And it shows me now trivial. So why the consider this is this may not be an IR package. Consider this, this may not be an L packet in general, but it still gives a distraught union, disturbing partition what the mist would do. Okay, so um this part one is exactly the upper bound because you see for pi here, pi is here, right? Which means pi two is in pi. So that's exactly the upper bound of conjecture. And joined with low and shahiti, so we uh we have semi-reductions of this part two, this activities. This is work in progress. This is working progress. All right, so that's not. Thank you.
