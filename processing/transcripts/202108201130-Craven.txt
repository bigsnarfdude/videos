I am going to give a brief survey of what's going on in finance info groups in terms of maximal subgroups. And I'm going to focus mostly on exceptional groups, which is where my work has been. But then I will talk a little bit about general groups of Lee type and their structure of their maximum subgroups. In broad terms, I'm mostly focusing on. In broad terms, I'm mostly focusing on this set that, if you aren't familiar with this thing, is often called curly S or C9 or something. They're almost simple groups, the almost simple subgroups. And we'll look at C what's going on in them in general terms and what can be said. So, right, so why do we interest in maximal subgroups? We've heard about them in a couple of different talks. Why are we interested in them? So, particularly about almost simple groups. Particularly about almost simple groups. So, I'm mostly going to be talking about simple groups, but all the results I've done also extend to the almost simple groups. So, why are we interested in things in simple groups with automorphisms on top? So, the O'Nan-Scott theorem, as many people know, says that we've got some understood classes, although there's some issues. I mean, there can be some difficult problems, as we've heard, about understanding things being quickly. Oh, nice. We can have some, there's some. We can have some, there's some serious maths to do with the understood classes. Then there's this, as I think Adam referred to it, as a bin, you throw everything that doesn't fall into one of the classes, and that's almost simple groups. So we already want to understand Maximal Sog groups, almost simple groups, just to understand the Onan-Scott theorem. And then this theorem of Michael Ashbacher and then Scott said that you can understand the Maximal subgroups of any finite group if you're. Subgroups of any finite group, if you can understand the one cohomology of simple modules and the maximal subgroups for almost simple groups, so that means that almost simple groups become of the focus both for the cohomology, which I'm not going to talk about today, and for the maximal subgroups. And then, of course, there's just people who like to study things because they're there. I mean, it's the same reasons people climb mountains. They exist, so we should study them. So, the Mallory opinion. Well, why do you study Maxwell subgroups? Because they're there. So, let's just quickly remind ourselves about symmetric groups because we're going to do all finite simple groups in this, apart from the sporadics. So it's more a characterization than classification. We separate them into intransitive, transitive, imprimative, and imprimitive. I'm just giving broad strokes here, even broader than Tim gave in his talk. Broader than Tim gave in his talk. So intransitive ones are things like Sm cross Sm minus M, then you've got wreath products, and then you've got a primitive group whose soccer is not non-abelian simple, and then an almost simple group. And that sort of broad outline is what's going to happen for the groups of Li-type as well. We're going to have a couple of understood classes that come from some kind of combinatorial or geometric structure, and then miscellaneous stuff at the end. Miscellaneous stuff at the end that just happens by freaks of nature. Sometimes sometimes there are very good reasons why these things exist at the end, and sometimes they just are there. So for finite classical groups, Ashbacha's theorem, which again we've heard over the week, if it acts reducibly, this is some may be compared with intransitive, that it acts alongside the stabilizer of an M-space. I was thinking about. I was thinking about this. The next one, I say that it acts irreducibly, but absolutely irreducibly, I can compare that with imprimitive. I haven't decided whether I should compare like a wreath product structure with imprimitive, but anyway, it could be a geometrically defined subgroup. So the fixed points of an algebraic group. So things like that, including disconnected ones. So wreath products of GLN with symmetric groups, or in here are members of what are traditionally called curly S. So just algebra. Called curly S. So just algebraic groups acting irreducibly. Or it could be the fixed points of an automorphism. So it could be something like a what's called field automorphism or a graph automorphism. So think things like SUM or it could normalize some R subgroup. So this is another bin called extra special type groups. So it could normalize some R subgroup that isn't a P subgroup. So the top line. P subgroup. So the top line parabolic subgroups are normalizers of subgroups in the right characteristic, and these things are ones that normalize subgroups in the wrong characteristic. Or it could be a normal simple group that is not Li-type in characteristic P. The members of curly S that are Li-type in characteristic P are lumped in group three by Steinberg's restriction theorem. So Steinberg's restriction theorem says that every simple module in defining characteristics Simple module in defining characteristic for a group of Li type comes is just a restriction of a module for the algebraic group. That's group of GLN. Then there's some work of Gary Zeitz, I think, that shows that it's not that hard, but you have to do it, that the form drops. And so the subgroups of the classical groups also have this property. Whether for exceptional groups, well, we'll talk about that a bit later. Whether you can have this Whether you can have this dichotomy that you are the fixed point of an algebraic subgroup, or you are almost simple group that is not Lee-type in characteristic P. Not so clear for the exceptional groups. There could be almost simple groups that are Lee-type in characteristic P, but do not come from an algebraic group. This can't occur by Steinberg's restriction theorem in GLN, but that could occur in the exceptional groups. So for final The performance exceptional groups are the theorem of Borovic and Liebeck-Zeitz. They independently and they have slightly different statements, but they're both easily good enough for what I'm going to write here. It could be a parabolic subgroup. It could be a geometric. So when I say a geometrically fine, I'm thinking reductive if you're an algebraic group theorist, because of course parabolic subgroups come from the algebraic group, but they're not reductive groups. It could be the fixed points and automorphisms, so it could be the regroups or twisted E6 or subfield subgroups. So E8 of 2 inside E8 of 4. It could normalize an R subgroup. So this is the equivalent for classical groups of those extra special type groups. It could normalize some cross-characteristic subgroup. It could be a normal simple group. There's a little bit of space on the slide. Little bit of space on the slide because just for exceptional groups, it could be one other thing. I think Adam stated this in his talk: the Borovic subgroup just randomly turns up here. It's the only example. Oh, it's just there. I mean, there's a very good reason why it is there. But yeah, and there's just that one sitting at the end. So it almost looks exactly the same as the classical groups, but then there's this extra bonus subgroup at the end. This extra bonus subgroup at the end, and you don't quite get as much information because, for example, the almost simple group, the classical groups, must act absolutely irreducibly. Here, well, first for E8, for example, there is no minimal module for it to act on, no natural module. It would have to just act on the Lie algebra. And it's far from clear that subspace stabilizers are positive dimensional. And so for GLN, the stabilizer of a subspace is a parabolic. Subspace is a parabolic for E7, the stabilizer of some 17 space on the 56-dimensional module could be anything. There is no reason why it's a positive dimensional subgroup. And in general, it won't be. So now the bin that you've thrown the things into is quite a disorganized bin because they could be sub-space stabilizers in that bin. Whereas in classical groups, that sub-space stabilizers. Classical groups that subspace stabilizers are in the parabolics or in the classical groups, certain reductive groups. So the exotic R local subgroups have all been classified by Cohen-Lieber, Zaxel and Zeitz, and there's some list of them. I'm only including on here the ones that are not coming from positive dimensional. So there are some R local maximal subgroups that are also geometrically defined. So they could be because your group of Li type Group of lead type for small fields has a piece that has an R subgroup. So PSU32, for example. PSU32 has an R subgroup. And so it's an R local subgroup, but it's just a coincidence. If you change the field, it stops being a local subgroup. Or it could be this type D group in E7 that just happens to exist, where it is the normalizer of an R subgroup, but it is a positive dimensional subgroup, and it's always positive dimensionals. Group, and it's always positive dimensions, it's always our local. So, but these are all known. So, if you go back to that statement, the point four classified, point six classified, point three classified, point one clearly classified, point two and point six, point five are left. Geometrically defined subgroups and almost simple groups, right? So, what about geometrically? Right, so what about geometrically defined subgroups? They are ones, so now we need to understand the maximal subgroups of positive dimension in exceptional algebraic groups. And they've been completely classified by a series of papers culminating in a 2004 memoir by Lie Pekkenzeitz. There are maximal parabolics, maximal rank subgroups that come from an algorithm. That thing that we've just seen, 2 squared cross D4 sim3, that thing down the bottom here, 2 squared p omega 8 plus of q for the finite version. For the finite version, an A1, SIM5, or it's one of a short list: E6, E7, and then E8. There's a few more, but still it's fairly short. So that, in some sense, finishes part two. There's one or two issues that we'll see later, but well, there's exactly one issue. But in some sense, the point two. But in some sense, the point two completely done. So we're in good shape. The first four are understood. The last one is understood. All we're left with is almost simple groups. We're in much better shape than we are with classical groups. For classical groups, if we want to understand point two, we'd have to know the dimensions of the irreducible representations of all algebraic groups in all characteristics, which is impossible. So we're in much better shape than we are for the classical groups. Much better shape than we are for the classical groups. What about maximal subgroups of smaller exceptional groups? So these are already known. A series of papers for small rank fires exceptional groups, these are already known. Twisted G2 and G2 were done by Peter Kleinman in 1988. 3D4 was also done by Clydeman and also done in 1988, or at least they both came out in 1988. 1988. Guntamala did twisted F4 in 91 and then F4 E6 and Twisted E6 were completed last year and are on the archive. So I've said see Cohen and Wales wrote a paper on subgroups of F4 and E6 in characteristic zero and did some important constructions. And then Kaimergaard's PhD thesis got most of the way to classifying maximal. Most of the way to classifying maximal subgroups of F4, and Michael Ashbacher's series of five papers got almost all the way to classify the maximal subgroups of E6. There are about a dozen groups missing in F4 and E6 on the two papers, and they're now completely known, up to conjugacy. Okay, so that's what's known, that's what's out on the archive. Known, that's what's out on the archive, or all done. So, old work because it's because it's available. So, that's the introduction. So, from now on, it's things that you can't just get by searching the internet. Right. Maximal subgroups of E7 of Q. No, they're not all known yet. So, at the moment, there are two issues with writing a Issues with writing a paper that says the maximal subgroups of E7 are Q are classified. The first is if there's a subgroup A2.2 in the algebraic group E7. So this is one of these geometrically defined subgroups. So at the moment, I don't believe it's known whether when you take the fixed points, so in the adjoint group of type E7, it's clear you get a PGL3 or a PGU3, depending on which content you class you're in, not two. Constant clustering dot to the graph automorphism is in there, and then the question is whether the graph automorphism lies inside the simple group or whether it lies outside the simple group. Now, I believe the answer is that when p equals five, it's always inside a simple group. And for p greater than five, if q is an odd power of p, then it's outside the simple group. And if q is an even power of p, it's inside the simple group. Now, I know that's true for q and even. Now, I know that's true for Q and even power of P, and I know it's true for P equals 5. And I know that my statement is true for P equals 7, 11, 13, and 17 because I checked it. And at that point, I stopped because no matter how many I checked, there are still infinitely many primes to go. So I thought 7, 11, and 13, and 17 was enough evidence that that's going to be the case. But a computer will not solve, computations will not solve that. You actually have to write down this graph automorphism explicitly. This graph automorphism explicitly. And as far as I know, it hasn't, you can't, it's not clear from the construction in Liebeck and Zeitz whether that too lies in the simply connected E7. Maybe one of those knows the answer to that, in which case that issue goes away. The other issue is not all the members of the almost simple groups are known. There are some possible subgroups left that I can't solve. So there are PSL27. So, there are PSL2789 and 13 in certain characteristics. These, there are potential maximal subgroups that are almost simple groups that I haven't been able to eliminate yet. I don't think that any of them exists. I don't think that any of them are maximal, but my techniques I have, which involve taking an alternating form on the 56-dimensional module, and then module and then taking and then taking the Lie algebra and working out explicitly with by constructing E7 subalgebras of the sp56 Lie algebra. This doesn't work as of yet at least for those four groups. So this is a state of play for E7 of Q. Apart from those four groups and this issue about the automorphism of PGL3 and PGU3. GL3 and PgU3. All maximal subgroups of E7 of Q are classified, and also for the almost simple groups as well. So that's a complete conjectured list, but we still have a little bit of work to do. All right, so that's E7 of Q. So there's one more group left, right? E8 of Q. What can be done for E8 of Q? The situation is much, much worse for E8 of Q. much worse for e8 of q right so for so the problem the the thing is for e7 of q there's a 56 dimensional module which is small ish 56 is i mean if you're if you're if you're working by hand 56 dimensions is quite high but if you're working on a computer 56 dimensions is quite small and you can easily calculate and work out traces and stuff e8 is 248 dimensional and if i were to work out uh lee brackets on that i end up with a 6000 dimensional module I end up with a 6,000-dimensional module or something because it's the exterior square of that 248-dimensional module becomes much, much harder. But the other problem is that there are many, many more modules on 248-dimensional space than there are on 56-dimensional space. And so it's much harder to work because they have lots more composition factors. So I haven't even looked yet at possible maximal subgroups at this issue about whether you can have different This issue about whether you can have defining characteristic maximal subgroups that don't come from algebraic groups. So, a possible maximal PSL27 in E8 of 343. 343 is 7 cubed, by the way, in case you didn't know that. So, how do we know that that doesn't exist? Well, we had that problem even in E7. Problem even in E7 for PSL2.7, I don't know the answer for P equals 7, and for PSL2.8, I don't know the answer for P equals 2. But here, I don't know the answer for PSL2 9, PSL211, 13, 16. I don't know. There's dozens and dozens of groups that we don't know the answer for, for PSL2. And then there's also about, I think, 10 groups of larger rank. Groups of larger rank that we don't know the answer for. Suzuki 8. We don't know that there's no maximal Suzuki 8 in E8 of 4 or E8 of 64 or anything like this. And these are all groups over small fields. They're all characteristics 2 and 3. But there's about, I think there are 10 not SL2 groups that we don't know the answer. We don't know. Know the answer. We don't know that this analog of Steinberg's restriction theorem that all of the maximum, all the irreducible subgroups come from algebraic groups. We don't know this. So that's a really big problem, and that's only a problem. We classify maximum subgroups of E8. But we also don't know anything about the rest of curly S, things that could be a sporadic maximal subgroup. We haven't classified M11s, for example, in E8 in characteristic. For example, in E8, in characteristic 11 or 3. Alternating groups, we don't know any ACE, there's A6s and A7s that we don't know whether they're any maximal ones. And then cross-characteristic Li type. What I can give you is a table of all the known ones. So here's a table of known maximal subgroups. So here are a few. These are the ones that are not P. These are the ones that are not PSL2Q, that are known. The reason that Suzuki 8 has P not divide H is because I haven't, where H is PS is the Suzuki group, is that I don't know the answer when P divides H. It definitely exists and it's definitely maximal, but I don't know the field of definition and I don't know how many classes there are. So that's why that's there. So this is a table of the knowing maximals. This is a table of the known maximals. Since I don't know how many maximal subgroups there are when P is seven, for example, for Suzuki 8, it's not on the list. I suspect the answer is there's one class, but I can't prove it yet. Many of these were previously known. Some of them were previously known over certain finite fields, and some of them were known in general. I'm not claiming that any of the I'm not claiming that any of these are original. What I've mostly done is eliminate some others from this list. So, for example, the Thompson group, well known to be existing inside E8 of 3. I don't think it's ever been written down anywhere that there is no maximal Thompson inside E8 of 9. In theory, that can happen. There is no a priori reason why, if I've made a simple group, the Thompson group inside E8 of 3, why all the conci classes... Why all the conjugacles, the Thompson group, why all the Thompson groups must be conjugates in E8 of 27? A priori, there's no reason why that should be the case at all. Why must all of the classes that exist for some group be defined over the same field? Now, if you're in GLN, this is clear because you just take the field of values of the corresponding character, and that tells you the minimal field into which you can embed the group or C. Field into which you can embed the group. We'll see this in a little bit later. But for exceptional groups, no such statement is true. It's certainly not known. And in fact, there are counterexamples, not many. We'll see that later in a minute. But if you don't know a priori the field of definition, there might be more than one. And so you've got to prove it, not just for E8 of three that there's one class, but for all E8 of three to the end. Now, for Tom. HS3 to the M. Now, for Thompson group, it's rather easy, but for some of these, it's very much not. So, that's the first page, and then the second page is PSLs, PSL2s. So, these are the ones that, so on my contribution here, and bird notation, P61 is the order of P in the unit group of 61. So, that's the order of P modulo 61. So, if I take P and put it inside Z mod 61Z, it's the multiplicative order. And that's needed because of some irrationalities in the characters. So, these were known in characteristic zero, but in characteristic P, what I've in in characteristic dividing these orders is where I've added to the knowledge. Uh, added to the knowledge, but I've only got down as far as 32, and the reason I haven't gone further than 32 is that for 31, there are there's not just the PGL231 that exists because SARE constructed it, there are also potentially lots of others PGL231s or PSL231s, because there are lots and lots of characters that look like they could yield an embedding into E8. Into E8. But because there are lots and lots of possible characters, I had to have to go through each of them, eliminating them, to prove that SERE's construction of a PGL231 is the only construction of a PGL231. In theory, these other characters could yield subgroups. And there's no reason why not. And that's what I mean by there's possibly more than one class when you change the figure. Class when you change the field, so there could be one class over F17 and then two over F17 squared. You don't see that kind of behavior in GL, but there's no reason to not see it for the exceptional groups. Okay, so that's the state of everything for E7 and E8. For E8, we have these partial tables for E7. We'll see the ones coming from characteristic zeros later, but there's But there is complete knowledge conjecturally. So that's what I was going to talk about today. Today, if you have asked me to do it a few months ago, but since then, I've done some more work on what I call a knowledge duality for maximal subgroups, trying to give an understanding and a conceptual background and a conceptual explanation for which groups appear and why in the maximal subgroups. Maximal subgroups. So that's what I want to talk about for the rest of the day. Some of it is very obvious, some of it's well known, some of it's not well known, and some of it's quite new. So it's a mixture of things that are obvious and not at all obvious. That's why it's an interesting subject. I think it's, I'm surprised that it's not all known, but it appears not to be. Right, so let's start with subgroups of GLD and subgroups of GUD. GLD and subgroups of GUD. So it's a completely different part of talk, in the sense that it's still maximal subgroups, but not classification. I want broad brush understandings of maximal subgroups. So if I take an arbitrary finite group and I take a faithful irreducible character, then this yields an embedding into GLDK whenever I have a characteristic different from H, different from anything dividing H. So for which Q. So, for which Q can H be embedded in GLDQ yielding this characteristic character chi? So, this is a well-known problem. It's called the Schur index. And the question is: so, over the rationals, so if you have a, if you have a, if chi has rational character values, then often your group can be embedded in the rationals, but sometimes it can't. But over finite fields, Over finite fields, that's never the case. If your character values are realizable over your field FQ, then your group is always embeddable into GLNQ, GLDQ. So that's what I'm about to say. So if n is the, so this is a well-known statement due to Brouwer, I think it is, that I can realize any group in some cyclotomic field. And the particular cyclotomic And the particular psychotomic field, the nth one, according to the I've denoted it here, that is, can be chosen to be the exponent of the group. So the lowest common multiple, all of the group element orders. And whether H embeds in GLDQ depends only on the congruence of Q modulo N. So this is well known and very standard stuff. Been around for nearly a century, I suspect. But not only can you embed embed uh so you can embed h inside gldq whenever q is congruence and you can work out which which congruences it is because it's based upon whether the character values are in the fixed field under the galois group of uh q of the site the cyclonic field over q so you look at which you look at which galois automorphisms of qzeta n fix your character values and that's the congruences Values, and that's the congruences mod n that work. It's sort of fairly easy. So, yeah, I'll just say this here. So, H embeds in GLDQ if and only if I take the congruence and I take that map, whether it fixes all the character values. So, I'll let the set of such congruences. So, for a fixed H and chi, I'll denote by IN those congruence classes modulo n such that H embeds. Such that H embeds in GLDQ. So this is telling me which prime powers I can realize my group as a subgroup of GLDQ. Right. And then this is just some connection. It's a subgroup of the unit group. It contains one, because any subgroup does. So in particular, if Q is congruent to one mod n, you can always embed it. And then just a fairly easy thing to prove. And then, just a fairly easy thing to prove, it's an exercise, quite easy exercise. Minus one lies in this group, if and only if chi is real. Obviously, because complex conjugation is minus one. If you think about a zeta goes to zeta inverse, so if your character is stabilized under zeta goes to zeta inverse, then that means it's real. And if chi is not real valued, right, so this. Real valued right, so this is the next. This is so the first statement is kind of obvious. The second statement is less obvious, but you can prove it in about a couple of paragraphs. If chi is not real valued, and I take my set i n minus one is not in there. Okay, and then the set of things where it embeds in GUD is minus the set of things Is minus the set of things where it embeds in GLB. So if I know which congruences it embeds in for GLM, I just negate them. And those are the congruences it embeds in for GUN, for GUD. This isn't going to necessarily be all of the congruences mod n, because I n union minus in might not be all of the units. So if you're if I IN could be just one mod 13 and then and then the GU would only be minus one mod 13 and all the others it wouldn't embed in at all. That's quite possible. But it's not just that I've split it into two halves. I n is it does not necessarily have index two inside Z mod NZ. Okay, so this is a null duality. So a null duality for representing So, ENOLA duality for representations is a sort of, it was originally the statement by ENOLA that you could, there's an algorithm, there's a procedure to generate the character table of the general unitary group from the general linear group by replacing Q by minus Q and then messing about a bit. It's not quite just, oh, I'll just put, so I'll take my character table, put minus Q everywhere, and then I'm done. You have to mess about with some roots of unity and you have to. You have to mess about with some roots of unity, and you have to worry a little bit because these character tables don't even have the same number of rows and columns. But there is a procedure that basically involves sending Q to minus Q, and it takes AN to twisted AN. Now, then this was proved by Kawanaka and then generalized to the sort of a more general statement that information about GLN can be changed to information about GUN. For example, the character degrees. For example, the character degrees is much easier than the character table. Let's just say the group order. The group order of GUN is the group order of G L of minus Q. I maybe have to change the sign. So this is a proof that like Shintani descent not just goes from starts off in character theory and then gets used in subgroups. This is again an oliguality started off in character. This is again an oligology started off in character theory and now is being used to see that subgroups also satisfy it. But it doesn't just work for type A. In the case of types B, C, G2, F4, E7E8, there aren't any twisted groups. So in those cases, we would expect that the corresponding set I n, i.e. the corresponding set of values for which you embed in the symplectic. Values for which you embed in the symplectic group to be closed undertaking negatives, i.e., if I is in there, then minus i is in there. Now, for types B and C, this is clear because you embed in SP if and only if you embed in GL over that same field and you stabilize a form. So, yes, I should state that Lustig and Srinivasan also proved a null duality. I can't remember whether Kawanaka did it for sufficiently large Q and Lustig Srinivasan did it for small Q or the other way around. But there was a proof for large Q and there was a proof for all Q. Anyway, so yes. Then Then, so B and C, it's quite clear because you stabilize a form and you lie inside GLN, means you lie inside the form stabilizer over the same field. So that set, apparently that doesn't work, so that set minus one lies in IN if and only if chi is real valued. So if you're in types B or C, chi must be real valued. So minus one is in I n. So minus one is in IN, I n is a subgroup, so minus i is in in whenever i is in i n. So for types B and C, this is the exact statement. I n is closed undertaken negatives. What about exceptional groups? Now we're going to run into a problem that exceptional groups, the corresponding statement to this, the corresponding idea of the sure index is not always one. Just because your character Just because your character is defined over a field does not mean your subgroup has to be conjugate to a subgroup of that exceptional group over the field. So it's not always the case that if you embed in the exceptional group over the algebraic closure and you embed in GLDQ, then you have to embed in the intersection of those two. I believe the first example of this was PSL45. PSL45, which is proved by Cohen Debex Axel Zeitz to embed any 8 of 4, but the 248-dimensional module exists over F2, but it does not embed any 8 of 2. The group orders don't divide. I mean, Lagrange's theorem proves that that doesn't work. So PSL45 embeds in GL248 of 2 and in E8 of 4, but not in their intersection. So this is a sure index question type. So, this is a sure index question type thing. Just because your character is defined over the rationals does not mean your group has to be defined over the rationals. It might have to be defined over an extension field. So for finite fields, assure indexes for the indices for the classical groups are all one. But for the exceptional groups, there can be two. And that's not the only example. They're very rare, but there is an example coming from characteristic zero. They're delete primitive. They're the Li primitive subgroup PSU33 inside E7 of C. Now, PSU33 has a property that any self-dual module for it is realizable over Z. Now, all the simple modules for E7 are self-dual. So all of the representations of E7, their restrictions to PS233, are definable over Z. But it only embeds an E7 of Q when Q is congruent to plus or minus 1 mod 8. Plus or minus one mod eight, so it does not embed any seven of three, but its module is defined over z. So this is not, you don't see this behavior in classical groups. If you're defined over z, then you definitely embed into GLNP. But in the exceptional groups, this is not the case. But there's very, very few examples of these. I believe that this might be the only one of a Li primitive group, except for the ones we don't know for E8. Except for the ones we don't know for E8. Normally, the character the field of values is enough to determine the embedding. But this is a really difficult problem now, because you used to think, oh, well, I can take a guess at my minimal field, just look at the character values. But now we know that's not enough for E7. It's going to get worse than that, but this is so for exceptional groups. Exceptional groups, you can't just take that set in for GLD and then just translate it over. So this is the table for E7 of the groups of the maximal subgroups that come from characteristic zero. So there are other ones that exist only in specific characteristics, but this is a list that exists for all characteristics. And as I said, as I said, the notes. I said the notation qi means a multiplicative order of q modulo i. These are still, they are still, though, congruences mod some integer. The sure index is now two, the corresponding, the sure index using finger quotations is two, but they are still embeddable in some congruencies mod n. Just the same as for GLN, it's just that the congruencies might be different. There are two subgroups on this list: PSL219. Groups on this list, PSL219 and PGL219. The PGL219 is SERE's construction of a PGL2H plus one, where H is a Cochet number in G of C. The PSL219 does not extend to a PGL219 in the adjoint group. It exists for different queue. And it has exactly the same action on the Lie algebra. So, if you were just looking at the Lie algebra of E7, there are two classes of PSL219 that are not conjugate when Q19 is congruent to Q3 mod 2 and Q is plus minus 1 mod 5. There's only one class when Q19 is not congruent to Q3 mod 2 and they have the same action on the linear. And they have the same action on the Lie algebra. They have different actions on the minimal module, but you might only have the Lie algebra to look at. So we're now seeing that that other statement was for GLD, which is that if I take the same action, then all my classes must be defined over the same field, that fails now as well. So there can be two classes with the same action on Lie algebra, but different fields. But different fields of definition. So that's quite inconvenient. But we see a null duality holds again. All of these are congruence conditions where if I replace Q by minus Q, I get the same answer. So the table for E7 of Q looks pretty nice in that respect. So it behaves exactly the same as types B and C. G2 and F4, I have. G2 and F4, I haven't put the tables on, but they behave exactly the same as well. Replacing Q by minus Q gives you the same table. So the only group left, E6. E6 has a twisted version. So the table for epsilon E6 of Q is that. So these are all the corresponding thing. These are all the maximal subgroups. Corresponding thing. These are all the maximal subgroups that come from characteristic zero. The PGL213 is a novelty maximal that only occurs when the graph automorphism is on your almost simple group. So that's so PSL213 is contained inside the G2 subgroup. And then when you add the graph automorphism on top, it swaps two clusters of G2 subgroups, but it normalizes the PSL213. So that pops outside the G2s and becomes a new maximal subgroup. This is why you have to look at almost simple groups rather than just simple groups. If you were just classifying the maximal subgroups as simple groups, you would miss that PGL213. And here we see that if I replace Q by minus Q, I end up with the character table of the other, I end up with the maximal subgroup table of the other group. So an oliguality here is that I can get the character table. That I can get the character table. See, I can also get the character table. I'm so used to a character tables, I just say it. I can get the maximal subgroup table of twisted E6 of Q from the table from the maximal subgroup table of E6 of Q by replacing Q by minus Q. So that's quite nice. So the only group left is type D. So there is a D and there is a twisted D. Now a null of And there is a twisted d. Now, a null or duality for type D is different. So, in type D, for a null or duality, if you're in Dn, if you're in orthogonal groups over twice odd dimensions, then Q might get to minus Q should induce a duality again. But if your orthogonal group is four times a dimension, so it's D2N, then that doesn't work and you don't get a duality between the group and the untwisted and twisted group. Group and the untwisted and twisted group. So we might expect to see something slightly different happen depending on whether the dimension of your orthogonal group is twice odd or twice even. Okay. So for type D, the character must be real. So it's going to embed in either Geo plus or Geo minus. I've got an irreducible character. It has a unique form. So it can only embed in one of them. And it embeds in one of them. In one of them, and it embeds in one of them if and only if it embeds in GLD, and that set in is closed undertaking negatives. But we now want to know which of the two type D groups we want to know which of the two type D groups we embed in. Sorry, one second. I need to talk to my child. Yes. Thank you. Okay, let's have almost a dinner. Okay, if I've almost been in, I'm the Lloyd the video. Sorry about that. Okay, so in type D, we now know we know what set it embeds in. It embeds in some orthogonal group, but we don't know which type. So we want to understand, we want to take those congruences mod n, maybe we'll have to increase n to and then tease apart those congruencies into two new sets. One will give. That one will give me the congruences for plus type, and one will give me the congruences for minus type. And then an older duality would be that one of them is minus the other one. Easy. So if this is true, whichever of geo plus and geo minus contains h depends on q mod some integer m, I will split my im into i plus for those residue classes where h embeds in geo plus and i minus for geo minus. I'm not claiming at this. I'm not claiming at this stage that this is the case. I am saying if it, I will use this notation. It's not clear that such an N would exist. There is no a priori reason why just because you embed in GOD plus or minus, you're embedding one of them with respect to some congruence. And let's just assume we're in the adjoint group, GO plus. So if I take an irreducible real representation. Irreducible real representation, rho, then the symmetric bilinear form associated to it has a matrix of scalar products. And if you know about this stuff, it's all clear. This determinant alpha, so the determinant of the matrix of scalar products is unique up to multiplying by a square. This is because a change of basis matrix basically involves multiplying by the change of basis matrix on one side and its transpose on the other rather than its inverse. And so you and so your determinant. And so you and so your determinant changes from alpha, not to alpha itself, but to alpha times the square. When you change a basis, normally you do alpha on the front and then beta and beta inverse. This time you do alpha and beta beta. So you only get alpha beta squared. So your determinant is no longer fixed. It is now fixed up to a square. And I will define my row to be a root cycle. Rho to be root cyclotomic if the square root of alpha lies in some cyclotomic field. So the determinant alpha definitely lies in the cyclotomic field because my representation can be written over a cyclotomic field. So my representation can be written over a cyclomic field, so my scalar products are over that cyclomic field, so the determinant is over the cyclotomic field, but the square root of the determinant need not. Of the determinant need not. The square root of one plus i is not in a cyclotomic field, as an example. So I'll just call it root cyclotomic if square root of i lies in some cyclotomic field. Examples of these will be integral representations. If your representation is over the rationals, then alpha is a rational number, and its square root is definitely in a cyclotomic field. Why do I want root cyclotomic? Why do I want root cyclotomic? I mean, if you know any class field theory, you'll know why I want root cyclotomic. So if rho is root cyclotomic, then whether the square root lies inside your field, lies inside FQ depends only on the congruence of Q mod some number. So this is one of the basic statements of class field theory, which is that if you have some number alpha and the minimal polynomial is F. And the minimal polynomial is f and the splitting field. So, if you take q adjoined alpha, that's a Galois extension and it has a Belian Galois group, then whether that minimal polynomial of alpha has roots in FQ depends only on the congruence of Q mod some number. It'll be the number of the index of the cyclotomic field. The index of the cyclotomic field that it's defined in. So that's what we're, so that's why I'm interested in cyclotomic. So I want to know whether the determinant is a square. So why do I care? So where are we? So root psychotomic if it lies in some psychotomic field. Now the point is, GO plus and GO minus, I can distinguish them by looking at the discriminants. The discriminant. If the discriminant is a square, then I am usually in geo plus unless q is congruent to three mod four and my dimension is twice odd. But it's the point is it's where it's known as to which, as to what the square root of the discriminant is. So geo plus has the discriminant a square, and geo minus has the discriminant a non-square, except for certain congruences. That is how I can distinguish them apart. I find the discriminant of my matrix. Part. I find the discriminant of my matrix. I look and see whether it has a square root. And if it does, then I'm in geo plus. And if it doesn't, then I'm in geo minus. Unless q is congruent to 3 mod 4 and d is congruent to 2 mod 4. But basically, whether the square root, whether the determinant has a square root is what I want to know. Apparently, right button does not press. So if row maps the gldz. If rho maps to GLDZ, then everything is good because my thing is root cyclotomic. And if and you can prove if D is converted to 2 mod 4, so you're in the case where a null duality might hold, then Q goes to minus Q does indeed swap subgroups of Geo plus and Geo minus. But it doesn't work for 4 divides D, but it wasn't supposed to work for 4 divides D because it doesn't work for the representation theory either. But at least for D congregate to 2 mod 4, if your representations are root cyclotomic, then Q goes to minus. Then q goes to minus q, does what it does on the list of maximal subgroups. In the case of representation of a z, we compute a determinant, removal. So, this is how this is just a formula for how to work it out. If you know the determinant of the z form, you just plug it into this formula and it just tells you which out of plus or minus it embeds in. And as I said, there's a technical point about the plus form not always being a square in a field. And that's why you sometimes have to multiply the congruency. And that's why you sometimes have to multiply the congruences by four. Now, if you have a representation of a z, the determinant is always, if I once I've removed all the squares, an odd positive integer. It's always a positive integer because when you extend the field to R, all of your eigenvalues must be plus one or minus one. Because if you think of the signature of the form, those spaces are invariant submodules. And so, since your representation is irreducible, one of them is zero. Irreducible, one of them is zero. And if all my eigenvalues are minus one and my dimension is even, my determinant is positive. And it's odd because if I take, if I reduce my form mod two, I can't have an odd-dimensional radical because symmetric bilinear forms in even dimension in characteristic two are even dimensional. So I can't have an odd dimensional radical, which means an even number of my eigenvalues must have a power. Number of my eigenvalues must have a power of two in them, and so I add them all up and I get an even power of two, which is a square. So in general, whether a finite subgroup H lies in the lies in the simple group omega is not dependent purely on the congruence mod any integer. So even in these tables in Greyhart, Rennie-Dougal, you will find when you get to omega-12, then whether PSL33.2 embeds in Q 33.2 embeds in Q only if some equation has four roots. So that's why we're looking at adjoint type groups. This is not the first example. There's an example in E6 where PSL28.3 embeds in your simple group if and only if some sextic equation has roots. And it's again has non-abelian GoR group. So we look at adjoint groups only. Oh, David, David, are we here? I'm about to fall asleep. I have to go, Philippe. Sleep, I have to go. Philippe is angry. I have to go have dinner. Okay, are we almost near the end? Hey, you can look at the bottom right. Yeah, okay, you're on. I'm supposed to be chairing this session and I'm okay. Can you make the wave? Okay, two minutes and then we'll finish early, right? I'm supposed to finish eight minutes, but two minutes. No, no, you're over time. I'm not? Yeah, you had 45. Oh, God, I started at half past. Oh god, did I start at half past? You started at half past. God, I was going slowly because I thought I'd oh, I'm terribly sorry. Yeah, that's why that's why I'm that's why I'm that's why I'm interrupting. Okay, right. So I conjecture that all real representations are root cyclatomic. That's the obvious thing to conjecture. And that's true for up to dimension 16. Not true in dimension 56. So in dimension 56, there are representations that are not root cyclatomic. So whichever PhD student has to produce the tables of maximum. Student has to produce the tables of maximal subgregor for O56, will find that you cannot do it because there is no congruence conditions for plus and minus types. So, for some primes, one of them have representations as plus type and minus minus type, for some primes, both have plus type, and for some primes, both have minus type. So, we have to modify the conjecture to the case where we have a non-duality, and then it's known.
