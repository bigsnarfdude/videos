from the University of Vienna, and he will speak about constructible functions for convergent sequences of surfaces. Please. So I would like to thank the organizers for making this nice event. I would like to thank all the audience for your interest in my talk. Smenaliesker has just given a wonderful talk about his recent Talk about his recent conjectures on the behavior of intrinsic volumes of Riemannian manifolds under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence with lower curvature bound. And I will be speaking about our joint work with Simon Alevsky and Michael Katz, where we considered some of his conjectures in details in a very, very simple in the toy case when our When our manifolds are just closed surfaces. So, of course, after Simon's talk, I won't be speaking much about motivation and background because Simone has just presented it. So, I just make a very quick recap of those parts of his construction which are important for my talk. So, assume that we have a sequence of n-dimensional compact Alexander spaces with curvature uniformly bounded below. With curvature uniformly bounded below, convergent in the Gromo-Hosdorf sense to a compact Alexandrov space X. So, here for the conjecture that I'm speaking about, we conjecturally can assume that it should be working for not necessarily for smooth Riemannian spaces, but maybe more generally for compact Alexander spaces. So, alright, so from the definition of the Grown-Hausdorff convergence, for each disjoint pair, Xi. This joint pair x, i, and x, we can choose a metric, extending the original matrix on them such that the Hausdorff distance in our pair tends to zero. Okay, then I define such sets which I will be calling pseudo-balls for my talk, for the scope of my talk. So for each point in our limits and space, for each. Limits and space for each point in X, I just define metric balls with respect to this extended metric and intersect it with Xi. So it's important to highlight that while here the center is in the limiting space, but this set, this pseudo ball, belongs to Xi. And here is the conjecture, which is the central conjecture for my talk, which might be seeming a little bit Um, might be seeming a little bit cumbersome. So, there are a lot of quantifiers, a lot of quantifiers. So, let's pass through the statement. It says that up to some sub-sequence, for every point and every sequence of matrix satisfying these conditions, there exists delta zero dependent on x small, such that for any two deltas smaller than delta zero, starting from some number, if we consider. If we consider two such pseudoboles, one is included in another, so there is a natural pullback map induced by the inclusion in cohomologies. The statement is that the dimension of this image stabilizes, that it stabilizes with respect to i and deltas. And the dimension of this image should be weakly independent on the choice of our sequence of metrics. Okay. Okay, so this is the central conjecture for my talk. I just give maybe a few seconds to look at the statement because there are too many quantifiers. All right, so I'm going once again. Sorry. Can you say again what you mean by weekly independent? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. So the Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. So that's just my next statement to recall what is weakly independent here. So more or less independent. So independent in which sense? So there might be another sequence of metrics with the same properties. And if we know that those dimensions stabilize for one sequence, the statement, the claim is that for any other sequence, they also should be stabilizing for the same sub-sequence of Xi up to isometry of our limiting space. So it only might happen that So it only might happen that like we chose another sequence so that our limiting space turned out to be acted by its inner geometry. So this is what I mean here by weekly independent. Okay, and so as Vitaly said during Simone's talk, so you're saying that actually this map should be an isomorphism, but we Should be an isomorphism, but we were expecting that actually the matrix can be slightly distorted. So, even for large eye, the matrix can be slightly distorted. So, they almost stabilize. So, that those pseudoballs, they might be almost stabilizing to some homotopy type, but up to some form, but always up to some form. But this form can be excluded if we look at such pullback map. And such pullback map. So, for instance, we have that H0 is identically one, but I think that those metrics can be always chosen in a little bit distorted way, that those pseudoboles, they are not connected. They are not connected, but they are connected up to some form. So, it is an exercise to show that H0 is identical. To show that H0 is identically one, but I don't really think that it is evident. Yes? Yes, sorry. Yeah, what I was saying is right. What I was claiming should be true for actual balls, not for pseudoballs. Pseudoballs, yeah, maybe a little bit. So this is a tricky thing, actually. So they are centered at points of X, but we consider only their intersections with the capital. sections so what i want to say if you lift points x to xi and then take delta balls at xi then it will stabilize yeah yeah so so that's how we can prove several things that's how we can prove that each zero is identically one or that's how we can prove that in the non-collapse case uh nothing really happens yes but but i think that uh in general the behavior can be more complicated so in general we can expect yeah well but if perhaps it's better But perhaps it's better to take both rather than. They tend to be stabilizing, but they tend to be stabilizing always up to some form, always up to some form, always up to some accidental holes. And in order to exclude those accidental holes, we are using this construction, we are using this pullback map. So I think that we even cannot expect that they are always connected. So they are connected in turn up to some form. So I think that this statement is not internal. That this statement is not entirely evident. But anyway, that's an easy exercise. Okay, so I would like to remember, I would like to remind a few more facts that we have. So in 90s, Relyman and Petrunian developed very deep structural statements about compact Alexander spaces. So they showed that Alexander spaces admit canonical external stratification into finitely many strata, which are connected topological. Which are connected topological manifolds. So, of course, in the scope of my talk, I won't be speaking about what is extremostation, but here, to the purpose of these conjectures, it is conjectured that these functions should be constant on the extremal strata. And by some extension of Perelman stability theorem due to Vitaly Kapovich, so one can quite easily conclude that the construction indeed works in the no-collapse case. Indeed, it works in the no-collapse case. So, when the Hausdorff dimension of the limiting space is n. But in this case, just nothing interesting happened. So, those functions are just homologies of the point. All right. So, this is what I wanted to recall about the general case. And now I turn to the case of surfaces. So, we already know that in the null collapse case, nothing interesting is happening. So, when we would like to study this construction in detail. Would like to study this construction in detail for the case of surfaces, we actually need to study only the case of collapse. And so, this is a very simple case, very simple scenario, because we know that the host of dimension of the limiting space should be integer. So, in the case of collapse, it is either zero or one. And all Alexander spaces like this are points, circles, and segments. Okay, so first of all, I would like to recall just very folklore. Recall just very foreclosure facts about what can happen for the collapse of surfaces. So it is known that if a sequence of closed surfaces with curvature bounded below collapses, then all but finite Riemannia have a non-negative Euler characteristic, actually. Yeah, so that's a small mistake. So they have a non-negative Euler characteristic. So in particular, there are just four possible topological. There are just four possible topological types in the sequence. Those are spheres, two-dimensional tori, real projective planes, and plane bottles. And we are passing to a sub-sequence which have the same topological type. And I quickly recall, in the case when the limiting space is point, just everything is trivial, just all those pseudo doubles for large enough i becomes become surfaces themselves. So of course, everything stabilizes. Of course, everything stabilizes, and so we need to consider only the case when the dimension of the limiting space is one. I just quickly recall what can collapse to what? A sequence of two-dimensional spheres can collapse only to a segment. A sequence of real projective planes can also collapse only to a segment. A sequence of two-dimensional terrai can collapse only to a circle. That's more or less a foiler result recently written down independently by Michael Katz and Sergio Zamora. And the sequence of plane battles. And the sequence of plane battles can collapse both to a segment or to a circle. And so, here is our statement. So, basically, what we are fighting for here, what we are fighting for are only functions H1. So, only functions H1, because all higher functions are zero by dimensional reasons. Because here, if we have the dimension of the limited space equal to one, then it means that for small. Means that for small enough balls and large enough eye, those sielder balls are homotopically equivalent to surfaces with boundary. The surfaces with boundary, that's why already starting from two, all such functions are zero. So the only thing that we are speaking about now are h1. And all right, so if you have a sequence of spheres collapsing to a segment, then we have that this h1 function. Have that this H1 function is one in the interior and zero on the boundary. For real projective planes collapsing to a segment, we have that these functions are once again one in the interior, zero at one boundary point, and one at another boundary point. For the collapse of tori to circle, those functions are identically one. And for collapse of client battles to segment either to a segment or a circle, they are also. Either to a segment or a circle, they are also identically one. Okay, so this might be looking like a pretty trivial statement. So, indeed, it is a very toy case where basically we don't have to think anything about complications of collapse. So, there are no complications with collapse. Everything is quite clear, but still, in order to obtain those results, we need to use quite heavy machinery. And our paper about it is about 50 pages long. So, I don't know how. So, I don't know how trivial is it. Okay, what we can see from this, we can see that we can, by knowing the limiting space and our nearby cycle functions, by what is called integration with respect to the Euler characteristic, we can read back the Euler characteristic of surfaces in our sub-sequence. So this can. So, this confirms in this extremely simple case the conjecture of simul. Okay, now I would like to speak a little bit about proof ideas. So, there are two main proof ideas on which everything is based. So, the main idea is the following. So, basically, this is the structure of all the. The structure of all the proofs in all cases. So, for every point in our limiting space, we define some family of nested sets, some family of nested sets for point and for i, we define some family of nested sets in xi parameterized by epsilon with the following properties. The first property is the squeezing property. So, we would like that every two pseudo balls can be squeezed by three nested sets of By three nested sets of our family. And we would like to claim that the hamatopic types of those nested sets stabilize for sufficiently small epsilon and sufficiently large I. Then a very easy diagram chase shows that in this case, this image is exactly isomorphic to the homologies of those nested sets. So the whole task is in each case to construct In each case, to construct a family of such nested sets and then extract our information from this. Okay, so we already can see how to show, for instance, that H0 is identically one. We just need to construct connected sets that would be squeezing our pseudo balls. Then we can extract that our H0 is identically one. Or how can we show the no-collapse case? In the no-collapse case, The no-collapse case. In the no-collapse case, a stronger version of Perlman stability theorem says that metric balls, that metric balls inside our convergent sequence become at least contractible. So if they become at least contractible, then this is on the right would be just a homologous of point. That's why in the no-collapse case, we get nothing interesting. Okay, but so the whole proofs are about constructing such nested sets. Such nested sets in each case about which we know this topological information and this quizzing property. So here is the second idea. So the second idea, which is used in several places, is that if we can equip each set xi with two metrics, such that those metrics become arbitrarily uniformly closed as i tends to infinity. And if you know that the functions are well defined for Functions are well defined for one sequence of metric spaces, then they are well defined also for another sequence of metric spaces and just equal to each other. All right, so the obvious application of it, but not the only one, is based on the following falconular fact that all closed Alexander surfaces are smoothable. So they are Gromov-Kausdorf limits of smooth Riemannian matrix with the same curvature bound. Same curvature bound. So, this is probably quite a fancular result, but the only place I know where the argument is written down is the PhD thesis of Dimas Woodsky, where the argument is heavily based on the PhD thesis of Tomarichar. And that's why we can assume in our statement that all our surfaces are just smooth remaining surfaces. Okay, then I start to pass through special cases and I will. Special cases. And I would start from the case of Tarai. From the case of Tarai, because so it seems to be a little bit more generic, a little bit more generic case. So there we use a very strong result, a very strong result due to Yamaguchi, which says to us a lot about the structure of Gromov-Hosdorf clause, smooth Riemannian manifolds. So it says that if So it says that if you have two very close smooth Riemannian manifolds, and very close in the Gromo-Hosdorf sense, then under some mild conditions on their curvature injectivity radio, we can express this closeness by an almost Riemannian submersion. So there exists a smooth map, which is an almost Riemannian submersion. So that the So that the fibers are very close in the sense of this extended metric to their targets. The fibers are connected manifolds. So Yamaguchi actually gives much more information about those fibers. And of course, this factor of being almost Riemannian submersion tends to zero as epsilon tends to zero. Okay, so this is a very powerful theorem. This is a very powerful theorem which has many implications. So, what does it give to us? From it, we can quite easily extract necessary nested sets, A. So, in the case of Tori collapsing two circles, we can use the Yamaguchi theorem to produce almost Riemannian submersions. And then, as those sets A of epsilon, we can just consider small balls at the same time. Consider small balls at the base and they are pre-images. Then, what we know? It is quite easy to show that indeed those sets satisfy the squeezing property. And of course, they become homotopically equivalent to the fiber of our submersion for small enough epsilon. So, is there a question? There is a question in the chat. The chat, uh, well, but we have a fixed circle, we have just a fixed circle, so here x is fixed, so uh, there is a bound on the injectivity radius only for one space, which is the base for vibration. Yeah, so of course, uh, here in the case of collapse, uh, we do not require uh we don't require any bound on detectivity radius, so Dejectivity radius, so otherwise, of course, this theorem would not be applicable in such type of consideration. All right, so if we are in the setting where the Yamaguchi theorem is applicable and we can somehow show that for a subsequence our fibers in this vibration stabilize, then we know that our functions are well defined for this subsequence. Okay. For this subsequence. Okay, so in general, I don't know how to show this in a more general setting, but here for our case, for the case of Tori collapse into a circle, so everything is pretty easy. Everything is pretty easy as the fibers are just circles. So that's how we establish the case of Tori. Next, so are there any questions up to now? Know all right, so uh, the next case is the case of spheres. There, we use uh the well-known theorem of Lexandrov, which says that every Alexandrov sphere with curvature bounded below by minus one can be isometrically realized as a closed convex surface in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. And it is possible that this realization degenerates to the double cover of a convex two-dimensional set. Of a convex two-dimensional set. So, here we can use Alexandrov theorem to realize isometrically all members of our sub-sequence as closed convex surface. We can assume for simplicity that they are smooth in order to avoid degenerations, in order to avoid speaking of the double covers. And then we can show that if our initial sequence was convergent to a segment. To a segment in the Gromo-Hausdorff sense, then of course the sequence of realizations would be convergent to a segment in the three-dimensional hyperbolic space in the Hausdorff sense. And even more, we can prove that in this case, the extrinsic matrix of those surfaces become uniformly close to their intrinsic matrix. So we can use the second idea once again and replace here the intrinsic matrix with the extrinsic matrix. Intrinsic matrix with the extrinsic matrix. And here we have a very obvious choice of sets A of epsilon. So we just pick a point in X. So here we consider X also realized in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. So it's a segment in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. We pick a point there. We just consider two planes orthogonal to the line containing this point. And those slices for large enough i, they cut. of i they cut for an interior point x they cut just an olive out out of our surfaces convergent to x and for boundary point they just cut disks so the homotopic types it's very easy to see that here the homotopic types of those sets stabilize and that's how we settle the case of spheres all right for the case of projectify For the case of projective planes and plane battles, we just consider them as the two equivariant versions of cases of spheres and Tori. So we are using an equivariant version of the Gromo-Kosdorf convergence. We obtain the two equivariant versions of the Alexandrof and the Yamoguchi theorems. So for the Moguchi theorems, it's quite complicated to obtain it in the full power. So for the purposes of this paper, we just Purposes of this paper, we just do it only for the case of circles. And then we just use a bit of metric geometry and diagram chases to show that everything stabilizes well. But this very, so that's what we should expect from this case. All right. So this is more or less everything I wanted to say about proofs. So if we compare our two approaches, our two approaches, Or to approach via the Imaguchi theorem and via the Alexandrov theorem, then I think that it's quite evident that here the use of the Alexandrov theorem seems to be a little bit artificial, a little bit too much related only to this case. And especially, so this is because we know that there is no analog of the Alexandrov theorem in higher dimensions. So, in higher dimensions, just to have a Dimensions, just to have a lower bound on the sectional curvature is not a sufficient condition in order to be able to realize asymmetrically metrics on spheres as convex surfaces and spaces of constant curvature. But I think that it is very interesting here to try to reflect actually what was the meaning, what was the meaning of the use of the Alexandrov theorem and how it can be replaced by something more abstract, maybe working in other situations. Working in other situations, working in other dimensions. So, what is the meaning of convex realizations here? How it actually gives us stabilization of at least some family of nested sets, which we are using to squeeze our pseudo-balls. All right, and of course, so the usage of the Maguchi theorem seems to be much more natural here, and it is a very interesting direction. And it was a very interesting direction of further research to realize how, in higher dimensions, can the Maguchi theorem be used, or versions of the Maguchi theorem be used to further obtain that our functions are well defined. So, there are some similar versions of the Yamaguchi theorem, so partially proven by Yamaguchi himself. And so it is very interesting to understand what are the scopes, the limitations of their applications in different versions of Simon's conjectures. All right, so I think that I can stop here. So thank you very much for your attention. Well, thank you very much for your talk. Are there questions or remarks? Please, Alexander. Please, Alexander. Yeah, hi, thank you very much for the talk. So, what I think you've mentioned them, but I was not quite sure. So, you know the work by Shoi and Yamaguchi about collapsing of three-dimensional spaces. So, there they analyzed rather precisely what happens in this, so more general, much more complicated situation. And so, should not this also suffice to sort of? Suffice to prove I know about this work, but I am not a big expert on this, but hopefully, yes. But still, somehow one needs to prove that in all those situations, so also in three-dimensional case, the fiber stabilizes. So, I am not a good enough expert to say that actually, in all the cases in our considerations, it follows from. In our concentrations, it follows from further Yamaguchi's work that also for three-dimensional collapses, all those fibers are stabilizing. Yes, but this is like the main direction of further research. So if you cannot prove Simon's conjectures, at least about the existence of those nearby cycle functions, then at least we need to treat next cases. And of course, that would be the next obvious case. I also believe what Vitaly said, so that the effects of this stabilization is more or less so, so this should be true in all dimensions by some semi-convexity arguments. But I mean, so what you also state is also that there are these numerical functions which you compute, and then that there is some connections between these intrinsic volumes of the base and Volumes of the bass and music volumes of so and this so for this you should then have quite a lot of cases. So I yeah so maybe three dimensions that would be yeah yes yes of course but that's only the beginning of the work so there are many new cases to consider. We just started with uh the most uh v from the simplest case, from the simplest case when uh uh we can have everything in hand. So Have everything in hand, so where we can focus on the underlying metric geometry, but where everything is, of course, clear about the collapsing. Yes, so basically, here you just want to stabilize the chromology of these syllables. These filler balls. And basically, you say you have these cases where convergence is either to interval or to the circle. Yes, so I agree with Alexander. I mean, this does follow from Shiro Yamaguchi theory, or, well, you can give other arguments, right? I mean, topology. I mean, topology, possible topology that there is, as you described, you can have like the torus converging to a circle or Klein bottle to a circle or an interval or maybe the projective space plane, I mean there are just very few choices that that that can happen. That can happen. So, of course, here everything is completely clear about the limits, what happens with topology, what happens with fibers. So, we wanted just to focus on metric geometry. So, how we can obtain this in the simplest possible cases. So, with hopes that we can proceed in the future with more complicated cases. Complicated cases where there are much more choices with the topology. Okay. No, but this is, of course, the very toy case. So that's the first case that needs to be treated in order to understand that these functions are indeed well defined and that they show something meaningful. Okay, thank you. Are there further questions or remarks? If this is not the case, let's thank the speaker again. And we continue at 11:25 Oaxaca time.
