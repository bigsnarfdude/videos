We have in collaboration with Panos Beggis and Delias Kyricis. And part of what I will talk about was published in this paper of ours from 2019. And there will be some new material that we expect to put on the archive by the end of this week. So let me keep those. Let me give some motivation why we're interested to study such solutions. Wormholes are interesting exotic solutions of general relativity plus matter. And the motivation that we have is the following. We want to understand holography in the presence of multiple boundaries. We know that when we have Lorenzian When we have Lorentzian wormholes, so we are in Lorentzian signature holographically, these geometries correspond to having entanglement between the two boundary KFTs. But it is not known what is the analogous property in the Euclidean case. We'd like to see if there are some universal properties that the holographic 50 duals should possess, as well as to find the microscopic model that can describe sachiomy. Model that can describe such geometries, and even better if we can also see how it can give rise to such geometries. Let me make clear here the distinction. So today we will talk about what is here in green. We will talk about Euclidean and not Lorentz wormholes, so there is no time. And we are interested in macroscopic wormholes, so classical solutions to GR class matter, and not microscopic ones that they can. Microscopic ones that they can form a gas of wormholes and that they govern by alpha parameters. And these two categories, the macroscopic and microscopic wormholes, correspond to having different characteristic scales. We are interested in the case where the length of the wormhole is of order of the length of ADS, which is much bigger than L-Blank. So in the first part of the talk, I will give the bulk perspective where we will study the gravitational solutions. In the second part, In the second part, I will propose some bottom-up QFT models. And in the third part, I will propose some microscopic models that could describe such geometries. And I will finish with a summary and some future directions. So the solutions that we will study are of this form. They have two asymptotic boundaries that they are ADS, and they are connected by a throat. By a throat. Since they are Euclidean, there is no time, we have only space dimensions. And to have such solutions, one needs to give locally negative Euclidean energy to support the throat from collapsing. And this can be done by actions or by including in the action actions or magnetic fluxes, etc. Let me also give some holographic comments or puzzles, if you want. Puzzles, if you want. Since there is no time, we don't have entanglement. And naively, we would expect that the different QFTs that they live at the different boundaries, they don't communicate. So the cross-correlators factorize. But since there is a common bulk from the gravitational point of view, there could be the possibility that there are some interactions between the different QFTs. Between the different QFTs. And moreover, from the holographic dictionary, we know that a bulk gauge symmetry corresponds to a global symmetry at the boundaries. So there are different conserved currents at each boundary, but there is a common Gauss law constraint from the bulk. So we would like to understand these features better. So by in 2004, in a paper, In 2004, in a paper by Mandarcene and Maozi that were studying Euclidean wormholes, it was pointed out that there is the following problem, the factorization problem, where from holography you would expect that the partition function for the dual partition function for the system would correspond to just a direct product of the partition function of the one safety and partition function of the CFT and partition function of the other CFT, but they notice that this is not the case. So there are different proposals for how to resolve this tension. One is that after one sums over all different topologies and takes into account semi-wormholes, wormholes, and other non-perturbative states, then the correlators factorize, then we have Factorized, then we have factorized the partition function. But to test this proposal, one needs to have non-perturbative information. More recently, there were the following proposals based on studies of two-dimensional gravitational theories, such as ZT gravity. That is the following, that the bulk quantum gravity path integral corresponds to an average over QFT. To an average over QFTs. But this proposal is usually worked out in lower dimensions. There is some tension with unitarity and tension with higher dimensional examples, such as the canonical example of the whole graphic duality between n equals four super young mills and the gravitational theory on Egypt 5 crosses 5. This 5 crosses 5. So we will propose a different avenue, which is that we have interactions between the QFTs. But these interactions, they have subtle properties. And especially we see that they should be soft, at the cross-correlators, they should be soft in the UV. So our proposal will be that the partition function should have the following form where we have Following form, where we have the product between the partition functions of the boundary QFTs coupled with a weighting factor and the summing over a particular sector. And what we mean by sector, it will become clear later on during this talk. So now we'll start with describing the gravitational part of our work. So we studied So we studied the Euclidean solution with two asymptotic ADS boundary, and specifically we studied the three following examples. We studied Euclidean ADS2, that is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton, where the throat is supported by the flux of the gauge field. We studied three-dimensional solutions to the Einstein-Dilaton theory with Iran. Einstein dilaton theory with a running dilaton in the constant potential. And this they have hyperbolic slicing that they that this hyperbolic slicing provides the negative Euclidean energy to support the throat. And also we studied four-dimensional solutions with spherical slices in the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory where the throat is supported by the non-abelian Gates field. There are many more such There are many more such solutions. And the recent paper where also the stability of such solutions was studied was by Maro Fran Santos, where they showed that the subset of such solutions are perturbatively stable. So now we have the solutions. We want to study scalar correlators. To study correlators for boundary operators, we need to study Boundary operators, we need to study a second-order differential equation, which is the Bulgar fluctuation equation. Since we have two boundaries where the solution can potentially diverge or become constant, we have extra freedom that provides for two types of correlation functions. The one type, which is what we usually have in holography with a single boundary, is to have insertion of operators at the same boundary. And this is what we call O101. And this is what we call O1O1 and O2O2, depending if we have insertions at the CFT1 or at the CFT2. And but here we also have an extra correlator that we can study that is to have insertion of one operator at the one boundary and the other at the other. And this is what we call cross-correlators. In the case of the Euclidean ADIS2, we can compute the correlators analytically. In the other cases, we have In the other cases, we have numerical results. So, here we have the plots of the correlators as functions of momenta. This first plot is the case where we have insertions of operators at the single boundary. We notice that they have similar behavior in the UV as when there is only one boundary, which is that we have parallel divergence. And this is the plot, and they saturate in the IR to constant positive. In the IR to a constant positive value. And here we have the plot for the cross-correlator as a function of the momentum, where we see that it goes to zero at the UV and has a finite maximum in the IR. In position space for the Euclidean EDIS2, the correlator with these sessions at the same boundary has this functional form. And in the case, the cross-correlator has this functional graph. Correlator has this functional form where since it's one over cos 2 delta plus, we see that there are no short distance singularities for this cross-correlator. The qualitative behavior of the correlators is the same for all type of solutions, so it's irrespective of dimensions and matter content of the theory. So we have this universal property that we'll try to reproduce from the QFT side later on. Later on, we also studied non-local observables such as Wilson loops. We inserted one loop at one boundary. Here the disk slices are three spheres and the Wilson loop is a circle that sits on this three. We notice that the larger the loop, the further in the bulk we can probe. But we can never pass from the middle of the throat. Here we have plotted the regularized action of the URL minimal string, an abugoto string, as a function of a parameter t star, which takes values from zero to pi and governs the boundary loop size. And the different colors correspond to different races of area. To different ratios of L throat over L A D S. We notice that for large loops, when this star goes to pi, the action scales approximately linearly with this star. And this scaling is an aerial law behavior. If we had one boundary, this area law is indicative of IR confining behavior, only in the case where we take the limit where the volume of the streets becomes infinite. But here we have two asymptotic. Here we have two asymptotic boundaries, so two spheres, so it maybe have a different interpretation. We also studied loop-loop correlators, where we have inserted one loop at one boundary and another in the other. In the regime where we have large Wilson loops, the leading contribution originates from a single surface that connects the two loops and has the topology of a cylinder. Have the topology of a cylinder. As we shrink the boundary loop, we find that the leading configuration is the one that we have to disconnect the loops that they interact by exchange of perturbative bulk modes. So larger loops, they can probe the IR properties, and we see that we have strong IR cross-crapping. Now we will move on to propose some bottom-up gifting models. Some bottom-up shifting models. Let me stress here that, as we know, for transversible Lorentzian wormholes to provide for negative energy, we have to couple the two boundary CFTs by double trace deformation. This was shown by Gauss, Jaffares, and Wall. And this interaction term is of this form, that is a local interaction term. But in the Euclidean case, we saw that. In the Euclidean case, we saw that the cross-interactions are softer at shorter distances and they increase and become strong in the IR. And the two theories interact mildly and the mixed correlators do not have short-distance singularities. So it is not possible to have, to reproduce this behavior by introducing local interaction terms. So our initial proposal, our initial bottom-up proposal, is the following. We said, okay, let's take two Euclidean theories as well. Take two Euclidean theories S1 and S2 with local operators O1 in the theory one and O2 at the theory two, and introduce an effective non-local cross-interaction of this form, where this function f should be such that it reproduces the features of the correlators that we found from the gravity computation. A very simple example that has these features is to couple Is to couple two three massive scalar theories by such a term. This is in the momentum space. The correlators exhibit the desired universal properties of Wormholt correlators. And if we go to the diagonal basis, one can show that the propagators are positive definite in momentum space when m squared lambda squared, where lambda is cut off, is bigger than one. Is bigger than one. And also, if we forget transform to the position space, we find that additionally, when lambda squared is bigger equal to m squared plus two, then the correlator satisfy reflection positivity. Nevertheless, we cannot resolve the non-local interaction by integrating in a d-dimensional field because then the propagator is not positive definite. So, this is not a very So, this is not a very good model. So, we wanted to improve on that. And from now on, what I discussed up to now is in our paper from 2019. What I will discuss from now is it will be in our new paper. So, based on the following proposal by Van Ramstong, the sound rites construction, we'll try to build some models. Some models. So, this sounds construction is the following. Imagine that we have two D-dimensional holographic boundary GFTs, that they are coupled through a D plus one-dimensional intermediate message theory that is non-gravitational. The gravitational development construction is D plus two-dimensional. We want to study the following regime where the central charge of the mesenger theory is much smaller. The messenger theory is much smaller than the central charge of the big QFTs. And in this paper by Ramstong, it was argued that the system should flow to a gap confining theory in VIR. And the hope is that the dual bulk gravity can localize on D plus 1 dimensional end of the world brains that bend and connect in the IR. In the final part of the talk, where I will show the microscopic models, we will So, the microscopic models will take the extreme limit where the messenger theory is a topological theory. But now I will give you a toy example that is of this Sandrich form. Imagine that we have a simple model where we have massive free theories S1 and S2. These are the BQFTs, and they are separated by an interval L in an X. interval L in an extra dimension that we call Y. And then there is the D plus one dimensional messenger theory that is a free scalar theory. And the interaction comes from these couplings between the interactions between the boundary theory comes with these couplings with the messenger theory. If we integrate out the messenger field and go to the momentum space and to the diagonal basis, the action takes this form. Action takes this form where d plus d minus are the inverse propagators. And here we have the following possibilities. What we symbolize with d plus minus are inverse propagators where the messenger field can propagate along the whole infinite extra dimension. And what we symbolize with d plus minus with an index i is when the messenger can propagate the message. Can propagate the messenger field, can propagate only at a finite distance. So, this to let me discuss the properties that this model has. Again, there is a regime of parameters for which the propagators, both in the case that the messenger propagates in the whole extra dimension or only at the interval L. At the interval L are well defined and admit the Callen-Lehmann spectral representation with positive weight. So they satisfy reflection positivity. And also all the composite operators have appropriately UV soft cross-correlators. Moreover, we were able to show that even if the PQFTs have arbitrarily self-interactions, the above properties still hold. Hold. So, since these are KFE theories, we would like also to see if they have a meaningful Lorentzian continuation. There are different possibilities. One is to analytically continue one of the boundary directions. This is only well defined in the case that the message propagates only at a finite distance. Distance and because, in the case that the messenger can propagate to the whole extra direction, there are transcendental branch cuts. There is also another possibility that we can analytically continue the messenger direction y. In this case, the boundary theories remain Euclidean. In this, when we want to analytically continue the When we want to analytically continue the messenger direction, this is only sensible in the case that the messenger can propagate to the whole infinite extra dimension. Only in this case, the Euclidean propagator is reflection positive. In the case of the interval, the propagators are not reflection positive. These are all bottom-up constructions. We would like also to have a microscopic description. A microscopic description. So, in the following, I will propose some microscopic models that are of the Sandrich type. So, we'll start with what we call 2D, 1D model. We take a two-dimensional generalized Young-Mill that has coordinates tau and Z, and we couple it to two one-dimensional UN matrix quantum mechanics theories that are at the end points of the interval along the. points of the interval along the direction z plus minus distance l the action of the generalized young mills is this where b is a zero form field and f is a two form and is the field strength of the gauge field a and the component a tau of the bulk gauge field at the endpoints we symbolize it as a a tau one two as a function of tau and is the restriction of the two-dimensional And is the restriction of the two-dimensional gates field on the two boundaries. And this restricted gates field is the gates field that shows up at the matrix quantum mechanics theories that live on the two boundaries. This is the action for the matrix quantum mechanics theories where M12 are time-dependent Hermitian U and N cross N matrices. Matrices and dτ is the covariant derivative with respect to this Gates field. If we take the potential for the B field to be B squared, we have the 2D Young mills. And to study thermal partition function, we place our system on a cylinder. So the partition function, it has this form. It has this form, which is the form that I argued in the beginning of the talk, where Zm is the partition function of the matrix quantum mechanics theories at its boundary, beta 1, 2 are the sizes of the circles for the theory 1 and theory 2 at the boundaries, and R is the UN representation, and CR2 and CR1 are its CASIMERs. So we see that the So we see that the sectors that we said in the beginning in this example are the summation of the representation R. So the systems are coupled by carrying common representations. We can also propose the following model that is a variation of the previous that allows for liberation of the messenger from the matrix quantum mechanics. The matrix quantum mechanics Jates group. So we can couple the matrix quantum mechanics at the boundaries with 2D Young-Mills by introducing bifundamental fields psi, AI and one, two has to do with the one boundary in the other. And these five fundamental fields are coupled to the two dimensional Young-Mills Gates field A alpha beta. Field alphabeta. And now the Latin indices i run from 1 to n1 or n2, and they are associated to the gauge group u n1,2. And the Greek indices alpha run from 1 to little n, and they are associated to the Balka gauge group UN. In this case, the partition function is of this form, and it's And it's quite similar to the previous slides, but now we have R symbolized the representation of the gauge group UN, while R1 and R2 are the representations of the gauge group UN1 and UN2. And the representation R3 is determined by the fusion rules for the tensor product of UN1 cross UN and UN2 cross-un. And this And these symbols C are the little wood-richerson coefficients that they come from the fusion of characters. This model allows to take different limits, so to study different potential geometries. So in the case that the little n is much smaller than n capital 1,2, we generically have a very small deformation. Have a very small deformation of the two decoupled matrix quantum mechanics systems, and the dual geometries are almost factorized but can possibly be connected by quantum microscopic warm holes. In the case that the little n is of the same order of n1 and n2, then the leading saddle is very different from that of two independent matrix quantum mechanics. So, let me give some comments about the potential. Some comments about the potential dual geometry. We know that the singlet sector of matrix quantum mechanics, when we have one matrix quantum mechanics and we take the double scaling limit, is due to the two-dimensional linear dilatant background of the SQL School 1 UV string theory. In this case, we have one asymptotic region of space. But if one allows for non-trivial representations for this Trivial representations for this matrix quantum mechanics model that they have few boxes in their U diagrams. From the U-field point of view, they correspond to adding long strings. If these representations are large, they can deform the background and could potentially lead to the creation of black holes. So in the examples that I mentioned before, we took the large representation limit and studied the saddle point equations in order to find the corresponding In order to find the corresponding geometry, this is technically difficult and it is very hard to read off the dual geometry, so we don't yet have a bulk reconstruction technique to do this. However, we are able to prove the existence of different saddles, some of which we expect to correspond to disconnected and other to connected geometries. And it would be interesting to study possible phase transition between the two. We could also study any We could also study endpoint cross-correlators. They are of this form where the indices I1 refer to matrix quantum mechanic theory one and I2 to the matrix quantum mechanic theory two. And though are operators of the theory one and though tilde of the theory two. This correlator generically only depends on separate separately on the differences between the Euclidean Between the Euclidean times of the theory one and the theory of two, and we don't have mixing of indices one, two, and tilde with non-tilde operators. Corros communication can arise at Lidling Saddle Point at the Little Saddle point level when we take both n1 to a little n to go to infinity. When we have n1 to go to infinity, a little n is, but a little n is finite, then the little cell. Is finite, then the little cell is factorized and there is a sub-leading cross-communication from very long thin partitions with ON1 and ON2 boxes. And moreover, the two-point cross-correlator of simple traces of matrices M1 and 2 are simply constants. So we don't have, the cross-correlator doesn't have UV singularities. We can play the same game for high-dimensional examples. For high-dimensional example. For example, consider a sanded space-time with the topology Gm, which is imagine that you have a manifold S cross-M interval I. The two boundary holographic QFTs live at the interval of the points, let's call them S1 minus S2, and are coupled by a topological quantum theory that lives in them that does not have local propagating degrees of freedom. Of freedom. A two-dimensional example is when we take two BCFTs that are coupled through a topological field theory like Edge and Simon's theory that lives in three dimensions. And the partition in this case is as the one for the case of matrix quantum mechanics and the general form that we proposed in the beginning, where again S has to do with representations and the cross-correlators. And the cross-correlators again are soft in the UV. A possible three-dimensional example could be to take a messenger theory in D equals 4, like a BF-type theory in analogy with the simple to D generalized Young-Mill example. So this is basically the end of the talk. I will just summarize our findings and give some future directions. So we analyzed the So we analyzed the various Euclidean workable solutions that they are of different dimensionality and of different matter content. We computed the holographically correlators both of local and non-local observables. And we found that they should satisfy common properties, such as that the cross-correlators should not factorize and they are soft in the UV. We proposed a dual description in terms of a system of interactive. In terms of a system of interacting QFTs. And but these interactions should satisfy what we noticed from the holographic computations for the correlators. And we also propose some possible microscopic descriptions in terms of two matrix quantum mechanics or BCFTs coupled through topological messenger theory. In the future, we would like to understand better the analytics. Would like to understand better the analysis and continuation of these geometries and their holographic URLs because they might give rise to cosmologies or Bankruptz universes. All the examples had two boundaries. It will be interesting to generalize this discussion for multiple boundaries. Of course, it will be very nice to find the reconstruction method so that we can reconstruct the geometry. Reconstruct the geometry from the microscopic QFT degrees of freedom and also to have a top-down construction that is embendable in critical string theory. Thank you. Okay, thanks very much. We have some time for questions. Let's see how there is something in the chat, but There is something in the chat, but because I'm in full screen mode, I cannot see it. Maybe I should. I think that was just your five-minute warning. Okay. So maybe I'll start with a question. So you were using these topological theories to couple the two theories on the boundaries. I was wondering, so just from a field theory point of view, A field theory point of view, are there some examples known where this is enough to? Well, I guess if you started with some conformal field theories where some topological theory in the middle would be enough to gap the whole system in the IR. Yes, I think so, but I don't. I mean, we only had this example that I saw you here. I don't know if there are more. I don't know if there are more. Maybe. Yeah, I guess I was wondering if there's some kind of condensed matter system. Ah, okay. Yeah, this I don't know. Yeah, this system that we studied. Okay. Toby has a question. I had a maybe I missed this sort of early on, but with your solutions, is the claim that you can't just analytically continue to static Lorentzian solutions? Somehow it's more complicated, is it? No, so from the gravity point of view, I can do it, but we were trying to analytically continue the QFTs. And it seems that this cannot be done for all a range of parameters. I see. I was just wondering if you could analytically continue the gravity solutions to static solutions. Could you not explain the existence of these connected solutions between the boundaries as some form of entanglement between the two boundary theories? There is, I think. So, okay, so if I analytically continue, for example, what was the radial direction in these cases, I end up with something that is like a Bank Grant's universe. And depending on the solution, for example, for the Young-Mill, for the solution that was Einstein Jang-Mill, if If we can also do other types of continuations where you can analytically continue one of the transverse directions. If you do this, there are some issues with the gates field. Like we cannot find gates that the gates field doesn't have imaginary components. Okay, I see. So they don't become black holes when we analytically continue. Like they don't Like they don't become like the internal black hole, for example, that we know that the ternal black hole in EDAs corresponds to two entangled systems of CFTs. And also, for example, if you do the opposite, like you take the eternal black hole and you analytically continue, you in Euclidean, you end up with two disconnected geometries. Thank you. Okay. Any other questions for Olga? I can't see. I'm going to say something. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, is the general suggestion that any sort of wormhole you click in the wormhole should be interpreted as originating from a coupling of the boundary from the field series. From field theories via some topological field theory. Is that the general suggestion that you would like to make? Yeah, this is the suggestion we would like to make. We want to make it more robust by being able to somehow reconstruct the geometry from these microscopic models that are connected to this topological theory. But at the moment, we haven't fully done this. But yes, this is the general proposal, and that the participation. Proposal and that the partition function should be of this form that I sorry that I saw in the beginning. Do you have any idea more generally where this topological so this topological field theory if you put boundaries on it typically you get propagating degrees of freedom on the boundary this topological field theory cannot give rise to the new propagating degrees of freedom on the boundaries I suppose Degrees of freedom on the boundaries, I suppose, right? Because then you would be changing the actual. Exactly, yes, exactly. That's what, yeah, yeah, that's right. And then, do you have an idea what is in the more general case, like suppose they do M equals four super young males or something like what these topological degrees of freedom are supposed to be? Yeah, this I don't know, but so for example, in the Lorangian For example, in the Lorentzian case, there are some examples by Bajas and Labdas that they have some quiver gates theories that they open some gates. So maybe you could find something similar in this case, but I don't have something more concrete to say about this. Thanks. Any other question if there are others? I think one was great. Yeah, sorry. Signal is greatly connected. I have a question. So, someone asking him. So, I was trying to understand how this proposal of the topological field theory is or is not the same as averaging over couplings, right? So, couldn't we think of the couplings as results of some, let's say, some suitable BF theory where Where the vacuum are given by the coupling, somehow. Yeah, we could do this, but we didn't use any of these steps averaging, but it's true. Possibly you could see it also this way. For example, in your example, the sum was somehow more discrete in the sense that you summed over the different representations. Right. And you also had, I guess, some entanglement between the indices of the representations. The indices of the representations between the two sides, right? If I understood correctly. Yes. Yeah, that looks slightly different. I was just wondering whether there is a way to diagnose the difference, whether it is the same or not as averaging over couplings. Somewhat similar, but it looks, I guess, this fact that in your case you had this entanglement between the indices of the representation looks a bit different than the. Um, but yeah, I don't know. What you said is more like a yield disorder one or something, right? Like if you like integrating out, integrating out a topological field theory is not the same as averaging, right? Because it's annealed instead of quenched. Well, I had in mind the, so in this example of the VF theory, right, the different representations are different vacua for this Higgs field, for the phi field. Um, so they are discrete, they are not. Um, so they are discrete, they are not continuous, right? Right, but you could imagine that an average over couplings might be the result. I mean, maybe you can define some theory where for each coupling you introduce a canonical Liquidjugate momentum and then you're considering some vacuum where you're summing over all these couplings. Yeah, I mean, I think generally you can when you integrate out what's in the middle. When you integrate out what's in the middle, you could think of it as some kind of average. But maybe the difference here, sometimes the couplings are normally the couplings are just parameters that couple to gauge invariant terms in the action. But here it's like you have not really a coupling, but like a gauge field with in some representation. With in some representation that's inserted, yeah. The coupling comes from the representation from the fact that there are common representations in the end that, like the topological theory enforces that the boundary theories, they have the same representation in USAM over those. I mean, it's like having an external charge with in some representation, and then your gauge, your singlet constraint. Singlet constraint gets smarter. That's a case to one way to try to understand the difference would be to consider a system with multiple boundaries, right? Yeah. So if you have like average number couplings, you have couplings which are common to all boundaries. And this in topological theories, I think you can think about this situation where you think in terms of this in BF theory, there is a common phi field, so scalar field that is the same in all cases. Cases. So that sum is the same for all of them. I'm not sure how the indices of their presentations work out, but. All right. So we should probably get on to the next talk, but thanks for all the questions. Thank you. And thanks for your talk. Let's thank Olga one more time. Thank you.
