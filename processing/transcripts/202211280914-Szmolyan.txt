Yes, online conferences, but this does not place the real thing, so it's a real pleasure to be here. Let's use the time. Okay, so I will talk about slow manifolds in chemical systems, which is sort of a topic which has occupied me for the last years and I c found it increasingly interesting. And I changed the name a little bit. It's mostly in the biochemical context. In the biochemical context, so I developed an interest in models from mostly from cellular dynamics, so cell dynamics actually, to the internal processes and control mechanisms of cells are often modeled by ODE systems, and they have integrated multi-scale structures, and that's what I like to analyze. We present basically two problems which give the which fit to the title of the talk in the sense that they Which feature the title of the talk in the sense that they have several or even many slow manifolds. We are all used to slow manifolds, notion, some at least, or some you know these, many of us use them actively, but often there's one or maybe there are two or there's an S-shaped manifold. The manifolds I will talk about are different, they are more, they have different shapes, and they are hard to find sometimes. I decided not to give an introduction to, I will not talk about. I will not talk about slow manifold gaze and geometric single vibration theory. I will just use it. So I will recall a few notions, but not really details. I assume there's enough background here. The two models I will talk about is a cell cycle model. That's funny that is that within this model we find an old friend later, and you're always happy if you see an old friend coming up in your work. The second model is about a cicada. The second model is about the circadian rhythm model in a special kind of bacteria. And there, the interest is sort of why do we do this? Well, we do it because it's fun, but we also think we can have something that we have something that we can tell the biologists. That's very rarely the case. It almost never happens. They always tell you we knew this. Anyway, the reason they knew this is they build their models by undoing. By undoing what we do, and we undo what they did. But at least here, there was a little pleasant surprise that there was one point where theoretical biologist said, oh, this is neat. That does not happen very often, I think. So I will report on that a little bit. Okay, so let's jump into it. Multi scales in biology are well known to everybody who ever looked at biology, so we have all the time scales you want to look at. Scales you want to look at from at the molecular level of nanoseconds, 10 to the minus until up to sort of like days here. That's still for cells and organisms, and the longer things are, well, biology and population dynamics. So there's a huge range of time scales. Certainly, I'm not the person who sort of tries to cover a large range here. So I will really talk about the cell and how it sort of Talk about this cell and how it sort of operates here, but even there are enough time states. So, there's a picture of a cell or two types of cells, just to set the stage a little bit. We all know the basic knowledge what's going on. There's like the nucleus, RNA, DNA, transcription, metabolic processes, whatever. And they take on take place on these scales, let's say ten to the minus six to Let's say 10 to the minus 6 to 10 to 4 or 5 seconds days. All this horribly complicated. I'm not claiming that I understand actually much about it. I rather pick certain existing models and try to understand them. The cell is a spatial object, so spatial objects are also important. We will neglect those that stay in the purely kinetic chemical regime of well mixed chemistry. Of well-mixed chemistry, which is not a good assumption often in cells, but it's nevertheless made as a first approximation often. The interest in this field is like, well, over the last decades, there has been this enormous change in experimental technology. There's this flood of data, which is good, but it's almost too much data. So I think that the understanding of this data is lagging behind. So maybe you should rather go to machine learning and data science. Rather go to machine learning and data science and not do MODs, but nevertheless, I still believe that certain things have to be understood dynamically, deterministically. There's also a lack of data. In these models, the parameters are never known, almost never known, some are not measurable, some have to be inferred later on from the model, and things like this. So the data situation is not as happy as it could be. What will I talk about? I will be very quick with sort of just some general principles about dimensional reductions, the well-known classistic status function, our version of it based on slow manifolds, mechanical theory. And my focus will be sort of on dynamical phenomena in these two cell models, which involve what I always call switches and oscillations. So the cell or this part of the cell changes its mode of operation from one behavior to another. That's like a switch and that's all controlled by chemistry. And if you are lucky, these switches occur in an order which in the end lead to an oscillation. And in most of these, there are several slow manifolds involved. That's what I will focus on. At the technical level, one has to use different scalings to uncover these different features. Features, you have to match them, and I like to do this by this blow-up method. But I will be fairly non-technical, so we don't see much of that. So, here's a cartoon picture of a slow manifold. Everybody has seen it. There is like a yellow slow manifold, which is assumed to attract faster modes. You can reduce it to the slow manifold and dimension reduction. That's great. And within this first slow manifold, there might be another one. Slow manifold, there might be another one which again attracts, and so on, and so on. So we could have these nested slow manifolds which organize dynamics. That is what I call the Bohr picture, because it's sort of always going down, down, down, and the end you may be at an equilibrium. It's more interesting if you have. I'm more interested in this structure, which is a cartoon picture. I jumped forward now, where you have sort of seven. But now, where you have sort of several slow manifolds, these are not perfectly drawn. The pictures were for me. I stole it from my friend Rovidio Radolescu, who is a physicist termed systems biologist, that he is looking in this huge mass of biomodels for traces of multi-scale behavior and trying to develop algebraic, analytic methods to analyze them, hopefully at some point in an automatic way. That's a long way to go. So, there are these different So, there are these different slow manifolds with flows on them. You can jump to another one, they could intersect, and maybe they form a cycle at some point. But to go back, we all know about the Here is Mental reduction, the textbook example of a reduction to a slow manifold. So, there's a slow manifold, it attracts the fast reactions, then you have slow dynamics according to Michelin's Meckman law. It's very useful when it works, but there are other things as well. But there are other things as well, possible. Okay, here is, I said I wouldn't talk about GSPT, and I will not. These are just reminder, the equations, as they are always written, x is a slow variable, y fast. You write a transform to a fast time scale, and the epsilon moves up here, and these two systems now have very different limiting systems. This reduced system, that's the layer problem. This lives on the set G0, which we call the G0, which we call the critical manifold. So I assume everybody has seen that. Here I will spend a few more seconds. These chemical systems very rarely come in this form. They almost never come in this split form, which is called the standard form, where you have a clear splitting between slow and fast. Chemical systems always look like this, more or less. So they are large polynomial systems with many coefficients, some of them very large. Coefficients, some of them very large, some very small, concentrations very large, very small. So, lots of candidates for epsilon, but we don't know what the epsilon is. Here I was optimistic, put in something which is the epsilon we are looking for, or we have found it. Mathematically, a singular perturbation problem is a problem that was already done by Fennecli in his paper in this generality. So, it's a vector field which, when you set epsilon zero, it should have a Zero, it should have a manifold of equilibrium, which is not generic, but when you have it, then it's sort of like a single perturbation problem. When you turn on the epsilon, this zero set will become a slow manifold on which you pick up slow flow. This works perfectly if this manifold S is normally hyperbolic, otherwise it's more complicated. We'll see examples where you have normal hyperbolicity and also. We have normal hyperpolicity, and also we see examples where we lose it. And as I said, this is sort of like the form in which these IO models based on reaction kinetics or Michelism kinetics show up. Okay, so here to be a bit specific, I show two very trivial toy models just to illustrate this non-standard form. So there are two equations, there's one model in reality. There's one non-linearity, the same here, and then there's an epsilon perturbation of both. If you set epsilon zero here, you recover this trivial layer problem for which x minus here. So the difference is conserved. X minus Y is constant. So the flow is along the Yeah, x minus y0 is constant. So if the fast flow takes you along the first median and you have two zero sets, x0, y0, which are here the axis. So these are the gravity manifolds. They are both attracting, except for the origin. The origin is non-hyperbolic because this is fully quadratic. If you turn on the epsilon, you get this in this case there there exists an inverted manifold, a slow manifold. An invet manifold, a slow manifold, one is guaranteed to exist here, another one here, and in this case they hook up smoothly, not in the, yeah, so there, and you attract it and drift along. So that's easy. If you change signs a bit, then same non-linearity, but now it's sort of different signs. Now really x plus y is conserved, which Y is conserved, which means that the fast flow takes you along these lines of slope minus one. Again, there's the slow manifold, the critical manifold here, a critical manifold here. This one is attracting, this one is repelling, the origin is non-hyperbolic. And you see a slow manifold here, which is repelling, and then it sort of wears away here. And there's an attracting slow manifold going up, which attracts orbits. So this is just, I did this example. I did this example because this very simple, innocent-looking quadratic type nonlinearities will play an important role later. So, this was like this in Walmart. I showed this picture already. Ovidia calls it the crazy quilt. So, it's like a known thing of many different pieces. And this is hard to find in a large system and it's hard to understand due to very different what is. Due to very different orders of magnitudes, of variables and of parameters, the dimensions can be different, can change, stability can change, some of these manifolds could be attracting, some are repelling, some are maybe cell type. Everything changes, the geometry could change as parameters vary, the intersections are hard to study, and connections are maybe hard to find. In a 3D picture, all this is easy, but as soon as you go up in 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 You go up in four, five, six, seven dimensions with three-dimensional slow problems, four-dimensional fast problems, you almost lost, right? So we have to be moderate about dimension, which is regrettable because these biomodels, they are often very large, 10, 20, 40 variables, but they are sort of out of reach for detailed analysis, one is to be honest. So let's jump into the first model. This was the cell cycle problem. It's an old model by Thyssen. Model by Tyson, well known for his work also on Fitzunokumo and spiral waves, the same Tyson who turned more into assistantologists later, right? So he was an applied mathematician, turned, well, applied, still a mathematician, more on the bio side. The model I will analyze has just five variables and it describes a central control mechanism of the cell cycle. Well, a cell has Of the cell cycle. Well, a cell has to grow, then it has to decide how to divide, and it has to start preparing for this division process, then it divides, then it splits into two, and then the next cell again repeats this process. So it's in some sense periodic. The idea, an old idea in the 1990s was that this is controlled by things which are called cycline and cycline-dependent kinases. In 1990, this was worth a Nobel Prize, so at that time. As a Nobel Prize, so at that time this was cutting-edge research. By now, these models have grown in size and complexity. But often, sort of like what they do now is like they plug together four or five pieces like this. The essential pieces are still very similar. These substances, they are proteins, and these proteins can always appear in several states. Can always appear in several states, a passive, inactive state, and then they can be activated by adding some phosphor molecules, this phosphorylation. And when they are active, then they add as enzymes in other processes. So that's this mechanism. The whole cell works on a complicated network of such processes. That's the main one of the main mechanisms. And the thing is, so there's this X5 is cycling, that's this variable here. That's this variable here. And the cyclene can build a complex with the CDC. And this complex can be in its basic state and in its active state. And in its complex X3, that's what's called maturation-promoting factor. And when you have enough of it, then the cell will decide to dist to to split and divide into two. Then this thing is deactivated and the cell is sort of in a rest state. The cell is sort of in a rest state. So these X3, X4 are the crucial players for this cell division process. And with some modeling, you come up with this five-dimensional model, which includes an autocatalytic step, where this MPF factor works, positively, influences positively its own production. So if you have some, then it really gets going. And that's sort of modeled here by this cubic term, which is nice dynamic. Is nice dynamically, which is not so nice from the basic view of chemistry, because in chemistry you should have just quadratic mass action parameters. So, this is like a modeling, and it should be explained by some other processes which are not treated in detail. The rate constants have very different orders of magnitude. So, there's a 10 to the 6, 10 to the 3, 200, small, 200, small, whatever. And the interest is to start it basically with a lot of cyclene and then and sorry with a lot of cycline and some CDC2 and then see what it does. That's sort of the experimental situation as well. And what it does is it shows a very nice interesting limit cycle. There are some transients which are very very fast. They are not resolved here, so they happen on this axis. I didn't zoom in, you would have to use a lot of. I didn't zoom in, you would have to use a logarithmic scale to see them. But after that, you see oscillation developing and it shows sharp variation, so it looks like relaxation oscillation. There's a nice separation of these scales. So the purple thing here, that's X5. This is the scale 10 to the minus 4, X3 is scale to 10 to the minus 3. And we are here at the middle, this is X3, X4. These are the main players. These are the main players, and x1 is sort of the top, one of one. But that's almost too good to be true. You see, almost here, epsilon. So, there's epsilon one over ten works very well here. And that's a good small epsilon, actually. If you make it smaller, your numerics will be already quite hard. Okay, so how do we approach this? It would be nicer to keep the case and work with all these case as parameters, but then Case as parameters, but that's not manageable, really. So, the usual thing is you introduce your scales you think are correct, and that's guesswork. You do it just based on this one set of data or by some knowledge from the biologists. So you put it in, so there's this very large parameter, k2, and epsilon to the minus 6, epsilon minus 3, minus 2, small, quadrup1, minus 2, quadratic again. You plug it into the equation. And now this equation. And now, this equation is an equation, a slow fast, singular perturbed equation in this more general form. So there's no splitting and slow fast, but there are lots of epsilons here, which we can make better visibly or better exploit if we multiply the whole thing by epsilon to the power 6. That makes it appearing more regular. So we go to a faster time scale. And on this scale, And on this scale, we see the first basic structure. Setting epsilon zero here is very simple. Just two terms survive. It's just these two simple terms, linear, but that's ravin, my kids would say. So it's easy. And we immediately get one critical manifold, which is just obtained by x setting x1, 0, and it's attracting because of the minus here. You can compute its expansion. It's expansion. That's easy because it's more or less just it just comes basically from the quasi-steady state assumption in this first equation. So if you solve this for x1, linear, you get these terms. So it starts with epsilon cubed, then there's epsilon to six, and then there could be higher order terms which we sort of don't compute. And these first two terms are basically the quasi-steady state assumption for x1. You plug this into the remaining equations. Remaining equations. Now you have four equations. Different powers of epsilon appear. And the good thing is now we are able to divide out the epsilon to the four. There's an epsilon to the four everywhere. So we divide it out and get a system which again behaves more regular. So now there are two terms, there are four terms without epsilons. So there are two reactions and they are grouped here. So there's this one reaction involving x2, x4. This one reaction involving X2, X4, X5. X5 and X2 are consumed and produce X4, and then there is this other autocatalytic reaction where X3 and X4 produce sort of more of X3. If you set epsilon zero here, you get another layer problem, which is a bit more complicated, but again, these mono binomial terms play an important role. This is the monomy binome. Is it a monomer binome? What is it? I never know it. Two factors is a binome or is binome A plus B to the power n? Well, anyway, but this okay. This is again easy, but it's not completely trivial because now we get sort of again many critically many volts. So whenever x two times x five is zero, then this it disappears, and when this product is zero, this disappears. This product is zero, this disappears. So we have to look at the combinations of the two of the variables vanish. So either x2 is zero and one of these. These are two slow critical manifolds, or x5 vanishes and one of the other two. So we have four critical manifolds. VR easy, they are like planes, or hyperplanes. But there are many. So in principle, all of them could play a role, but the good news is that for this relaxation oscillation, only this one plays a role. Oscillation: only this one plays a role. So x5 small and the other two small consecutively. So just two of these play a role. This fits fairly well with what we saw in the numerics, actually. This x5 was the smallest one, it's 10 to the minus 5, but we see it's sort of like on analytical grounds. So there exist these two additional slow manifolds. On both of them, we can compute x an expansion for x five. An expansion for x5, and indeed the equation predicts that x5 is of the order epsilon to 4, what I just showed you all the numerics. You plug this into the equation here, and you are at a 2D system, which is not true. I'm cheating here a little bit, because actually, what is it still 3D? You have the equations which I show you hold for both of these branches, sort of. Then it's two different 2D things, which I have predated here as things are. I abbreviated here as this a little bit not fully rigorous two-dimensional system. It captures the essence, so I took the liberty to write it like this. And this system, when I saw this, I got excited. This is the old trend I mentioned in the introduction. This is what we call the 2D autocatroller, which we analyzed a long time ago. It's one of the first models where these tools, blower, pre-scaling, were used in a, let's say, serious or rigorous way. A rigorous way. So if you call x4a, x3b, and you call epsilon square, which shows up here epsilon, then you get this system, which is this, I call it the famous Otto Catonata, and it's a pet problem because it really shows these ideas sort of in the most in the easiest situation where they make sense. And we have analysed this like thirteen years ago, but there's a nice paper and I still talk about it. Nice paper, and I still talk about it. Last year I talked about it in this SciATS mini tutorial, and the audience was very happy that I explained it because still, well, things spread very slowly somehow. Okay, so this here, in this system, I don't explain it now here. So there are these two, this ABC, these autocatalytic terms. They have lines of equilibria A0 and B0. This is an attracting slow manifold. Attracting slow manifold. This is a non-hyperbolic one, so two more slow manifolds. This one you have to blow up to a cylinder, and if you do this, another slow manifold pops up and another one, and then you put it together, and in the end, you have a be like, I don't know, seven, ten, eleven slow manifolds in this problem. Here is the fold point, which you have to blow up again, if you haven't done it before, another couple of slow manifolds. There's a nil potent point, which you also have to blow up, and then you are done. So it's this huge hierarchy. Many, many slow stations. Many, many slow things, details get a bit messy, but the overall structure is completely resolved. That's what I like actually. Okay, good. So now a few minutes, two minutes? We started late. Okay, I'll make it very quick. Another model, this is this model for circadian redox oscillations, developed. Circadian redox oscillations developed by Hans-Peter Herzl in his group in Berlin. It was sort of like an alternative model for circadian oscillations. That's his research area. I mean, it has a similar structure that there are sort of some main reactions and they are controlled by some enzymes, let's call them, and when they are on, then they speed up these reactions. That should suffice. So here it's like a six-dimensional model with a constraint. So in fact, this is only five. Constraint, so in fact, this is only five-dimensional. It comes actually from a larger model. They had 11 equations, eliminated some by some heuristics, and they get these time series. And these time series are the time series which are called switches and oscillations. So there's a switch. So there are two main players. One is hardly visible. There's this orange thing here, which is A2. And then there's this very unvisible. Unvisible to increasing D1, and it's either A10 or D10. So there is a switch where the one goes on, when the other is zero. When this is back, it's zero, the other one goes up. And this is controlled by this thing, and it generates a rhythm which can be adjusted to a daily rhythm. Okay, so this model can be reduced to a four-dimensional model, and that's the model we studied in more detail. And again, it has this similar. And again, it has this similar problem. I should say there are like again two of these, let's call them again, binomial terms with large coefficients. So there's a reaction diving A1D1 here with a large constant, and there's other one A2D1. So these are the main reactions which structure these switches. One of them can be eliminated, and then you're just left with this one here, with this prominent stuff. This prominent stuff. And here, the switch is now better visible. So the blue trajectory goes to zero, and the other one goes up. Then this goes down, then this goes up. They block each other mutually. And this sets the rhythm. That's it. There's a periodic solution with sharp switching. You can play the same game as I showed you. You rescale time, you get a very, very simple layer problem which has A0, D0 is critical manifold, so they are easy, just true. Manifold, so they are easy, just two of them. They intersect. They are these planes. On these planes, you get a relatively easy reduced problem which you can resolve. The edge A, D, both zero is non-hyperbolic because it's quadratic. So you have to blow up this edge to a cylinder, which is actually a cylinder of planes because there are two other variables. On this cylinder, you find another flow which does the switching. Which does the switching? You can analyze this. This is not too hard actually. You analyze the flow, and you get sort of a singular cycle which approximates this limit cycle. And now let me give you this story about what technology is like. So I visited Franz Witter Herzeg in Berlin before the pandemic, actually, and I spoke about this. And they said, oh, this is nice, but like center manifolds, you know, this stability, yeah, we have. We know this stability, yeah, we've heard these things, you do it also. So you cannot get them excited. But then, as I went on, at some point, I said, well, the switch goes sort of here, dynamics go from top down. So D increases, A decreases, you have to go up. So this must change somewhere. This happens at a definite value, at the value p over b. So when this variable r is at this value, there is sort of a line of equilibria. It's called a line. Of equilibria. It's called a line here, where this process is indeterminate, but on this side you go down and here you go up. This switch was something he really liked because he can relate to it in his language. These B and D are things which come from the chemistry, but that's the only thing he really liked. This whole slow metaphor blow up, they couldn't care less. Yeah? Okay, so that's my end. Why do we do this? So, what should we look at? This, right? So, what should we look at? I think that's important, also, maybe at a workshop like this. In particular, I think biology, and this is cell biology, you really should look only at very robust phenomena, nothing depends too much on fine-tuning. So, colours and everything, mixed molds, nice, but I wouldn't go for it in cell biology. It's probably okay in neuroscience, but maybe not good in cell biology. So, many folks, biologists also like this thing, actually, this way. That's how they build their models. Actually, this way. That's how they build their models. They say this is slow, let's give it a small parameter, build it up. And what they really like, and that's what we should try to give them, simple answers about an interesting property about the HD care. But with this, I probably stop. Yeah, sorry, quick for not. Any questions? Yeah. So, are you suggesting that this whole modeling, rescaling, reduction, and then analysis after blow gives you quantitative information? Yeah, on some crucial parameter, yes. This is sort of like the threshold where it happens. This figure in this time series, it's basically R here is this dashed line, and it's r one-half, which is this threshold, which. One half, which is this threshold, which changes things then here. Yeah, so gives you something. I mean, the model is not quantitative. It's surprising, right? I mean, the model is made up, actually. This model, they haven't even funded an experiment yet. So, but these things are sort of in development. But the funny thing was, so these are biologists and they are trained in feedback loops, positive feedback, negative feedback. Negative feedback should give you oscillation. Negative feedback should give you oscillation. They couldn't explain the oscillations here because there's no negative feedback. So this was also new to them. So that's quite cool. So it's not quantitative, but it tells you important parameters or important combinations of parameters. That's the thing. Thresholds. I think that's what they also care, and that's what they could maybe measure or set up an experiment. More discussions later, just then the fact I can find things on the screen.
