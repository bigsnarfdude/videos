So, second talk of the afternoon is Jake Solomon who will speak on Rich Gromo with to thank the organizers for organizing the great conference with us here. So, everything here is going to joint work. Don't work because put some cats and so okay, it's gonna do a perfect idea and correct two. Uh system is smooth. Okay, and we're going to choose field extensions with degrees. With degrees summing to what we'd like to do is find some kind of invariant count say. Say stable maps U Surface Sigma Zeta Passing through some points V1 up to Pi. Okay? Okay? So and we'd like to do this in so these stable maps we defined well you'd like to you'd like them to be defined over K a priori, like really, you know, well if you're counting over algebra as a closed field, that would count stable maps over C passing through a bunch of complex points. That would be what we usually do in Going-Witten theory. And the hope would be to sort of do the same thing over some, you know, not algebra. To sort of do the same thing over some, you know, not algebraically closed field, but then if you just count maps over K, then you might not get something invariant. So you do something sort of in between, and what that is, is, well, so these match are defined over Some say time extension and you saw you want to remember as much as possible this finite extension. So you, I mean, ultimately people say like I have. Now, ultimately, we'll be paying people say, like, I have 10 maps defined over k, and another 12 defined over some extension L, and then another 13 defined over extension L prime, but in real life, that's hard to do. So instead, what you do is... Is somehow L the minimum field of definition of NetMap or you fixed some kind of L that right. Okay. Okay? So Right, so this is a say lu, okay? For each map u, there's some extension lu. If I have extension lu, okay, and you want to count that map, and the way you and you want the answer, of course, to be independent of the points p. Invariants of number. So. And also invariant under deformations of Z, or is that too much? That's too much. Over A1 connected bases. Except that we don't have any. Yeah, I mean, we don't really have any examples of that, but. Of that. So, I mean, I think the answer is that we certainly believe. Okay, first of all, I haven't said any theorems yet. So, of course, yes, we'd like it to be independent of deformation of the target. And in fact, I don't think we have examples where we can prove that, but I think we believe it's true. Over A1 connected basis, I believe it's true. But I think I even believe it's. But I think I even believe it's true for. Well, let's get to the theorem and then we can discuss what I. I think there's like a. It will take some time. Go for it, sorry. Okay, so this leads you to define the count should actually belong to this group, which we've been talking about so much. This group, which we've been talking about so much at the conference. And okay, so I want to go into more detail about this and say what we can actually prove so far, what is kind of hopeless to prove, and how you can get around that, or something like that. But so, anyway. Right, so idea. How do you do this? Well, we'd like to consider NGNZ beta, stable maps from GNSG with NMAR points. Of course, I'm not going to talk about. Of course, I'm not going to talk about genus in general. We have no results in genus greater than zero, so this is just sort of like a, you know, there was a word towards in this talk, so I have to make some attempt to say what you'd like to do ultimately. Okay, so Okay, so and then you have an evaluation map to the nth power of the target variety. So, can I ask, is this entry at bar z by defined over the brown field? Definitely over k, yeah. So, I mean, there's some paper touch because the So, okay, and then what we'd like to do is, okay, so in general, you'd like to put all kinds of different classes here and pull them back, intersect, and that can be challenging to do. So, we're going to compromise for something simpler, which is just when the dimensions agree, we'll just put point classes in, which means this. Put point classes in, which means essentially that we'd like to define this. Okay, right, so let's call this. Notation is that sigma is going to be equal to this list of L1 to Lr. And And we'd like to define this count call it Z beta sigma Okay, and so the idea is that we want eight Take ng beta sigma and define it to be equal to the degree of this evaluation map. Oops, snap this back. Yeah, so then this is not, this still doesn't contain any information about sigma. So I have to say what we do for sigma, so we can incorporate sigma. We can incorporate sigma in here by doing a sort of dialogue twist to the everything inside, so that essentially this product of Zn winds up being the product of the restriction of scalars. Of scalars of Z from the field Li to the field K, product from I equals 1 to R. Essentially what you do is you allow the Gaul group of the closure of K to act on this thing to the closure, but you have a permutation representation which comes from Representation, which comes from looking at different embeddings of K and Li in the closure, and you allow that permutation representation to act on the marge points. Okay, so you have the usual Galo group acting on the moduli, the usual action of the Galo group in the moduli space, but you also twist it by a permutation action, the March points. And then you naturally get this sort of Galois twist. Okay? K-points of this target thing. K-points of this target thing correspond exactly to points points in result. Okay. And so these are, like, this is all, these are k statements here. Okay, but then as Mark was saying. So if you had points with like a C adjoint I, the Galois group would clock those two conjugates. There's a permutation representation on those N marked points if you know what they're. On those N mark points, if you know what their builds and definition are. So I'm allowing those points to go to orbits of the stable curve here is going to be like, you know, it's going to have n mark points, but some of it are going to come in orbits of the length of the degree of the field extension associated with that. You know, P I for I1, I from one to R. Wouldn't it be easier to just forget the labeling of the points? But wouldn't it be easier to just forget the labeling of the points? I mean you can do that. You can do that too. But then and you get all possible choices of your choice. Unless it fixes your choice of the fixed one. So we want to actually have, we want to remember the different field extensions, right? You get an invariant of that. You get different answers of those for different choices of field extensions. Okay, so and now we want to consider the okay, so now your chromopricon invariant is not going to be symmetric somehow in the idea. Yeah, yeah. Is that right? It's going to be symmetric, right? But I mean, it's going to be symmetric in the points which are of the same field extension. Okay? So, I mean, and which is, you know, you can't hope for more than that. Okay, so the definition is going to be that n z that sigma is going to be somehow the degree. Can be somehow the degree of this map of sigma when the dimensions of the domain and the target of the evaluation map are the same virtual agree or something. Well, So, of course, we would like to have a virtual class. We don't have a virtual class in this generality, so we can't do that. We're going to have to actually make our moduli spaces smooth enough. Just restrict yourself to the case where there's actually a typical dimension. No, I'm just counting the creed. Not exactly, but we're going to get close to that. Okay. But we're not exactly doing something classical here. I mean, well, Jake's going to show us. I mean, well, Jake's going to tell us more about when we're doing this than I think we'll do. So, I mean, in general, you'd like to have a virtual class, but I mean, it's just not available yet. And when you do things with, you know, when you have not, when you have some kind of non-trivial isotopic groups, then you have to usually invert things, and that means you lose out on information when you're trying to do things like in a Gromov, what do you call it? Not a Gromov-Witten group, but a Grothendieck Witt group, as somebody already remarked, that the two. As somebody already remarked, that the two things you have to go fairly far in order to distinguish them. Okay, this thing, of course, is not a number, it's a quadratic form. And I want to say what it is. Okay, so the first thing is, what is this degree? So supposedly we have some map F from X to Y. So the map, planet map, smooth. Smooth. Okay, screens. Okay? So then, in order to define a degree, we first have to define what we mean by an orientation. Of course, if you were over C, then that wouldn't be necessary, but now we're working over an arbitrary field, and you need to define an orientation. So definition and orientation. Of F is a line bundle and an isomorphism from this line bundle squared. This line bundle squared to the relative canonical sheaf of the map. That we mean the same, but determinant of the x format given the Given such a thing, we can define the degree the degree is an isomorphism, but just some I need. Sorry. Oh, the harm is the definition value. I don't think that. This is a definition. Other way around. Okay, thanks. The degree of F, which of course depends on the orientation, is going to be given by so it's quadratic form. Quadratic form on y, okay, which means a vector bundle over y, which has a symmetric non-generate near form on it. And the way you get this thing is you consider the push forward L. Right, so Right, so push the maps by the push forward row to push forward the relative canonical bundle. This thing is just the oops Okay, the okay, so there's a trace map. So okay, so there's a trace map to y, which is just a counit of this adjunction. And this is not degenerate by coherent duality. Specifically, if you consider so. Consider, so you have a map row. Just rewrite a row like this. Okay, so then you can push that forward and substitute. And substitute here trigger the y and then by coherent duality this thing isomorphic to isomorphisms of course. Okay, so this is a way of defining the quadratic form of y and that seems like a complicated thing. After all, I wanted to get this thing seems a bit in a much well more concrete group, the growth and the width group of K out of. Niquid group of K out of Y, and here's where A1 connectedness comes in. So if Y is A1 connected, then this is a scheme over okay, and basically every pullback from the point is an isomorphism. This map Okay, so everything that we can possibly get there actually comes from the more of the H0 of the associated sheets with the GY compass to the something in G W r you something. Maybe it's the same thing as some cater or some permission catering, but there's a variation on this. This is going to be very important because, well, for two reasons. First of all, okay, so now x so there's still k schemes, but they need not so this is going to be enough. This is going to be a map of the past means. But, well, let's not even say that, but I mean the point is something like it is not necessarily finite and not necessarily orientable. Okay? And And however, you have some u sitting instead of y, okay, such that two conditions hold. First of all, the codimension of the complement Is at least two. And second of all, when you restrict F to the preimage of U, then it's already. Okay? So then you can just, you can define, you can still define degree. Sorry. Sorry. And finally, let's say that if this thing is also smooth, okay. Assume the Y is smooth, right? But not necessarily X. So in this case, you can still define the degree of f being equal to the degree of f just inverse. Inverse image of you, okay? And this thing a priori lives in the growth and digit group of U. So we have some, now u could be some kind of thing which you don't know very much about, and so this is highly non-designed. And so, this is highly non-desirable. I mean, Victor U might be not A1 connected or something like that. Okay? But actually, because it's codimension two, and because of this, let's call this one, co-dimension two condition, plus the fact that the growth The fact that the growth indicate which sheath is unramified, which is some result of handing and I'm spelling this right. I'm not going to attempt to even pronounce it. I'm not going to attempt to even pronounce that. So, this implies that actually, so basically, there's some kind of like Hartog's principle which allows you to extend quadratic forms from here to the entire Y. So, actually. So, J, so both of them. It's really not for GWY, it's really for H0. He's defined GWY as the global section. He didn't define it. Okay, this is a sheaf. It's got a s kind of curly script. And this one is not a sheaf. But what's the other one? Sorry, this is not a sheaf. It's simply the global sections. It's the global sections. Yeah, it's the global sections of the sheaf. But that just means vector bundles with a quadratic form. Well, no, it's the sheaf. You can attach them. This is Mark's previous question. We can have a whole cover and say which cover. Okay, you're defining this to be H0 of the sheath. This to be H0 of the sheet. Okay. That's fine. Everything's fine. What we actually construct is a global vector bundle. Okay. There are more things after in here. The statements you're saying are not true for globally defined geometry. It's true for the machine. A1 connectedness is not enough. There are various other definitions for GW and Y, and you need A1 contracted for this, but A1 connected is good enough for the H group. Okay. Okay, so this zero is actually supposed to be equal to H0. Great. Thank you. Okay, so in fact, even though we don't know anything outside of this nice set U, we're still. We're still able to find. Okay, so this actually shows that we can still, under this A1 connectedness assumption, get something in the growth and take width group of. Something in the growth and liquid group of the field. Okay, now essentially the challenge here is to apply this star variation to the evaluation map. When f is equal to the evaluation map, say twisted from From what we said before and this is going to be our X and this is going to be Y. You're saying the challenge is differently you? Times is different on the U. You have to find the U, yes. Find you. Show the U exists, right? I mean, so I want to convince you this really is a challenge. Bad behavior. You expect to have an equivalent one, but you want it to have an equivalent two. Right. Why is this even a finite map? No, that's a final map. You have to show that it's a finite step. No, to match it. I mean, he's. I mean, he's tuning beta and n so that ng, so that it's. We're assuming the dimensions are equal. That you can just do by, you know, the usual drum-witten story, right? You have to have some dimension axiom, which has to be satisfied. That's just, you know, that's always there. I'm going to be very explicit about it in a little while, but I want to just convince you that. You that this somehow should be extremely surprising that you can address this challenge at all. Okay, so in fact, I mean, I guess, you know, maybe the original, you know, the origins of Chroma-Witty are somewhere around in the 1870s or something like that, you know, people doing this thing oversea, and it was only in 2004 or whatever that Belcher. 2004, or whatever, that Belchanger even attempted to do this over R. And I think this century and something difference in time is essentially because of the fact that this is not something you expect to work. I still don't understand. What if Mgmbar is not of the expected image? Then we're not going to look. I haven't read any theorems yet. I mean, in general. Theorems yet. I mean, in general, you need some kind of virtual class, and you don't have it. You're going to be stuck in g equals zero, almost correct. Yeah, yeah. We're going to do g equals zero. I mean, g equals one, you're going to always have codimension one. I said at the beginning of the talk, we're going to do g equals zero. But, okay. So even when z equals p r, okay, Okay? And so therefore, not only is the thing of the expected dimension, but it's also smooth. Okay? Achieve it. Stay smooth. Sorry. Yeah. I always think about doing this in material, so I don't even bother to. Yeah, okay, so But it's a smooth stack. It's a smooth dealing upward stack. Okay, so as we would expect to mention, you still don't have this So such U doesn't exist when R is greater than 3. You can see this are you looking in the real case. It just doesn't work. So the hope is Is I mean that okay, so if you focus on two or three, okay, then you can try to get you The inverse image of U, so stable maps, sigma, okay, doesn't contain stable maps of the following type. Okay, so So you have two components. Okay, so this is something which is going to be, if not even co-dimensional, so usually bad phenomena happen in codimension one in the modified space. And that's the case, but not all these bad phenomena map to co-dimension. Map to co-dimension one and the target. And it turns out you get very lucky when you're in dimensions two and three that the bad phenomena only map to co-dimension two. And here's the bad phenomena that really is going to kill you in higher dimensions. So you're going to have n1 marked points here, and it's going to have to be beta one, and this is going to be. And this is going to be and here you're going to have N2 marked points and degree beta2. So these are two rational curves which meet at a point and the beta1 plus beta2 is equal to beta, n1 plus n2 is equal to n. Plus m two is equal to n. And so the bad condition is that the dimension of n. The dimension of n say this minus n one times the dimension of x is greater than or equal to two. Okay? equal to 2. Okay? So you want sort of like the dimension if you just restrict the evaluation map to one of the components, if you just look at one of the components, you want sort of like the dimensions to be close if you map them to u. And this is exactly the sort of thing which happens only in codimension 2. And And this is something which essentially the ability to stick this kind of behavior in codimension 2 depends very much on low dimensions, r equals 2 and 3. Now, I should say that there is some kind of horizon going beyond this. I'm going to say in a second what are actually resulting. Say in the second letter, actually, what the result is. It's going to include the r equals 2 case here, and maybe the r equals 3 case is work in progress. So the sort of, you know, distant horizon. Suppose you actually want to do, you know, varieties of arbitrary dimensions. So there's sort of a light which you can look at coming from open-Grommer-Witten theory. Open Bruno-Witten theory, which is that you want to look at some kind of obstruction theory, associate kind of A infinity algebra to such a setting. And this actually allows you to define. Okay, and this actually allows you to define sort of real ROM of our open, I mean this is actually more general. Open ROM of an invariance, say, for are greater than three. Okay? So if you're just interested in the real field, then you have an answer. Real field, then you have an answer. But currently, the technology we have at our disposal of our arbitrary field isn't quite enough to go there. And well, one day it will be. But that's sort of distant horizon. Let's get down to some actual results finally. So So let's assume now that Z is a delta pencil surface. We're going to have VZ is going to be the degree of this is what's called the degree of the del Tetzel. We're going to We're going to define so beta just now when the card class can see and So this distance horizon, is that what Zinger and Georgieva Zinger and Georgieva which succeeded in doing r greater than three if you only allow complex constraints on your curves. If you want to allow real constraints, Now, real constraints on your real curves, then you need to do infinity algebras, okay? And this thing is due to myself and Dr. Pachinski. So But now what we're going to do is just the case of Del Pezzo surfaces and say d is going to be equal to minus, this is just the degree, and d minus 1. This is the dimension condition. We said that the dimension of z to the n has to be equal to the dimension of the n n n n n n n n n Of z to the n has to be equal to the dimension of the modular space. This is where it comes in. So n here is the sum of degrees of field extensions. And now we have this sort of hypothesis, which is going to be present in all the results. This hypothesis is that That first of all that I'm forgetting the first thing, but I'll do the second thing. So either dz is greater than 4, or so this means like projective space and logics and bulbs at up to five points. To five points, or z equals 3, so this is a cubic surface. And then we just have to assume that v is not equal to 6, or dz equals 2, and d has to be then greater than or equal to 7. And the first condition is that. Deta is not equal to m times some delta zero, where delta zero is minus one per okay. So this is our hypothesis, running hypothesis. I think I'm going to add here that Z is A1. Okay? Generally, you could have some sheaf of A1 and have components. So, under hypothesis. Okay, and now I'm going to only talk about characteristic zero. Well, I'm going to talk about higher characteristic in a moment. Theorem 1 of 3 by 1. If the characteristic is 0, then we can find a U inside of this Z and Sigma You know, such that, you know, as in this variation, okay, such that, just be, right, so, right, complement, codimension, the complement of u is greater than two, and the valuation map Is dynamite oriented, and this thing is smooth of the expected dimension. Okay, so I mean there's a whole literature which we had to somewhat extend in order, you know, which talks about modular space and stable maps and no pencil surfaces and. Petzo surfaces, and you can, but by far, the most difficult thing here is not the transversality, but I would say the orientation. So as this example was supposed to demonstrate, there's just no hope to do orientation in many cases, and you certainly have to put this U in in order to take care of the orientation. Is DZ different for DN? Is DZ DZ different? Or are D and D Z the same? D and D Z are different. What was DZ again? DZ is the degree of the Del Petzel. So DZ was KZ.KZ. Oh, Kz.beta is the minus KZ dot beta is D. So this is sort of like. So parsing the second bullet point. What are the parentheses? This is in the boot point. This is the second bullet point. Oh, sorry, the second bullet point. The second bullet point. Oh, sorry, the second bullet point of the boot. I guess they just need this one here. Is that good? Yes. In other words, if you blow up P2 at less than or equal to five points, you're cool. If you blow it up at six points and you have a cubic surface, then you have to exclude one case. And if you're at seven points, And if you're at seven points, then you have to exclude seven cases. And eight is no good. Oh, no, from eight, not this. Sorry, I mean if you lost. Six cases. If you do eight blocks, then you're out of business. You're out of business. So, I mean, and this is because of essentially transversality issues. I mean, since we don't have a virtual class that will work in this generality, we have to really actually show that after you throw out stuff, quote dimension two, So then, after you throw out the stuff in four dimension two in the mapping under the map, under the evaluation map, you get something smooth of the right dimension. And this is maybe not super surprising, but requires a lot of work. The thing which is kind of or needs some idea is this orientation. Okay, so then you can define n. And z beta sigma is equal to the degree of sigma with respect, of course, to this orientation. Okay, and this is the sort of canonical choice of orientation. Okay, because in an operator you might have many, many different choices of orientations. There's one that you can just choose, and that gives Can just choose, and that gives you a number. And these numbers have been computed. And I guess examples were presented in Andre Stalkin. Do we know how those numbers change if you choose a different orientation other than the canonical model? If you twist in a simple way, just by, say, changing rho by like something in k star mod k star squared, then I guess we can figure out how things change. I guess we can figure out how things change, but afterward, if you do something more tricky than that, we don't quite know what the answer is. Is there contortion in the card group of that moduli stack, though? I think it is. Or in the U, right? Just two charging in the U.S. The line buggles up. It's up the line bubble is upstairs. Oh, it's upstairs. The U is in Z. Or the pole case. So it's the two torches in the pole. You have to look in some kind of open set of the moduli set. I mean, you've made up this stuff. It's hard. It's kind of hard. Well, but isn't that unramified? So this is, obviously, upstairs is lack of mention. Okay, so I should say that in the real case, then you do, there's another way of generating orientations, which we're trying to find some analog of here. Which we're trying to find some analog of here. This construction of orientation is sort of still a bit special to dimension two, and maybe this particular setup. What you'd like is to control your orientations by choosing a spin structure on your target. Except we don't know what a spin structure is over an arbitrary field. Spin structure is something from like real topology and so on and so forth. If you're choosing orientations using a spin structure in the open Gollo-Witten setting, then you can see exactly how changing the spin structure changes the numbers. Structure changes the numbers. There's like a formula. It changes them by signs. But for example, if you look at some deltenzel surface with a whole bunch of topology, there's a lot of different possibilities. So I assume there's going to be a lot of different possibilities here as well. And it's not just changing by k star, not k star squared. Okay, so theorem two. So what about Positive characteristic. So then we're going to have to make some choices. But in the end, these choices aren't going to matter. So we want to choose the following information. Lambda is going to be a complete PZR with resonance field. This k and quotient field characteristic zero. Okay, then we're going to have to choose some S Z tilde over lambda such that the special fiber Um special fiber Z tilde K is equal to Z and we're going to choose some B tilde growth group Z tilde with B tilde K is equal to beta and To bet on and probably forgot something, but these always exist, and it's independent of the choice of these results. That's part of the theorem. Okay, so Um term two, okay, so it'll always exist. Okay, so um is that so under the hypothesis Hypothesis. And now we have to assume that k is perfect and powerful not equal to 3, then there exists u ah I had to. Sorry, so then we have this f t. We have this f tilde sigma, which goes from m zero and z tilde to this is a Gaia twist of the evaluation map as before. Okay, so there exists some u. Exists on U on this thing. I'm not going to spell that thing out again. Again, it has count as co-dimension two. The evaluation map tilde is going to be relatively oriented over this pullback of Pullback of U. And then we can define n c beta sigma is equal to the degree of n tilde sigma and this guy again lives in Lives in the growth index with group of k. So this should be a little bit of a surprise. But this, I mean, this requires an extra argument. So essentially the trouble is that uh if you just look at the central fiber, the special fiber, you can't find a pseudo. So th you'd have to throw out stuff of codimension one. You'd have to throw out stuff of codimension one. Okay? But if you stick everything inside of this family, which has a codimension, which has a characteristic zero general fiber, then these bad things in the special fiber, which are codimension one in the special fiber, become codimension two in the whole thing. And then you have to somehow extend your quadratic form over these things of codimension bottom the central fiber. Button the central fiber, and the unramified result doesn't quite work over a base ring like lambda. You have to do some kind of local thing, first extend over codimension one points, then you can, once you've done that over the special fiber over k, then you can apply the unramified result. And again, you get into here. And this thing is independent. Spirit's n of all these choices which are labeled by star. Okay, so in order to show this thing actually is well defined, you have to make all these choices, but in the end, you didn't actually choose anything. Okay, and the final thing is that in one minute, um Minute so in all characteristics we have the local formula. So assuming now that you have things, so I mean in one sense these results kind of go against the grain of common fit in theory because you have to, you know, you don't have a virtual Theory because you have to, you know, you don't have a virtual fundamental class, and you have to do all this kind of, you know, try to show some multi-space is smooth and it expected dimension, which is really against the grain of Roman-Witten theory. But there's kind of still, you're doing some kind of topological definition, and you make some mileage out of this. One of them is just like, for example, this definition for positive characteristic. You really kind of need this in order to get around the fact that you don't have a nice U. U. But another one is this theorem. Okay, so I mean well. So after all, we didn't actually have to have any kind of points in general position to count curves through. But if you do have such points in general position, then you get an enumerative interpretation of this the truth. So if there exists p1 chi um in In general position, especially in positive characteristic, when the general position might be some empty set, not obvious. One more minute to finish writing this. This is all under the hypothesis and so on, but this is for arbitrary characteristic. So here, U is a stable map of degree beta passing through P1 and PR. Now we're going to Now we're going to trace from the field definition of U the product of the norm. And here we're going into sorry, different R. Thank you. Product of here P going to mean nodes. Of u Okay? And here we're going to norm from k of p to k of u the this guy and And capital D is an element of K P star mod K P squared such that the two branches of the node, so the tangents Of U at E are defined over, hey, I'll join the square root of dp. I think I wrote everything down. This might not be the equation, it's x squared minus dpy squared. Okay, I find this somehow like. Okay. I find this somehow like easier to imagine. Okay, let me stop here. So if you wanted to unpack this and say you were just interested in those curves with some specific set of types of nodes, I mean just sort of set, is there enough information in those at DWK to try? I mean, there was in the I mean, there was in the real case. Even in the real case, you can't say how many curves of, I mean, you just say that, like, the ones with that many nodes count with the plus, and the ones with that many nodes count with the minus. Oh, and I guess that's not even what number of the individual nodes is in. But I mean, still, I mean, that is, you remember something about the field of definition, because this is encoded when you take the trace from K of U to K of this product. Of this product of quadratic forms. So, I mean, remembering the types of the nodes is maybe too much to ask. Remember something about the field of definition of your curves? Yeah, yeah, that would be yeah. So, this this gives you a Relshech definition, but it also gives you another finite field. Yeah, so I should say there's generic position points if you're assuming the peak field is like. If your assumed field is like infinite, then your surface is rational. But general bit. Is there a way to adjust your definition so that you can do insertions that are like hyperplanes instead of point classes? Okay, great question. This is many ways. So, even in surfaces, this is an important question. I mean, if you're on a surface, of course, if you're went through this, you're like, okay, it's just a divisor. Don't went through this, you're like, okay, it's just a divisor, divisor, you just throw out. But even then, it's not so simple because if you take some line and you want to intersect it with a curve over the real numbers, this number is not going to be an invariant. So you can't just say, well, any line intersects the curve in V and V points. However, what you expect to be true is that if you, so in the real case, you can put in complex lines. Put in complex lines. And if you were to go up, say, to like a three-dimensional situation, then you'd be able to put in sort of cycles of arbitrary, in the real story, which is, you know, then you could put in cycles of arbitrary degree, complex cycles though, and use those to constrain sort of like those would be sort of over a field of degree, an extension of degree two. Degree, an extension of degree two. Now, we don't yet exactly know what the necessary condition here is when you look over some arbitrary field and field extension, but it seems that if you want to do something like the open WDVV equation, which was mentioned before, then you'd need to be able to put sort of, I mean, it's really crucial that you'd be able to put some kind of insertions over at least certain field extensions in order to make that work. And we're trying to do it. Yeah, so yeah, in general, even also in the open Gromfuiten story, you can put sort of arbitrary colonology classes from the complex ambient space target variety, but you can only put points from the real points. Why do you call this open promo? Well, this is not open promo. But in the open graph situation, that's sort of like. Open Norm of Witten situation, that's sort of like a generalization, or, well, I don't know. I would say the real case is a special case of open one of Witten. And there's this bigger world of open norm of Witten where you have similar phenomena. And there it's really important that you should be able to put stuff in from the whole space as well as just from the real points. Lagrangian is a manifold in general. Since you're in such a restricted setting already, could you Restrictive setting already, could you better just like take the pre-image of the general hyperplane in the moduli space for each hyperplane insertion, and then for the rest of the point insertions, use your definition on that closed subspace. If you just took it over an arbitrary, like over k, that you wouldn't mean you're asking for like so many tangency conditions, is that So many tangency conditions. That's what you're talking about? Intersection with a hyperplane. Just imperceptibly. Just evaluation minus one. But he's saying in the real case, it's. I mean, it's not in there. Yeah, what's the condition error? Look at curves passing through a hyperplane, mark each point they pass through the hyperplane at, and count that. In other words, in addition, to count the curves passing through a bunch of points, count. Have another point which passes through the hyperplane. That's that's an intersection problem. Well, so normally that in over the C that's just sort of done like the visor points you're saying it's sort of over R's is not even in there. I see you use different number of points and you have different conditions that you still point over your values. But maybe it's not invariant over R because you didn't get the local index correct. So if we're taking a pre-image, so we've still got this evaluation map. Mark's suggesting take the pre-image of that item plane and maybe Image of the item plate and make a sub-moduli space, try to orient that. Well, Variant's to show that it's not oriented. I mean, there's no U that you can throw out, so that would be oriented. What? Is there really a virtual fundamental class in a classical setting? People are talking about curve counting and rational curves and what that's also. And just the fundamental, I mean the modulized space is a smooth stack. Modulized space is a smooth stack. You're just taking stack. You just said it was at the beginning. What? For Del Detzo services? For P. For PN, okay. Ah, okay, so for P2. For P2. Yeah. You take the whole, you just take the Eagle. And you can tell you about the thumbs. So but the fundamental, the virtual one comes for other Dell Plus Os because there are other components or something? Are there components or something? Well, I mean, all the stuff we threw out in co-dimension two, it's not, I mean, we had to. But it's in co-dimension two, it doesn't affect the functionality. It's in co-dimension one, but oh, it's in the token image. I mean, you're still taking the degree, and it doesn't show. I'm not even sure they're in the expected dimension. I don't think so. Like, you might have components that are not. But they all match the codimension. No, even for genus zero, I mean, we just showed that those things. Genotypical. I mean, we just showed that those things map the high code dimension, so they don't exist. Yeah, but you're taking a degree. You want a degree or expensive. But the moduli space itself is not that expected dimension. Right, which is the exact same thing. Yeah, but when you take the map, it takes things of the wrong degree to zero. The wrong magnitude to zero, virtually that might not be the right thing to do. When a deformation invariant in general, your virtual class is going to have something on those hardware.
