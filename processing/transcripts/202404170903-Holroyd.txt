Working on these topics, it was a very different world. It was kind of a niche subject, and you know, on the one hand, that meant you know, there were only really eight papers or something that you had to read, and you could straight away start thinking about problems that hadn't been explored that much. But on the other hand, you know, there was not really that much of an audience, and I think maybe even there was a bit of a respectability deficit amongst the wider community. amongst the wider communities and and such things. So, well, how the how the subject has changed since then. It's amazing how it's developed and it's really incredible to have a whole room full of people who are so knowledgeable and interested on the subject. So a great privilege and also a little intimidating for me, I have to say. So yeah, polluted So, yeah, polluted bootstrap percolation. So, this is based on joint works with Janko and David from a few years ago, but still ongoing. So, first of all, a little puzzle for you. So, this is a picture that I took earlier on in this trip. So, can anyone tell me what's happening here? De-icing, exactly. De-icing the wings. Wings. So, yeah, so ice on aircraft is a very big deal, very important indeed. So, here are some random pictures. So, you really don't want ice on the important surfaces. It can be very bad. And so, billions of dollars are spent on trying to find ways to mitigate this. And one of the things you might try to do is. And one of the things you might try to do is sort of think about the microscopic properties of the surface of the wings and so on, and how does that affect ice? And well, you know, on the one hand, you have perhaps nucleation centers, so maybe there are places where it's easier for the ice to start growing. And of course, that's what we've been thinking about: nucleation all week. But on the other hand, maybe there are other kinds of defects which There are other kinds of defects which could sort of impede the growth of ice crystals, and you might want to understand how these two effects play against each other, among other things. So that's a little bit of motivation, but as other people have said, we don't really need motivation. So, yeah, so here's the polluted bootstrap model, which Rob already mentioned. So, really, it's just So, so really, it's just another way to say it is: let's do bootstrap percolation on a percolation cluster. Super good point. But here's one way to say it. We have, so I'll always be on ZD for this talk. And in the initial configuration, we have three types of sites. We have occupied sites or infected or active. Or infected or active, whatever you like to see, whatever you like to say. I'm a bit nervous about the word infected. So very early on, when I was at UBC, they wanted to write an article about me and my work for some university newsletter sort of thing. And this reporter, a journalist, interviewed me. And so I tried to describe the bootstrap model. And I started by using the word infected. Do you have these infected, initially infected cells? Initially infected cells, and from this moment on, you know, the person wouldn't let go of the idea of infection. They kept asking me, Well, what about flu? What about this disease? What if it's been for vaccination? No matter what I said, I couldn't shift this idea. So I'm a little bit nervous about infected. So I normally say occupied. So anyway, initially, first of these sites are occupied for Publio DP, exactly the same as normal, but then in addition, we have. But then, in addition, we have closed sites. So, some of the sites are closed, and we could also think of it as polluted or obstacles. So, these are the things that will potentially stop the bootstrap growth. And all the other sites are not closed or open, but initially they're occupied. So, the rest, independent sites, of course. But here's the dynamics, very simple. Occupied sites remain occupied. Sites remain occupied forever, as usual. An unoccupied site, as long as it's an open site, not one of these blue closed sites, becomes occupied. Exactly the same rule as usual, the usual bootstrap rule, if it has at least R occupied neighbours, if it's two D in its neighbours, so exactly the normal bootstrap rule, but closed sites just stay closed forever. Stay closed forever, they're just inert and they cannot become occupied, so they cannot contribute to the occupation. So, clear, very simple. And yeah, so for this talk, I will focus on, I would think this is the most interesting regime, but there may be questions about other regimes. So, I'll focus on the sort of classically. The sort of classically interesting parameters of the bootstrap model. So the threshold R is between 2 and D. So these are sort of the critical models that were the one where you have can fill the lattice, but you have interesting scaling and stuff. And yeah, the interesting regime is, for me at least, is going to be when both P and Q are spots so you have small density. Small density of occupied sites, small density of closed obstacles. Right, so the first paper on this topic is an extremely nice one by Gravener and MacDonald. Almost back in prehistory, but a lot of the work we think about today. So it's very nice. So they looked at the just the most Just the most basic bootstrap model, so in two dimensions and the two-neighbour model. Our favourite, the pi squared over 18 model. And so they asked if you let P and Q go to zero simultaneously, then well, sort of which wins? Does the occupation win or does the pollution prevent the occupation? Prevent the occupation. And right, so it doesn't really make sense to ask about the entire lattice becoming occupied. Of course, closed sites can't become occupied, but also you could have a tiny little contour of closed sites surrounding the region and they will never get occupied. So the thing that makes sense to think about is: just let's ask what's the probability that the origin eventually becomes occupied. Eventually becomes occupied, and well, they showed that the correct scaling is Q versus P squared. So somehow the pollution, the closed sites are much more powerful than the initially occupied sites, right? Because P and Q are very small. So Q is much, much smaller than P. It's the square. And they showed this is exactly the right form of the scaling with two different constants. With two different constants. So if the q is less than the constant of b squared, then the origin with high probability becomes occupied, and the other way around with a different constant, high probability, it doesn't. So it's very nice. And so here's a picture of the model. So blue is closed or polluted, red is initially occupied, and what Watch the picture over here, but the yellow is things that became occupied, and this is the final configuration. So we see what happens is occupation is nicely growing here, but these closed sites in the corners somehow block it. And there's this sort of blocking path forming the boundary of where you can get to. And their proof very carefully analysed these. Very carefully analyzed these blocking paths. And roughly, what do they look like? It's you on the internal corners, like this one, you always have a closed site solving it. And on the edges, like the faces of this interface, well, there you sort of don't have another occupied site anywhere along this face, because that would let you keep going. And this already tells you, at least roughly. Tells you at least roughly where this scaling of q versus p squared might come from. Because if you're sort of in the critical regime where you can just about find these paths, then you kind of want the scale of the steps to be about one over p, because that's sort of critical for whether you can find an occupied site on the face. And on the other hand, these blocking sites, these closed sites, you sort of have a one over peach square. Have a one over p squared area to look for one in, because that's sort of anywhere in this square that potentially got. That's already where the scaling comes from, basically. Right, so obvious questions, then, starting from this point, what about sharp thresholds? Can you replace two constants with a single constant plus or minus epsilon? Usual sort of question. And so, this question. Um and so this question, so I believe there's some progress on it, significant progress by Bisco and Leeds, but I think it's unpublished, but they've made very substantial progress on this, but not completely solved for this model. And there's a real article of Anderson ugly. You could also think about not just the classical two and every model, but but other two dimensional bootstrap rules, all these ones we've been hearing about. All these ones we've been hearing about. I think we have a little bit of progress maybe this week on one of those. But then another question is what about higher dimensions, three dimensions, four dimensions, et cetera. And that's what I'm going to focus on today. But so you want the polluted model of Zd, and again, these parameters, the dimension can be. Parameters, the dimension can be well, I'm kind of interested in three dimensions or not, and then the threshold is anything between two and so for just straight bootstrap percolation, of course, these models all kind of live in the same category, they're critical. So the critical probability is zero, you do fill space, but you have interesting scaling, and of course, the scale. Interesting scaling, and of course, the scaling depends on the choice of R and D, but they're all kind of in the same category in that sense. So, here it turns out there are two sharply different regimes according to whether R equals D or R is strictly less than D. So these are very different. So, in the case R less than D, so think three dimensions with threshold two. With threshold 2. So that already means we're giving the occupation a bit of an advantage, right? Because in three dimensions, you could have threshold 3 and still normal bootstrap percolation does percolate and so on, does it? Does it have critical probability 0? So we're giving the occupation a big boost by saying it only has to have threshold 2. And there's a conjecture by Morris, which he mentioned. Maybe he didn't mention. This is from a very nice. Maybe he didn't mention this. It's from a very nice survey of his. That actually the occupation has a decisive advantage. The occupation just always wins in this regime. So no matter if P and Q go to zero, no matter what way, if both of them are going to zero, then probability of the origin of the company occupied goes to one. It's very striking. The occupation has a decisive advantage. Decisive advantage, not like the polynomial scaling we just saw. And fine, so I'm going to talk about two theorems today. The first one is this conjecture holds in the case of threshold two. So think three dimensions and threshold two. But it also works for higher dimensions as well. Can I just let Q? Can I just let Q be fixed sufficiently small and let it go? Yeah, I think this is equivalent to what I've got. I'm not confusing for these things. But yes. So another way to say, so this probability is clearly monitored in both P and Q, but in opposite directions. So I'm telling you, you can send them both to zero any way you want. So sort of the most extreme way to do it is to send one to zero first. That's the other one. The first the other one is zero, so this is equivalent. So that's tablet. And interestingly, one interesting consequence of this is it implies a phase transition. So if you fix q but let p go to zero, then there is a limit because it's monotone. We call that phi of q. And the theorem tells you that phi for sufficiently small. For sufficiently small q, phi of q is strictly positive, because in fact it goes to one as q gets to it. And on the other hand, by percolation argument, so if q is sufficiently big, then you'll just have closed loops or surfaces or whatever of closed sites. The closed sites will break the space into finite regions, and then when p goes to zero, you won't have any. P goes to zero, you won't have any initially occupied sites in such a region, so phi is zero. So, in between, there is a phase transition in Q. And perhaps you can ask all the questions that you ask about phase transitions, what happens at the critical bio and what about scaling, and so on. No idea whether these questions are easy or difficult, but on the difficult side, I suppose. Do you think it's the same as you prepare density for preparation? No, it's not. No, we can put it that way. No, it's not. No, we can put it that way. Okay. So, right, so then I'll talk about proof, but let me talk about the other theorem first. So, right, so then the other case is when d equals r, and we already talked about two, so think about three, so three dimensions, the three-neighbor rule. So, this remember. Three-neighbor rule. So, this remember, this is the one that has the log-log scaling to it. It's all nuclear calculations. It's a subtle model. So, right, but in the polluted case, it can't be what happened in the previous theorem. So, it can't be that the occupation always wins because there's the det details may be, but there's there's some P versus D scaling with some polynomial under which with positive probability. With all probability well, even the origin is contained in, for instance, a structure like this. So it's a long sausage of width two, and on the ends we have closed sites, and inside we have no initially occupied site. And if you think about it, that structure prevents the origin from getting occupied, and what happens in this ratio. Okay, so it's not like the previous case. The previous case, so we presumably expect some interesting scaling of p versus q again, like in two dimensions. So we sort of move that, except not quite as strong as you would like. So the scaling is roughly now it's q versus p cubed. P cubed, so it was q versus p squared, but we can't quite prove everything we want. We can we sacrifice a log or some logs between the two bounds, and also we can only prove this for the modified model. So it hasn't been talked about, but the modified bootstrap model is another. Classical rule in two dimensions. It's the usual bookstret rule in two dimensions is if you have two occupied neighbours, occupied, the modified rule is you need to have two occupied neighbours, one of them horizontal and one of them vertical. So just left and right when you do it. That's the modified model. So it's very close in relation to the supposed model that we've talked about, but slightly different. And sometimes it's easier to deal with. So, and in general, with R and D, modified model says that you become occupied if at well, you have at least our neighbours occupied, but they have to be in different dimensions. Same dimension, right, left and right, it only counts as one. Left and right, it only counts as one. So that's that those are two ways in which this theorem is not as strong as you would like. And but so if you want to do it for the standard model, it's an open problem to do it for the standard model, we can do it with a p cubed on one side and a p squared on the other, so that's not too good, and a real hack, we can do it for the real model. We can do it for the real model if when you have a polluted site, instead of it being a single site, it's like a little cluster of six, seven, yeah, seven closed sites. Every time we would push some obstacle, you put this instead. So then we can get the backskin. That's a bit of a hack. Um okay, so I don't want to talk about these two thirds. So, yeah, so actually the key tool for bounds in both directions is something that's actually pretty classical and not very. Classical and not very deep, but turns out to be really useful. This is just about percolation models, and it's about finding random-oriented surfaces, like this one, in percolation models. And yeah, so I developed with a bunch of other people, I developed this a few years ago, this technology, and the basic idea of. Technology. And the basic idea of it is that this is just purely about percolation. So we have open and closed sites in ZD. So for high enough density of open sites, you can find an infinite open surface, a surface of open sites, which is Lipschitz in a certain sense. So basically, it has some direction, but it's a But it's allowed to deviate in its local angle, but not too much. And moreover, the lip shapedness can be sort of defined by local constraints, like specific things, like if this site is on the surface, then you can go a nice move, but not diagonally, this sort of thing. So I'll say exactly, but this is the general. Oh, but anything you ask for. Anything you ask for like this, there will be a genuine phase transition photograph of high enough velocity of open times you will be able to find them. So this turns out to be really useful. So yeah, so let me talk about this, the proof of the first theorem. And so again, I'll prove it in this form, which I said was equivalent. So again, this is the So r equals 2, d is bigger than 2, and we're just trying to show that occupation always wins, basically, no matter what we're scaling. So, first of all, it's enough to prove it in three dimensions. There's just an easy algorithm for that. So, we have three dimensions and the two-neighbor rule. And so, here's the idea. So, of course. So of course even ordinary bootstrap calculation without pollution of course succeeds in filling space for any positive p. Whatever. But actually that was true even in Z2, right? With the two neighbor rule, you didn't need to have three dimensions. Okay, so without collision. Okay, so without collision, we've succeeded in two dimensions. But if Q is sufficiently small, if there's sufficiently few closed sites, then we should expect, by the previous remark, that Z3 should actually contain infinite open surfaces. And we might hope that one of those infinite open surfaces should behave like Z2. So on that random open surface, So on that random open surface, we should be able to behave like the two-dimensional model. And that means you build things. So that's the general idea. So, okay, so here are the details. So here so this is simply a theorem of a proposition about percolation again. So there's no P and there's no books about percolation here. No P and there's no here. So we just have Q sufficiently small, so the density of closed sites is sufficiently small. Then I claim that there's an actual threshold below which there exists an infinite surface of a particular type. Here's a picture of it. This is restricted to a finite box, but you should think of it as infinite. Finite box, but you should think of it as infinite in all directions. So, an oriented surface of open site, but it has a very specific characterization. So, if you think of it in layers, in horizontal layers coming up from the bottom, each layer is just an oriented path, south and east-oriented path, as you can see. And I don't want it to be completely straight, so I'm going to say never have three consecutive south steps or three consecutive steps. All the three stuff. That'd be exactly that, but it's convenient. And then when you go from one layer to the layer above, the two paths are sort of close to each other. So specifically, if you're in the surface, then on the bottom level, say, then either the site right above you is in the surface or you move back a bit. So, and I'll say it in specific ways, either that or the way you go above. Where you go above, and then you move back diagonally. That one is it. So it says on each layer we have an oriented path, and the paths are sort of close to each other, and they're sort of sweeping backwards in this specific way as we go up. So that's true. I'll explain how you prove that in a second. Blue is open. Yeah, blue is open, too. Not the same colour as before. Before. Oh, oh, yeah. So, yeah, I forgot to say actually, this is a little bit important as well. So, I want that the sites on the surface, not just the sites on the surface are open, but every site adjacent to it as well. So, actually, the set of open sites is thickened. So, that's true, and I'll talk about why it shouldn't thicken, but note that if you had such a surface, then it turns out you. Turns out you can do bootstrap percolation on it successfully. So, if layer zero of such an infinite surface was completely occupied, bottom path, and if there was just one occupied site on the layer above it, on layer one, then it turns out that layer one becomes completely occupied by the two neighbour butcher. So, you know, you have to. Bootstrap or so you know you have to check something here, but it it's it's not very hard. If you're uh if if the layer one was right on top of layer zero, then you automatically have one occupied data from below, so then it's easy to just fill it and hop up. And then when it's slightly back, you know, s some of the other sites on level zero become occupied, like this one right behind it becomes occupied, so there's some backfilling and and hacking. Backfilling and having checked your shells, but it just works. Right, so this is our outline of what we want. So, okay, so first of all, then how do we prove this proposition? So, this is an example of this oriented surface technology, lipstick surface technology that I've dealt with about. So, we have a general technique for proving things like this, and as I said, it's sort of Like this. And as I said, it's sort of classical. It's actually just how do you prove that oriented percolation in the plane has a phase transition? So you have to, one direction is you just prove that small parameter you don't percolate. That's sort of the easy side, but then the other side, you normally do it by duality. That's a percolation 101 proof of it. Proof of it. So you look for the things that block the oriented paths, and you find that's kind of an interesting kind of path, but then you count those things. That's how you do it. It's not an exercise if you teach a percolation course. So it's just the extension of this. So first thing is for the proof, we could get rid of this or adjacent to because. This or adjacent to because this is by Sean and Stacey. You can compare the process of sites such that it and each of its neighbours are all open. You can compare that with a product measure, but there's something into commercial, but we were only trying to show things sufficiently. We were only trying to show things sufficiently small cube, so we can forget about that. And then, okay, so here's how we do it. So we start with some half space, and again, this is just percolation, you know, that we start from some half space perpendicular to this record, works in this case, so one more one, and then we look at the set of sites that are reachable from that half space. Reachable from that half space using paths of a certain special kind. So, the special kind is you're allowed to take various kinds of steps, like all these and this kind of steps. These are the directions you can go away from this surface. They're all on one side of the surface. And this is the kind of up step, but actually, here's the surface. So, if you take a step of this kind, So, if you take a step of this kind, then there's a condition: the site that you move to has to be a closed site. And then it's kind of you can go up if you're going to a closed site. But when you go down, which means any of these directions, and they're kind of somehow sliding down the pattern in some sense, you're allowed to do those for free. So you start from the surface, you take paths where if you go up, you have to pay, there has to be a closed like that, but when you go down, and it's going down a specific path. And it's going down specific directions. You can just do that whenever you want. And you look at the set of sites that are reachable. And then it turns out, just by pretty classical path counting arguments, this A that you can reach, well, it's not the whole of the lattice. Basically, you can't reach too far above the plane that you see. The above the plane that you started from. It's just a path cut. Does the tax come into this definition? How does it what, sorry? Where does the tax come in? To the to what? To what I just said? To the definition. Of this subspace, of this set A? By tax I mean it has to be a close, you have to move to a closed set. That's the tax. Yeah, sorry. So yeah, because I don't expect you to. So, yeah, because I don't expect you to follow all the details, but it's not actually hard to do things like this. And then the point is: this red set really actually stays close to the base plane if Q is sufficiently small. It has counting argument and has exponential decay, it's of the height which is. And moreover, the upper boundary of it, so the site is not in A, but the site. Not in A, but the site just below them, is that the surface that I want. So if this is closed, you can see that, because if one of these sites were closed, it would have included this. And then it turns out because of all this stuff, it has this nice literature that we want. And it's a bit of a black art. So, how you sort of, for me at least, how you, for any particular specification, how you choose these things. You choose these things, but once you're at USD, it's not to construct things like this. So, anyway, that's the groove. And then, okay, so we're sort of, it feels like we're almost done, right? Because we have this nice surface, and we argued that that surface is fertile for bootstrap percolation. And it's open, so there are no closed sites and no obstructions. But we have to be a bit Obstructions. But we have to be a bit careful because we have to sort of get started. So here's how we did this. There's a renormalization argument as well. So here is a piece of our surface, but now I do restrict it to a box. And the sort of idea is, suppose this bottom edge is full, then I'm going to fill the whole thing. But one problem is that because of the angling of the surface, the Angling of the surface, the path gets smaller as you go up. It's sort of getting pushed to the back. That's kind of a problem, right? Because this occupied region is shrinking and we don't have to fill everything. So we rescale the dot and we rescale the lattice as well, just by a constant factor. You scale it by 10 in this direction and 3 in this direction or something. And it's still true. So still, say with high probability, if you make a box with appropriate size, there is the Size, there is this random surface, a bit like a sail in it, and then we can fit those sails together. So I've organised it so that if we put another sail in this direction, because you can have them in any direction you want, right? Then it intersects. And if this one is infected, occupied, bottom, then it causes this one to get occupied as well. And then you can piece cells together and you can do a localization occupization activity. So that was that proof. And again, remember, we used the random surface to facilitate growth. We grew or constructed a careful surface such that you can, such that the occupation can grow upon it. It's asked me at the beginning: am I on the side, am I for or against pollution? And at least for this talk, you know, I want to keep switching sides depending on which band I'm coming with. Right, so now let's talk about this. Pro-pollution or pro-infection. Exactly. So, right, so now let's prove this. So, again, this is now three dimensions and the three. Three dimensions and the three neighbor role, and I'm going to show this interesting q versus q scaling. So that direction, so what is this? This is where I am on the side of the occupation. I want the occupation to become occupied. So this is actually a consequence of the last theorem and the little renormalization argument. And maybe I. And maybe I would say but this, but it's actually very simple. You do a renormalization, you define some kind of good boxes which allow occupation to spread, be transmitted by them. And then there are some other boxes that are just completely occupied. And you do a renormalization, and you find on the level of the big box. Find on the level of the big boxes, you are doing the r equals 2 model, which we already know about by the last theorem. And we use almost the full power of the last theorem, which says that occupation wins no matter what the P and Q and here by renormalised P and Q a horrible because I said the whole box has to be honest, but it doesn't matter because it says occupation just wins no matter what. So, yeah, maybe I'll learn a bit later this, but Maybe I went a bit later this, but it's not. Okay, so now the other direction. So now I'm on the side of collision. So now I'm trying to show that the origin does not become occupied. So I'm trying to protect the origin from occupation somehow with high probability. So So we're again going to construct a surface. So we're again going to construct surfaces, and now we're doing it for the opposite purpose, like protective surfaces rather than fertile surfaces. So we want to protect the origin. And okay, to understand this, let's start by just trying to protect. So here's the origin, and let's try to protect from occupation coming from. Occupation coming from just one direction. So let's say perpendicular, well, from the direction minus one on one, say, imagine there's this huge wave, tidal wave of occupation coming from that direction, trying to occupy the origin, and I want to see maybe I can stop it, hopefully. So, first of all, just with no sites and no other occupied sites, if you start with Occupied. So if you start with a half space perpendicular to 111, then just automatically the next layer becomes occupied. So if everything in this half space is occupied, then the next layer just gets occupied for free because I've given the diagram direction. Each of these sites just above has three neighbours. So if there are no closed sites, then this, then a tidal wave coming in the diagonal. A tidal wave coming in the diagonal direction is just unstoppable. But I do have closed sites. So, what would happen if I had this one closed site, say, at the origin? I'm not doing any probability. I don't understand what the model does. So, I've flipped the picture upside down to make it easy to see, but we have this wave of occupation coming in from Coming in from diagonal direction, sorry, up here towards the page, and suppose there's just one closed site here, what will happen? Actually, this will protect the whole offline octet behind it. If you think about it, this wave and everything comes down, but then this site doesn't become occupied, and and actually then everything in the octant behind it stays unoccupied. Stays unoccupied. It's just one closed site in the absence of everything else and protects this whole thing. But of course, which is not as simple as that. We have other occupied sites, which we don't like. Now we're on the side of the pollution remember. So if somewhere on each of these positive axes, Positive axes, there is an initially occupied site, which there will be, of course, if you look far enough along the line to find an occupied site. Then again, the projection breaks down. So you only need to get to this side and you can just get in and fill the whole bridge. Okay, so that's no good, but on the other hand, we have more closed sites as well. Unless you find another prototype on the head, but if over here you find another one of these protected oxidants, sort of up a bit in this direction, before you find an occupied site on this line, then we're good again for the moment. Find another one in each of these directions, and then of course these need protection as well. These need protection as well, so you're going to need to find another one and another one. But potentially, this could stem the flow of occupation. So you can do this, and turns out that this we need precisely this cube scaling. And again, it's because the reason for the scaling is that when you look for occupied sites, which you hope are not there, you look at them linearly along a line, and when you Linearly along a line, and when you look for closed sites, you look at them in a whole volume. So, yeah, so using this and using the oriented surface technology as well, you can construct a random surface that looks a little bit like this. And on each of the protruding corners, you have a closed site, and on each of the protruding edges that you can see, the output-facing edges, you have no. Edges, you have no initially occupied sites. And the whole thing has to be random, right? It has to, you have to allow some fluctuation, otherwise, it's a little fluctuation behind this. But it does exist, and the scale of the steps is one over p. And if you have such a thing, then occupation coming from this direction gets stopped. So that's good. But of course that's not enough for the proof because the origin needs protection from all directions. We really want to show in the actual model the origin does not become occupied. So the solution to this, of course, is a stegosaurus. So, what's the idea? So, the Stegosaurus needs protection as well because there are lots of other dinosaurs that are trying to eat it. And so, it has very, very thick skin, of course, quite hard, but some parts of it are more vulnerable. So, its back, its spine, is a lot more vulnerable because it has a lot more exposed directions. So, that's why it has the armour plates on its vulnerable spine to protect it even. On its vulnerable spine to protect it even more there. And like maybe the head and tail are even more vulnerable, so they have even further extra protection mechanisms. Okay, so here is our spectrosylvis. Okay, so what is this? So, first of all, I want to take, remember this random surface I just drew. Random surface I just drew, I basically want eight of these sort of roughly on the sides of an octahedron surrounding the origin, so that I protect the origin from all directions. That's the level zero idea. But then, okay, when two of them meet at a seam, we obviously have to be careful. And remember, each of these little cubes, you have a Little cubes, you have a closed site right at the pinnacle of it. These are the closed sites are basically what's doing all the work for us. And then, when you follow the edges back, you have to hit something else fairly soon before you encounter an occupied site. That's the idea. But then, if you're right on this seam, I mean, consider one of the closed sites that's right out here, sort of an extremal one out in this direction. One out in this direction, then that one can't actually protect a three-dimensional cube anymore because it has the three orthogonal lines, so two of them go into the big belly of the beast, but two of them go out this way and this way, two of the lines, and those lines aren't going to get protected by anything else because you're extremely in this direction. So, actually, you have a close eye out here. You have a close site out here, it can only protect a plate, a one-dimensional plate. And you can see some things on here, and they're actually flat regions. So we need these. But that's good, right? Because they can attach these cubes from the side and from the other side. So the Stegosaurus has a row of plates along its back, and actually, we kind of want two rows of plates for sort of technical reasons to inside. So it's even more like a So, it's even more like a sphere server. And by the way, this is why the argument doesn't work. This is why we need to be for the modified model. This is why it doesn't work for the standard model, because a thickness one plate in the standard model gets infected because you have things on two sides of it collapses. Okay, so we have that. But then remember the head and the tail of the stegosaurus are even more vulnerable. Stegosaurus are even more vulnerable. So, if you imagine the, I have a construction like this, and you think about the very topmost closed site of the ones that I'm using to create this protective shield, the very, very top one. So that's even worse. So, these ones could only protect a plate, but the one at the very top can only protect a line, because in the other four directions, you're going to encounter site. So, all the very top. So, so the all the very top one is doing is protecting a line going down into the beast. And that's kind of useless. That doesn't really help anybody else. It doesn't help you protect one of these or the plane. A line does nothing. So that's kind of bad news because if you think about then the second highest closed site, that's not getting any help from anyone. And then so that's useless. And then the third highest is useless as well. So actually, the whole thing is going to unravel. The whole thing is going to unravel from the corners and useless. So, our solution to this is actually very crude in a way. We put what we call a headstone. We just put a giant block on the top of this thing. And what is this block? It's each of the eight corners must have a closed site right there at the corner. And then the edges must have no occupied sites. Which have no occupied sites. So it's very costly to find that. So everything else was based on percolation arguments. So until this point, the probability that I would succeed in finding a surface like this is maybe like a half, no matter how big it is. It's just percolation arguments, and this is critical relevant thing. But this is hugely costly. This costs me like Q to the eight because I have, at least, because I have eight corners in specific. Eight corners in specific places, and they all have to be close. So super costly, you can do it more cleverly, but it's still cured to some power. Okay, so yeah, so there are two loads of plates on the seams, and then this is the keystone. And right, so of course it's a problem that it's expensive because I want to say that the origin is protected with high probability. So tiny probability like this is no good for not. Tiny pop of interlock, this is no bit fit. Um, but uh, and of course, I want to put a keystone on each of the corners, so then it's like q to the 48 or something cost. But I can keep on trying. So I try to find this surface surrounding the origin, and I try to put the keystones on the corners. And of course, normally I fail, because the keystones are phenomenally unlikely. If I fail, I just try a slightly bigger one. Fail, I just try a slightly bigger one. I forget everything I did, and I try to construct a slightly bigger surface around that. Probably I fail, then I try again, and I try again, and I try again, and how many attempts will it take me? Well, roughly one over the cost of the keystones. Q to the 48 or Q to the 50 or something. So this is very, very big, but it's polynomial in Q, so polynomial in P, it's the same thing. Over the P, it's the same thing, in my scaling. So five minutes. Yeah. So, okay, so I have this structure. Still something else I have to worry about. So again, I have closed sites at all the exposed corners that you can see, both these ones and these ones and these ones. ones and these ones and these ones and I have basically I said I want to have on the exposed edges the black every black line I want to have no occupied sites initially occupied sites and this ought to protect the origin from any occupation from outside but there's another problem inside the stegosaurus you still have You still have the bootstrap rule going on. Still, things happening. And now it's quite big, right? So all sorts of things can happen inside it, and they might infect the origin. Or, much worse, if the dynamics inside pierces a face of this. Face of this, then I'm in trouble. So, edges are okay because they have no occupied touch, but maybe, but the faces can leak. So, if I pierce a face, then suddenly the outside and the inside can interact with the face, and everything could fall apart. So, I have to deal with that. But, so, how big is this thing? Well, it's something like this: it's some huge power of. Some huge power of huge, not that huge, 50 million. So that's big, but actually that's sort of that's small for bootstrap percolation, right? Because for ordinary bootstrap percolation with no pollution, you know, we have this Eisen-Liebenbitz picture with the nucleation centers and so on. So the critical size is like basically exponential in one. Exponential in one over big. The same for this. So that's actually much, much bigger. So this thing is big after all these attempts, but nowhere near that big. It's polynomial in p, not e to the minus one over p. So actually, we can say a lot about the internal dynamics, and just by Eisen and Liebitz bounds, basically, the internal dynamics, even if Internal dynamics, even if there were no closed sites, just the normal bootstrap dynamics inside, doesn't produce very large clusters. So if this is a constant, then there's just a constant that you get no clusters of diameter bigger than something inside. And actually, that's true even if you take r equals 2. So my r was 3, but even if you take the r equals to 2 dynamics, that's still a critical bootstrap dynamics. It has a A single exponential scale instead of a double one. So that's still true, and that matters because on the faces, on the faces, you might have occupation outside. So the faces get a free occupied neighbour. But if I'm just doing arguments too inside, it means I'm still okay and you can't interact through the faces. And finally, that actually means I was lying about the construction because when I said that I want That I want no occupied site on the edges, actually, that's not enough anymore because you have these things growing inside, so I have to say there's no initially occupied site within distance 4,000 of an edge. But, okay, so that means I have to redo the whole thing more carefully. And the way we do it, it's like pretty, you know, this is a pretty picture, but it sort of hides 30 pages of hard grind actually. To find actually doing all this, and of course, you have to choose the constants in the right order. And the way I described it, you might be a bit suspicious that affect those and so on, but yeah, it's just a matter of choosing the constants in the right order. So finally, so open questions, I guess I basically talked about them. You can ask about sharp thresholds for all these things. Very nice. Very nice open question. It's to show that occupation wins in general for G greater than R. I think maybe some of us have a few ideas for R equals 3 at least. But yeah, the problem with all these things is you sort of feel like going to higher dimensions or higher R, you feel like there's no fundamental obstacle because it's sort of the same thing, but when it comes to the details, you just. When it comes to the details, you just really, really have to work to understand the exact geometry at the lattice level. There seems to be no way of getting around this, and it just gets harder and harder as you add dimensions. So that's kind of the obstacle. So maybe the solution to it is to find cleaner versions of the curves so that we can extend them better. And yeah, of course, removing the logs and making it for the standard model, instead of source for the standard model. So the starting model and yeah, and four-dimensional stegotons. Yeah, so lots of open problems. Any questions for Andrew? Thank you, Mr. Tops generalists about state service. Major talks to journalists about technology. So, for the higher powers, do you think it's going to be like Q versus P to the D? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, higher-dimensional universality paper for separate from detail. I mean, here it has, but it has these very similar things. So there they construct their 2B surfaces in a different way. But my point is you can construct them in my curvature, construct them on a monthly scale, that's fine. But perhaps the way they'd be there would be once you have the surfaces, put them together in Put them together, they always be easier than constructing this. Yeah, so for us, I mean, for what we did, actually constructing the surfaces isn't hard. I mean, it looks hard when I show it on the site, but it's not once you on the side, but when they join together, that's that's where things get heavy. So they also have some problems. Also, it's a bit more difficult. I don't know. I don't know what it is. Same sort of idea. It's actually quite a nice idea. And actually, you know, I mean, if you just wanted to construct the surface, then actually the way we do it is not by taking eight copies, it's just we do the duality thing a split one go on the for the octahedron. For the octahedron, but but but that's still not enough because we need the plates, right? Plates of the stegosaurus just because of the actual model is not necessary. But yeah, the geocentric views actually avoid blades and also it somehow takes the complementary viewpoints where you are trying to protect the things from the outside, there they are trying to prevent things from growing their right. Right, and like maybe one of the holy grills in this sort of thing is for the surface or whatever that you use for the upper and lower bands to be basically the same wall, right? So then they clearly matter. So then they clearly match. And this is sort of what you did in your paper a long time ago, right? For the two-dimensional model, really, you have these blocking contours, but you can understand them so well that the one band is showing that you have contours and the other is showing that you don't. Same ones. Any other questions? Online? Anyone? Anyone? So
