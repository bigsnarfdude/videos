Of collegiate unitaries. So first, let's say what the two-dimensional version is, and let's motivate this with the following question. So, suppose we have un and dn, which are kn by kn unitaries, and asymptotically in operator norm, they commute with each other. And notice the dimension here can go to infinity. Can we find u n prime and vn prime, which commute with each other on the nose? And again, asymptotically an operator norm, they get closer and closer to the ones we started with. Get closer and closer to the ones we started with. So the answer to this is no. And here is the counterexample that I claim is two-dimensional, and we will find the four-dimensional version. So what is this? Un cyclically commutes the standard basis and vn is all the nth roots of unity in order on the diagonal kind of going around the circle. And if you calculate their multiplicative commutator, you get this primitive nth root of unity times the identity. Primitive nth root of unity times the identity. And that is the operator normal of that minus one is kind of above two pi over n, so that goes to zero. Okay, why can't we change these a little bit to get two actually commuting unitaries? And so this is originally, I guess this argument goes back to Kajdan. I think it's just a chef's kiss of a mathematical argument, so I'll try to go through it here. It here. So take trace of log of this multiplicative computator, and we get minus 2πi. And if we were close to a commuting pair of unitaries, as I've written here, you could make a homotopy from Un and Vn to their commuting brethren just by walking in a straight line from one to the other. And if we just define log to be a power series centered at one, then since these commute with each other, and this, you know, everywhere along this path is pointing. This, you know, everywhere along this path is close to here, everywhere along this path is close to here, we can guarantee that this multiplicative commutator is within one at every step along this homotope, and so we're allowed to take the log at any point just with a power series. And now, since we take this trace of log at every point, I claim this has to give us something in 2π IZ. Why is that? IIZ. Why is that? Well, if you do expo trace of log and think about what happens to the eigenvalues, well, first we take the log of each eigenvalue, then we add them all together, and then we exponentiate them. And if you think about that process, you could have instead just multiplied them, and that would give you the determinant. But now we have the determinant of a commutator, and the determinant of a commutator is going to be one. And the subset of the complex numbers that is, I guess, in The complex numbers that is, I guess, in the kernel of the exponential math is exactly 2π. So that's where we have to be. And now that means this trace of log of a commutator, it can't change along our homotopy because we're trapped in this discrete space. And trace, log, and these paths, they're all continuous. And that's a contradiction. Why is that? Well, we start, our homotopy starts at 2πi. And if we end with two things that commute with each other, then their commutator is 1. With each other, then their commutator is one, the log of that is zero, and so we ended somewhere different than we started. So that means they can't be close to things that actually commute with each other. And I will refer to this as the winding number argument. For historical reasons, you can reframe this in terms of a winding number, but I won't. Okay. So let's put this in a more general context. So we've seen a bit. So, we've seen a bit about stability, and here we're talking about stability in the operator norm. So, to review, we have a group is metricially stable if every sequence of functions, so that pointwise in operator norm, this defect to being multiplicative goes to zero, that should imply that there's a sequence of actual representations of the group. That, again, pointwise in operator norm, get closer and closer to the things we started with. And again, the dimension is finite, but is a latter. Dimension is finite but is allowed to go to infinity. And so if your group is Z2, then that is equivalent to the motivating question I started with. So Z2 is not nutritionally stable. Okay, so here is, I guess, a very nice general theorem that tells us that a lot of groups are not nutritionally stable by Marius. So if gamma is a group that Is a group that obeys some very broad conditions that I won't get into, and it has even cohomology that it's not matricially stable. So, any linear or any amenable group will not be matricially stable if it has even cohomology. And so, this is nice, but it doesn't tell you how to actually make these asymptotically multiplicative maps that show you the group is not nutritionally stable. From stable. So here's a weaker theorem that lets you do that in a specific case with two cohomology. So the group is virtually polycyclic and it has two cohomology, then you can actually make the example. And it's more general than virtually polycyclic, but also this is, I don't want to write something super technical here. So yeah, here we go. So the goal of this talk. The goal of this talk is to sort of give an example that recognizes this, you know, higher cohomology instructions as opposed to just the second. And you can think of Vojkulescu's example as this theorem, I guess, is generalizing that example, but they recognize this two-cohomology obstruction, which is, I guess, why I say they're two-dimensional. And if we could get, for example, an almost. Get, for example, an almost representation of Z4 that recognizes the four-cohomology of structure, and that would be the four-dimensional analog, which is what we're hunting for. Okay. So, you know, why do we want explicit examples? So I'm going to give three reasons here. The first one is, even though we're functional analysts here and we believe in free ultrafilters and the Han-Bonnock theorem, Theorem. There's a voice in me that when I hear they exist, but we don't know how to make them. Are these asymptotic homomorphisms? Are they in the room with us right now? Can we actually see them? And I think it is much more satisfying, at least for me personally, to be able to write these things down and look at them. And I think that also is a nice way to get intuition about what they look like. It's much more satisfying. But maybe you don't. Is much more satisfying. But maybe you don't care about that. So here's an application of sort of the two-pohmology case: is that a finitely generated Hilpoin group is Frobenius stable. So this is stability in the unnormalized Hilbert Schmidt monument, if and only if it's virtually cyclic. And this contrasts a result that a couple of our speakers have spoken about. So Ari and Gittemar have proved it, as well as Caleb and Tatiana-Schulman independently showed it, that in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, these groups are all stable. These groups are all stable. So I think this is kind of nice that it shows it really does matter whether or not you normalize. Okay? And here's our third motivation. So these two cohomology techniques, they sort of rhyme with some things in Hilbert Schmidt's stability, like specifically stuff that Audrey and Matthew and Peter Spass have made and also Lone. So since three of those people are here, I think it might be good. Those people are here. I think it might be good to sort of show this four cohomology examples. It would be very cool if there is a rhyming analog in the Hilbert Schmidt world. And also less cool, but maybe still interesting if there's not. Okay, so what are the sort of invariants that kind of go into Marius's group? So for any group, we can associate a topological space, B gamma, the classical. Logical space, B gamma, the classifying space. And I won't get into how exactly you do this. And I'm going to assume that it's a finite CW complex just to make the theorems more manageable. They're sort of analogues of everything I'm saying in the more general case, but I don't want to get into them. And to an almost multiplicative map, we can associate a vector bundle over V gamma. And then we can calculate these topological invariants of the vector bundle, call them turn characters. Variants of the vector bundle called turn characters, and these are going to give us in the 2k cohomology. So the kth one gets the 2kth cohomology of the group. And so the first one is sort of the two-dimensional obstruction, the second one is the four-dimensional obstruction, and then the sixth-dimensional obstruction, and so on. And if any of these are non-zero, then this can't be close to an actual representation. Okay, that is all I have to say. Okay, that is all I'm missing. So that's, I guess, kind of an outline of what we're trying to do. We're trying to find things that realize these higher term characters. Okay, let's sort of, I guess, make the winding number argument more general, and that will start with explaining a little bit about two-homology of a group as opposed to co-homology. So if the group is a free group mod sum relations, then we can think of two homology as sort of the group. Can think of two homology as sort of the group of relations in the commutator subgroup modded out by subtrivial ones. So, for example, if our group is Z2, the fact that the generators commute with each other generates the tuomology. And so, in the winding number argument, we can start with a homogenous relation. So, all of the commutators henceforth are going to be multiplicative commutators, not additive commutators. Just to save the Just to save a little bit of space. So we have this product of commutators and we have an almost representation. So then we can sort of push forward this product of commutator relations, take the trace of log and divide by 2 pi i. And by the argument I gave sort of at the beginning of the talk, this is going to have to be an integer. And if it's a non-zero integer, then you can't be close to an actual representation. So we can kind of view this as a machine. So, we can kind of view this as a machine that takes in a two-homology class and an almost representation, and it spits out an anti-trap. So, abstractly, we can now sort of understand, connect this machine to the techniques that Marius uses. So, we have a group, and B gamma is a finite CW complex, and we have a two-homology class. So, we can take the first turn character of our value. Character of our vector bundle. And then, if we have, this is a two-homology class, this is a two-homology class, sorry, this is a two-cohomology class, and we can pair them with the chronic repairing to get an integer. And that integer is exactly the one we got from the winding number argument. So this winding number argument, it really is measuring this turn character obstruction that Marius uses. And there's a non-trivial last step that we did, but I want to say that a lot of, you know, most of the work probably follows from Mulder results of Marius, and then it goes back to Warwick of Marius and joint work that he did with Jose Carrion. And the original inception, I think, go back to XLMR. So now, how do we build things that realize the first? Things that realize the first turn character. So, something we can use is what's called a projective representation, and that means that rho of g times rho of h, this sort of failure to be multiplicative here, is given by a scalar value function, which we will call a cocycle. And so, here, if you have a projective representation and the co-cycle kind of comes from a rational value cocycle, then it sort of follows from computations that are. Of follows from computations that are implicit in my previous work and the theorem on the last slide that the first Turing character of the vector bundle we associate to this almost representation is the cosycle we started with times this thing that I guess describes the character on Z that takes us to the circle and the dimension of the representation. So this turns out Uh so this this trend character for a projective representation it gives you the co-cycle back okay all right so uh what should the four-dimensional analog of Voigtalesku's unitaries like actually be? So we want an asymptotic representation from Z4 to kn by Kn unitaries, and we want the second term character now to be non-zero. And just to sort of isolate the second term Just to sort of isolate the second Shurn curve, you know, to get something where you couldn't just instead use the classical winding number argument, we want the first one to go away. And that is equivalent by the theorem on the last slide to just taking every pair of the generators, taking trace of log of their commutator that should be zero. So this sort of winding number invariant goes away. But this higher four-dimensional You know, four-dimensional obstruction should tell us that we are still far from an actual representation. Okay? And so now that we know what we are looking for, here it is. So we actually built it from Vojkalesku's unitary, so I'll put them back here. And so the first generator of z to the 4, you know, you can, you have u n, you know, tensored with one, and then 1, and then UN tensored with 1 again. And here we go, Vn. So if you look at the first tensor coordinate here, you kind of like get the Voigtalesky unitaries on the first two generators. But now we have Un and Vn star in this second direct sum. So you can check that these sort of cancel each other out. And the same thing happens here, except now we're doing everything in the second tensor coordinate. And since these are in the first tensor coordinates and these are in the second tensor coordinates, Tensor coordinates, and these are in the second tensor coordinates. You know, E1 actually commutes with E3 on the nodes. One of the first two and one of the second two will commute on the nose. And then you can check the winding numbers of these pairs that cancel out. Okay. So how do we know that this observes the so what about if you choose any of any term that would um that is uh That is not obvious one way or the other because there are, like, there's an argument, I think, originally due to Gong and Lin, but like also Eiler, Schulman, and Sorensen, where you can kind of embed the two torus and the three torus in a way that kills the reduced K-theory. And it follows from that that there should be in Z3 obstructions where all the topological invariants go away that you can't perturb them. What I can say is that. What I can say is that if you had three of them and you just only looked at those, you could add like an honest representation of Z3, like direct sum, an honest representation of Z3, then perturb it. So you have this kind of, yeah. But for this, you couldn't add an honest representation because the second term character would still show you, would still not go away. Would still not go away. Okay, so yeah, so I'll go on to explain why this actually gives you an interesting example. So we're going to define the total Turing character to just be the sum of all of these. And we assume that B gamma is a finite CW complex, so this is actually a finite sum. And this is actually a ring homomorphism. And this is actually a ring homomorphism in the sense that if you tensor two vector bundles together, you get the cut product for an algebraic topology. And if you direct sum two vector bundles, you get the sum. And the vector bundles associated to the almost representations, they also respect tensor products and direct sums in the way you want them to. And then the generator of the top form on Z4 is a cut product of two different two cohomology classes. So going back to the example, Going back to the example, these first two are kind of giving you one two-cohomology class, if you just look at this coordinate, and these next two are giving you the other one, and then we tensor them together, so that kind of gives you something in the fourth cohomology. And it turns out, rather than canceling out in the fourth cohomology, when you add these two things, they actually add together instead of canceling each other out. Alright. So, how general can we make this? So, let's say we have a discrete group with a finite CW complex, and we have a four-cohomology class that you can write as a cup product of two different two-cohomology classes. And we have projective representations whose co-cycles they kind of come from these, I guess, let's say these are rational two-cohomology classes. Cohomology classes. Then we should be able to get something non-zero. And there's sort of a technicality that I'm sweeping under the rug here, which is these might already have second turn characters, but you can do kind of a case by case. You can always get something. And so the big problem with this technique is: you know, the group already has to have two cohorts. So not only that, you have to. So, not only that, you have to actually be able to get something that realizes the two co-oblogic constructions. So, you won't really be able to find examples for new groups, but I still think finding new examples is interesting. And, you know, for the sort of the basic example that I use to motivate this is Z2. I think Z4 is sort of the simplest example. So, just even getting that, I think, is a good starting place. And we do have some more complicated examples, which when we put the paper on archive, you can look at, or if you want, you can talk to you about it or Laurius, I guess. Oh no. Okay. Well, here's the 6D version and the China's run. Questions? So the examples that you give are always cup products, not two cohomology classes. So my question is: probably you need to go maybe to Z to V8, I guess, to make more sense. I would like an example, a four-comology example, which does not arise in any way from two homology. Yes, I would like that too. So, yeah, so like one example that Marius cooked up that should be sort of a reasonable group to look at is the instead of Is the instead of the H3 Heisenberg group, the H5 Heisenberg group? This, you can kind of show with the Gisson sequence that the 4-cohomology doesn't arrive as a cut product, but it's still sort of a very nice Georgian-free finitely generated nil-coding group. But in order to make this, I think I'll one, we'll have to I'll have to think very hard about geometry or it's not it's not it's definitely not as easy. I'll see It's definitely not as easy. C2D8 is not okay for this. Yeah, because the Kunith formula just kind of tells you that everything is actually a cut product of one cohomology classes. And then if you're even, you can just pair them off with each other. So does the method completely break down if instead of like cop product of two cocycles, you have a cop product of four cosycles? Um, like imagine you have, like, you don't have two cohomologies. Yeah, yeah. A cohomology, but it does arise as a pump product. Yeah, so I think this should work. Um, that you mean, yeah, like the method should work? Yeah, it should work. Um, I mean, someone has to give you, I guess, like two, four cohomology examples to start with. But, you know, once you have those, in principle, you should be able to do it. And you might have some kind of problems if, like, if they don't sort of isolate the four. If they don't sort of isolate the four cohomology, you might get some extra terms you don't want, and it might not be obvious how to cancel them out. But in theory, that should work. The thing is, you need the four-cohomology example already to start with, and the only way I know how to make that so far is with the cut product of two tuco-opology classes. You mean you can't realize these four homology classes using These four home classes using representation? Yeah, I don't know how to realize those yet. And there's some kind of geometric techniques that Maurice and I thought about to start with. But it turns out that once we realize this, it's a lot easier. So that's one direction we might go, but I can't make any promises about that yet. So, I guess the short answer is yes, if you had such an example for 4-cohomology, it should get you one for 8-cohomology. But the only examples I have for 4-cohomology already kind of come from 2-cohomology in some sense. Nutritional stability, could you point out a reference that I have taken? A reference that I can take a look at because I'm interested. I want to know about like the list of groups, or I mean, like, is there some paper where this is summarized nicely? Yeah, so I guess a nice survey paper is Eiler Schulman and Sorensen, but they wrote it before Marius' result, so it doesn't include that. Marius's paper, like, you know, It is a very good general result, but it's not elementary to read. So I don't know of a good survey paper after that that sort of says, I think I misspoke a little bit about survey paper. They have a lot of new results, but it is also a good summary. Thank you. I think that's all. Yeah, nice to see you everyone.
