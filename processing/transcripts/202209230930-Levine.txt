Today, we're going to look back at this Euler characteristic. And then, if I have time at the end, I'm going to say a little bit about the localization methods that tell us about computing numbers of twisted cubics on hypersurfaces and complete intersection. So, yeah, we'll look first at these Euler characteristics. And there, you remember the original definition was we take this symmetric monoidal category. So, this is SHFK. We'll treat this today as the blackest of black boxes. And I'll show you just a few of the buttons you need to press in order to use it. So, don't get scared. It doesn't really bite, it doesn't matter. It doesn't really bite, it doesn't matter. But what do we know about this? It's a triangulated symmetric monoidal category, and we have this other category. Well, we have smooth varieties over K, and there's a natural Yomeda map to spaces over K, which are, by definition, pre-sheaves. Of simplicial sets. In fact, we're only going to be using pre-sheaves of sets today. So you don't like simplicial sets so much on smooth varieties over k. And this is this, you know, you need a map where we consider a set as a constant simplicial set, discrete simplicial set, right? And x, well, And x well, I put a little point here, so I'll put pointed simplicial sets. X goes to, just call it X plus, where X plus sends Y to maps here from Y to X, union disjoint base point. Okay, so it's very simple gadget. Very simple gadget. And then there's an infinite suspension functor here. So just all this. Okay, so that's just notation, but it just means every smooth variety determines an infinite suspension object, sort of P1 infinite suspension in here. And the important thing for us. And the important thing for us, these are all dualizable. And so they have an Euler characteristic. Remember, a dualizable object X in some symmetric monoidal category gives an endomorphism of the unit. This is the diagonal map, the evaluation map, and this. Evaluation map, and this is the Euler characteristic. And so we have this quadratic Euler characteristic. This by definition is the Euler characteristic in here of this gadget, whatever it is, doesn't matter. And this lives in In the endomorphisms of the unit. The unit is the sphere spectrum. The sphere spectrum, I'll write it like this, but this is just the infinite suspension spectrum of spec K. And then we have the theorem of Morel, which tells us that this is the Groten-Eck-Widering of quadratic forms over K. So that's the gadget we're interested in. And today, And today, yeah. So, right. So, today we're going to try and get at this thing, but I have to say a little bit more in order. I mean, my goal is to state the motivic Gauss-Bonnet theorem or a sort of version of it. And that has to do with how this thing maps into, given a cohomology theory, it will map into the units of the cohomology. map into the units of the cohomology theory. And so I have to say a little bit about what are cohomology theories, motivic cohomology theories. So this is again, I have to give you a few buttons that you can press. So first of all, we have for any X say a smooth variety over K. smooth variety over k and any z inside of x closed then we have we can again we consider these as pre-sheaves and you take the quotient pre-sheaf this makes perfect good sense as a quotient as a pre-sheaf and this gives you and the base point would be everything mapping to the bottom term and this gives you a perfectly good object in here. Okay. Can you say again what you mean? So the quotient is this the quotient of as precise, right? So for any y, you have x of y, the maps, and then there's a map. Well, z is a, you know, you have x minus z of y. A Y. It's a map of sets. Right? And you just take, you send this thing, this subset to a point. Also, okay. It's not a equivalence. It's an equivalence relation sending this thing to a point and nothing doesn't do anything to the rest. Just a quotient of sets. Just contracts it to us. Yeah, that's the quotient. What do you call it? Contraction. Okay, it's a contraction. Yeah. Okay, it's a contraction. Yeah. But yeah, it's in the category of sheet. Well, whatever. So, yeah, it's X and Y. Okay, so if you like, it's a pushout. Okay, is that better? Okay, very good. So that's how you define this thing. All right, thanks for the clarification. And let's see. And remember, just to remind you, this motivic sphere spectrum is just the infinite suspension spectrum of spec K with an added base point. And now, if you take any object E, ah, maybe I should say, then what else do you have? Ah, yeah, we have suspension operations. So there's an action. Spaces, pointed spaces over K act on this guy. This is sort of a precursor of the symmetric monoidal product. monoidal product so you can take not only the symmetric said this is a symmetric monoidal category the product is so-called smash product just a notation for the product in this symmetric monoidal category that's an induced from an action of pre-sheaves on objects here just as spaces and spectra act on spectra so you can take Act on spectra. So you could take something like you can take the constant pre-sheaf, simplicial pre-sheaf S1. So any simplicial set, you think of S1 as a set gives you a constant pre-sheaf. So every, this sort of contains pointed spaces, if you like, just by taking the constant pre-sheaf. And so you can take S1, E, those two. Maybe I do it the other way, usually E smash S1, sorry. And you write S1, sorry, and you write this is the suspension by S1 of E. You take any object here, you have a suspension, but another useful object is Gm. Gm is the pointed gadget A1 minus 0, pointed by 1. And this goes to E smash GM, which we call the GM suspension. Called the GM suspension of E. And then we also can do the same thing with P1, where we think of P1 as pointed by infinity, or maybe one is even better. Doesn't really matter. And that's the P1 suspension. Okay, and all these operations are invertible. Are invertible. That's what when you construct this guy, you officially invert this thing, and it turns out that this thing is the product of these two in this category. So these are also inverted. So these are all invertible. And in fact, P1 suspension is equal to S1 suspension GM suspension, which is equal to GM suspension. Which is equal to GM suspension, S1 suspension. That's a fact. Okay. And so we have a following notation. We define the AB suspension to be the suspension with respect to A1, A minus B times, and the suspension with respect to GM B times. Gm B times. And that makes sense for all integers A and B because these are invertible endomorphisms. They're auto equivalences. Okay? And this relation tells us that P1 suspension is 2,1 suspension. GM suspension is 1,1 suspension. S1 suspension is 1-0 suspension. Just a notation. Just a notation. Maybe I should use the yellow chalk for this more. It's impossible to see. Second, is that more or less still okay? Okay, so now we have our E and we define E cohomology. So for any X pointed space, we define the E A B of X. Of X to equal harm SH of K of the infinite suspension of X into sigma AB of E. Okay, special cases, we can take X to be X plus, and we write that as E As EAB of X. Another special case, we can take X to be X modulo X minus Z, and we write that, that's just the usual E cohomology of X. And then we write that as E A B X sub Z. That's the E cohomology of X with supports in Z. z. And this quotient sequence x minus z goes to x goes to x modulo x minus z induces the usual long exact sequence. Ah, maybe I should say that in SH, the suspension, the translation, this is a triangulated category, translation equals S1 suspension. equals S1 suspension equals sigma one zero. So when you have long exact sequences that arise from the triangulated structure, the first variable is the one that changes and the weight of the second variable doesn't change. Okay, so you get a long exact sequence. E A B Z X E A B X E A B X minus Z and then the boundary map to E A plus 1 B X Z that continues. Okay, so it more or less comes from the all right. So now that's for any object, and we have special objects. That's for any object, and we have special objects that really give us cohomology. Think of cohomology as having a ring structure. So we have the notion of E in SH commutative ring spectrum. It's just a commutative monoid object in this symmetric monoidal category. In other words, you have a unit. In other words, you have a unit. The unit in the symmetric monoidal category is here. It's a unit. And you have a multiplication that satisfies the properties of a symmetric of a commutative monoloid. Okay, so it's a so. Okay, so it's associative, commutative, and unital. Okay, so that's a gadget here, and that endows E star star of X with a structure of a bigraded ring. And there's a certain commutativity, but I'm not going to, it's a little complicated, so I'm not going to say that. Okay. Okay, all right, so now we have some special types of commutative ring spectra, and that's getting close to all I need to tell you about this whole package. We have the notion of orientation. So, there are lots of kinds of orientation. I'm going to tell you about the two most basic kinds. Two most basic kinds. Okay, so this is based on the fact that if you take any X, so I mentioned some isomorphisms. You take any smooth variety X and you look at A n cross X modulo A n minus zero cross X and you take and you smash this. And you smash this with E, this would be the suspension with respect to this guy. This is sort of naturally and canonically isomorphic to the nth P1 suspension of E, which is the sigma 2N of E. Okay, and it's just some kind of barely Fairly simple excision property. You can put an inside of p1 to the n sigma 2n of e. That just follows from this notation here. Okay. So what that says is Okay, so I think these are pretty much all the buttons we need to proceed. Yes. Yeah, so not really. I mean, you can roughly, I don't know if that's ever been really pinned down. The idea is the That's ever been really pinned down. The idea is the way you build this category will tell you what the axioms are, but it's roughly speaking that it should satisfy Niznavitz excision, A1 invariance, and stability with respect to suspension. That's the minimal list, and I'm not sure it's really enough, but that's the idea. But I don't know if there's ever, if there's any, you know, Bruno, I don't think there's a real I don't think there's a real direct analog of Brown representability, except to say that, you know, it's what it is. There are things which have nobody care to try to write them up for unstable. Yeah. Yeah. So, but roughly speaking, yes, but I'm not going to make a precise statement. I think you're converting down theorems about problems with any sign-later category, but you have them, but they're not. Yeah, you have them, but they're not. It's basically those are saying, those are questions of extending functors from the compact objects to the whole thing. That's the general statement. And then, yeah. Anyway. So you have to characterize what it means, if you can characterize what these things do on smooth varieties, then that characterizes what they are. But I don't know if anybody's really, other than the short list I've given, which is a minimal list. Given as which is a minimal list, I'm not sure if it's sufficient, but thanks for the question. Yeah, all right. So, what that says, this is, of course, a n cross, this is just the trivial rank n vector bundle on x. Right, so it says you take the, and this thing here. You take the, and this thing here is what's called the Tom space of the trivial bundle. The definition of the Tom space of a, or what is this? This is the thing. Let's see. Or maybe I should say, not, let me, this is not what I wanted to say. This is true, but let me get rid of this here. Let me just say it's about the suspension object. This is the same. Sorry. Sorry about this. This is the same thing as the nth P1 suspension of the infinite suspension of X. So this is the statement. I should just read my notes. It's also true, the other one, but this is the one we're going to use. Okay, so this. Okay, so this says, what does this say? If you harm this into any E, what does this say? This says for V, the trivial rank and bundle on X with zero section zero, we have a natural isomorphism that for any E. E A plus 2N B plus N with supports along the zero section of V of V is isomorphic to EAB X. Why? Because this thing is half. Remember, it's of that suspension thing, but that's the same thing as the nth P1 suspension. P1 suspension of X plus, and this is the same thing as taking the nth P1 suspension of sigma AB of E, right, because this is just A plus 2n B plus N. And now this is an invertible functor, and so you can cancel. This is calm of the infinite suspension spectrum. Infinite suspension spectrum of X into sigma AB of E. And these, of course, are naturally isomorphic because just applying an invertible functor, same invertible functor on both sides. Okay, so that's always true. And now you say that E is oriented. So this is a quick and dirty definition. And dirty definition. If this is probably slightly inaccurate, but it says if there exists canonical, I'll just say it, you know, by sweeping the details under the rug with the word canonical and natural isomorphisms. I mean, this is this is all kind of I mean, this is this is all kind of trivial stuff, right? From E A plus 2 N B plus N zero B of V isomorphic to E and D and X for all. For all the N and all ranks, right? N is the rank. Okay, so instead of just for the trivial bundle, you have a way. And probably to make this completely accurate, you have to say this is gotten. So E now is going to be a ring spec, well, a module spectrum or something like that. Well, a module spectrum or something like this. Let's say that the thing that if there is one, it is unique. No, it's not unique. An orient is oriented by a certain orientation. It's a choice. That's an orientation is a choice of, right. Yeah, so maybe an orientation, maybe an orientation, better to say it, an orientation. An orientation, better to say it, an orientation is on E is a family of, thank you. Yeah. And you say E is oriented if there exists an orientation. You say orientable and orientable. Yeah, E is oriented or orientable. Yeah. Yeah, okay. No, I mean, see, E is oriented, means you've chosen the orientation. So, what I wrote was okay, but maybe it's more precise to say it that way. Okay, giving E an orientation is orienting E. Oh, whatever. I think you get the idea. Great. All right. And you have a slightly restricted notion, so an SL orientation. SL orientation. So this you might call, if you want to give a group structure to the kind of orientation, you call this a GL orientation because any vector bundle is a G L gadget. An SL orientation is a family of canonical. I'll just use the very canonical, canonical natural. Natural ISOs. So maybe I call this row V and you have the same thing. I'll just put parenthesis, you know, but I'll call it maybe phi by V. Sorry. I, phi V row for each the V to x of rank n plus rho isomorphism of the determinant of v with viewed as a locally free sheaf with OX. Okay, and again, this is probably not completely accurate, but this is the idea. Okay, now. Now, just to keep in mind the examples, and I'll say more about this later, hopefully, a typical oriented spectrum is the spectrum representing motivic cohomology, which in certain degrees gives you the Chow ring. And the typical Orient, another one, is the one which represents algebraic K-theory, which in certain degrees gives you K-naught. Those are Orient. Not. Those are oriented. And the ones we've looked at that aren't that SL oriented are the things there's a there's a chow there's a Milner witt motivic cohomology which in this geometric degrees gives you the chow witt groups that is SL oriented as is the cohomology of the wit sheaf and we saw one thing that was different about those is we had this notion of twisting by an invertible sheaf so if each So if E is SL oriented, you can form, and you have L, an invertible sheaf on some smooth X. You can form the twisted theory by sort of By sort of saying what it would be if it was oriented. So, in other words, you take L, it corresponds to a line bundle. It's a sheaf of sections of a line bundle. So it's not, this L is not spec of the symmetric powers of L. It's just the sections of this L is this L. Okay? And you say this is the same, this is by definition A2, the one. The one on the zero section of L of L. So if E were oriented, this would be an identity. And since L does not have trivial determinant unless L is the trivial bundle, this for an SL theory will not be an identity, it'll be a definition. Okay, and Yeah. That's MSL. Yeah. No, it's just you take Tom spaces of what do you do? You take you. You take the cover of the Grassmannian, which trivializes the determinant. That's BSLN. And you do the same thing over BSLN that you do over BGLN as the universal bundle. You take the Tom spaces and that forms the spectrum. Okay, so let me just, okay, a few more buttons. What are properties of Of SL-oriented theories. And these will give you corresponding properties of oriented theories just by ignoring the twists, because the twists are identities for GL-oriented or for oriented theories. So of course, if we have f from y to x, then we have f star. This is for any theory, right? From EAB of x. Of X, EAB of Y. That's just because it's a hom, right? You use the functoriality of the hom. This is hom of a infinite suspension spectrum of E, of X into E, and this is HOM over Y, and this thing gives you a map of the infinite suspension spectrum. Okay, let's see what's the other properties. But also, if F is proper. If F is proper, these are of course smooth, proper of relative dimension D, then you have an F lower star from E A B of Y. But now we need to include the twist. So let's say we have an invertible sheaf L on X, but we have to twist it with the canonical sheaf on Y goes. goes to E A minus 2d E minus D on X L twisted by omega X. So that's where these orientation sheaves come in. This is a general construction for all these SL oriented theories. And you see if it's oriented, then you just ignore the twists and you get the usual Geese maps. Okay. So. Okay, so similarly for oriented E. Okay, that's the basic thing that works. What's special about oriented E's is, oh, I'll say it in a minute. Okay, so in particular. Particular, if we have V to X rank our vector bundle S P, and we take the zero section and take any other section, then we can define the Euler class for the theory E of V. This lives in E 2r of X, twisted by the inverse determinant of V. And this is just, ah, sorry, hard to see. This is just the usual story. It's S upper star, S zero lower star of one on X. So what's one on X? We have our unit. X, we have our unit to E. And this is just a map. This is an element, right, by definition. This is the infinite suspension spectrum of K. So this is something in E0, 0 of spec K, just by definition, essentially. And then this one on X is just the, you take the projection for X. You take the projection for X, it's a star of this U. In other words, you compose this map with PX from suspension spectrum E to here. This is an E. This is a script E. It's the same as this script E. Script E. Is that okay? Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah. This is the Roman small letter E, Euler class. Okay, and in fact, you also have this is the Euler class. And you also have an Euler class with support. So you have to introduce another thing in order to define this, but let me just tell you that it exists. Tell you that it exists. If the zero locus of S is contained in Z, which is some closed subset of X, it's essentially the same formula, but you have to do a little bit of. To do a little bit of work. That this one on, well, anyway, that the push forward actually lives in a theory with supports on the zero section. You have to do a little bit more work. That's sort of a purity theorem. Okay, let's see. I think that's all I need for now. Are there any questions about this stuff? Yeah. So we have also a homework. So, you have also a homology series, yeah, and basically you could define it as classically or one side. No, no, no, the homology theory would be maps into E smash the object, yeah. And there's a, there's a du, so if you have a duality, then you put the duality into the internal thing, and that gives you some kind of duality, but the right, that's how you get a twisted duality. That's how you get a twisted duality. So, yeah, that's a good point. So, the duality is actually for smooth projective X is a nice point, is suspension with minus the vector bundle, the tangent bundle. So suspension with the vector bundle is smash with V mod V minus zero. And then that's an invertible thing. So you take its inverse, that's suspension with respect to. Its inverse, that suspension with respect to minus v, and when v is the tangent bundle, and when x is smooth and proper, that suspension of x is the dual of x. And for an oriented theory, it does only seize the rank of v. So you just have the usual tate twist is what comes into the dual in the cohomology theory. And for other things, it's a twisted tate twist, right? For SL-oriented things, you get twisted by the omega. Twisted by the omega. That's the duality. And that's why you have the push forward. This is ascent to the push forward is essentially the dual of the map using that duality. Right? It's the dual of the pullback. So that's what that is. If at some point you write the notes, will you also write it? Yeah, I'll put that in. I'll put that in. That's a good thing to put in. Okay. So let's see. Right. So. Right. So now maybe I just say it since I'm really running late here. This is an Euler class. And if E is oriented, then you actually have a projective bundle formula, right? You have the first turn class of O of one. That's the Euler class that exists. And then you have an addition, a projective bundle formula, which tells you that you have other turn classes. The Grotendieck method gives you the other churn classes. So oriented theories have the usual theory of churn classes. Have the usual theory of churn classes. And the top churn class is the Euler class, more or less by this construction. Okay, so now we can get back to the thing I wanted to talk about. So that's all black box stuff. And I'm happy to answer more questions about this little black box. About this little black box, but maybe later on. Okay, so now let's at least state the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. So, motivic Gauss-Bonnet. And this is actually for SL-oriented. And there's a completely general statement due to degrees. In con. But I won't get into that because we won't need it, but it's more or less the same thing. Okay, so right, remember that we have this motivic Euler characteristic. This is the Euler characteristic of the dualizable object living in. Living in end of A S H K, which by Morel's theorem is G W. Okay, and now here's the Gauss-Bonay theorem. So let's take E to be an SL-oriented commutative ring spectrum. With unit U from E. And note that that induces a map from end SK by applying on the right to maps from SK to E. So that gives U star from end SK to maps from SK to E, which is. Maps from S K to E, which is E zero zero of K. That's a side remark. Okay, so now let PX from X to spec K be smooth proper. So for these things, we always have the Euler character. Remember, there was a question of resolution of singularities, but that always exists. Always exist, then if I take u lower star of this quadratic Euler characteristic, this is equal to px lower star of the E valued Euler class of the tangent bundle of X. Usual Gauss Bonnet. Okay, now this all makes sense because remember. sense because remember the determinant inverse of t is omega x. So this Euler class lives in the E-theory with omega x, and that's exactly the twist I need to push it down to the E-theory on spec K with its omega, but that's trivial. So this actually lands, remember this is landing in E zero, zero of K with no twist. It's really twisted by omega of K over K, but that's nothing. Tay, but that's nothing. Okay? So that's the statement. Good. So maybe the whole list of examples, we've seen. Maybe I'll do a quick resume of the examples. Okay, so examples. One, you take E to be this motivic cohomology spectrum, this rep, right, representing motivic cohomology, then E2N of X is child groups of X. Okay, and this P lower star, in general, the pushboards are the pushboards. General, the pushboards are the pushboards in the Chow groups. And so we get, and this U lower star, we think of it as a map from G W K. This is my end SK going to Z, which is chow zero and K is the rank. And so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells us. And so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells us that the rank of the Euler characteristic is the degree, that's the pushboard, of the top turn class. See, n is equal to the dimension. So take n equal to the, well, this is a different n. Sorry. N equals dimension x. So let's say d equals x. C D for the child groups. The child groups of the tangent bundle. And remember that, and this rank by other properties is just, you know, what we call the topological Euler characteristic. Yeah. Is that an MK again in terms of after the squiggly arrow? Is that MK? I just can't read very well. Oh, this is rank. Went. Oh, this is rank. This is rank. That's not an M. That's not an M. Yeah, sure. My, my, no, my poor writing. That clears that up. Okay. Okay, that's one example. Let's do another. So this is oriented. I mentioned that this is oriented. Doesn't really matter so much. And we know what the pushboard and pullback map. What the push forward and pullback maps are here, so we don't have anything. You know, we know what the Chern class is, that's all very clear. But let's take E to be KGL. This represents algebraic K-theory on smooth varieties by KGL. Let me give the general formula: AB of X is K theory in degree 2B minus A of X. 2b minus a of x. So in particular, if I take kgl of 2r of x, it's just k0 of x. And this is where all the churn classes live. In particular, the Euler class of a rank R bundle lives there. So you get an Euler class in K0 of X. Okay, so what is the Euler class? I'll just write it EK of some rank R vector bundle. Well, bundle well remember let's take the zero section it's zero upper star s zero lower star of the one and the one is the o of x and so we know how to take s lower star right you just the coherent sheaf o of x on the vector bundle v right this is just you know it's on this is just the coherent sheaf Is just the coherent sheaf on V, but we want it in K0. So we have to take a resolution. And what resolution do you take? You then take the Kazoole resolution. So this thing is S0 star of the Kazool resolution of S0 lower star of OX. And we know what that looks like. It's just the exterior powers of the pullback of the dual of V. Okay, and when you take S0 upper star, all S zero upper star, all the maps. Well, it doesn't matter, you have a complex, right? And the k-naught class is the alternating sum of the terms. And when you pull back by zero star of the pullback by p star of the v's, you just get the v's again. So this is just the sum, let's say q equals zero to the rank of v of minus one to the q, the class of wedge. The Q, the class of wedge Q of V dual. Okay, and what is now we want to take the do this for the tangent bundle and then take the push forward by the projection for X smooth and proper. So now we take V to be the tangent bundle of X over K. Of x over k so we get e a tangent bundle of x. And now I take px lower star, which is really r p x lower star. It's really r p x lower star. So this is r p x lower star of summation q minus one q. The class, well, what's the dual of the bundle? It's the differentials. Differentials. All right. And this, when we take rpx lower star, we're in k0 of k, which is just z by the dimension. So this becomes the sum over all p and q minus one to the p plus q dimension over k of h. H maybe I should have put a p here. I think. Well, whatever. Sorry. No, I want to leave this. I don't know why I care. Let's be hp on x omega q. Okay. In other words, the alternating sum of the Hodge numbers, which we already know is equal to the topological Euler characteristic, but that's another way to see it. That's another way to see it. And the point is that that says that these two things are the same. That gives you another formula for this thing. Okay, good. Yeah, it's an element, but they're both Z. And they both, in other words, they're both the image, the maps are the same. So you have to show that the map from Gw of K to Z being K naught is the rank map also. Rank map also. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, but you show that. It's not so hard. Okay, so and I did switch the P's and the Q's. Okay, so now what about, so let's compute. How can, but this doesn't compute, this just computes the rank. But what's this thing equal to? What's a formula for this thing? That's the whole point of this story. To get a formula for this thing, instead of using k-theory, we use Hermitian K-theory. We use Hermitian K-theory. Use Hermitian K-theory. So, this is represented by a spectrum. Let's call it KQ. It has many different. Yes, we're in a different example. Three. We want to use this formula to actually compute what this thing is fairly explicitly. And KQ represents the Hermitian K-theory. So, Hermitian K-theory, this is K-theory of quadratic forms, roughly speaking. Okay. And what I want to mention is that KQ2RR of X is the same as GW of X, and maybe with a twist L is G. L is g w of x, where you're looking at derived quadratic forms with values in the line bundle whose sheaf of sections is L shifted by R. Okay, so you can imagine something makes sense. You're in a derived category. It makes sense to talk about quadratic forms somehow in the derived category, and with values instead of an O or in L, you can take. Instead of an O or an L, you can take in values in L shifted by R. And this is SL-oriented. That's why I can do this. Thank you. Okay, so that's a little bit of background. And so now we again, we apply. So how do we get to what I want to claim is that the Kazul complex has a natural quadratic form. Complex has a natural quadratic form on it. Okay, so Kazoole of, let's say, so for V dual and a section S, okay, has a quadratic form with values in determinant. Determinant inverse of V shifted by the rank, right? It's just the wedge product, wedge I of P star of V, well, in P star of V. Star of V dual, answer wedge R minus I, P star of V dual, going into determinant of V dual shifted by R. Shifted by R, which is determinant, well, P star, which is pi star determinant inverse of V. Okay, so that's the quadratic form. I'm stating that when you take the push forward of the trivial quadratic form on O of X, just gotten by multiplication, you know, X goes to X squared. The claim is that. The claim is that the S0 star, S0 upper star of OX, say one is equal to this Q causal for you know Tx, which is just equal to the wedge product, it's a bunch. product it's a bunch of wedge products from omega i of x but shifted i mean i i should have put the shifts here i'm considering this as being in degree minus i and this being in degree um r minus r minus i and this is landing in degree minus r. E minus R into omega X shifted by D. Okay, so it's just a special case of the Gazul complex. And then when you have a quadratic form on X and you push it forward, Sare duality gives you a quadratic form on the push forward. Quadratic form on the pushboard, right? Because especially here, you get a quadratic form on the pushboard by using SAR duality. So just you think about it a little bit, right? Because quadratic form on V is hom of V into V dual. And when you take the push forward of the R hom, then and use Sare duality, it gives you the quadratic form. So let me just. form. So let me just not work that out because I'm out of time. So if you take px lower star, this is of course the KQ Euler class of the tangent bundle. PQ lower star of the sky here. TQ is then the quadratic form. Let me call it Q Hodge on this object in the direction. This object in the derived category, PQ, I'll call it H. I wrote it H. Way I wrote, let me just get it the way I wrote it here. Do X sum P plus Q equals D. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No. P Q. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Wait a second. Yeah, I wrote it HQ. Yeah, I wrote it HQ on X omega sorry yeah omega P shifted by P minus Q into K where what is this? You take this thing going into H D omega D shifted by D. Shifted by D, and then take the trace. This is the wedge product you like, and this is the trace map. Okay, so that's a formula for this thing. Now, if you give me five, you give me five minutes. I think I started a little late anyways. So that's fairly explicit, right? So notice, first of all, that, so things to note, this recovers what we said, that if D is. Covers what we said that if D is odd, implies this thing here. Okay, so of course, this is equal to, maybe I didn't finish this, this is equal to mu KQ lower star of the Euler class. But mu KQ lower star goes from end S K to K. k q 0 0 of k and this is just g w of k and this is just g w of k and this is the identity. So you recover the whole thing by doing this. That's the point. Okay, so that's this is just equal to this here. Okay, so this implies in particular that for d odd, and I'm And I'm going to regret using D in a minute. That implies this thing is hyperbolic. Right? Because you just have the duality between HQ omega p and h d minus q omega d minus p, and those are never the same if d is odd. Right? So, and if d is even, d equals 2. D equals 2m, then this thing here is some multiple of a hyperbolic plus just the quadratic form Hm X omega m into k by taking the square x goes to x wedge x and then taking the trace. Right, so okay, so that's very explicit. Well, it's fairly explicit, except it's not explicit because if you ever try and figure out what that thing is for a particular x, it's not so easy. So if you just give me a few more minutes, I'll give you a nice explicit computation in the case when x is a hypersurface, smooth hypersurface in Pn. And yes. So here in This was for the um you're landing in the K9, right? Yeah, for this particular example, and for this for this example or for this example, for example number two, yeah, example number two, it's really K0, but it's really KGL2DD. Right. Then you said here, then, well, let's consider Hermitian K-theory. Yeah, Hermitian K-theory, the twist, it doesn't satisfy, this is not always GW. Satisfy, this is not always GW. The twist is recognized by this thing. So this lies in the twist by omega x twisted by, shifted by d I see. So you land there. Yeah. But then. Right, because that's where the quadratic form has its values. The values are in this thing here. Well, the values are in this thing here. That's the. Yeah, there's a right. Yeah, there's a right. So the point is that the GW of the derived category is the same as the GW of the scheme. Yeah, there's an isomorphism going on there. Yeah, thanks for raising that. Yeah, so for K, you know, the derived category of K vector spaces is not too far off. Okay, so there's this extra shift in there, but that just takes care of. I mean, it's sort of taken care of by the. sort of taken care of by the saying where the values are saying that the values is in k supported in degree zero gives you the same gadget as you had before so um yeah where was i let me just finish off this lecture series with an explicit algebraic computation of this thing This won't take too long. So now we do the case X inside, and I'm going to switch N and D. So I apologize for that, but I won't be able to. So smooth hypersurface of degree Degree D. And we assume that D is prime to characteristic of K if this is positive. The characteristic is positive. Characteristic is zero, there's no condition, but in general, to assume this. Okay, so this defining equation F. Degree D. And then we have for this thing, we have the Jacobian ring of F. Modulo, you know, the partial derivatives. And this assumption here tells you that this is actually an Arten ring. Actually, an Arden ring. So it's a complete intersection Arden ring, but you need something like this in order to get this. Okay, so this right, this is actually equal to the direct sum of Jf in degree, let me call it I. I goes from zero and the soccle degree is d minus two and 2 and plus 2. And since it's a complete intersection, Jf in this soccle degree is isomorphic to K. It's a rank, it's a one-dimensional K vector space. Okay, and there's a canonical generator for this thing. We find a particular element, the so-called She-Storch element in here, defined as follows. You write each of the You write each of the gadgets here as a sum Aij Xj. And then this guy here is the image of the determinant of this matrix of Aij. And you see these things will have degree n minus 2, D minus 2, and they're exactly n plus 2 of them. So the determinant really does have this degree. Determinant really does have this degree. Is that okay? Can you see this okay? No? Does this make it better? Yeah. Great. Okay, so that's the story. And it turns out then that you have a quadratic, this gives you a quadratic form. I'm almost done. This is the explicit gadget. Okay, so you have this quadratic formula called QSS of X. So what you do is you take L from JF to K gotten by first projecting onto this soccle, which you can do because this is graded. This is a K linear map. And then you take the isomorphism, which sends this EF. Isomorphism which sends this ESS1. Okay, that uniquely determines L, and you define this quadratic form to be L of X squared. And this turns out to be a non-degenerate quadratic form. This has been looked at by Milner and by Eisenbud Levine Kim Shias-Villy, not me, this is Harold Levine. Anyways, so the point is. So the point is: now, this is not quite the story. We also have, this is due to Clemens and Griffiths way back when, looking at Torelli problems. If you take the HQ on X omega n minus Q, so X is now dimension N, there's an isomorphism, particular choice of isomorphism of this thing. choice of isomorphism of this thing with Jf in degree D2 plus one minus n minus two. Okay, so let's define, this is the primitive homology. Notice a hypersurface, this is in the middle degree, and so this is essentially the same, it doesn't change anything except if n happens to be even and q is half n, and then you're taking the perpendicular. And then you're taking the perpendicular to the hyperplane, powers of the hyperplane section. So I won't write that down. You all know what that is. Okay, and you take this thing, let's call it Hodge. This is H D G for those of you who can't read my writing, is just this QSS restricted to this direct sum of JF B Q plus one. Q plus one n minus two summed over Q. Okay, and the theorem is, so I really went over time, but now if I can tell you the theorem, it now becomes a completely algebraic computation theorem. So this is due to myself. This is myself, Simon, Epin Lahalua, and Srinivas that so for n even ix is just represented by this explicit quadratic form. You take the degree and then plus minus d times this. D times this QSS Hodge. And then there's an additional. So this is from the hyperplane section of the middle dimension. This is the primitive cohomology in the middle dimension. And then you have the remaining other terms, which just are a multiple of the hyperbolic form, the HPP is for P not in the middle dimension. And then N is odd. This thing is equal to. This thing is equal to, you just have this part. We know already that, and then this becomes n plus one over two times h. Okay, so this we already know is hyperbolic, and it's it's sort of immediate that it's hyperbolic when you look at it, but that's just for completeness. The interesting thing is this guy, and of course, up to hyperbolic forms, this guy is also just determined by what happens. By what happens for Q equals half the dimension. The rest of it is hyperbolic. Okay, well, thanks very much. Sorry, I really went over time, and thanks a lot. I hope you enjoyed the series, and it was a pleasure to give it to you. Thanks for your beautiful series of talks. There's questions from the audience. There's questions from the audience. So let's let's bruno after uh has done similar computations, but I don't remember exactly what and I know he has done cosmology and maybe he also for cosmology, but also computing its way for ah okay. I'll have to look. Yeah, between five and ten. Between five and ten years ago. No, okay. I'll take a look. Thanks. Yeah, the point: the trace form on a lot of cohomology is not the same. I think you remember. Yeah, I'll take a look. Thanks. I got a question in the account. What the case is much before now in the board was constructed in the church class. I mean, there's a quality nobody wants to do with the other classifying space, but I think you know, suspicious. Yeah. That's the same thing. You get the same answer here for an oriented theory. Yeah. But the turn, I mean, I think that that's more a consequence of having the turn classes than. I mean, then, well, I mean, you can do it either way. Yeah, sure. Yeah, but you represent, right, in the stable homotopy theory, motivic homotopy category that represents K0. That's true. So you could, it sort of goes in either direction. There are many ways to get to the answer. But yeah, it's the same as in topology for oriented theories. It's a little more complicated for the SL-oriented theories. So for BSL, So for BSL or BM, BSB, yeah, for BSL, which is where you'd like to get these things, you actually get, there's no Euler class anymore because the Euler class is not stable. Right? So you get an Euler class for BSLN for even N. Remember, because the Euler class, well, at least if you, yeah, if you have a theory where, remember this element eta, this element eta. This element eta. This element eta is actually in the Milner-Witt theory, actually is the algebraic Hopf map. That's where it's represented in the, you know, as an object in the motivic stable homotopy category. And if you invert that thing, which things like bit theory have this eta inverted already, the Chao-Bit theory doesn't. That's why it lives in both worlds. But if you want something sort of purely quadratic, you look at things where eta is inverted and then all odd rank bundles. And then all odd-rank bundles have a trivial Euler class. And then, for such theories, these SL eta inverted theories, the Euler class and the odd thing. So for BSLN, where N is odd, vanishes. You just have it for the even ones, and it's not stable anyway. So it doesn't give you anything on BSL. So you just have these other classes which are stable, the so-called Pontryagin classes. And that's sort of a class. Classes. And that's sort of a classical result, also. But for us, it's really the Euler class is really maybe the most interesting one. And that's not a stable invariant. Yeah, there was something I wanted to say. Oh, yeah, here's a nice example. So I wrote this example in the notes, but just for fun, make the computation. This is an elementary computation for F. For f equals sum AI xi to the d to a Fermat, generalized Fermat hypersurface. It's an amusing calculation, I think. Did you try it? Did you try it? Yeah, give it a try. It's very, it's easy. And it's not completely trivial. So you'll find for D odd, it is trivial, and for D even, you get something a little more interesting. Right, right, right. Right, right, right. And here I guess the rank can be interpreted as. Yeah, the rank is the usual Euler. Yeah, right. The rank gives you the right thing. Right. Yeah, because the rank of this QSS is the primitive Hodge rank. And then you add one more. And then these are the other terms. So this just gives you the rank of the, this gives you the K-naught calculation back, the Hodge sum of the Hodge. Back, the Hodge, some of the Hodge numbers, alternating some of the Hodge numbers, gives you the Euler characteristic. So that's also true in positive characteristic. That's not the same as Durham cohomology. But since there's a spectral sequence, the Euler class, the Euler numbers are the same. That's not nothing new, but it's just what it is. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Sorry for
