Three problems. So that's a kind of project, a cooperation with the three groups. So first problem is with Shai Shan, Jinping, and Yi Xiang. So related to this principle, echin value and our monotonous end of dependency with diffusion. Dependency with a diffusion coefficient or possible rate in Guernold's talk today, earlier today. And then the majority talk is given my second kind of my collaborator, Procia, so she was my former PhD student. Now she's a senior check, assistant professor in liberal arts college. That would really use this kind of group inwards to Group inwards to try to quantify this network of heterogeneity index or network heterogeneity. So that's where I realized as I take the same shuttle with Sebastian, I realized that he's going to use those things in his talk tomorrow. I wish I could speak up with him. So in that way, I can really expand this a little bit more. But then I get to talk after you. Okay, so maybe next time. And then as a side product, we also have some work on this metaman. Some work on this maximized total biomass that we talked yesterday. So I think we are working on different problems. Also, our model also is the model will be the same as Bohr and the Don Grande model, but we are working on different automatic problems. So let's see whether we can find a connection with all. I think probably one of the purposes for being uh being the uh this workshop together. So oh, uh right, so this is uh come from this uh uh kind of It comes from this kind of research group from one of the conferences, which I can tell you a little bit more detail later. So, maybe I can skip on biological modification, just give you this model. So, it's good, so I speak after Allen. So, this is really the model from his paper back to 1982 or 1983. So, he has two papers. And this is a, we consider this a landscape of M patches. So, XK is a population size in the patch K. Probably size in the patch K, and F is a kind of interest growth functions within the patch. MKJ here will be the question about this repository rate from hydrogen to hydro K. Therefore, the first term will be checking all the move in, and this second term will be checking all the move out. And the mu would be a kind of dimensionless kind of parameters you can think about, whether it be travel frequency or d dispersal speed. Or disposal speed depends on the seconds to have. So basically, we know in isolation when you equal zero, we call if you have FK0, it's called intrinsic growth rate, so that means the source, and if that's less than zero, the sink. So we want to learn with the coupling and how those kind of source and sink, particularly this patch process rate, coupled with this kind of movement coefficient in terms of this. Of movement coefficient in terms of this movement matrix or MKTA here. So, really, if you look at the persistence or extinction, you're looking at the stability of this triple equilibrium. The Jacobic systems will be given by this diagonal matrix of this patch gross rate, Fi Z L, and then minus mu L. L is come from the move in, move out. I have negative sign here, therefore all move in terms that we appear in the off-diagonal in the negative sign in front. The negative sign in front, and move out term that we appear in the diagonal with the positive sign. So, the reason is that this is called LaBar metric in graph theory or in normal sense. So, in that weight, really, if you know this metric, you find out we assume there's no no loss during the travel. So, move in, move out will be balanced at each patch. So, in that way, each column sound will be zero. So, this L matrix is a singular matrix. L matrix is a singular matrix, and the left eigenvector of this corresponding eigenvalue zero will be all the ones. So, but we're going to use the right eigenvector at all, okay, corresponding eigenvalue zero. And so basically, if you denote the spectral bond, which is a large linear part of eigenvalue of this Jacobin matrix at S of G, so we know mental population will be dies out if S of G and S and zero. And yellow. And if it is a positive, you have this persistence with some other contiguous or this non-linear and or linear growth rate functions. So I think that's in your nose toilet called principal echinwag. So here we just call this spectral bond. So we are interested on if you have different uh kind of arrangement of the tight growth rate Fi0, so how can you maximize this uh s spectral bound S of G? Spectral bond S of T. Or vice versa, if you want to get rid of this species, just invasive species, you want to lower down this spectral kind of bond S of T or metaphorical ocean rate. So how can you arrange your FIGL to do that? Or in other words, if you have disease spread among the N cities, so which city you should do this kind of more control strategies? So if you can only control one because of the limited resource availability. The availability. So, this is a classical model. We know many of things. So, for example, if you assume this L metric is irreducible, that means all paths will be connected through one delta path for one way and then the other will return. So, and we assume the growth rate satisfies this duality less than 0. Then we know if the spectral bond, less than or equal to 0, you have triple equilibrium where it goes stable. Equilibrium will be longer stable, otherwise, you have a unique Potten Equilibrium. And I think that's where non-inclusive. I put several papers here at the reference. But really, when mu equals zero, if you go back to this metrics again, when mu equals zero, therefore it's diagonal matrix, therefore spectral boundary will be largest diagonal entry. So there will be largest patch growth rate. But we are interested on what happens when mu goes to infinity first, and then what happens when mu is going to be influenced And then, what happens when mu is not that small, not that big, with intermediate value of the disposal speed? So, we try to answer those kind of questions. So, it turns out in a 1982 paper, Eiland did it under the condition L equal to L transpose means you have symmetric movement. That means the coefficient from this MKGA web equal to MJK. So, but certainly we do have asymmetric movement. If you think about the proportion dynamics along the river, stream network. Along the river, stream network. I believe there's a later day some talk about stream network things. So instead, we have asymmetric things, then you are asking the questions. So I think earlier the result shows when mu is so big, so the spectral bond, or the metaphor growth rate, will be appropriate to this average of the patch growth rate. So basically, you atomic, you divide by n. Okay, so then it turns out our question, sorry. What happened? Something just peered. Okay, interesting. Okay, so let me tell you the question for instance happens. So I have three parts in the router. The three questions. The first question is: if you allow asymmetric movement, so get rid of symmetric matrix L, what happened for this time? So with the symmetric movement, So, with the symmetric movement, this is average. So, we are wondering how you can define those new average with asymmetric movement, first term. You can think about it as a kind of a limit as mu equal to infinity. And second term, as I said, we care about the intermediate value of mu. And how about the second-order term, if you call this a first-order term? So, in some sense, in some situations, the second-order term plays quite an important role and provide us not only. Low and provide us not only quantitative but also qualitative behavior. Okay, so there will be higher-order terms here. And the third question is: when metaphysium persists, you have this positive equilibrium. If I add this positive equivalent together, we call it a total biomass. We are asked, how can we maximize or minimize this biomass? So there are three questions. So I believe we have a complete answer for the question one, question two, and for question three, we only have some. And for question three, we only have some special cases. Okay, so let me tell you the answer now. So really, we can show this, once again, if you remember, our geography matrix is a diagonal matrix encoding this within patch growth rate and minus mu L, L J La plus. We can show the spectral bound of this matrix will be monotonous decreasing and also there will be concurrent R. So if you remember in So if you remember, in your notes target, he also has some kind of monotone results. So also, I believe this is Tai Tago with this reduction principle back to this Carlinjo work earlier and later on Lee Attenborough's work. And certainly Steve Kocher and the Zuguang and the subject level here establish something like Morton Doubt here. But what we did here a little bit differently is we are able, I think our condition is a little bit different, our motivation is a little bit different, and Modulation is a little bit different. And it turns out we are using a different approach to prove it. And with that approach, we are able to get a little bit more. So I think that's good. We can learn always from other people's work with different kinds of application problems. So and later on we find out, oh, we are working on something so close. So I think that makes it a workshop so nice. And really, so under the conditions, we can show at mu, if you remember, at mu go to zero. Remember, at mu equal to zero, that will have the diagonal matrix. Therefore, the fixed bond will have the maximum of Q diagonal. At mu equal to infinity, that will be equal to the network average, because now I allow L be asymmetric. So instead, I have one of n in front, I have this width coefficient, theta k. And theta k is this right eigenvector of Laplace matrix, corresponding eigenvalue zero. So uh and well so it's kind of uh kind of uh kind of makes sense because uh as your coupling coefficient or disposal speed is so fast, you have n patches, they are moving around, essentially you become one patch and that average becomes this uh this this uh this average thing here. But however because you have uh as much movement some patches have more moving and some other patches have less move-in, so you can count these kind of uh kind of uh things going there. Kind of things go in there. Another way to expand, to understand this network average is this large partial matrix can be normalized in that way, so you can get this mark of chain transition matrix. So then this theta k, that the item vector will be the stationary, there will be the stationary distribution of a regular mark of chain. So in other words, the theta k tell you what the resonance time, if you follow the kind of movement metrics here, learn the movement, what will be the Here, learn the movement. What would be your average lesson time stay in the patch K? So, really, you think about you have some people move around in patch K, the goals are the QK. They're going to stay their time 7K. You estimate again. So, in that way, this is another way to think about network average. So, that will be the answer for part one, question one. And our really kind of interesting is on higher order term. So, but I want to highlight here. So, later on, I'm going to show you the Here. So later on, I'm going to show you the plot. As μ increase, my spectral bond S will be decreased from the maximum of Q's called this width average. So you're going to see this concurve upper curve a lot. But you are thinking, if I have some scenario, I have the same maximum, I have the same error. Maximum, I have the same average, you might have two curves. So, in order to compare this and mean, and this is a spectral problem. Okay, so in order to compare the two scenarios, one way to look at it is if I look at the slope of tangent lines here, but it turns out that's a motivation for our second order term. Okay, so the answer, ah, it's okay, just speak away. No, no, no. I know why, because uh uh my PDF file is twenty some megabytes, so I might be able to see it. Yeah, yeah, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. So, so, so let me let me do that. So, they didn't copy that file, so now give me a second. I can do it. Uh just should be good. Okay, sorry. Yeah, that's my sleep question. Now you're all sleeping. So and our answer is here for question two. So once again, you have this spectral bound, diagonal matrix, minus mu L. The first term is the next word average. Our second order term is defined using this group inverse. If you recall, L is a Large partial matrix, it is singular. The inverse matrix It is singular. The inverse metric does not exist. We are looking to generalize inverse. There are two ways to look into generalized inverse. We are looking to follow this jetting inverse. So, and particularly we are looking to this jet inverse of type 1, type 2 in the region where we group inverse. So, well, you can ignore all those things. Basically, for our Laplacian matrix, you can find this matrix L sharp, set by just three identity. Then, L sharp is called root inverse of our L. Of our L, LaPartial matrix. Okay. So, and then I'm going to use L sharp, just a KTA actually denoted KTA. I use L K G A sharp, C dot G A. C d G A is my weight coefficient. I can make it over matrix. And Q K Q G. QK is a growth rate impact K, Q G is a grossweight impact K. K and G. So if you define the double sum, If you define the double sum, that will have the turn appear in my second-order term. Let me explain this term a little bit. So, really, I was reading Sebastian's archive paper. I tried to find a connection with our definition here and his definition. I didn't get the sense in sort of all the years. The problem I didn't want to look into that. But let me try to explain to you another way: why we call this network a heterogeneous index, if you're doing with us. With us. So, first thing, you're standing in package here. C the TA is a weight coefficient. Let's time you stay in this package. I put it here. I'm looking around all other patches. They are growth rate. My growth rate is 0G. I look at different QKMIQG with all other patches. And this LKJ sharp negative since is counting the distance or accessibility from patch K to patch K. 2 patch 10. So in that way, you add what kind of variations with other patches together. So in patch G, so that will be this square bracket term. And it would network average of those variations. The reason I have divided by one half is I count those differences twice, K and G. So that really is counting this kind of total variation of your difference of the gross of those gross. Of the growth of the growth rate among the patches. And use network structure as kind of the measure in some sense. So I will show you, later on you can see, even though my La Partial matrix, all the offer diagonal is non-positive, it turns out group inverse, L sharp, of diagonal, could have positive and negative sign. So even though we are able to derive this double sound as a kind of variation formula, we are not going to be able to deny the signal Variation formula, we are not easily saying this is a non-negative because L K shape could be positive, could be negative. So, however, eventually, I think last time when we talked about it, that's still open, but eventually we are able to prove this is non-negative. So, in other words, we are a little bit comfortable to say the first time is average, second time is covariance. But under what kind of sense, we don't know. So, maybe there's something more we can look into the grouping inverse. Something more, we're going to look in the group inverse. Okay, so let me show you some examples with a very simple four patch connect with one path. Okay, just a line, three patch, four patches. But before that, I want to show the application. Because our result really is for metric results, any aspect results. Can be applied not only for meta-professional models like single-sufficient model, but certainly can be applied to decision models. The tied up with Daozhou's party yesterday afternoon. So, if we ignore the kind of other disease compartment, only focus on infected disease compartment, so you can define this disease growth rate. Similarly, you have this diagonal matrix mass mu L. That makes our theorem can be applied right away. Or you can look at this next generation metrics and basically reversion number R0. We are able to prove that mu increases R naught where remote on decreases from the maximum to the network. From the maximum to the network average. And with our network hygiene index, we are able to get a second term in the expansion with respect to one or mirror. So basically, just kind of right away you can apply. Okay, so let me show you how to look at this group inverse now. So as I said, if I have this symmetric movement, then all C like K will be equal to each other, will be 1 over N. You think about, I'm looking for symmetrical kind of I'm looking into a symmetrical kind of movement network. So I have one patch with a hotspot. If you prefer ecology, that will be, you have a large growth rate. And the other three will be smaller growth rate or smaller R node in the disease. So you have two scenarios. If you look at the average, because that's a symmetric movement, network average becomes average. They have same average. So really, I have the same average, horizontal line, extra vertical line. Horizontal line, exposure line, I have the same maximum that will be read. The many difference comes from this slope of the tangent line. So that it is my second term, which is this h term. So this is the numerical result. Really show you you have this concurrent up from the maximum to the average. Okay, now let me show you how to compute h. Let's call this h1 because there's a different pattern located in A different patch located in patch 1. This is the difference occurs in patch 2. I call H1, H2. So it turns out, by our variation formula, H1 is equal to, this is a Laplace matrix. So you can see one connect two, and two connect one, and two connects three, and two uh three connect two. So basically that's a metric. And uh and then you can compute this. L sharp. We can compute something, L sharp. As I mentioned before, that off-diagonal, they don't have a sound pattern for L sharp. That part we don't understand, really we don't understand. We sort of couldn't, it shouldn't be a non-negative button. But the good thing is that each column sound, L sharp, still equal. So that's still synchronous. Okay, because this is symmetrical, therefore the each row sound also will be equal to zero as well. So using each column sound equal zero, we are able to rewrite this. We are able to rewrite our network hatching index just in terms of diagonal entry. So, in other words, if the different patch occur in the end, then our network entry index is 7 out of 32. And this is RF and R. R is this green kind of disease growth rate or path growth rate. And R actually is this one, the difference. And actually, this was the difference. So if you have difference of a curve in the patch 2, then if you look at diagonal entry, just 3 here. So apparently, H1 bigger than H2. Therefore, if you put this hot body at the end, you have a large growth rate than put in the middle. So they were simple example. Okay, so this is one different. You have one path different, another three. Similarly, you just group inverse, you can count. You can count, I have two higher and two lower, so I can compute this edge again as well. Surprisingly, it turns out the largest edge will occur when I have two hotspots coupled, kind of locating to the one side, but all other three scenarios, my edge will be the same. Okay, I can add, I can, so how to get that? So, the first scenario is one, two. What I need to do, 1, 2, what I need to do, I just add also 4, 1, 2 block together. I get 12. Okay? Now, let's add 2, 3 together. 3, x, 1, x, 1, 3. I get 6, minus 4, I get 6, minus 2, I get 4. So apparently, that's a 1, 2 submatrix. It has the sum larger than my 2, 3. Actually, let's tell you how to compute the network heading index. So, in that way, this network. So in that way, this network heading index has this ability to tell you how you distribute your resource into these metapopulation settings, how you can get the larger goals rate. So let's tie it up with this talk with Chu Yen talk yesterday. So if you look at the special ecology here, so because we are looking to growth rate, so we only look at four growth rates here. I assume the four growth rates sum up to I assume the four growth rates sum up with 20, but I'm going to distribute those growth rates into four patches. So I just come up those eight ways. So the last way will be equally distributed. In that way, each patch I have growth rate kind of five. So and this one I have the R1R2 growth rate is 10 and R3R4 growth rate is 1. And R is 20. So if you do the simulation, just plot this growth rate with respect to mu, as you can see, all starts from the maximum. As you can see, all starts from the maximum to the average because, once again, that's symmetric. And the horizontal line, it is 5.5, sorry. I think it's 20 divided by 20 or should be 22. Okay, sorry, I think that should be 22 here. 22 divided by 4, you should get a 5.5. So it turns out when all packs have the same growth rate, homogeneous, the growth rate will be the smallest one. More scale one. And if you have a larger dramatic kind of large network hesitancy index, then your cross-free will be bigger. So I compute this edge here. So it turns out you can see the agreement very well. So the example I show you is only for very simple kind of network structure. Certainly the same can be more complicated. So I have the seven patches. I have the seven pads here. And one pad is different than others. It turns out I can compute this group of universe, look at diagonal entry, I can find out this network hygiene index. It turns out if you put one patch different in either one or two, you're going to get the largest growth rate. If you put a patch in four, you're going to get a smallest gross rate. So that's one pack difference. Certainly you can compute the two pack difference and maybe three pack difference. So I send you judges. So, I think there's a way you can measure this network halogenity in manufacturing models. So, that's our answer for question two. That means good. And last one is most challenged because the total biomass will be non-linear problems. So, before we all look at the kind of linearization, linear problems. So, our purpose is we would is we would like to kind of arrange this RI such that either I want to maximize my metaphoric growth rate, which is a spectral form of matrix with CNT4. And we know there will be a boundary below by this network average and boundary above by the maximum and also we know this second order terms. But however, for the biomass, if you look at the party equilibrium, the atom together, we form maximum. The atom together, if I want to maximize the total biomass, might be different strategy you're going to use to maximize the metabolic growth rate. So we first explore this one here. To make life simple, we assume all pattern capacity is the same. So once again, because our earlier kind of research is all different RI. So make life easy, we put K different. Certainly, the cadding capacity should be different as well. So it turned out that the conference, CBMS conference, Mark and Pauline Manager is also Steve Ponderland. He is an expert in group universe. So two years ago, he was these 10 lectures. So we have several groups who work on different group projects. One group worked on the problem I showed you there and we gave some some results. If I interest people are interested on learning a little more about group inverse, A little more about group inverse. We've got a website, the lecture was recorded. So you should be able to see something more about the group inverses. And our answer is, if you remember, the metaproportion growth rate at mu equal to infinity will be network average of the patch growth rate. If I put the largest growth rate to the downstream, then for downstream, delta C dot I will be large. So the theta i will be largest because the waiting time will be higher. It follows this amount of chair or learning movement or movement metrics. So, in that way, to maximize growth rate, we need to put a lot of RI to downstream. But however, if you want to maximize the total biomass, you need to do the opposite. You need to put the largest growth rate in the upstream. So, that's a little bit different. And it turns out the largest biomass will be achieved when you have ideal free distribution. So, in which all the movie and In which all the move-in and move out, not only coefficient, it's kind of balanced, but also the kind of if you use this AIG time, this XGS since that will be, you have the zero net movement. I think that ties up this idea of free distribution together, surprisingly. Okay, so and then the last question I try to say is, I think my time runs out. No, you have dilemma. Yeah, you have dilemma. You have two. You have dilemmas. You have two species competing each other in a river. One species has a larger gross rate in the upstream. One species has a larger growth rate in the downstream. You're asking which one wins competition. So largest gross rate in downstream give you a larger growth, metaphysical growth rate. Larger gross rate in the upstream give you larger biomass. Okay, so I think as Edward mentioned, or this is, maybe I can skip, this is for the first result. This is for the first result. But I think Ellen mentioned every talk must end up with a GMP paper. So the GMP table answers the question that it turns out the logic grossly in the upstream. That's between the competition. So yeah, so maybe that's, I think it's a good time to end up. Sandra Pojong showed us this picture in this conference, everything that was so in Makumahani. If you look at the title, subtitle conference, it went nice. Some kind of conference, it went nice. I was looking at the picture, I found out so many people there and also here for the conference. And maybe a little bit, I think probably still previously I mentioned right away. So there is a chapter 2014 workshop, and also there's an upcoming 2024 workshop. So that will be a nice time for people to go to Miami for more digital possible things. Okay, I stop here. Thank you very much. Next slide, Peter Shannon. We have time to put some more questions. So, did you also do the extension for the total biomass for March? Well, we are working on Chan Xi, but it turns out it's not easier. So, not surprised because we transform from 200 tournaments, so UN tornado. UN torment, so UN torment gets a number of constants. You must find this kind of in the medium kind of middle value, get a larger biomass. But our entry is on a different arrangement by your source. So how should we get kind of two arrangement? I have a question. So at the beginning, at the first part of your talk, you had this beautiful sort of decomposition for the spectral radius. The spectral radius in terms of the average, and then the heterogeneity times 1 over μ, and the remainder term. And that's very nice because you can explain it to biologists, perhaps, right? Because there's some conceptual understanding. But I think that required symmetry for dispersal. And in the last part, you talked about the river, where there's asymmetry. Is there any chance of having a similar kind of formula? Kind of formula. Yes, so when you have an asymmetrical one, there's a network average and also network index. First term, second term, we are joining impact. So when your mu is large, network average, we are playing low. So you're going to put a large growth in the place you have more income, more inflow. So really, for example, this is a kind of river water, a kind of waterboard to get this downstream, this is upstream. So if I put hotspot in the fall, If I put a hospital in the four, I'm going to have larger average. And then if I put a hospital in the one, I have the smallest average. But as mu gets smaller, then there will be determined by this extra time. So it turns out larger edge will be achieved if I put, let me see, if I large of the edge will be achieved if I put the hotspot in one and four, will be small. Two, three will be small. That's why you have digital. will be small. That's why you have digged down. You have two hotspots, then if I put the largest hotspot in 1, 2, or 3, 4, I get the largest h. But then the network average will be largest if I put the hotspot in 3, 4. So really, to answer your questions, so when you have an S measure of movement, so you have to look at its network average and also network ahead of index, and also the speed of disposal that has a movement. Questions or comments? Yeah, she's before WikiLAM, so she had this last day with the 20 letters. I thought it's 30 almost. I think it took 20. Yeah, it's 20 odds. Other questions? Other questions? In all examples, you seem that this H has always the same sign? H has a sign. You said that it need not be positive in general. Yeah, I think we prove H is non-negative. So if you remember, our volume DAO said this will be monotonous decreasing at new inputs. So so that's really we are able to prove it. So some open things if you don't know how the time. So, but we are not able to prove it. So, and also, if you go back to this one, as I said, and probably I skipped that part, if you look at this, the first two terms for those last three scenarios is identical. But however, we don't know the high-order term. But the main result shows all high-order terms for last three is also the same. So, it looks like we should. The same. So it looks like we should look into more terms. Or, in other words, in some scenarios, for the first two terms, we have the complete determinant for the higher term. So that's a summary trying to work on it. I thought it was like your hand up, but no. Um, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know, Adrian, did you want to say anything? Oh, so yeah, we assume that one emergency. Yeah. So today is a little bit early day. Yeah. I love your talk. Well, that's good fun. I've heard a heard part of it before, but of course. Yeah, I think that's also. It is. Yeah, I think it's also a little bit more. Maybe more. So, for example, from Sahashi, you know, so what happens is also. And then we're assuming that's a matter of display. Somebody should find that you told you. Yeah, sure. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't understand. It's very cool.
