This is a joint work with my former postdoc, Professor Shiguang Yang, in Hunan First Normal University, where the Chairman Mao graduated many years ago, like 100 years ago. So, and my former PD student, Yuza Zhang, in Nanjing Norman University. This is my funding support from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council. So, this topic is on the multiple distribution function. We call this MDF Latex-Boltzmann method for multi-component and multi-fist flow. But we assume the temperature is constant for this study. So, this is the outline of the talk. First of all, let me give a very brief introduction to the background of this research. So, I have a long collaboration with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. So, the professor Shu Yu Shun in cost. When we study the radar engineering as a project in the radar engineering, so we meet this. So we meet this person flow problems with some multi component and multi-phase flow problems. So of course, so for this reserve engineering problem, so they need, you know, the temperature will change. But when we study at the very beginning, so we assume the temperature is constant and we consider this. The face multi-face flow problem in this problem. So later, currently, we're still working on the non-isothermal multi-phase flow problem. That's our first step. First of all, let's revisit the thermodynamic relations. Okay, so that's the main function is this. Function is this molar density function. So that's a vector contains several components. That's why I call the multi-component problem. So we assume, as I mentioned, we assume the constant temperature and we consider it the fluid mixture. So this capital NI is more of the ice component and the V is over volume. So then we have this vector. Volume. So then we have this vector, a model density vector. So we use this model density vector to construct the partial differential equations. And for the fundamental law of thermodynamics, we have this equation 2. So that's a main equation. We derive everything from this fundamental law of thermodynamics. Here, this capital U is internal energy, and this T is the temperature. And this T is the temperature, which is constant in this study. And S is the entropy, and P is the pressure. V is this overall volume. And mu I is the chemical potential of the commodity I. So later we will use this prior term. We use this chemical potential term to replace all this prior in the equation. So this is a Uh so this is a free energy based, uh so multi-component multi-phase flow. Uh so for the Hamaha's free energy, uh uh this capital F is defined as this in internal energy subtracts this temperature multiply this entropy and then we can have the uh Hamaka's frame density is a small f is f over v so in the form of this equation is three. form, this equation is three, we use this form to build the relation between this chemical between this Hamerhas refrain density and this pressure and the chemical potential mu i. Then from this equation three and this Jebus Duham equation, this Jibus-Duham equation, so we can have this following relation. Have this following relations. And then we can have this chemical potential formula, which is partial F, partial NI, and also the pressure, which is related to the Hamas free energy density and also the chemical potential mean. So that according to the gradient theory of the multi-phase systems, the total Hamas of the. systems, the total Hamas of Energy contains two parts. That's a homogeneous part and also the and also this surface contribution part. So for this F0, this called the homogeneous Hammer's free energy, which is related to the equation of state. So you, which kind of equation state you started, and that gave you the And that gives you the homogeneous chemical potential, Î¼0. So, this F0 can be determined by the elastic equation of state. Later, we revisit some often used, widely used equation of state. And this surface contribution part related to some gradient terms of the model density. So for multi-component fluid with a different equation of state, so this F0 have different forms. For example, for this commonly used vandal equation of state, we have this form, formula. So F0 contains two parts, this ideal gas part and the axis gas part. So ideal gas part, we have this formula. We have this formula. And for the Wendover equation of state, so we have this axis guess part. For others equation of state, usually for the ideal part, we have the same formula. And for this axis part, we have different formulas. So this can be seen in many reference papers. In fact, we have also studied this model in our former paper with Professor. Former paper with Professor Shu Yu Shuan and his student and the postdoctoral. Another very widely used equation state in the oil reservoir is called the Pen Robinson equation of state. These two professors name, Penn Robinson, last name, equation of state. That's used very widely used for the hydrocarbon. For the hydrocarbon fluids, mixture of fluids. So that also contains, this F0 also contains two parts. The ideal gas part, that's the same as other models. And for the axis part, so this is a different part with a Van der Waiver equation of state. If you look carefully, this part is quadratic. Quadratic polynomial, but this part is a logarithm function. So then the pressure of the homogeneous fluid, P0, can be given in this formula. So this P0, that's for the homogeneous pressure, given by this chemical potential, homogeneous chemical potential, mu zero, and also this homogeneous Hamas free energy part. part. We studied this model for the single component, single component multiface flow problem in 2014 with Professor Xui Shun. So we started a 2D problem. So before in the Raspberry Engineering, people usually consider a 1D problem, 1D simulation, because they don't have the efficient algorithm to do the Efficient algorithm to do the 2D and the 3D simulations. Of course, our algorithm can also work for the 3D simulations. So we propose some energy-stable numerical schemes for these grid and flow problems with convex splitting strategy. So there are different friends. Free energy models in mathematics we often consider the like the double potential or multiple potential. So can be generalized into this form. This is this G is defined as this if N is a single component, then this is a double potential. But here is a multiple potential form, which is often studied by mathematicians. But this does not relate to the realistic equation of state. So in our project, so we can propose a model to study the realistic equation of state for real computations, for real comparations with the laboratory data B. So that's the relation between the chemical potential and the pressure. Chemical potential and the pressure can be written in this form. So this is total chemical potential. This contains the surface contribution, right? Contains this homogeneous part and also the surface contribution. And then the total pressure also contains two parts. This pressure zero, that's a homogeneous part contribution, and also this because of fluid mixture, we have this. Have this mixture, this surface contribution. So, and this Hamgenus prior part has this relation with chemical potential, Hamgenus chemical potential, and Hamgena's free energy density. And from the definition of this pattern, this definition, so we can have the following relation. So, you know, in the So, you know, in the fluid dynamic equation, so we have this gradient p term. So then we want to replace this term with chemical potential term. So we must use this relation. So we have this relation from this definition. So then for the total pressure, this gradient p part, okay, we have this relation. Okay, we have this relation. It's a total chemical potential and plus this term. So that's very easy to prove. This lemma is very easy to prove. So you just substitute the definition for the pressure part and also the chemical potential part. The chemical potential, that's a total chemical potential. So has these two terms, right? Chemical, this mu I0 and subtract this term. And then this pressure term also contains these two parts. Also contains these two part these three terms. So then we substitute that into this formula and then combine this term and this term will cancel each other from the previous formula. This can be cancelled each other. And then we have three terms left. This term and this term and this term. And then we can combine them together to get this term. Only one term left. only one term left so that's this term okay so that way this lemmer uh in the equation later in the equation the fluid equation so when we have this uh gradient p this pressure so we can replace that with this subtraction of this term and this term so that's related to the equation of state don't forget that okay then for the multi-component Then for the multi-component two-phase flu, a two-phase fluid system, so we can have this mass balance equation. So this Ni is the molar density. For the molar density, we have this mass balance equation. And this Gi contains this chemical potential part. Don't forget this chemical potential also contains. Also, contains a derivative inside, right? So then this gave us a fourth-order term. That's like a conheliered, you know, this is like a conhelier equation. So that's a, we have the fourth order derivative. Then, in fact, so we can define a mass density of the mixture in the formula 18, and we can rewrite. 18 and we can rewrite this 17 into this 19, this equation 19 for this mass density equation. And for single component problem, before in fact we solved this equation 19, of course we don't have this summation at that time because we only have a single component. So and for the moment balance equation, so we have this equation. So, we have this equation 20. And for this gradient of this prior term, so we replace that with a chemical potential, this gradient of mu y and subtract this term. So then we replace the pressure term with the chemical potential term. So this replacement will make the, you know, when we makes a you know when we use a numerical method to solve that we'll have a more stable and accurate we get a more stable and accurate solution so for single component two-phase fluid problem so as i mentioned so we can change that to consider this mass density equation okay because we don't have the mixture fluids okay this is a single component This is a single component fluid. So that's a mass conservation equation. Mass conservation equation and the plus is moment balance equation. So we can have, we solve this system with two equations. And also we can, in our former paper, we replaced this gradient pressure part with this chemical potential form. So and we solve this equation. Of this equation 22 combined with this equation 24. And this can be further derived to equation 25 because this chemical potential mu has this homogeneous part and this surface contribution part. Then for how to solve this mass conservation equation and this Conservation equation and this moment balance equation. In our previous paper, so we use multiple relaxation time lattice Poseman method to solve that. Then we can have this formula. We use a time splitting scheme to solve this convection part with a beam warming scheme and also solve this ordering differential equation directly. Differential equation directly. So that's a beam warming, second-order beam warming scheme. Why we introduced the beam warming scheme to solve this convection part? Because we can have, you know, this, we can adjust this time step a little bit to use a little bit larger time step to solve these problems. If you use upwind scheme, like other RBM. Other RBM method. So they must use very small time stamps. When we solve the Penn-Robinson equation of state, this problem, so usually we cannot solve that with the general upwind scheme. We must introduce this second-order beam warming scheme. Then you can have a little bit larger time step. At that moment, we use 10 to minus 6 dirt T equal to 10 to the minus. Delta t equal to 10 to the minus 6, then we can simulate a single component two-phase flow with pen-Robinson equation of state. And then we can compare our result with the laboratory data. So if you have interest, you can go to this paper and see the detailed numerical result. And that's from the distribution function, kf. Distribution function, okay, f, and we only use one distribution function, f. Then we can recover, okay, we can recover the macro, the macro scopic quantities, like the mass density zhou, and also the velocity u by using this formula in equation 30. You can have zhou and this u. That's for our prayer. That's for our previous simulations. And now for the multi-component and the multi-phase flow, we must use a multi-distribution function. Only f, a single f is not enough. We should introduce another distribution function. So we want to solve this coupled nonlinear equations. The first one is a mass balance equation. Mass balance equation. So here we use in this work, we use this Ni, which is molar density of I's component to be the equation, the governing equation. And the other one is also the velocity, the moment balance equation. So then we introduce our first distribution function s. Distribution function f to recover the mass balance equation, which is you can look at that as a conhiller equation and another distribution function to recover this second moment balance equation. Okay, so therefore, the equilibrium distribution function, so F EQ, so we use this. F EQ. So we use this form. Here you can see we involve the chemical potential here. So that they can consider different equation state by considering this formula, muj in this formula. Okay, then from the general trophy and scope analysis, so we can recover the model density. Density Ni by do the summation of this distribution function fi. And as mentioned, we need to introduce another distribution function H to recover the moment balance equation. So here that's H alpha introduced to recover the equation for U alpha. Uh, you are from uh uh then uh go through uh 12 miles analysis uh and then we can recover the velocity u alpha by using this formula. This rho is uh you know the mass density uh constructed by using the formula formula. Take the summation with take the summation and also with And also, with mobility of the molar density, so then that's the models and the numerical method. We have the mass balance equation, which is a Kahila equation and movement balance equation for this multi-convince and multi-phase flow problem. And we use multiple distribution functions to recover. Distribution functions to recover the mass balance equation and the moment balance equation. So then we do some numerical simulations to compare our result with existing result. The first numerical example is for the spreading of liquid lens. So I think this picture, Professor Wei Qingjian also showed this picture in the more. Show this picture in the morning talk. So, for these problems, we have a droplet. So, then with the phase two and the phase three, this liquid two and the liquid three. And so then they have the balance. And then you can calculate the contact angle, theta one, this phase one with phase two, the contact angle, and theta two, this phase one. 2, this phase 1 and phase 3 contact angle. And also, we can have the diameter, this D formula for this diameter. And also, we have this H1 and H2. The formula can be given explicitly. So we use this example. We will simulate the multi-component, the multi-phase flow problems, and compute the numerical result compared with. New market result compared with theoretical result. So then there's theta one can be calculated from this formula, and theta two, that's the axis placed formula and the diameter, and h i can be calculated from these formulas. So we do the computation for different density ratios with the phase one, the density ratio is ten. The density ratio is 10 to 5, that's phase 2, and to 1, that's phase 3. So, and then we compute with different parameters, we compare the numerical solutions. So, that's a numerical solution, that's an analytical solution, compute from the former formulas, and that's the relative errors. You can see, so for our numerical result, it's quite appropriate to this simulation. To this simulation. And the second example is for the layered pursuit flow. First, we consider two-layered pursuit flow problems. Then for this problem, so the analytic, we can have the analytical solution. Then we can compare our results with this analytical solution. So you can see the So you can see the solid line is for the analytic solution and this circle is a numerical result from our calculation. So that's agreed quite well. And then we do the computation for the four layered per flow. But for this problem, we don't have the analytic solution. But we have a previous simulation result from the restaurant papers. So we can compare our result with. Result with available data in this paper. So you can see that our result agree well with the previous data. You can see the four layers, right? One, two, three, four, the four layers. And then we simulate the rising bubble in the stratified layers, so with different bound number. With a different bound number, okay, the different bound number. So this riding bubble is rise upward due to the buoyancy. So the two layered phase one and phase two, and here we have a bubble, and then the bubble will rise. And you can see when the bone number is large, let's jump to the phase one quickly. And when this bone number And when this bound number is small, then it's because of self-tension. So it's rise slowly. Then we compare the mass evolution at a different time for different phase. You can see the mass conservation preserves quite well for three phase. That's a three-phase problems. This bubble and the phase one and phase two. One and phase two. We preserve the mass. Okay, and then we want to calculate some new marketing experiment to compare with the laboratory data. So that's a calculation of the subtention of a two-component hydrocarbon mixture. So for this problem, we use a Pen-Robinson equation of state because a hydrocarbon mixture. So here. Mixture. So here we have this methane and also the NDK, this mixture. So that's an initial data. So each block is a mixture of two hydrocarbon fluids. As initial data, because of self-tension, so then they move to a sphere. That's a 3D simulation. Then for this sphere, the surface tension, they... The subtension, in the laboratory, they can test the subtension. They give the data at different temperature. They have different data. So, and therefore the subtension, so we from our numerical simulations, we need a calculus subtension. We use this formula, okay? The initial how much free energy and the free. How much free energy and the energy at a different time. So, to calculate the error of the cross-surface, the A is a cross-surface error. So, as an initial data, okay, this is a sharp interface. So then you can calculate the error, the surface error, right? Because that's a square, okay? And then later, because we use a fish-field model, so we have a diffuse. Field model, so we have a diffuse interface. So we must consider this diffuse interface. So then we should calculate the error from we calculate the error A with two different approach. So we consider this diffuse interface part. If you do not consider the length of the diffuse interface part, you will get a larger result. Know a larger result, like larger result because you use a small a, right? So you must consider this diffuse interface part. Here is a comparison with the different method. This method one, so that's a sketch picture of the method one. So you use this straight line and cut this curve. Cut this curve, this point, and then you calculate this is like this is the error. And for the method two, so you just select like this is one and this is zero, and then the midpoint, you use that and give the error, false error. So the different method, you give a quite accurate result. So you can see this is experimental data, okay? Experimental data, okay, and that's our new MAC result. So this gave a compilation at temperature, this temperature. And this gave the comparison with different temperature, but at this constant pressure. So you can check this experimental data in some papers. Okay, so I think that's all the result for the model and the numerical method and the numerical experiment. We published that in this paper with Professor Yang and Dr. Zhang. And in this project, we give a multiple distribution function lattice Boltzmann model based on this free energy model for the multi-component matrices flow. And so in the future research, we want to develop efficient Lax-Bosman method for the non-asomo multi-component flow with relastic equation of state. So we want to resolve this very famous Leading Frost effect. This morning also, Professor Liu gave some wonderful talk, gave a wonderful talk on the Talk, there's a wonderful talk on this contact angle problems. We should consider this contact angle also. So, the idea is to refer to this dynamic vandal theory by this Anuki. They propose that in 2007, they have this dynamic vandal theory. And we want to use the AnSag principle method to develop the model and use the Latin Pusm method to do the simulation. Do the simulation. So, in fact, this morning when I listened to Professor Liu's talk and asked my poster Xiguang to do the simulation, give me some numerical simulations immediately. And he sent me a video. But I cannot put this PDF. I'll show to you the simulation result. Can I show the So that's the plate with the temperature change. And then the draw plate drop on the plate and jump up. And this can be compared with the previous numerical result. And we want to simulate a more complex experiment. Experiment in the laboratory. Like the finger, the plate is not, you know, the plan plate. That would be some finger hydrophobic surface. Okay, that's all. Thank you.
