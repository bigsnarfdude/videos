Okay, so a few applications, but not a lot. It's more about the fundamental question about what it means for some quantum gravity or other theory to be a space-time theory. And what we usually do is we start by applying a quantization procedure to some classical space-time theory like general relativity. General relativity and try to make it as consistent as possible. But even if it is consistent, it guarantees that it's a space-time theory only in the limit of h bar equal to zero. Not even limit. So if we just really just set it strictly equal to zero, we know there's a space-time interpretation because that's the classical theory. And the question is: what is if h-bar is non-zero, maybe still small, is there still a space-time interpretation and what does it mean? Interpretation and what does it mean, and how do we show that? So, that's the main question that I'm trying to address: extending the range to non-zero H bar. And what I came up with here as a working definition is that at least in certain limits, we have to be able to describe fundamental solution in our standard space-time picture. So, we have to figure out how to construct line elements corresponding to fundamental solutions. Elements corresponding to fundamental solutions, which initially might look very different. They might look, they might be canonical, if it's a canonical quantization, so we don't have space-time objects initially, or they might be algebraic objects like star product versions of line elements, which are not necessarily the same as the standard line elements. So they don't tell us immediately, for instance, how we evaluate solutions to find the horizon of a black hole. The horizon of a black hole, if it's not a standard line element or how to construct conformal diagrams, and so on. So, since we rarely use, maybe never use classical coordinates in our fundamental theories, we somehow have to find a different way to reconstruct line elements. And the two possible versions that I just could think of immediately here, there might be others, is from fundamental gauge transformation. So, this applies to canonical approaches, for instance. Applies to canonical approaches, for instance. They are still gauge theories. They're not space-time initially, but they have gauge transformations. And if we are able to somehow recognize the space-time diffeomorphism structure in these gauge transformations, we have a space-time theory. But that's usually not obvious. Or it could be from deformed symmetry. So, in this case, we also have to do some work. I think this was briefly mentioned in Marco's talk where he avoided the question of how to. Question of how to what these theories mean for non-zero theta. So that's a little bit like non-zero h-bar here. So that's where all these higher order derivatives and things like that come in. So the question is if there's still a well-defined space-time or line-element interpretation when these parameters are non-zero, even if they are small. So, in this sense, if this can be shown that they're effective line elements, I would say that's a theory in which. I would say that's a theory in which, in a semi-classical or some other limit, space-time emerges from the fundamental description. And I'll talk about how, in one case, how these line elements can be derived. It turns out that this general covariance in this sense is a very strong consistency condition. So, as soon as we move away from zero h-bar or zero parameters, it's usually very hard to find a consistent space-time interpretation. Space-time interpretation, and we've seen lots of space-time proposals today in the first two talks, for instance, and they're not consistent, they're not covariant in this sense. They might be consistent in some other meanings, but not as soon as h-bar is non-zero, which was the case in those talks, they don't obey the conditions that we'll see here. So, I should describe this a little bit, but on more general grounds. Now, since this is mainly a question about classical type space-time structures, we can Space-time structures, we can address this from the classical side first. So we can just look for the most possible ways to generalize classical dynamics or theories or action principles. The traditional approach would be something like higher curvature terms or extra fields like biometric, bi-tread, tetrad, and other things, maybe non-Riemannian like Finchler geometries. But there are always implicit assumptions about the space-time structure, which might not be met by. Structure which might not be met by our fundamental theories. We need space-time integrations, volume elements, curvature tensors, or some space-time tensors if we try to write down a possible action principle. So we need assumptions about space-time to formulate these potential effective space-time theories. And then it's never clear if these are really assumptions that are valid within our fundamental approaches. Now, the canonical formulation eliminates some of Canonical formulation eliminates some of these assumptions. Turns out there's still others in there because it really slices space-time into spatial slices. And then there are objects, instead of an action on spacetime, there are objects like the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism constraints, which are only spatial integrations. So we don't need a space-time volume element, we just need a spatial volume element, which is a weaker assumption. And we don't need space-time curvature tensors, we only need spatial. Curvature tensors. We only need spatial curvature or other tensors. So these are weaker assumptions, and in principle, they might give us a larger class of consistent space-time theories that go beyond higher curvature actions or the standard approaches with extra fields. And in recent work, Eric Duke is a grad student now at Penn State, used to be at Colima as an undergrad and master's student. And in this work, we've shown that this. We've shown that this expectation that there might be additional theories is actually true, at least in strictly symmetric and cylindrically symmetric models. So we're not sure yet about full configurations without any symmetries, but at least there are new possibilities that haven't been considered yet. So the idea is now in the next few slides, setting this up to eliminate assumptions as much as possible. So the first slide, if we start with special relativity, because we still want something related to space-time. Something related to space-time transformations. That's very close to a canonical picture, but just in terms of eliminating assumptions, instead of working with coordinate systems and global transformations for symmetries, we just use a definition of what a spatial slice is. So the black or the green lines here. So this replaces the spatial coordinate axes. And then to turn that into space-time, we have to. To turn that into space-time, we have to be able to deform these in a consistent way and transform from one slicing to a different slicing. And to do so, we need something like a time direction, but in this case, it's more convenient to use a normal direction. So these are these arrows. And they should be normalized in some way. So we have a unique way to specify how much we transform the distance. So I'll call these unit normal vectors. Unit normal vectors. And then this big n function here, which is the labs function of canonical gravity, can be any function of the spatial coordinates. And it tells us by how much we move the slide up slice upwards or downwards in the time direction, in the normal direction. And then on the new slice, when it's deformed, there's a new normal direction. And to indicate that we are considering Lorentzian signature space-time, we used the same kind of normal direction. Of non-right angles that we have in Minkowski diagrams. So, if we wanted to talk about four-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we would just use standard right angles. But for Lorentzian signature, they look like this. Turns out that's sufficient. So if we have this information, which is more local, weaker than the standard global transformations, we can reconstruct the space-time geometry, space-time 10. Geometry, space-time tensor line element, and show that it's really consistent and a diffomorphism invariant. So, in special relativity, these deformations would all be a linear function. So, the lapse function would be a constant, a time displacement, plus a linear term, which corresponds to a boost. So, speed and the coefficients. And then, if it's in three spatial dimensions, we have additional spatial displacements and rotation matrices. Placements and rotation matrices. So, that all the parameters that we usually have in Poincaré matrices are contained in these deformation functions in the linear case. We can do algebra with these objects. Here's a brief example. So, if we perform two normal deformations, two different lapse functions in the two opposite different orderings, top and bottom here, we end up at different. We end up at different locations with the same final slice, but there's a spatial displacement. We just follow the endpoints of the final vectors. And if we go through the geometry of these triangles here, we can calculate that the spatial displacement is just V times delta T, which we would also get from a commutator of two boosts. So we can do algebra if we really do this in all three dimensions and then one vertical for normal deformations. We can do all the quantities. We can do all the Poincaré algebra relations in this geometrical picture. Here's the example of signature. So the previous slides used Minkowski-Lorentzian signature. And so we have a displacement to the right. If we replace all these normal vectors with standard right angles, then we get a Euclidean geometry. And the only difference is that the final vectors point in the opposite direction. Opposite direction. So the minus sign in there is the signature. And so we'll use this later as an example. We can determine whether a space-time structure is standard type, so some that might be described by higher curvature terms or non-standard, by checking whether solutions might have dynamical signature change. So in high curvature actions, it never happens that the Lorentzian solution. Happens that the Lorentzian solution suddenly becomes Euclidean without going through singularities or things like that, just gaps in our space-time. But it turns out some of the new solutions can have dynamical signature change. So that's a simple way to check whether it is really something new or just an older version in disguise. Now, general relativity or something with curvature, we just moved from linear slices to curved slices. Slices to curved slices, and then also non-linear deformation functions, laps, and then the shift vector here in spatial directions. And from canonical GR classically, we have these commutators. So that's a little more complicated than Poincaré relationships. But it's also a consistent set of bracket or commutator relations. The main difference that's important. The main difference that's important conceptually is that we need the spatial metric in the last relationship. The first two are just lead derivatives, which are defined without a metric. Then the last one here for the gradient of these lapse functions, we need the spatial metric that's induced on a spatial slice if we already have a space-time metric. Now, if there's no space-time metric to begin with, then this QAB would just be some function, a field, or a function of the field. Or a function of the fields. And we have to figure out what the conditions are for that function to be a candidate for the spatial part of the space-time metric. So that's how space-time theories can be reconstructed from a theory that initially has weaker assumptions, which in this case is very close to canonical gravity, but the resulting effective theories might also be applied more generally. Now, some of the canonical Be symmetric. QAB here is it turns out to be symmetric. Yeah, it's, I'm not sure one might be able to look for even more general theories in which it is not assumed to be symmetric. But just for the purpose of this talk, I'll assume it's symmetric. Well, a metric, a spatial metric also has to be a spatial tensor. And it has to be the spatial part. And it has to be the spatial part of a space-time metric. So we have to be able to find additional. So these are the conditions that I consider here. And I'll have a few more details on those. And yeah, so it's symmetric by assumption, and it will automatically be a spatial tensor on each slice. But the question is whether it can be part of a space-time tensor on the combination of all the slices. And the canonical gravity. And the canonical gravity turns out hasn't always considered this general question, but it provides lots of methods to do so. So we have started with Pirak. So there's a few more details here. So this Q is the same as on the previous slide. So on this slide, it's really just starting with G R. So there's a space-time interpretation, and we'll just re-express it canonically. And then the Q that we saw, or rather the inverse. Saw, or rather, the inverse because we had upper indices determines the spatial part of the line element together with the shift vector here. And then the lapse function is the remaining time component of the space-time metric. Now, Dirac also showed that there are a phase-based function. First of all, there is a phase space, so the metric here then has momenta related to extrinsic curvature of these spatial slices. Of these spatial slices. And then the relationships, these bracket relationships here have an equivalent as Poisson bracket relationships of corresponding phase-based functions. So this would be the Hamiltonian constraint, which generates these time deformations, and the diffomorphism constraint generates these spatial deformations. So these are pretty long expressions, but we just have to know that they exist. To know that they exist. Dirac, I think it was Dirac, also showed that these functions then generate diffimorphisms, basically. So there's a version of general covariance. If we take a space-time vector field psi, then the lead derivative of any function of q and k is the same as the Hamiltonian vector field of a certain linear combination of t and s acting on the same function. T and S acting on the same function. And we have to do some linear combinations like this xi plus w xi t because the space-time vector field has components according to time and space directions. And these n and w functions are defined in terms of normal and spatial direction. We have to transform from a time direction to a normal direction, and that's what the linear combination does. But then Then, if these generators are also constraints, so if they vanish for n and w, it follows that we have this equality. So, on this constraint surface, we have general covariance. So, even though it's formulated canonically, there's only a spatial metric and extrinsic curvature on the phase space, we can make sure that we have full space-time covariance by checking this relationship. Variance by checking this relationship. And that relies on the constraint equations down here and the fact that the constraints have brackets of these forms, form in which the same metric appears that we use in our spatial part of the space-time metric. So that's the first set of results. And then a little bit later, Orman Kuhach Teilboin showed that there's also That there's also a dynamical relationship. So that can also be formulated fully at the canonical level. So they were looking for possible second-order field equations that have symmetries corresponding to these hypersurface deformation brackets two slides ago. And they showed that they're basically equivalent to Einstein's equation, which is not a big surprise maybe at this point. Maybe at this point. And the evolution equation that we didn't have yet on the previous slide are also obtained through Hamiltonian vector fields generated by T and S, and then directly with these N and W functions. So as we evolve then to the future, then the canonical evolution and the corresponding space-time theory are equivalent. And here we recognize the two constraint equations just as. The two constraint equations just as the tt and tx components of Einstein's equation, which don't have second-order time derivatives, so that's why they're constraints. And so that result, so it's a uniqueness result. There are two free constants, which are just Newton's constants and the cosmological constant. But up to this choice, for second-order field equations, the theories are uniquely determined. So that's equivalent to the standard statement that we just used. To the standard statement that we just used the Ricci scalar plus cosmological constant terms, maybe. But it turns out also this derivation, even though it was canonical, didn't use space-time tenders initially, it used hidden assumptions mainly in the way the normal direction is interpreted, because even if it's canonical and we have spatial constraints or integrations, we still have to figure out what normalization of the unit normal means. And that requires some kind of. And that requires some kind of assumptions or information about the space-time metric. So that's where these hidden assumptions work. So it doesn't mean that there's nothing else other than Einstein's equations. So at this point, open questions. First of all, it would also be interesting, independently of dynamics, how to interpret the meaning of these hypersurface deformations of shell when the constraints are not satisfied. We know they are equivalent to diffimorphisms on shell. To diffomorphisms on shell, but their consistent symmetry also off-shell. And the question is: if there's any independent meaning of that. And then the big question here for modified gravity, are there any additional theories that are not of the standard forms, like higher curvature? And they might be candidates for any as effective descriptions of any fundamental space-time theory. Now, a brief example. Now, a brief excursion here, because for some time I thought that might be related. It's not that likely anymore. But independently of these canonical derivations, there was more recently a mathematical development which tried to interpret these brackets as a consistent mathematical structure. And the problem here is also the appearance of the spatial metric. So it's not a Lie algebra because the Lie algebra would be labeled by N and W, but Be labeled by n and w, but it would not be able to describe the extra dependence on q. Mathematically, this suggests a bundle picture. So the generators n and w would be on the fiber, and the spatial metric would appear, would be describe points on the base manifold. So, and then if there's a bracket structure, that would be an algebraid. So, it's a bracket only on sections in this bundle. On sections in this bundle. And 2010, people tried to use a Lie algebra to describe this, and they showed in certain limits it was possible, or in certain cases, so on-shell. So if really, if the constraints are satisfied, there's a Lie algebraic interpretation. But that doesn't tell us anything about the off-shell meaning. And the second case was a metric-independent NNW, so really just. And and W. So, really, just because metrics appear on the base menu for just constant sections of this fiber bundle, but that's also a strong restriction. So, more recently, they found a new structure, which is an L-infinity algebra. So, instead of a Lie bracket, there's a bracket that's also anti-symmetric, but does not obey the Cobi identity. But in this case, these relationships were realized for any non-constant sections. So, what this suggested was. So, what this suggested was that because the Arkubi identity is violated here, that there's some kind of maybe non-associative structure if it's quantized. But also because in canonical gravity, all these physical evaluations or to use these find Lie derivatives corresponding to general covariance, for instance, we use Poisson brackets and they do obey the Jacobi identity. So there's some kind of mismatch between the underlying algebraic structure. Between the underlying algebraic structure, which is L infinity, and the Poisson bracket used for physical evaluations, which in some way suggested that this could actually lead to new gravitational theories, because if we transform from an initial set of T and S, which could be just the classical expressions, to linear combinations with metric-dependent coefficients alpha and beta here, then we are sensitive to non-constant sections in this. non-constant sections in this L infinity bundle, and then using Poisson brackets for physical evaluations could lead to new physical results. So that was the suggestion that might lead to modified gravity. But it seems there's a simpler argument now. So we don't actually have to use L infinity or non-associative stuff. So there's another argument that also leads to these linear combinations and corresponding modified. And corresponding modified gravity. And that's related to the hidden assumptions in previous derivations already mentioned. So there's this relationship between a leader robot in space-time and a Hamiltonian vector field. The leader robot is more details here. It has components defined by a time evolution vector field TA. So it defines the time direction and then some basis of our space-like slices. And the time evolution vector field itself is a superposition of the normal direction that's used in the canonical description of these hypersurface deformations and the same spatial basis. So that's where these linear relationships come from. So if we express xi in terms of n and s instead of t and s, we get the same linear combination that we already saw up here. And so that's the canonical. So that's the canonical generator down there. But the hidden assumption here is that we have to use a unit normal NA. So if we derive all this from GR, we know how to normalize N. But if we're trying to reconstruct the space-time metric from a fundamental theory, we don't initially know what the space-time metric is. So we can't really use that object to normalize an A. That's the hidden assumption in these previous derivations. And these previous derivations. And so the new reconstruction here, which is a generalization, uses some of the previous ingredients. So also here we look up the spatial part of the metric from one of these brackets. So that's directly in here. Now, in the general setting, well, first in the standard cases, classical GR, higher curvature. Um, classical GR higher curvature actions, a qij is always one of the fundamental fields if it's a metric theory, or it could be a combination, like tetraheds, but a simple combination. And if we don't start with a pre-existing space-time metric, this qij could be a more complicated function of the fundamental fields, but it would be defined by just making sure that we have exactly this form of the commutator. This form of the commutator of two of these normal deformations. And it must be of this form. If there are any extra terms, we don't have any chance to reconstruct general covariance. So that's one of the strong conditions. So that gives us the spatial part. And then we get a space-time metric if we also know the unit normal vector, just this standard expression here. So we have to find a way to define the unit normal independently of a pre-existing space-time metric. Independently of a pre-existing space-time metric. And the way we do this is we just take this T of n very literally as the generator in this unit normal direction. So whatever we call T of n, and which appears in a consistent relationship like this, will implicitly define the unit normal. And now these linear combinations that were initially suggested by these L infinity algebraids can also be motivated here because a linear combination like this combination like this redefines our t to a t prime so according to this definition it redefines our unit normal vector and then the space-time metric will also be modified not only by the q term but also by the n term if we use something like this so that's the idea and of course one has to go through lots of calculations to make sure that the brackets can really be maintained in this form even after a linear combination Even after a linear combination, if alpha and beta are metric dependent, or even also depending on extrinsic curvature, then the Poisson bracket of this T prime will also give us derivatives of alpha and beta. So it's no longer guaranteed that we just have this simple expression on the right. So all these extra terms from derivatives of alpha and beta basically have to cancel out. And again, that's a strong condition, which we've checked in a few cases. So spherical symmetry. Checked in a few cases. So, spherical symmetry here is one example. In this case, that's more like a triad formulation with spatial metrics here. So, we have this E1 and an E2 component, but it uniquely defines the spatial metrics. So, really, it's really just a canonical transformation from some Q to these two E's here. And then N and W canonically and the time components. Components. E1 and E2 have momenta K1 and K2. And then classically, the diffomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints look like this. So just some expressions. But they're long, but at least they're explicitly known. And now we can try to see what happens if we do linear combinations. So if we replace n with some n prime here, metric dependence or extrinsic curvature dependence in n, or really e and k dependence. dependence and we replace w with some w prime which has an end contribution so this corresponds to the previous linear combination here of t and s to a new t prime so with these expressions we can just go through all these equations so we get a new t prime we compute the t prime t prime Poisson bracket check if it's still of the form the required form up here and see what the new Q is And see what the new Q is. It's no longer a simple combination of the E's in this case. And these are the results. So for consistency and covariance, we need this specific alpha. And then so there are two free functions, mu and lambda, which are only functions of E1. None of the other fields appear there. There's an explicit k2 squared, but without a free function. And then s here can be plus or And then S here can be plus or minus one. So we just separate out the sine choice. And if alpha is of this form, then beta has to be strictly related to the same function. There are no additional free functions in beta. So this guarantees that we have this hypersurface deformation bracket and general covariance of this Qxx, since vertical symmetry then the previous Qij is just a single Qxx is X is given by this function. And if alpha and beta are of this form, then it really is the spatial part of a spherically symmetric metric. So it has the correct, the gauge transformations acting on these fields generated by the modified T and S are exactly of the right form for coordinate changes of a spatial metric. So in the classical case, Pxx was just, the inverse was just E1. The inverse was just E1 over E2 squared. And now that term is still there on the right, but there's lots of extra stuff. So it's not a simple expression of the basic fields anymore. So classical GR in any higher curvature version would simply be E1 over E2 squared. So the extra terms here are in this more general emergent modified gravity. Some implications, so just a few applications here. s equal to plus one, that's the first sign choice. In this case, there's a boundedness condition on k2 because the square root has to be real. And we can simplify some of the expressions by using a canonical transformation. So it looks like something we can use trig identities if k2 is related to a sine function and then canonically e2 is related. canonically E2 is related to E prime with the cosine, assuming at least in this case, for simplicity that lambda is a constant. So I don't have the details here, but this is related to some of these non-singular black hole models because the same, this kind of modifications had we found earlier without this modified gravity background. David Brigoela and Acier Alonso Badalki had a series of papers where they Where they applied the same canonical transformation. In their case, it was actually motivated by Lupin gravity. I think it was in Burek's talk somewhere. Whenever there's a sine or a cosine of extrinsic curvature, that's usually something that could also appear in models of loop point and gravity. I think Ed had the holonomy expression in his talk. And it's usually used for non-singular models because it implies boundedness of extrinsic curves. It implies boundedness of extrinsic curvature. So, with this replacement, it's usually not too difficult to avoid singularities. But the big question is whether this replacement is really consistent with space-time structure, and it is in this case here, because it follows from an implementation of all these conditions. But it's only a canonical transformation, it doesn't introduce any new physics. The new physics comes in because we have this E and K dependent alpha. E and K dependent alpha in our linear combination. So, because we're redefining the unit normal, we're reconstructing a modified space-time geometry. And in this case, this modified theory can also be non-singular. So initially, it was unclear whether the linear combination or the canonical transformation are relevant, but now this extra background, we know it's the linear combination. The other sign choice S equal to negative one. We haven't fully worked that out yet, but We haven't fully worked that out yet, but in this case, there are solutions which have this dynamical signature change. So that's another indication that this is really non-standard space-time dynamics, which can still be described by effective line elements. But then we have to use different ones, Lorentzian or Euclidean signature, depending on where we are in these larger solutions. So you're losing causality. Globally, there's no causal structure. Within one of the regions, you might still have some. So you get mixed type differential equations if you try to connect the different regions. So this Euclidean part, it depends. In most cases, it would be at large curvature. So we can approach this region. Can approach this region in a causal way. But in this case, up here, there's no signature change. But if there's singularity avoidance and signature change, then it's still non-deterministic. So you can't really get through, even though there's no curvature blow up, you still can't get through it if that happens. But then there are also models in which you do not have signature change, but still bounded curvature. So it's still, it's a lot of models that still have to be worked out. Models that still have to be worked out. So, open questions here. So, the big question is whether there's still something that's non-standard beyond spherical and cylindrical symmetry. So, we're working on this. It's a much harder derivation. But if it exists, it would provide a complete set of candidate effective descriptions. So, there are no hidden assumptions other than what we assumed about spatial structure. So, we still assume. About spatial structure. So, we're still assuming that the spatial kind of geometry is unmodified. We're still integrating over space. So, more generally, that could also be changed in some way. It would be a harder analysis. Now, initially, all these questions were motivated by models of loop point and gravity because they start modifying classical expressions and then putting it back together in line element without checking if it's actually covariant. And most of them are really just. And most of them are really just not covariant. So, even though they work with line elements and construct conformal diagrams, talk about horizons and so on, it's ill-defined, it's slicing-dependent or gauge-dependent. So it's really not a space-time structure. And then the only way to get something like loop quantum gravity effects is by a canonical transformation, which is a very weak module. It's really no modification at all. Now, in the last Now, in the last question, so I'm trying to make some context with the non-commutative geometry. A few years ago, we worked out some examples of hypersurface deformation brackets with non-commutative modifications. And the main difference with what I showed is that the lead derivatives and also this more complicated part where the metric appears look the same, but they're star products. Same, but they're star products instead of standard products in a special specific ordering of all the terms. So if we try to interpret this in maybe around the classical case, so we would expand the star product, and then we get higher derivatives, higher spatial derivatives of lapse and shift. So that's something that's not included in the descriptions I've shown here. And as far as I know, there's really no shift. As I know, there's really not much known about the algebra from the algebraic picture, for instance, or the geometry of something that's implied by hypersurface deformations with higher order spatial derivatives. So that would still be an open question and might lead also to additional modified gravity theories, but probably even harder to analyze. So that's all I have. And if there are questions, I'll be happy to answer them. Thank you. I'll be happy to answer them. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Any questions? How unique is the matrix at one week one week? The right way as a really a spatial part of a space-time metric. So these are additional equations. But if they are all satisfied, then the corresponding space-time metric is unique. So we calculated this in a bimetric theory where you start with two metrics, and a question was. Start with two metrics, and the question was: What is the matrix that you read off from the algebra? Basically, and it turned out that both are possible. So, there is not a unique way of writing the algebra. And depending on how you write it down, how you parametrize things, you get the same set of, okay, you get a set of first-class constraints, which are linear combinations of each other, but you can read off at least two very different matrix from them. Yeah, yeah, that's true. So, I should mention we are. True. So I should mention we are assuming that there are no extra fields. There is really only the number of fields that you need for a single metric and maybe some matter of fields. So it does not cover bimetric. Yes. Thanks. More questions? Are there yeah I'm wondering can can you add some extrinsic curvature to the spatial sections there? spatial sections there that will give you some additional some of your additional things yeah yeah that's actually what we assume um so um so it comes in only i think of one of the the earlier slides is so it it comes in only through um the phase space so we need a phase space to do all these canonical derivations so we assume there's a q and a k and classically k would be related to extrinsic Classically, K would be related to extrinsic curvature. And if we go through this reconstruction, if it's non-classical, something like these alpha and betas here, then this K2 here would not be extrinsic curvature. It would be one of the phase-base functions. So we would have to go to the reconstructed space-time line element where this qxx appears in the spatial part here. And then we could compute extrinsic curvature. Compute extrinsic curvature for this space-time metric and see how that's related to k2. So that would be it's not a fundamental field for us, extrinsic curvature, but there's at least a degree of freedom for it that's contained on the phase space. Any more questions? Is there any qua if if anybody has a question via Zoom, you can raise your hand, but I think Europe is probably a bit late now. Europe is probably a bit late now, no? I don't know how is there anything? No. Well, probably it's a bit after nine. Probably it's a bit. Okay, so if not, then thanks, Martin, again. And now there is a break.
