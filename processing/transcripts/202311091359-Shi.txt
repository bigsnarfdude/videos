To the second talk of the afternoon session. So, our second speaker, unfortunately, couldn't make it to be here. And she's Jesse from MIT, and she's going to talk about the Nuscar equation. Okay. Thank you so much for the invitation, and thank you so much for helping me to make this talk online. I'm going to talk about the analytic of the solution to the Muscadi equation. To the Musgat equation. So, our Muscat equation is a free boundary problem that studying the interface between fluids and two fluids in the porous media. For example, we have oil and water in the stand, and we want to study the interface of it. And we will focus on the 2D case with the same viscosity and different densities rho 1 and rho 2. So, in our 2 decays, means the interface is a 1. means the interface is a 1D curve. So this is a graph illustrating how things work. So we have two fluids with different density row one and row two and the boundary curve is driven by the velocity field U. And the velocity field will follow the Darcy's law, so this equation one. And here the mu is the premium is the viscosity and we take it to be same in both flowers and the kappa is the premium And the kappa is the permeability constant, and P is pressure, G is the gravity constant, and œÅ is density. And we also let our fluids to be incompressible, so it's divergence-free. Our density will satisfy this transport equation with velocity as defined using the Darcy's law. And because we have two fluids, so we'll have to, this row is a sum of these two characteristics. Sum of these two characteristic functions and is taken to be a constant in one fluid and another constant in another fluid. So if we plug in our row equation into our equation one, we know that the gradient perp of this V, which is vorticity, will vanish inside the fluids and it will only concentrate it on the boundary of the fluids. So if we give a parameterization of the boundary, then our vortex. Of the boundary, then our vorticity field can be written like this. So, first, it will concentrate it on the curve, and also the strength of it is the difference of the density times the derivative of the second coordinate. And after we get the vorticity, we can use the divergence-free condition and BR-Sovat law to recover our velocity field, and then we can get the equation for the interface. So, I will directly jump. So, I will directly jump to the equation for the interface, and this is how it looks in our periodic setting. Here, Z is the parameterization of the boundary, and it is periodic, means it minus alpha naught is periodic. And it looks a little bit complicated here, but I will show a very simple linear model later. And so, there are two conditions that relate to That relates to related to it, which is called our quote condition and the related coefficient. Sorry, there's something wrong with my slides. I don't know why they don't show. But the relativity coefficient is something that depends on the difference of the first coordinates and the difference. And the difference of the density and the derivative of the first coordinates, and the sign of it will characterize the behavior of the equation. And for our art code condition, this is defined as the denominator, this cosine minus cosine over beta square is bounded, and this preventing our curve from intersect with itself. So, our study will base on the property that the record condition may be negative. Our quote condition may be that is bounded, and the related coefficient may be take different sign. So, these are the three regimes that we are considering. So, for the first regime, the figure 1A, where the lighter liquid is above the heavy liquid, which we call it in the stable regime, and here is corresponding to our relative coefficient is positive. And in the second one, which is And in the second one, which is the heavier liquid is above the lighter liquid, its corresponding to relateral coefficient is negative. So we are in the backward stable regime. And in the last picture, it is the surface has a turnover point. And for example, in this S2, the heavier liquid is above, is below the lighter liquid. And in this S1, the heavier liquid is above the lighter liquid. So it will be in an unstable rate. So, it will be in an unstable regime. And as I said, the linear model is very simple and is equal to the is defined as the derivative of f is the negative times the related coefficient times this negative proportion to the one-half. And when the sigma is always positive, it is corresponding to the figure 1A. And when the sigma is always negative, it is corresponding to the figure 1B. And if it changes sign, it will. If it changes sign, it will be into our unstable regime figure 1c. So, depending on the different sign of the linear model, we will, as I said, it separated into these three cases. So, in the stable case where the heavy liquid is above the is below the lighter liquid, it has a parabolic behavior because the operator is negative Laplacian to the one-half. La Partian to the one-half. And in this regime, there are many results, and some of them are, most of them, are the local existence and well, and global existence results. And the lowest sub-left space that we have local existence results is the H3 over 2. And this is proved by ZAD and Yuan. They show that the solution in the initial data in H3 over 2 will have a local well-posedness. Well postness. And if given some smallness or medium-sized condition, then they will also have the global well-posedness. So also the Garcia Auras, Komoserano, Yuen, and Posidor, they show the existence of the self-similar solution. And with Hazio, they also show that the solution can start from the initial data with multiple corners. And because we have a parabolic behavior, Because we have a parabolic behavior in this regime, so the solution, if with the assumption they are sufficiently smooth for the initial data, it will have the instantly analytic results. The first proof by Castro, Cordoba, Fifmon Consado, and Los Fernandes, they show the solution. If stars from the H4 initial data, then it must be instantly analytic if they are in the stable case. And Matioc improved this result to the H3. this results to the h3 over hs where s is greater greater than 3 over 2 and gonsardo garcia oras peto and string they show the uh they prove the results in the winner algebra and they show that if given a median size initial data which depends on the different viscosity then they can have the instant analyticity of the equation of the solution and their results also cover some 3d 3d results Some 3D equations results. So, this is all about the stable case. So, if we go to the backward stable case where the heavier liquid is above the lighter liquid, so in this regime, this equation is L-posed and it's by Cordova and Gonsado. So, finally, we are going to our unstable case. So, in this case, as we shown in our last figure, so first we have Figure. So, first, we have this relay tailor breakdown, and by the Castro Cadoba, Feferman, Gonzalo, and Lof Fernandez, they show that the solution can start from the figure 1A, which from the interface is a graph, and a turnover can happen, which means it will from figure 1A and go to figure 1C. And after the turnover happens, the solution can start to become not small. Solution can start to become not smooth. So, this is called the breakdown of the smoothness. So, initially, it is a graph solution with H4, and it starts to become instant analytic, and it will continue to be instant analytic until the turnover happens. And once the tenor happens, it may start to break down, and the solutions may become not in C4 after some time. And in this regime, there's also interesting. Regime: There's also interesting behavior about the switch stability by the Kodoba, Komuserano, and Zerotas. They show the solutions can start from the figure 1A, which is the stable case, and go to the unstable case and go back to the stable case. And on the other hand, they also construct the solution that can start from our unstable case, then go to the stable case, and go back to unstable case. So this interesting switching stability behavior. Interesting switching stability behavior. And in this case, the uniqueness is a hard and unsolved open problem. And also, in the literature, there is no result about the analyticity. So our goal is to study the analyticity of the solution in this unstable case. And motivation is that, so first we have this parabolic behavior in a stable case, and also we have the backward parabolic behavior. We have the backward parabolic behavior in the backward stable case. So, although here our relater coefficient changes sign, we are hoping that we still are able to get some parabolic behavior locally. And also, the analytic, if we show that the solutions are analytic, then some Kershikrovsky type argument can tell us a good energy estimate, which will lead to the existence and the uniqueness. So, this is Uniqueness. So, this means that once if we can show that the solution in the unstable case are all analytic, then the uniqueness will follow. However, I couldn't get this fully analytic result. I will discuss later. So, here is our first result, is the analystity except at the general points. So, if we assume that Z is the solution that is That Z is the solution that is sufficiently smooth and satisfies our chord condition, then it must be analytic, except the turnaround points, and also we let the time to be greater than zero and less than t star. So this means as long as z is sufficiently smooth and satisfies our code condition, then except that when the turnover of the surface happens, the other points should be analytic. So here I will start you So, here I will start to explain some brief idea of our proof. So, this is still a graph showing a two turnover. So, the linear model, as I mentioned before, is in this case, is derivative of f is equal to negative the relativity coefficient times lambda f. And in this case, we let the relativity coefficient to be alpha, which is the simplest function that will change sign. function that will change sign and this coefficient is equal to zero when alpha is zero and is positive when alpha is greater than zero and is negative when alpha is negative so we want to show the analyticity that is accepted to normal points so we assume that alpha is not equal to zero so for example we want to study the behavior when alpha naught is positive the first thing we are going to do is we guess what the analyticity region guess what the analyticity region will look like near Africana. So we guess it should be look like as this region. So we call it omega t and it is bounded by two curves. One curve is C of alpha t and another curve is negative c of alpha t. When t is equal to zero, these two curves coincide with each other, so there's no analyticity assumption at initial data. And when t is not equal to zero the solution, the analyticity To zero, the solution, the analyticity region starts to expand, and we will have the analyticity whenever t is not equal to zero. So, the reason why we can do this localization technique is because, so although our lambda alpha, which is the composition of Hilbert transform and derived, it is a non-local operator, but the analyticity of this lambda alpha will only be locally dependent on the analyticity of f. So we are able. Of f. So we are able to do the localization without damage the analysis behavior of the equation. And second, as I said, the related coefficient, when it is positive, it will have good behavior when time goes forward. And if it's negative, then it will have a good behavior when time goes backwards. So we would let time go to the direction that is better when we pick the, when we study the behavior. When we study the behavior locally, so here's our plan. So, first, we have this region as we define as omega t, and we will do the following parametrization. So, we parametrized this region into infinite many green curves, and for each green curve, it will correspond to a fixed gamma. And then we find the complex. And then we find the complex extension f of our solution f on the each green curve. And after we find this complex extension, we still need to show that this extension must be real satisfy the Kaucher-Manner operator, Kauchi-Mann equation, because it has to be an analytic extension. And then by these two steps, we can show that the solution must be analytic. Be analytic. So, in order to find a complex extension, we need to find the solution, the equation that the extension should satisfies. So first we will do this localization. So we let the f, we time a cutoff to the f, and we separate the f into two equations, two functions. So the first is the tilde f, the one that we want to study. That we want to study, and the second one is the one that is not so important because it's one minus lambda time f. And by our good choice of lambda, it will always be analytic in the region omega t. So here is a graph illustrating how we choose our lambda. So this is chosen as whenever lambda is, it will always It will always equal to one whenever the c of alpha is not equal to zero. And then, if we time this cutoff lambda, it will not damage the anomalousity behavior in this omega t. So by this separation, we are able to find the equation for tilde f. So the equation of tilde f, the only two difference is first our related coefficient itself times a cutoff. Now it becomes lambda r. Now it becomes lambda times alpha. And the second is we plus a term that is always analytic in this omega t. So it will act as a good term. And it is because it's analytic. So whenever whatever we do with it, it will still be analytic. And the lambda, the alpha relateral coefficient times lambda alpha, now it becomes non-negative. So it is good. And we are able to do the energy estimate. To do the energy estimate, but because of the non-negativity. So now we are able to find the equation for H. So we set the H alpha gamma t to be the extension of our tilde F, which is the cutoff times F on this cutoff. The cutoff times f on this complex plane with fixed gamma, and we can derive the equation for h. So, the difference between the equation for h and the equation for our f tilde is that it has an extra term, which is a derivative of h times some coefficient. And this coefficient, it is the numerator is I C of alpha gamma. So, our C of alpha can be chosen sufficiently small. So, this term. Sufficiently small, so this term actually can be chosen sufficiently small. So, although it is a high-order term, we want to make the C of alpha sufficiently small such that it can be absorbed by the good term. And this initial data is taken to be tilde f of alpha at t is equal to zero. And notice that for every gamma, we set it to be the same value, because if we go back to our definition for the analyticity. For the analyticity region that we want to study for every gamma, when t is equal to zero, the curve will coincide with each other, and they are all corresponding to the real line. So we are going to take it as the same initial data. So now we derive a new equation. And because the related coefficient is non-negative now, and we can choose C of alpha sufficiently small, and this term. And this term can absorb the bad term caused by the derivative times i. So we can get the energy estimate for the HK norm of H and the HK norm of derivative of H with respect to gamma. These two energy estimates helps us to get the existence of H and the smoothness of H with respect to gamma and alpha. And the final energy estimate we need to do is we need to control. Do is we need to control the difference of h and f tilde. So the difference of our solution we found and the original equation. So in this, if we could control that by the groundwork inequality, it will always be equal to zero. And this means the edge we find is really an extension of our solution when gamma is not equal to zero. So the main gradient of this is because So, the main gradient of this is because the non-negative relativity coefficient, and this can let us use the guardian's inequality in the literature. And here is our step two. The step two is now we have an complex extension, and we still don't know our extension if it's analytic or not. So, we still need to show that it satisfies the Kirchhoff-Riemann equation. So, we let the Kirchi-Riemanni-Miyi So we let the Kershama operator define as R, and we use our parametrization, new parameter, to show this operator. It will look like this. And because our F is already sufficiently smooth with respect to alpha and gamma, so we only need to show it is zero. So it is not easy to show it point-wisely, so we choose still use our energy estimate method to show the L. method to show the L T norm of it is zero. So we still want to use our equation to control the L T norm, the growth of the L T norm of R of H. So the equation we have is the equation for H and we want to put a related coefficient R on both handside. So the last term, when the R is ketam, the cutoff times the analytic function is zero because function is zero because after the cutoff is one whenever the r is not zero and the thing with left is one term in the left hand side and another term in the right hand side and then we show that for the left hand side operator it commutes with r and the left right hand side integration operator it also commutes with r so the r of h is actually satisfy the same satisfy the similar equation as h. So we can use the similar energy estimate as h to bounce the r of h. And then we have the ground wells inequality. And after we get the ground well inequality, in order to show that it is zero, we only need to show the initial data is zero. And the initial data is zero because we go back to our operator, second line. When t is equal to zero, the first term is zero because there it has a t. zero because there it has a t and the second term the derivative with respect to gamma and we will go back to our original definition of the initial data which we chose it to be the tilde f of alpha naught that's for every gamma so it will just not depend on gamma then take the gamma derivative is zero so our initial data is zero and we have a groundwork inequality then we are able to show that our solution To show that our solution is always analytic, so this means the analyticity far away from to normal points. So, these are the two lemmas that I mentioned. So, the first lemma is the commuting behavior with the left-hand side operator. If given the H is sufficiently smooth with respect to alpha, T, and gamma, then we have this commuting behavior of the left-hand side operator. So, for the So, for the right-hand side operator, it is an integration operator. We show that if this k tilde is meromorphic, and so it has the analytic itself as a kernel, and also we need the contour has some smoothness condition, and also it has a vanishing boundary condition. Then we have, if we do the Kirch-Shreyman operator, apply on this integration operator, it is commute with the linear part of it. commute with the linear part of it. So if we just use it on our linear model, it will exactly same, exactly commute. And if we use our unlinear equation as our mutual equation, it will not exactly commute, but the linear part is already good enough for our energy estimate, so it won't cause trouble. So this is the two commuting lemmas about the Kaucherima operator. But last, I also want to talk about our results that are concerning the analyticity solution near the tenor points. So because we really study this behavior near the tenor points, as I mentioned, when alpha is greater than zero, the behavior is good when time goes forward, and when alpha is less than zero, the behavior is good when time goes backwards. When time goes backwards, so we really need to cut this equation at this point. So, in order to make it smooth enough after the cutoff, we will guarantee a higher regularity, which is C infinity regularity of our equation, of our solution. And also, we said the solution has two tenoral points. So, actually, it can be any finite, many tenor points because we will use a localization. And we also said this. And we also set these three conditions on this equation, on this solution. And those all three conditions are generic. And the first conditions shows that the related coefficient only vanished to the first order, not the second order. And the second condition shows that the interface will only have two tenor points. Actually, we can have finitely many tennoral points. And the last condition. And the last condition is a more interesting condition. It means that in the linear model, the sign of a transport term is not zero. So this is because we study the behavior at general points. So originally the transport term is harmless, but here it acts as the wind that either blows the solution from the good behavior region to bad behavior region or it will Behavior region, or it will vice versa blow the solution from the bad behavior, bad behavior region to good behavior region. So, the sign of this transport term really matters and it in fact our way to treat it. So, if given these three generic conditions, we show that our solution can be analytically extended to the following region. So, this region will have a degenerate rate and escogenic rate. And escogenic rate at neural points. So here is a graph showing how our analyticity region will look like. So all this shaded area are the region that we can extend our solution to. And this Z1 and Z2 are corresponding to two neural points. And the region degenerates at these two points at a quadratic rate. At quadratic rate. So, I want to mention that this may not be the optimal analytic region. They may actually be analytic everywhere, or they may just like this. So, I don't know yet. So, we still use our original structure to deal with it. So, we set the cutoff and we define this omega t, which is our shaded area. But here, we chose our c of alpha to be alpha square near alpha zero. So it's Near alpha zero. So it's this quadratic rate. So, and we will have an extra transport term that at the wind blows to different direction. So the sign of it will matters. And also we need a new localization. So this is because we do the cutoff near alpha equal to zero. So we have to make it smooth enough. So we subtract up to 60 orders polynomial and then times. Polynomial and then times the cutoff lambda. This is a smooth cutoff, and we can't times the non-smooth cutoff, which is the characteristic function of alpha greater than or equal to zero. So here, some difficulties show up, which related with our cutoff. First is the higher order estimates. So the Herobot operator, as we all know, Herbert transform, it is the integrated. It is the integration from negative infinity to infinity of f beta over alpha minus beta. So this one is bounded in any HK, but after we do the cutoff, this thing is still bounded in L2 because we can always do the L2 extension, but it's not no longer bounded in the HK when the K is greater than equal to 1 due to some boundary behavior. So in order to fix this boundary behavior, we have to change the contour of the integral. Have to change the contour of the integral. If we are on the real line, we will just change the contour from zero to infinity just directly to the integral from zero to two alpha. And if we are on the compactly region, we will change this green line to this new line, which corresponds, which consists of three curves. So this first curve is this blue line. It will be the same as this green line in the left graph. So we do the same integral from when beta. The same integral from when beta is between 0 to 2 alpha. And when beta is greater than 2 alpha, we will do the integration on the real axis. And when beta is equal to 2 alpha, we will do this straight vertical line integral. So if we use our equation to write it, our lambda alpha is this leg integral, is the integration from negative infinity to positive infinity. integration from negative infinity to positive infinity and we let h to be zero when alpha is beta is less than zero so now we only left with the part from zero to infinity and after we change the contour it will become this three integral plus some boundary terms so the first two integrals will be only two terms that depends on h so this thing because we only do the integration on 0 to 2 alpha so it will preserve the So it will preserve the good behavior of H when a good behavior when it's near alpha of zero. And the term that is far away from the origin, we will plug in our original solution. So this f tilde is known. So we will treat it as a fixed term and does not depends on our non-extended solution. And in this way, we are able to do the derivative and the boundary term will have a good cancellation and we won't have a higher. Isolation and we won't have a high-order term coming from derivative. So we have treated the high-order derivative, and we also need to treat the low-order derivative, which is the L2 estimate. And before we use this guardian inequality, but here we cannot use anymore. Exactly due to our cutoff. This cutoff is not smooth. So we will, when we use our original way, it will have a logarithm lost. So we need to do find. So, we need to do find the refined guardians in quality, and also it should be compatible with our approximation. And we are able to find it. And this is our lemma. So, with the loss of this constant 9, original, it should be 1. So, we find that the left-hand side, which corresponding to the derivative of g times f as the limit, is controlled by the right-hand side, which is corresponding to f times the negative Laplacian to the one-half of f. Laplacian to the one-half of f as the limit. So, this is our refined Guardian's inequality in the approximation setting. So, finally, we need our new lemmas for the Kerr-Schiman operator. So, our integral, as I said, we have to cut it off and separate into several terms because in order to control the careboard transformation. So, it is not the same as So, it is not the same as the original integration operator. So, we need to do a new Kershawman operator commuting that must. And this is still able to be done because when we do the change, we only change the contour or we do some integration by parts. This will not affect the analytic structure. So, if we do the analytic operator, Kershima operator, we still hope something interchange can happen. So, actually, it holds. So actually, it holds, but we have to plus some perturbation as the lower term. But this lower term is good, behaves well in our energy estimate, so it will not affect our proof. And then we are able to close our proof with this new lemmas for the Cauchy-Mau operator. And so this is for the degenerate analysis near the turnover points. And I also want to mention that. And I also want to mention that this technique, I believe it is general because it really does not rely on the structure of the integration operator, and I think it can be applied to many other techniques. Thank you so much. Questions or comments or jazz? Have you tried to put surface tension? To put surface tension in the model? Not yet. I didn't try it yet. But I think it's a good way, yeah, good direction to try. So you think the same result will hold true if you put some extension? I don't know. Yeah, it it will be have some it will be a different equation, so I'm not sure if it will work. Yeah. Any other questions? Any other questions, comments? If not, let's thank Gieria. Now there is a coffee break. I think I'll be for the path. Thank you so much. You don't have to get very interesting.
