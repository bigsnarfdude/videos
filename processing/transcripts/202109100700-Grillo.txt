Thanks a lot to all the organizers for this very interesting talk, so many interesting meetings with so many interesting talks and different points of view of related topics. I really appreciated it. So, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot also for the opportunity of seeing so many friends, unfortunately, so far at a distance. But let's hope soon in person. But let's hope soon in person. Well, what I'm going to say, don't be afraid, has nothing to do with stochastics. Okay, it's just a name, a property I'm going to mention in a moment, and it is the content of work with Matteo Muratori from Milan El Suer and Kazuelus Shikide from the University of Tokyo. And so let me start about. So let me start about. Let me see whether I can. Well, the starting point will be taking a manifold, which I call M and well, it is a smooth manifold. It is assumed to be complete, connected and non-compact. That's crucial to what we say, essentially, because in a compact manifold, everything will not be a problem according to the properties we are going to. So the problem is in. So, the problem is interesting in the non-compact setting, let's say, otherwise, there is nothing to say. So, it's not a restriction, it's just singling out the correct setting in which we want to work. Well, what is stochastic complex of the metaphor we are considering? Well, consider the heat kernel, I call it KTXY, the usual linear. The usual linear heat kernel, so the kernel of the heat operate of the heat semi-group on the manifold of the minimal heat semi-group. And we say, it is said that the manifold is stochastically complete if the integral of one of the two variables is the same with the first the symmetric. So never mind about which one, if the integral in space of the heat kernel is one for all. Is one for all the other spatial variables and the other 12 for one couple x t and hence for all other couples x t. Okay, well, this is a property. This might be true or might not be true. Depends on the manifold. It's really a property and one could guess where it is always true, but it is not. Okay, there are many for seeing which this is not true. And I'll mention that later in some detail, not so much, just to. So much just to fix ideas that there are several characterizations in terms of analytic and geometric quantities of this property, for this property to hold or not to hold. Well, what is this kernel, just to fix notation and ideas, where it is a solution to the heat equation when the initial data mu zero is a zero delta. Okay, well, I have put here u0. I have put here U0 instead of delta and time t instead of plus infinity as I wish in this specific case, because I will need this equation in a larger setting later. So HE heat equation will be needed with the generic U0 and the generic T here, but for defining the heat kernel, U0 is the 0 delta at the point X and T is plus 3. Well, it is known that it's something which I will say in more detail later, but okay, this okay, this MC is a misprint. Stochastic complete, okay, no, it's not the business, this is the label I put here. This mass conservation, okay, it is true. Uh, if and only if the identity in space. The identity in space and time is the unique solution to the heat equation corresponding to the initial data on a constant. So, one will guess this is always true once again. Okay, you take a constant, the solution of, of course, the constant is a solution as well of the heat equation, but there might be other solutions that's a surprising statement, but in some cases this happens. Well, why stochastic completeness? Well, the point is that, let me Is that let me show this whole slide? Is that well? If you take, let me go to the last part of the slides. If you take this issue here, this quantity here, namely one minus the integral of the heat kernel or one of the spatial variable, well, if this is not zero, it means that there is a non-zero probability that the Brownian motion starting at x escapes. At x escapes to infinity at a finite time t. And so the speed of the Brownian particle may grow up when you go towards infinity in a sense, and the speed may diverge in some cases. So you can reach infinity in a finite time. Once again, this is something which happens. In fact, this is the connection, is the link to the Is linked to the fact that the heat current is a transition probability of Brownian motion. So it is the probability that the Brownian particle jumps, travels from X to Y in time t. Okay, this is the probability density of this to happen. And so there is a clear connection between Brownian motion on the manifold M and analogy property of the heat curve. Well, let me state an analytic characterization of stochastic completeness, and it is the following one. Okay, let me show it. The following statements are equivalent. This is a result of Ligorian. I forgot to say the journal here. Practice, I don't remember, but when I mention another paper. but when I mention another paper later, sorry for forgetting, but I'm speaking now, I don't remember, but I mentioned another paper with reference and everything is found there. But the original place in which we state this is another one. Well, stochastic completeness is equivalent to the following statements. The heat equation, it was the equation in the first slide, maybe you remember, in which you have the heat equation with generic boundary. With generic boundary initial datum, has a unique non-negative solution in each strip, okay? A unique non-negative and bounded solution in L infinity, and the initial datum is always assumed to be bounded here in all time interval and for all initial datum which are bound. The other properties concern elliptic equations. This concerns elliptic equation, and so this is an elliptic equation, say, with the wrong sign, but this is an equation which is widely studied even in the Euclidean setting. So the eigenvalue equation with the wrong sign in some sense, alpha is a positive number, has no non-negative, non-trivial bounded solution. You see, this equation is something that clearly this. Clearly, this is true in Rn. There are no non-negative, non-zero boundary solutions of such equations in Rn, but in different geometric settings, this is not so clear. And in fact, this property is equivalent to the manifold being to just complete. The proof of this statement, I have no time, because it's not difficult. It's not difficult, it is clever, but it's not difficult. But it's not difficult, and this idea originally by Gregorian, who was the first to realize that, as far as I know, that this property is related to uniqueness of parabolic or solution to certain parabolic equation, linear parabolic equation, and non-existent in this case of solution to certain elliptic equation. Just to avoid confusion, this is the John, this is the Laplacian with the usual sign, okay, not the Laplacian, the geometers in Laplacian, okay, so the one, our one, okay. So this is really the wrong sign, it says. Well, in fact, I have required that the initial data is positive. Well, for this result, this makes no, this is absolutely normal. But for what I'm going to say later in the non-linear setting, instead, it will have It instead will have a crucial role, and so I prefer to write this down even in this case. Well, let me, before passing to the next slide, let me point out which was our original motivation. In fact, our original problem was the following one. Well, I mentioned in a few moments the fast diffusion equation. Maybe this is familiar to many of you. This is familiar to many of you. The fast division equation is a non-linear evolution equation. And since some year, we started studying equation of this type, non-linear diffusion of this kind on many poles. And we were trying to show uniqueness of solution to such equation. And we couldn't. And we couldn't, it was really a mess. We weren't able to get out of that. We weren't able to get out of that. And after several attempts, we finally realized this has something to do with the properties of the manifolds. It's not always true. And after a while, we realized that the geometric property, the analytic geometric property, one has to look at is stochastic completely. So our motivation was in non-linear diffusion. And after just a while, we realized this connected with this linear process. With this linear property, I have mentioned so far. So let's pass to non-linear equation. Okay, I gave a name this strange C, is the set of functions phi from the positive half line to itself, and phi is assumed to be concave, increasing, starting from zero, and smooth to this extent, okay, continuous everywhere and different. And differentiable possibly outside of zero. Okay. And the kind of non-linear diffusion we will consider is the following one. So we consider something which is similar to the field equation, but in which instead of u you have a function of u. And typically this function of u, the model example, is u to the m. It's u to the m, but the concavity requires m small. requires m smaller than one. Okay, so to fix the idea, think of u t equal to the Laplacian of U to the M with M smaller than one, positive and smaller than one. Well, showing that this kind of equation for a boundary initial datum, even more the boundary, but for example, with a boundary initial datum as a bounded non-negative minimal solution is not ethical, okay, because of Okay, because of several technical novel results. The real problem is uniqueness. The other kind of equation I will mention will be elliptic. And the equation is like this. You have the Raplacian of an unknown function of w, and you require it to be equal to five to the minus one of w. Okay, so clearly in the linear setting of Gregorian. linear setting of Gregorian phi was one was the identity so it was x t of x was x but here you have a power so here phi is u to the m as i said so this is the inverse so it is instead convex okay and these are the two kinds of nonlinear equations we will consider for the evolutionary setting the true problem is uniqueness for the literat setting For the liter setting, the true problem is at least the problem we will investigate will be existence instead of bounded solutions. Solution in which sense? In the weakest possible, namely in the distributional sense. You have only bounded things, so you don't know anything about regularity in principle. Then there is a little. Then there is a little parabolic regularity, of course, but in principle, we are taking just distributional solutions. So, let's go back for a moment to the Euclidean case to think a little bit about the fast diffusion, just a little bit to make some point about what is known in the about something of what is known in the Euclidean case. Well, you take phi of u exactly equal to u to the m and m is between. And m is between zero and one, as I said before. And surprisingly enough, but not so much beyond what I'm going to say, the initial datum can be taken to be locally integrable. It is not necessary that it is globally integrable. One is able to take data. Well, you need some local integrability to make sense of integral, of course, but you need nothing from a global. From a global point of view. And the existence, once again, I forgot to put the journal, the Reverend Pierre Paul Louise, I don't remember. It is Proceeding MS probably, or Indiana, I don't remember. Anyway, this is a very famous paper. And the crucial point in the Erevapierre paper is this Erevapier estimate, which bounces. Which bounds this integral over a ball of the difference of two solutions with something similar on a larger ball. Two R is just for fixing something, something larger ball, let's say, plus the terms which just not depend on the solution, depend just on the radius and on time. And this allows to say that what happens at time t in this ball, well, In this ball, well, depends only on what happened on the initial data on a ball which is a bit larger, but it is a ball, not the whole stuff. Also, uniqueness relies on these and uniqueness, which is technical, it is a difficult proof, delicate proof, also involves something which more or less is what follows. What follows? You take this u and u hat are two different solutions. You take this quantity here, it depends on x and depends on t x inside here, t is here. And well, this is shown in the academic quantity, something like this to be subharmonic. And after that, you use some mean value principle for this subharmonic function. Of course, I can't not enter into detail. I'm just mentioning this because for those Because for those familiar with these issues, well, using mean-value principle or manifold is a problem because typically you don't have them in the usual form, you have in different forms, but not in really in the Euclidean form one would expect. And so at least this kind of proofs, proof clearly cannot be shifted to the curve setting. And so you need something else. So, you need something else. In fact, you might also wonder: well, will it be true or not? And in fact, we will show that you this may fail in general. Well, existing instead is not a problem because of the random PR estimate, which is local, and you have no problem in proving it again in the manifold setting. So, you have existence for L1 local data, but you need to instead. Data, but UNIX instead, as well, this is technical, so forget about that. Um, but you have really a problem on manifolds that these techniques do not work, at least as far as we have been able to work about. Let me mention the main results. Let me start mentioning the main results we proved with Patrimira Mateo. It is a recent paper and we are still Recent paper, and we are still working on extending these results. So, the following assertions are equivalent: stochastic incompleteness, the fact that the non-linear evolutionary problem has at least two non-negative solutions which are bounded, and the fact that the semi-linear egg equation has a non-linear, a non-negative, non-trivial, and bounded distribution star solution. At least the crucial star solution. Okay, you see, take a maybe let me go back just a moment. So let me point to the equation for you to remember. So this was non-linear parabolic problem. This was the elliptic problem. And you see, in this elliptic problem, think to, for example, a manifold which is pheridically symmetric. So you can maybe try to find something radial and you should for this equation. and you shoot for this equation for solution for this equation and what can happen it can happen look at the solution exists but this solution typically you are you expect that this goes to plus infinity either at plus infinity as partial infinity or even at a finite distance from the origin okay and the key point in showing that there is a bounded solution to this equation to see whether there is a bounded solution to this equation There is just a bound solution to this equation. And let me go back to the theorem. In fact, the existence of the non-negotiable, non-trivial, back-bounded solution to this problem is equivalent to stochastic incompleteness. But as I said before, stochastic and incomplete manifolds exist. So there are manifolds in which uniqueness for the Cauchy problem, the evolutionary Cauchy problem does not hold. So there was no hope to prove uniqueness in general to our region. Uniqueness in general to our original problem. This was the point which let us stuck for so much time. And from the Lipti point of view, you have, in some cases, you do have in some cases existent or bounded solution to the Likti problem, which is counterintuitive, at least in my view, but it can happen. Well, this is the first note, this is the one sorry, I forgot I wrote this. The first note. I originally the first note just says that, in fact, there are many for I already say said it, these there are many for uniqueness fails for the pass diffusion equation, even for bounded solutions. And as concerned uniqueness, well, you can well, which is the, you can do more that when there is uniqueness for boundary solution, well, you can prove uniqueness by completely. Can prove uniqueness by completely different methods. This is a paper of my laboratory again and Pablo Punza from Viriano as well that just appeared. You can prove uniqueness even for, well, we have to require something more than an ingredient setting, locally L2. So you have uniqueness for a much larger class of data, in fact. But when there is a condition, there is a condition which essentially is not exactly stochastic completeness, but which something which is very close to it, okay, slightly strong. It okay, slightly stronger, but very strong, very close to it equivalently. Let me just for your convenience, well, you can also write a dual, it is essentially the same theorem, but you can write down a dual statement, namely that a manifold is stochastic complete if and only if the Cauchy problem has for the non-linear evolutionary problem as a unique non-levary solution for the mistake. On any strip, and the semi-linear lifted equation has no non-negative non-trivial boundaries solution. Okay, so you see it either way, but these are equivalent statements, of course. So it's a bit late, so I was too slow. I want then to stress something which is somehow written in what a list. Something which is somehow ridden in what I stated. In fact, well, in fact, there is something stronger than what I said. The following statements, let me go back, the following statements are equivalent, and each of them is equivalent to surpassing incompleteness. Well, it is sufficient that, for example, the evolutionary problem for some non-linearity and some time has at least two non-divided boundary solutions. one divided the boundary solution and then for all such functions you will have the same okay for all such functions and for all such data you have the same and this is clearly strong fact and similarly for the non-linear problem you it is enough you have the result for one function for one nonlinearity and you have the and you have it for all non-linearities okay and Well, Matthio, how long? How much time arrives? You have a couple of minutes. Okay, so let me skip this. Okay, this was something technical. The thing I'm skipping now is just for saying that with some tricks you could see that you expect the result could be even stranded. But standard in which sense? In the sense that maybe the assumption of phi. Maybe the assumption of phi can be relaxed. You maybe you remember that I the true assumption of phi is this was concave. Okay, it was concave and this is used aware. But the slides I skipped well was meant to say maybe you can do normal. And I have to say that, in fact, I have to mention my friends people at Liberian setting where they show something. Where they show something related. In fact, they show that in the case in which M is stochastically complete, then the elitic problem has no non-negative, non-trivial bounded solution, even when there is so one implication at least, is true without convexity. And this is results by these three guys, and this is not in several years. Okay, so let me try to say. To say at least two things and then close. The first thing is that there are conditions, I promised it to you, so I have to say, there are conditions which are in some sense explicit, saying one when a manifold is successful complete or no. This is completely null. Okay, so you know class of manifolds in which the results for the parabolic and non-linear and elliptical equation are true or are not true because you know condition on the Because you know, condition on for a manifold to be stochastically complete, you have two of them. Okay, here, for example, the manifold is stochastically incomplete, this is that of Gregorian, if a certain property of the green function holds, or this seems very strange, a bound of sectional curvature, and so on. But it means something very simple, in fact. It means, look at just at the final statement, it means that the curvature must become very Curvature must become very negative, must diverge to minus infinity very quickly, faster than quadratically. And in that case, the manifold is not stochastically complete. A dual statement, dual statements are as follows, where the second statement is, say, a complementary issue between the other, the previous one. You see here you add an But you see, here you had an integral which had to be smaller than infinity. Here you have the same integral, which has to be infinity. Okay? And this is a clear, so instances a clear characterization of the curvature condition. But this is very clear, for example, for the stochastically complete property, where the manifold is stochastically complete if the volume of balls grow not faster than e to the r square. That's the point. Okay? And if they grow faster. And if they grow faster than they are, in fact, there are another result of this type, and they just look across and incomplete. Forget about the proof. And last things I have to mention are extension. I am stopping a minute. Well, we have a recent ongoing work, qualitative is finished, in fact. We did it again with Pasuro Mateo and also with Fabi Punzo. The contemporary assumption of infection. The assumption of in fact can be weakened, and in fact it can be removed. Okay, it can be removed, the proof is much more difficult, in fact. And we can work, for example, with similar results with the porous medium equation as concerned nonlinear diffusion is concerned. So, M, the equation looks like the previous one, but M is larger than one. And the key feature, one of the key difference between the two diffusions is that here you have The two diffusions is that here you have finite speed of propagation. So, in some sense, you do not see infinity if you start immediately when at a finite time when you start from a compactly supported data and say uniqueness comes from insinity in some sense. But nonetheless, the result is true. And well, I can skip that. I just mentioned that our result is, in fact, When it can be, for example, done in the same way for weight at the Euclidean Laplacian, when weight can have singularities on the generic and so on. And the proof is exactly the same. There is no difference. And clearly, the problem about the literature, the parabolic equation, and the conservation of mass are non-trivial there, and the results also in the same way. So it is not related. Way. So it is not related to really to the Laplacian, just to the Laplacian, but you can take greater or later if you want. This is all I wanted to say. So thanks for your attention and again to the organizers for the beginning. Thanks a lot. So there is time for questions. Please just open the mic and talk. And then I will have a question for you, Gabrielle, which is, I was curious because you wrote the Erero PR estimate at the beginning and they were with the absolute value. As far as I know, they were only for ordered solution, as far as I remember. Did you have a new proof? Did you find a modification of it? Modification of it? No, no, but this is standard. This is something which is known that is written. Where is it? I don't part it anymore anymore. Well, I cannot enter. This one. Yeah, the last one. But this is nothing. Okay. It was just a curiosity. No, no, but this is true, but I should enter into the proof. Okay, but at least. Should enter into the proof, okay, but there is no real novelty here. Okay, it is something which can be done without any effort, but um, it is a technical issue, but there is no real novelty here. Okay, we can discuss it with the computational, but there is no real new stuff here, okay. Okay, and uh, just the last observation: does the extinction time since with The extinction time since with fast diffusion, you expect somehow that in some range, I mean, you say all the concavities, but you know that fast diffusion has several exponents and at some point you can distinguish what the distinction time plays a role in this thing. The distinction time, you see, it depends on the manifold in the sense as you remember, Mateo. For example, if you take the approbate space well. Well, extinctions in finite time for the fast diffusion holds for all data, that's the point. Okay, no, integrable data, but here we are taking down the data, so you don't know. You can take constants, okay? So it depends on the one hand on the data, because as far as I know, I have no hint about so take the constant, the constant as a solution which is the constant, okay? And so it does not extinguish. And so it does not extinguish because there is uniqueness. And so I see no easy way in distinguishing which are the data which lead to extinction independently of them, I mean. Which is the class of bounded data which corresponds to solution extinguish or not? I don't know. For example, in the hyperbolic space, all the one data extinguish, but I don't know whether one L you remember the crypto. You remember the critical M, okay, the right explorer, I mean, but I don't know which other, but this has no role, okay, in this as far as they do not extinguish this uniqueness, okay. And of course, in the extinction, you know, here the metaphor could be either Rn or Hn. We have made no distinction, the metaphor is general, and so the resulting Rn and the resulting HN are completely different. Completely different. So, but this is another story because we just are focused on the uniqueness of the equation or the solution for bounded data as far as if they are there. Okay, so yeah, no, no, you answered thank you. So, if there are not other questions, we can pass to the next talk. I'm sorry, we have delayed five minutes because we started a bit later. Sorry, so let's thank Gabrielle again.
