Yeah, good morning, everybody. Welcome back. It is my great pleasure to announce the first speaker this morning, Steve Guiter from Pacific University, and she's going to speak on whale poses of geometric flows of manifolds of formative current. Thank you. And you even pronounced my name correctly, which doesn't really happen here in the US. So it's a real pleasure to be here. It's a real pleasure to be here. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me, and thank you to all the speakers. It's been really, really fun. I will talk about a project that actually started at a meeting at BayOff here a few years ago. There was a result of Eric Bio and Eric Wogar that kicked it off. But I'm not going to tell you what it is. So, this is the cliffhanger to make you stay till the end of the talk. I'll get to it at the end. The end of the talk, I'll get to it at the end. I will talk about one posing us of various nonlinear pose on manifolds of bounded geometry. And in particular, we find a condition on this symbol that makes it quite easy to prove a condition that applies work close to so the background, the methods that we use are semi-group methods, and so just a few words on these. These were initiated by Kella, as far as I can tell, in 1948. Far as I can tell, in 1948. Adapted to nonlinear equations by the Prado, Grisbard, Lunardi, Senastrari, a bunch of mathematicians in the 1980s. As Sharon Simonette, I think, were the first to use it for curvature flows. They looked at the mean curvature flow in the late 90s. And then myself, Dan Kanock, and Jim Eisenberg looked at stability of the Ricci flow using these methods in early 2000. In early 2000. So the idea is you have PDEs of this form. DDT U of T is F of U of T, some function of U of T, be nonlinear, but you want to think of this as an ODE with values in a bottom space. So for example, the Ricci flow, which I'll talk about in more detail a little bit later, the evolution of the metric is the metric evolves by the Rigi. The you know, the metric evolves by the region verge, and so you think about at each time you have a metric in you know a space, some sort of a we'll be looking at literal holder spaces as metric compensates. So, if you have something of that form, you can linearize the right-hand side. So, linearization would be dt, say d of t is l v of t, so l is going to be my linear operator in this talk. This talk. So the L could be a, you know, a bounded linear operator. You want to think of a little glossy. In the case of the modified Ricci flow, the linearization of the Ricci flow, you know, before anybody gets mad, I will talk a little bit more about this. Is the, of course, the deterrent flow. If you linearize it at a fixed point, that's the same background effect. The linearization looks like the oxyplass. So lithium slaplacy is just. Like our Laplacian is just the regular Laplacian plus I'm not sure. Sorry, what is so Ricci minus Riemann? Oh, this is just very general. You can write out exactly what it is. There's just a Ricci term and a curvature term. Okay. So the functor space should be a Banach space. The function spaces here are all going to be Banach spaces, and the ones we're going to look at, we're going to be looking at little. Look at we're going to be looking at little holder spaces. So, this is the completion of smooth metrics in the holder number. So, they're going to be CK alpha holder spaces of symmetric two different. But you lose derivatives of those. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so when you set things up in that way, the idea of these semi-group methods is you study, you generate an analytic semi- Generate an analytic semi-group. So, an analytic semi-group, you know, this e to the tl where l is your operator, you can set it up. It's one over two pi i. This is a contour, and it's a contour that avoids the spectrum of the operator. You know, the t lambda. And this is, you want to think of, you know, one over lambda or so. This is the resolvent. So, we've seen this before in talks here. So, when you talk about analytics. So, when you talk about analytic semi-groups, you're not talking about a linear semi-group, right? I'm talking about something that has exactly that form. So, it is a linear semi-group. I mean, it's an analytic semi-group. Well, no, sorry, what's bothering me is semi-group can also be used to describe the non-linear flow, I think. No? Well, no, we're only going to look at the linearized linearized version here. So, we linearize at a fixed point, but we carry set this up. So, you can see that you need to be able to control the resolvent here, and you need a Resolvent here, and you need a spectrum that's going to have some form because you have to be able to integrate in a contour environment. So, the existence of an analytic semi-group is equivalent to a property called sectoriality. So, S is a box space here. I've got my linear operator from a bond space into itself. And I need two things here. So, an operator is sectorial if its spectrum is contained in a Its spectrum is contained in a sector, and this is a range in the bright complex half line. So, when we first started this, I was using the convention that you have a negative spectrum for the glossy. But now we started working with Rafe, and so we had to use the positive spectrum, which I mean, judging by everybody else's talks, that was the right way to go. So, what I did on this slide is I just flipped it over. So, I used to have it be for, so this is a, this is a lambda game. A this is a lambda, so this is in the resolva, and this is my omega upside down. So the spectrum is contained in this center in the right complex half-plane, and its resolvent operator is there. So the resolvent operator, this is the, so you need this inverse to exist. So your lambda here is in the resolvent. And you have to have the inverse, you know, the inverse satisfy this particular. The inverse satisfy this particular boundary. So, this bound has to look like a constant over lambda minus omega. And if you just look back at the definition of that analytic semi-group, you can see why that changed it. Okay, now I also have to say, of course, the spectrum, all of this depends on what particular bonox space you're working in. And so we are working in, we will be working in our applications these folder spaces. So the thing is, that particular resolvent bound is really hard to prove. And, you know, you can think, oh, that looks not like a shadow estimate, and it is, but it does, but you need this particular form. It needs to be a constant that's independent of random, particular, divided by randomness. Okay, and I think somebody else mentioned these resolvent bounds were hard to prove when you were looking at the OP version. What is Omega? What is omega? Omega, in my definition of sectoriality, omega is this point here. So you have to have the sector contained in a twedge here. That's not the origin. It doesn't have to be the origin. Okay, so we started looking at this and a preliminary result was the sectorial sectorial. The sectoriality of the narrowish laplasia on compact manifolds. So, this is something from a few years ago that Eric and Jim Eisenberg and I proved. So, you have a closed rebinding manifold, great alpha in zero to one, the Lithnarowitch Laplacian. These are the little holder spaces of symmetric two tensors. The Laplacian starts at C2 alpha, takes you to C0 alpha, and we show the Well, that and we showed that that thing said on compact manifest. But if the proof, so it was a constructive proof by contradiction. I guess constructive is probably it was a proof by contradiction, but we actually looked at that, tried to prove directly that sectorial estimate. So we, you know, assumed it failed and it had to fail at various lambdas and various functions, and then you can look at various points that, you know. Various points that you know something is bounded below, and these points you're on a compact manifold have to accumulate. And you take limits and then you derive a contradiction. So we proved this directly using the, you know, using the contradiction. So we had started to do the same thing on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. And then we started, this is now. Um, we, this is now joint with uh, Ray Pazilla. Did I not say that on my first slide? I did. Everything here is joint with Jim Eisenberg, um, Eric Bio, and Ray Misco. And we instead found an algebraic condition on the principal symbol of the operator that actually guaranteed sectoriality. So, this is much nicer because it's just an algebraic condition, it's easy to verify. And so that's what I'm going to talk about in this. And I should say this algebraic condition to investigate this on manifolds of boundary curvature, I think it's implicit in some of the work of Amon. It's, you know, 20 years ago. It's across several papers. It's really abstract. So this is, I think, in a form that's that's much formatible to geographic information. Minimal and geometric functions. So, I have the geometric setting, and then I have the kind of operators that we're going to be talking about. So, I'll just talk about those two things separately. We're always going to be dealing with manifolds of bounded geometry. So, these have come up at the workshop before. You have bounded geometry if there's a lower bound on the injectivity radius. And it's bounded at order L if basically the derivative. Um, if basically the derivatives of the curvature are bounded up to order L. Now, we're gonna, this is just a tiny technical point, if anybody cares, we're gonna need to abound of order L plus alpha to stack with a slightly different. That's great, but the alpha prime is between zero and one here. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's, you need, you just need there to exist an alpha prime for campus. We are going to assume that we have bounded geometry of where L plus alpha prime and our dissolved little state. But again, you're just going to assume you don't care how small alpha prime is. We don't. As long as it's bigger than zero. We actually will care how the operator interacts, the smoothness of the operator interacts with this work. So I won't say that. But this is the way to think about manifolds. So there's lots of manifolds of bounded geometry. There's isymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, you know, asymptotically Euclidean, you're asymptotically complex. So we go through this a little bit in our So we go through this a little bit in our paper. I should also say this is based on a couple of papers that are now on the posted the next couple months. Homogeneous bases with invariant metrics, compact Riemannian manifolds. Of course, there's lots of manifolds that don't have bounded geometry. If you have too much, you know, your curvatures will injectivity radius bound. What's that? I mean, sometimes that's not needed, yeah? So you allow injectivity radius to go to zero at a time? No, we don't. We don't. We have a uniform. We need this uniform size of a ball. Yeah. Oh, I see. So you're saying sometimes boundary geometry does not have to be. Yeah, so no, we, yeah, we record that. Okay, so that's sort of the geometric setting. And now we have the analytic setting. So the kinds of operators that we are dealing with. So we're going to call an operator administrator. To call an operator admissible of order m. Now, this is respect to a black space, you know, because the spectrum depends on the block space. If the pullback of the operator, you know, so the operator normal coordinates has bounded coefficients again uniformly. So you have to have some R0 such that these coefficients are bounded. And then this is the new criterion. There's some sort of a There's some sort of a wedge again in the right half plug, such that if you're in the complement of that, so if you're in the resolvent, you have this condition on the symbol. So here the sigma sub m is the principal symbol of your operating derivative. So I need this to exist, this inverse to exist, but in addition, I need it to satisfy this D. To satisfy the sticky. So this implies it's strongly omeptic in particular. Sigma sub m is the m. Oh, this is the admissible of order m, but you don't really need that. It's just the principal symbol of the problem here. The sub m was the principal piece of m. So you just have to say anything, isn't it? Yes. So if that's the order of the operator, then you need this particular decay. So that's what's new. So that's what's new about this. So you can see that this is just an algebraic condition. So what we're going to show, so let me first tell you, so some examples of these things. So you want to think of Laplace type of automatic. So the regular Laplacian, the scalar Laplacian, the Lagnarowich Laplacian that I was talking about on two tensors, which is the linearization of the reach of turbulence. Of the reach of turbulence or the Laplace here. You can also handle higher order Laplace operators here. So, one nice, one advantage of this is that we will be able to show well-posedness of higher-order flows that have this form. So, for example, here we'll see this again when we look at the problem. Oh, yeah, this is going to have to be even and. Oh no, this is going to have to be even and yes, so there's going to be others. So I'm really looking at, I'm thinking of this as the yeah, we are assuming there has been something example if the tensors are not two tensors, can you or six but three others? So outside of the two tensors, can you resist the same? The same by ordered concepts. Yeah, I mean, this could be, you could be defined on just some kind of other teacher model. So this is just the covariant derivative, it's a JIE. You can iterate it on a part of the. So, yeah. So somehow it looks like examples two and three are special cases of example four. Is that enough? Examples two and three are special cases of what? Of example four. Oh, yeah. So this is very general. So, here is our main result, which is if you have an admissible operator on a manifold bounded curvature in the sense that I define, then you have sectorality. So, let me just read it carefully. If you have a complete Riemannian manifold around a geometry of order L plus alpha prime, and you have this option. And you have this operator. So, this is a linear operator, but if you have a nonlinear flow, if the linearized operator satisfies this, you have one place of this. So, we're looking at these CK plus alpha bond spaces again. You know, this is just contained here. I just wanted to make the domain here explicit because it's an MQ operator. If this is an admissible elliptic operator of order M, and then you And then you need this. So m plus alpha is less than l plus alpha pi. So that's not really a restriction. I mean, a lot of our operators here have curvatures in them. So of course you need those curvatures to be defined up to be working. So that's okay. On this product space, then we have L said to work. So for example, if L is L account. If L is the Lithium Austrian and E is the bundle of some objective space. And I will state the well-posedness that follows from this in a second. I'm going to have a very brief slide here on the proof. This proof, just so you get some idea. We first divide the operator by absolute value of lambda. So you pick a lambda first. Divide by absolute value of lambda. absolute value of lambda and you define this epsilon to be the absolute value to the negative one over m and so you look at this semi-classical operator so you need this for sufficiently large so that resolvent bound is hard for large epsilon value values which is which is corresponding here to small epsilons and so we define this class semi-classical operator and show this thing as invertible if epsilon is sufficiently small Vertical, if epsilon is sufficiently small, so this can be a perfect result. Using methods of geometric microlocal analysis to construct the parametrics, which is sort of a proximate works. And then you have to establish uniformity in the epsilons. And for that, we made an argument by contradiction. You have to do some law arguments. And you have to move, so there's this interaction between the semi-classical holder spaces. Between the semi-classical holder spaces and the regular holder spaces, and so I think it um works any other these semi-classical holder spaces. You can see they're just on the regular ones where you have these longer lines too. So you do need to so that this was quite involved. And in the paper we try to actually give quite a detailed introduction to these methods. Introduction to these methods where we can see how they work. I wanted to say these admissibility properties on manifolds of boundary geometry are preserved under limits, so that was another issue. But finally, so do you get short-time existence of Ricci flow by this immediately? Yes, here, I just wanted this later. Yes. So it is. See, that's the thing about it. You get these very quick proofs of these things. So, first of all, So first of all, when I, okay, so you get it of the turf, yellow. So yeah, we did have an elliptic operator here, right? The point of the sectoriality is so that the semi-group methods kick in, so then you get welclosedness. And so here's the well-closedness result, just to state it explicitly, we have a completely my manifold boundary geometry, and my capital F now is my smooth operator. Now this could be a non-linear operator. Be a this could be a non-clear operator, and what we require here is that it's linearization. So here was just some, you need the linearization to be missable. If that's the case, then you automatically have short time existence, a uniqueness. So there's some capital T, so this is a short time, so this is small, such that this, so this is the state. So this is the statement of just the regular general equation with initial values in that u has a unique solution for t and zero. And then you have continuous dependence. So I'm going to state this. This is sort of a long time continuous dependence result that I'm going to need for that application later. So you have So you have, there's a little R and a capital C here such that if you start, so this is my U, if I take a U1 that's close enough to U0, then for any tau less than this capital T, U1 of T exists. By U1 of T, I mean the flow that starts at u sub 1. So u1 of t U sub 1. So u1 of t exists at least until time tau and it stays close to the flow that started at u sub 0. Yeah. So somehow I would expect and hope that you could get actually differentiable dependence on initial conditions out of this kind of method. So differentiable, so what do you mean by that? There's a flow at time one. Would the flowback time one would depend on differentiable way on the initial condition? In some, you know, one of the notions of differentiable need modic spaces. Yeah. Yeah. Although we haven't, I would expect that too. Is given T that's not necessarily the same as one because in for one, just if there is a short T, it could be okay or a small. Very small. This could still be small as well. It's just that challenge. It could be large, yeah. So T could be the maximal time. Yes. Yeah. In fact, we will take it to the maximal time here. It could be soon to do this long-term stability as well. I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the capital F. So for Ricci flow, the UT would be a GT. So for Ricci flow, okay, so this is a little bit misleading because. Is a little bit misleading because for this particular flow, so the connection to Ricci flow, you want to think of this as the Ricci determined flow. Because I do need the spaces, I mean, I would, the UTs would be GTs, I guess. Oh, yes, the solutions are G U T's, yeah. But I mean, so the G T's would be in C M plus K alpha M G. Yeah, I mean, the way you usually state this is just you take this thing into account. Because it's just you take this thing into itself and then you just look at its domain of definition. I mean, u is just the domain of definition of it. So I just put that m in there explicitly just because this is true for an nth order operator. But if you're for the Region flow, you would take that to be two, or you could take K to be zero and M to be two. So I just want to see how this applies in a couple of years. To see how this applies in a couple of specific flows, so I'll talk about the Ricci flow next. But I just wanted to mention this ambient obstruction flow because it's a higher order flow and proving its existence on these non-compact manifolds is not easy. So, this particular, there's this ambient obstruction tensure that was introduced by Charles Beckerman and Marvin Graham. We've seen that before too. It's a snice tension. It's a snice tank, it's formally covariant, divergence-free, tris-free, it's a Q-tensor. And it involves n minus 2 derivatives of the Rig tensor. So n derivatives of the metric vanishes for x and n minus 0. So this is a very nice flow. It's a mess to write down. So I'm going to write it down for n equals 4. So in n equals 4, it appears as a multiple of the gradient of the while energy. Wild energy. So that's a wild tensor. And so you can associate a flow with this tensor. So V here is this Bach tensor, which is this guy here, the multiple of A, the Bow tensor. And you can set up a flow. So there are several people in the audience here who have done nice work on this flow. Work on this flow. There's a couple of different ways that this flow is degenerate at the usual different ways of formal covariance. And so, one way to handle this, one of the degeneracies is to add on this term. You also add on it a turp type of term in order to get short term existence. But it's a nice flow. You have this, so B sub A sub J is the bot tensor. It involves this thing called the Schaupin tensor. It's the Rich G one is the. Tensor, it's 3G minus the multiple of the scalar and n equals 4. W is the bile tensor. This Bach tensor, I think, was discovered by Bach in 1921, as far as I could tell. So it's actually named correctly, unusually. The flow, I think, was first considered by physicist Facus Borlio most of Petropolis in 2009, so fairly recent. Eric Bio and Eric Bino and Dylan Heliwell proved a short-term existence of this version of the flow on compact manifolds. So you add this to term term and then make sure that you can get a solution within the dual version as well. Ho and Aaron Griffin looked at solitons of the flow. Chandler and King looked at, they just introduced a new flow that's like this. It's called the conformal bot flow, which is very nice. Nice. But it's a higher order flow. So our methods work to show well posiness of this flow on manifolds of bounded geometry. So if you have a complete manifold with even dimension, bounded geometry border two n, you start with a smooth metric, then there exists some time and a family of unique methods. So this is that there was a short time existence and uniqueness. Existence in uniqueness. And if you only unique metrics solving this ambient, so at least it works for the full higher dimensional ambient structure flow as well with initial condition G1. So if you look at the flow, if you just look at what the differential operator is, it's pretty much the Laplacian to the nth power. So if you look at the symbol of that, it's just the absolute. Symbol of that is just the absolute value of x to the nth power, and that satisfies that admissibility. Okay, now I want to talk a little bit about the Ricci flow. So, I want to be just a little bit more careful about this. So, the Ricci flow is this evolution equation, it's not parabolic. It's not parabolic due to the diffeomorphism invariance of the Richie tensor. And so, what you do is you convert it to an associated parabolic flow. And you do that, or one way to do that is to define, so this was this method of Duterk fairly shortly after the ReT flow was first studied by Hamilton. You can define an explicit vector field here. You can see it depends on the, so these are the It depends on the so these are the Christoffel symbols of the evolving metric and the Christopher symbols of this background metric. So to define the deterrent flow, you pick a background and you define this metric and put this vector field in terms of that and the Ricci deterred flow with this reference metric looks like the Ricci flow. So up to you can you can get from one solution to the other by a whole bath by eucomorphisms just as Zones just is just the reaching flow possibility. In the direction of this thing. Always true. I mean, contact manifolds, I know, but non-compact, you can always. So these different morphisms may exist on shorter short of time. Okay, so okay, so that's a problem. So we're going to see that when we look at long-term continuous dependence of the region. But you can define this anyway. So his question is: do you know that? So, his question is: Do you know that this exists? I mean, what is the connection between the time of existence of the Turk flow and the time of existence of the Ricci flow? And if you look at how to show that on compact manifolds, you have the existence of the state. Don't necessarily appear at the clear thing, et cetera. But when I said that the linearization of the Ricci-Turk flow was narrow to the Pausian, what I meant was if you picked the background metric, The background metric or the reference metric to be the metric at which you're linearizing, then the linearization is the linear achievements. Okay, so we, and I'll say how this proof works in a minute, but we were able to prove the following theorem about the Ricci flow then using the using those. Using those methods. If you have a clean metric of boundary geometry, you're next to me to find who you flow. So there's your next one you define. For any tau less than t, there exists some r such that if you start close enough, if g1 minus g0 is close enough, that was always in these little folder spaces, then the solution of the Ricci flow starting at G1 exists for at least time tau. So this could be a long-tended implication for the results. And stay sufficiently close. Okay, so it's not immediately clear how this follows from the well-posed in this result. So let me just tell you the steps of this proof. You have the well-posed in this result for the Ricci deterc flow. So as long as the Ricci deterk flow exists, you can show. Exists, you can show continuous dependence of the reach. So, one thing I wanted to point out just for that second step is this loss of regularity thing, and then I'll talk about the third step, which is you do lose regularity. So because that vector field has a Christophel symbol, and then you're taking the derivative of that, you lose two degrees of regularity when you go from the Ricci flow to the deterrent flow. And here we've stated this as not losing regularity. We stated this as not losing regularity. So, we had an initial result that 2019 before that we had a loss of regularity. But what you can do is you can use actually a result. This is in the Hamilton Free Chi flow. Where if you look at the difference between two deterrent flows, it satisfies this linear homogeneous parabolic differential equation. They write out all of the terms. Differential equation, they write out all of the terms. And so, because of that, what you can do is you can kind of bump it up. So, if you start at the Ricci flow, and then you look at an associated deterk flow, the difference, we're just looking at the difference of these two metrics. So somehow we can bump up the regularity on that difference and pull that back down to the difference of the two reaching flow solutions. So, we don't lose regularity, which is kind of nice. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because if you think Richard and Jeff would have worried about regularity, so you have shield type estimates and then you have a lot of regularity within it as well. So I was wondering if like scripting, if let's say the initial metrics are CK plus, you have for estimating higher but it works called CK plus the other. That's time one. So so you you want to start higher? Want to start higher? No, I'll say just the tangent of the top floor. Yeah. Let's say after turn one question is the difference, kind of the difference of the two floors estimated the CK plus L? Yeah, I mean, so that's why I think your question is what I'm saying, which is if you start off, yeah, the difference is in the CK alphanum, but you look at the flow. But you look at the flow, so here's the Richie flow. You start at D0, and you look at an associated deterrent flow. I want to show that if I started it near my bimetric here, I'm going to stay close to the mutual. So, what you do is you Is you from that nearby metric, you look at the deturk flow, and then you say, as long as this exists, I can pull this back to show the existence of a reticulum. And this difference is where I, and when I pull it back, normally I would lose two degrees of regularity, but I don't if I use this this paraholic regularity on the difference. Yeah. But it could be a taken up chart. But it could be a taken up or highlighted with areas that you need to. Just keep kicking it up, yeah. So you don't even lose, you gain regularity also. Hopefully you gain regularity, but you start at CK alpha. And you go to CK alpha. So you could, oh, I see in the popped territorial. Yeah, I suppose you could. So this is the Ricci flow contingent on the deterrent flow situation. Deterrent flow situation. But you don't necessarily have to have the deterrent flow. So in this setting, it's different than when you prove short-time existence of the Ricci flow. You show existence of the deterrent flow and then you pull it out. In this continuous dependent situation, we're starting with the Ricci flow. So I want to know that the Ricci flow exists, and then I want to know that there is some That there is some ball here around the initial metric such that G sub 1 stays close. But I don't know that the deterrent flow even exists along with simple 1 over G. Does that make sense? And so what helps us out here is there was a result of Bamler and Kleiner saying, so this is one reason if the Ricci flow exists till time t, it could be infinite. We pick a tau, a fixed tau that's less than that. A fixed tau was less than that. It could be any fixed tau. And they showed that there is a uniform interval of existence of the associated determination, depending just on the curvature spot. So what you do, if you want that step three here, is you first split this up into time intervals of length so that the associated deterrent flow exists. And then So, this is getting into the week a little bit, but maybe I'll just say one more word here. So, you look at the deterked flow starting here. You look at the deterked flow starting at a nearby metric. And to determine flow starting here, you have to actually choose the background metric. You have to actually choose the background metric to be G sub zero. So, because you want this linearization to be the lithium orange velocity. If you don't choose the right background, then you get the much more complicated linearization. So, you use that deterrent flow, pull back to here, so you start generating this associated. But then right here, you reset. So, here I reset and I pick a different. I think a different deterrent flow. And this new deterrent flow, this new deterrent flow has this as its background metric, and I'm really writing about this metric. And then I just keep piecing it along. And the panel or climber result is such that the new detriment flow exists for at least one. That's exactly right. So we chose exactly these time intervals so that it would, and now there's a little bit. That it would, and now there's a little bit of, you know, you have to be sure that this is sufficiently small so that these guys are sufficiently small to be in the right, well-posing this neighborhood. And then you keep, you know, so you can, you can, at each step, you can kind of shrink the neighborhood if necessary, so that you're in the correct, you know, so that you get correct as close as you need to. And just quick. Just quick. I really want to get to this. So, one consequence of this is this idea of convergent stability. So, the idea is if you have a metric that you know converges, so let's say it converges to a flat fixed point, then even if so, the flat fixed point, and I want two things. I want the fixed point to be stable, and I want this long time to be. And I want this long-time continuous dependence. If you put those two things together, if I have a metric that converges to a fixed point, you can see that if I have a nearby metric, as long as I can keep these things close for as long as I want to, then I end up in the stability neighborhood and then I get sucked in to a fixed point. So, in this, what I drew here, this is a center animal fixed spectrum. So, you might not converge exactly to the fixed point. You know, the hyperbolic case, but in the You know the hypermodel case, but in the flat case, maybe convert to degrees. But the idea is you can start then way outside of the stability neighborhood and get convergence to a state to a fixed point. Okay, so here's the application of the application. So the genesis of this was at this BAMP conference, Eric Bio and Eric Wolgar had this very nice result. Had this very nice result where they find a class of rotationally symmetric, asymptotically hyperbolic metrics that converge to a hyperbolic multiple. And there's a little bit, there's a curvature condition and sort of a mild curvature condition on the curvature of the tangential orbits of this flow. And just because I'm a little bit short on time, it's that the asymptotically hyperbolic methods we've seen here before, you just think of conformal. You just think of conformal effect, you've got a negative curvature. There's some details. But they showed convergence of this particular metric. And so at this BAM conference, somebody said, well, can you relax the symmetry assumptions and still show convergence? So our result says, in fact, you can. So the beauty of this is that Of this is that you can assume to get this original one to converge, you know, you can assume symmetries. I mean, it's that greatly simplifies your equations, but then you can relax the symmetries. So they found this class of metrics that converges. And so our result says that you have stability of the whole level. So you can start near these. You can start near these metrics. Your nearby metric does not need to be rotationally symmetric. It does not have to have those initial curvatures. It just needs to be close by in the CK alphabet, well, in a slightly different bonus space. So here's the result. So they looked at their on a ball, and you have a hypolic metric. So say you have a complete vocationally symmetric metric that converges to TH as given in. Is kind of th as given in VW, so I wanted to call these BW metrics or B squared metrics, whatever you want. So, one of their convergent metrics. Their exists are such that if you have an asymptotically hyperbolic metric that starts nearby and it's nearby in a weighted holder space, so I won't get into that, but you do have to have this weight, and you have to be sure that these guys, so you have to have a weighted holder space, which I have. Which I have on a previous slide, I think, to get the page away. And again, this is not a perturbative result since you can choose an initial metric that lies outside of the stability speech. I shouldn't have skipped that slide because I should say this works because they have this convergent metric. And also, so you have this asymptotically hyperbolic metric, your point-grade. Hyperbolic metric, your point Einstein, if their Ricci curvature looks like negative and minus 1g, so it's a fixed point of this flow. So when I talk about the Ricci flow in the setting, I'm talking about this Ricci flow. So the hyperbolic metric is a fixed point of the flow. And it is well known that G sub H is a fixed point of this flow in these weighted holder spaces, which we're going to go into. We can actually show this. We can actually show this again with our methods, but this is well known. Banya has a nice as well. And so that answers this question. So you have convergent stability around this. And so yes, you can relax those initial symmetries. Okay, thank you.
