So, today I'm going to present an extreme limit with non-negative scalar curvature. This is joint work with Wen Chuan Tian from University of California, Santa Barbara, and Changliang Wang from Tongji University. I apologize for mispronouncing. So, if you're given a sequence of manifolds with scalar greater than or equal to zero, at what kinds of limit spaces M infinity might we see? M infinity might we see, and what notions of convergence might we consider? What properties of non-negative scalar curvature persist on the limit space? What additional hypotheses might be added about Mj to provide stronger controls on the limit space M infinity? What additional hypotheses might be added about Mj to guarantee that there is a sub-sequence MJK that converges to some M infinity? And I'll review examples of sequences, notions of convergence. Of sequences, notions of convergence, and then present an example with an extreme limit published jointly with Wen Chuan Tian and Chang Liang Wang recently. Classical constructions of manifolds with scalar non-negative are the spheres, they have scalar equal to six, and cylinders that have scalar curvature equal to two. Riemannian Schwarzschild manifolds have scalar equal to zero. If you take a Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold, which you can draw like this, embedded into Euclidean space of dimension four, you see that there is this neck-like. You see that there is this neck-like region, and you can use that as sort of a transition to get an intuitive understanding of the creation of wells. So you take a sphere, you remove a ball, you take a piece of the Schwarzschild space up to the neck point, then you add one of the cylinders and then you cap it off. This isn't a smooth manifold, but it gives you an idea, and you can run Richie Flow for a second if you wish to make a positive scalar curvature manifold in this way. You can make a number of different wells. You can make a number of different wells in this way. If we cut a bowl out of a sphere and attach a Schwarzschild neck and then cap cylinder and smooth it, we get M3 with a well that has scale greater than zero. And adding many wells gives Ilmanen's example. So Ilmanen's example is to increase the number of wells as they get smaller and smaller. The total volume will be kept converging to the volume of a sphere. And Ilmanen's sequence does not converge CK smoothly, nor C0, nor does it have a Gromoff-Hausdorff limit. zero, nor does it have a Gromov-Hausdorff limit because there are too many balls. The number of balls of radius half the depth of the well is increasing to infinity. This example inspired Stefan Wenger and I to define the intrinsic flat convergence and to show Ilmanen's example here, in fact, converges in the intrinsic flat sense to the standard round sphere. In fact, Ilmanen suggested that someone should define a notion of convergence which makes this converge to a standard sphere. Building upon Federer and Fleming and Ambrosier-Kierheim, the way we define the intrinsic flat distance is you take a pair of oriented Riemannian manifolds of the same dimension, so they're both dimension m, and then we're going to take an infimum here. And the infimum, first let's describe what we're taking an infimum of. We're going to take it over all complete metric spaces Z. So here's a picture of a metric space Z. And we're going to take M1 and M2, and we're going to take And M2, and we're going to take a distance-preserving map phi1 and distance-preserving map Phi2 into this complete metric space Z. So, what we've done here is we've made copies of M1 and M2 lying inside Z. This notation here, phi1 pound M1 and phi2 pound M2, this is the notation from geometric measure theory to describe the images. The important point in geometric measure theory is what we're concerned with about these images. With about these images is how they integrate differential forms. So we're looking at these as integral currents. The infimum is taken over all the complete metric spaces Z and every distance preserving map from Mi to Z. And here, the flat distance between them is the Federer-Fleming flat distance, which is the infimum of the geometric measure theory notion of mass of A plus the geometric measure theory notion of mass of B. This has nothing to do with ADM mass. So this is the like an area and a volume. This is the like an area and a volume in this picture. So it's sort of weighted, though. There's extra information involved. And the idea is that A plus boundary B is this difference between the two images. So the orientation matters here. So the idea is that the B is one dimension higher, and you're interested in its volume. And it fills in the space between M1 and M2, but there might be some extra parts, and that will be incorporated in the A that has the same dimension as the manifolds. Same dimension as the manifolds. So A can include the boundary of B that isn't part of the M1 and the M2, and it can also include extra little pieces of M1 and M2 that stick out, like for example, one of these wells. So if a well has small volume, then it won't contribute to the distance between these two. This is an infemum over areas and volume. So the screen piece having small volume will make it contribute very little. And otherwise, in general, you want to make sure that the sort of General, you want to make sure that the sort of a filling volume between the two spaces is kept small, and that's what you're taking the infimum over. This is defined for rectifiable MJs called integral current spaces and include the zero space, empty set with the distance zero on it, using Ambrosio-Kirheim theory. So if you make, if you want to study the case with the zero space, consider the zero space as your M2 here, then the empty set trivially embeds into a Z. So what we're looking for is just copies of M1. We're looking for is just copies of m1 inside a z, and our b is really just a way of filling in m1. So that's generally a notion called filling a Riemannian manifold from Gromov's filling Riemannian manifolds. If the MJs are compact, the swift distance between two of them equals zero implies that M1 is isometric to M2, and in fact, they have an orientation preserving isometry between them. So this is an actual distance, it's not just the notion of convergence. Of convergence. And everything is made rigorous using Ambrosio-Kierheim theory because they are able to define currents that act on tuples instead of differential forms. All right, so key idea to keep in mind is the intrinsic flat distance is measuring a sort of volume between the two spaces as long as you've made distance preserving maps into a common space together. Why might one want to use this intrinsic flat convergence? The first reason is that. convergence. The first reason is that limit spaces m infinity obtained under Swift convergence are rectifiable metric spaces called integral Karn spaces. This means there's a countable atlas of bilips charts covering all but a set of measure zero. If you take a Gromoff-Hausdorff limit, you don't know it's rectifiable unless you have extra hypotheses on your sequence of manifolds. But for intrinsic flat convergence, we immediately get rectifiability. We also get boundaries, and the boundaries are also rectifiable. Wenger's compactness theorem, which he proved by Compactness theorem, which he proved by in a paper around the same time as when we presented our joint paper, Wenger's compactness theorem has almost no hypotheses at all. He just requires that the volume of the mjs is less than or equal to v, diameter of mj's less than or equal to d, and already you have a subsequence converging to some m infinity. This m infinity might be the zero space, but there are many occasions where it's not. Wells and tunnels disappear under swift convergence. That's one of the reasons we defined it. That's one of the reasons we defined it. So, pictures like this that I had at the beginning do, in fact, with converged. So, it's not just even just this illmin and examples of many, many wells, but also if you have thin, long tunnels, they are also going to disappear. Then, in joint work with Laxian, we proved that if you have smooth convergence away from some bad sets, and the bad sets have increasingly small volume, and you have control on distances between points outside of those bad sets. Between points outside of those bad sets, so you don't have to control anything on the bad sets, but you do need distances between points on the good sets, then you get intrinsic flat convergence. If also you have volume preserving, volume mj converges to volume m infinity, that's an additional hypothesis combined with swift convergence, then the ADM mass and the eigenvalue semi-converge. So this is the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The ADM mass. This is by work of Portuguese and by Jorugué Lee. By work of Portuguese and by Jorugué Lee. You actually have many other properties. Once you add in swift convergence plus volume convergence together called volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence, you end up with this nice controls on many aspects of the manifolds. And then in 2014, Gromov suggested: can we find a compactness theorem for MJs with scalar gradient zero? That implies that swift convergence with generalized scalar gradient to zero. So the difference here is he already knows. So, the difference here is he already knows about Wenger's compactness theorem, of course. So, the idea is he wants to add the scalar and non-negative hypothesis and conclude some sort of scalar and non-negative limit. But he wants to find a compactness theorem. He hasn't stated one. He hasn't stated a conjecture. He says the approach in 2014 was to find a good statement. So, examples of MJ was scalar curvature grading to zero and Shane-Yao tunnels. So, Shane and Yao made tunnels between And Yao made tunnels between manifolds with nine egg scalar curvature in dimension three, and the Gromov-Lawson did higher dimensions as well. By gluing Schwarzschild and a cylinder between a pair of spheres, we can make tunnels arbitrarily long, thin, or arbitrarily small. So again, this isn't exactly the construction, but I like this as a good intuitive explanation. You can take a Schwarzschild neck, but you can make an arbitrary length cylinder here, and then you can smooth it out. But the actual proof is done in more rigorous detail. This is the intuition. You can also make these very You can also make these very, very tiny, these next. So you can build MJ3 with no CK or Gromov-Hausdorff limit in the way that I described already, that do converge in the volume-preserving intrinsic flat sense. So they actually have volumes converging as well. So let's talk about sequences with many tunnels and pull string spaces. In 2017, we had this idea of sewing along a curve. So you take a curve inside a sphere and you add tunnels in. And what you do is you In. And what you do is you space your balls in a sewing type pattern, far, close, far, close, and so on. And then you attach the consecutive tunnels along so that you make a short path between points. And then the Gromoff-Hausriff limit and intrinsic flat limit and volume preserving intrinsic flat limit and uniform distance limit, all of them are this sphere here with a pulled string. So we end up with this pulled string space, S3, with eta identified to a single point, P. So this is. Single point P. So this is what's called a pulled string space. Or it's a little bit similar to drawstring, but I think the point of drawstring in the talk earlier this week was that they don't necessarily identify eta completely to a point, but allow it to just have a shorter length. And ours, we make it all the way to a single point. Okay, so we pull it completely. Basilio and Casaras and I in 2018 took a sphere and we were able to. And we were able to create these tunnels. We made an increasingly dense collection of balls, and we connected every ball to every other ball by a shuttle express tunnel. But we made the tunnel not short like we do in this one, but rather the tunnel, the distance between the tunnel's length is the distance between the balls in Euclidean space. So by doing this, we end up with the limit spaces S3 with the Euclidean distance on it. That has no geometric. Distance on it. That has no geodesics. So, there, it's possible that intrinsic flat distance has no geodesics at all because there are no midpoints between points in the Euclidean distance rather than the arc length distance here. All right. And then in joint work with Basilio, we produced M infinities in a process similar to this with many, many balls, but we made the tunnel short with surfaces and regions pulled to a single point. So we can set up increasingly dense balls. So, we can set up increasingly dense balls in entire regions and pull them to a single point. So, not just a pulled string. So, these seem to be rather disastrous. And then, Sweeney, and just this year, who's defending his dissertation with Marcus Curry this spring, did tunnel examples where the scalar J is arbitrarily close to one. So basically, he just makes sure that he can take a scalar curvature of these tunnels to be exactly close to one if it's spheres. If these are tunnels between hyperbolic spaces, he can make them arbitrarily close to negative one. He can make them arbitrarily close to negative one and so on. So he actually is able to make the scalar curvature close to the desired scalar curvature. So ours, we just had non-negative scalar curvature, and he's made the tunnels where the scalar curvature is arbitrarily close to the given value that you wish. So it's a beautiful new paper. All right, how badly can the swift limits behave? Well, Bamler and Gromoff proved that if you have C0 convergence, this has already been mentioned at the conference, and M infinity is a smooth manifold, then scalar mj grading to zero. Manifold, then scalar mj greater than equal to zero implies scalar m infinity is greater than or equal to zero. So, what if you only had swift convergence instead of c0? Is the scalar m infinity greater than zero? If we assume that m infinity is smooth, and well, this is open, but there's an example that I discussed with Dmitri Kazarasa a long time ago, but he wasn't interested in doing it. So, if anyone wants to try to implement this, this is the plan: take any smoothie money in Mexico. Plan, take any smooth Riemannian metric g less than or equal to g of a sphere, the standard g of a sphere, on s3, show that mj swift converges to s3 with this distance of this arbitrary smooth Riemannian metric that has nothing to do with scalar curvature bounds on it, where the mjs have tunnels, the same construction as before, but instead of making it the Euclidean distance, make it the distance, the Romanian distance for this D, for this G. So I believe that this can be done, and this is the picture. Can be done, and this is the picture of it. But remember that all these examples I'm showing you take a lot of work to prove. So, if someone wants to prove this, this will take a lot of effort. Okay, so it's not instant, but I do believe this could be done. And then in that case, so what I'm saying is that I don't believe the answer to this question is yes. I think the answer will be no. And this is the example that I expect could exist if someone wants to do the work to actually. If someone wants to do the work to actually produce the proof, how can we get limits then with scale grading equal to zero? So I've known about the possibility, this example, for almost a decade, but how it's already was a big concern and like, oh, well, tunnels are not very good. We want to not have tunnels. So the idea is: well, don't just talk about scalar curvature, volume bounded above, diameter bound above. We have to add a hypothesis. So there is one. Hypothesis. So there is one thing that we looked at, which was work I've done with Dan Lee on the almost rigidity of the positive mass theorem. In the asymptotically flat case with outermost minimal boundary or no closed minimal surfaces and scalar grading to zero, ADM mass going to zero, we had conjectured that this should have a swift limit equal to Euclidean space. So this was our conjecture. We proved it in the spherically symmetric case, and a lot of work has been done by people proving it in various cases. It in various cases. So, this gave us an idea. It was like, well, if it seems to be working for this kind of question, maybe we should have some extra hypothesis about closed minimal surfaces. So because of this, we then decided at an IAS meeting in 2018 that the natural compactness conjecture could have this statement. This is just one of a few possible statements. Remember, Gromov's initial question is just scaligrating with. Question is just scalar grading with a zero, swift convergence, weak scale agrading with a zero. So now we're adding the volumes just to get this and the diameter bound. That's to get Stefan Wenger's thing to work. And the new idea is to add something about minimal surfaces. So the suggestion was let's just make the minimal surfaces bounded away from zero in area. The minimum area of a closed minimal surface will be bounded away from zero. We chose this because of all the beautiful work of Shenyao on surfaces, minimal surfaces. On surfaces, minimal surfaces, but this is just a choice. There are other possible hypotheses you might want to choose instead. We further conjectured that we would like m infinity to be a connected geodesic metric space. So we're hoping, oh yeah, this area thing, that should be good enough to get rid of that problem with the example where it's just a Euclidean distance on a sphere. Because this min A, it prevents all those tunnels. Every one of those tunnels has a surface. Every one of those tunnels has a surface in the center of the neck that is very, very small, and it's like the size, it's getting smaller and smaller. So, this prevents all the tunnel examples. So, we could hope the limit space, G-D is symmetric space, we can hope it has Euclidean tangent cones almost everywhere, and that the volumes also converge. So, that's the full conjecture that we published after having a meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study on this subject. Note that Wenger's compactness theorem. Note that Wenger's compactness theorem already gives the volume and the diameter ap, and we already have a swift limit. But more must be done to show that the limit is not zero. That's an open question. Once m infinity is a non, actually, that's a nice one that Casarus and Shu might try. I think you might try to counterexample that. But anyway, once F infinity is a non-zero integral current space, it is rectifiable and the tangent cones almost everywhere. Tangent cones almost everywhere. Okay, so they do have tangent cones almost everywhere just by the properties of rectifiable spaces that are integral current spaces. But we don't know that the tangent cones are Euclidean. They could be just Banach. So that's an open question. Is M infinity geodesic? That's an open question. So these are all open questions. The intuitive idea is that scalar J and min A should work together as they do in the conjectured almost rigidity deposit mass theorem so as to obtain these extra properties. As to obtain these extra properties. So that's the goal. But if you wish, you could try to change this to a different hypothesis instead of an AJ. Most people are unhappy with the tunnel examples, so you would like whatever hypothesis you choose to put here to eliminate the tunnel examples. Okay, there's many ways to eliminate them. Injectivity radius obviously eliminates them. That's too strong, though, maybe. Injectivity radius seems Strong though, maybe. Injectivity radius seems a bit strong. You can also eliminate them with lengths of closed curves. Okay, so there's lots of things that could be used to eliminate them, but we chose this one because it was almost like the weakest thing that we could think of. All right, so it's also possible to choose a different hypothesis. And we'll consider that further because it's good to know all the examples that exist out there when you're trying to devise new hypotheses that can handle the new examples that have been presented at this conference, Kos Ross and Schupis. At this conference, Kazros and Shu presented work, and I have a new work with Tian and Wang. Okay, so what was the progress on this conjecture? Because there have been forward work that has been successful on this conjecture. So Park, Tian, and Wang looked at a special case where you have an S3, and it's the most simple case of a warp product with a warping factor that depends just over an interval. It's zero on the endpoints. And it subverges in the C0 and H1 loc sense just by imposing scalar non-negative and min A. Imposing scalar non-negative and min A with these hypotheses. They get C0 and H1 loc convergence away from possibly disappearing wells. So the endpoints of this intervals will change for the sequence, and it's possible that the limit F infinity that one gets will only be positive on a new interval A infinity, B infinity, but at least it's still connected, it's still geodesic. Okay, all these nice things. And scales grading to zero in distributional sense defined using F infinity, imitating the definition. imitating the definition for scale curvature on Fj. And they show MJK swift converge to M infinity, G infinity, and the volumes converge as well. Now Tian and Wang studied S2 cross S1. Now we're taking an S1 bundle over S2 here. Just a standard direct product. But anyway, this is the standard metric on S2 and we're warping with the function u on S2 the S1 fibers. And this is how we converge in the W1P sense for P less than 2. W1P sense for p less than 2 globally without any disappearing regions to m infinity 3g infinity, which looks of this form, and this f infinity is in w1p and it's definitely non-zero. You can bound it away from zero and scale greater to zero in the distributional Lee-LaFlock sense. Okay, so that's now Lee-LaFlock actually required us more than W1P for P less than two, but they show that in this particular case, it's nice enough that you can actually use their same. It's nice enough that you can actually use their same definition. So you can look at their work closely for this. And then they do not have swift convergence yet. Okay, so that's something they're looking at. And then Kazarus and Shu have an example in their paper that has the torus cross S1, but now they're allowing the metric tensor on the torus to change. And the FJs of U's are now, this is U is a function on the torus, U is a point in the torus, Fj of U is a function on the torus. Fj of U is a function on torus. And these subconverge in the W1P sets, again, P less than 2, and this is globally to some M infinity 3G infinity. Okay. So they also have no SWIFF yet. And then all of these are using the Min A and the scalar gradient to zero to get this W1P control. So this is interesting because it's saying that min A actually is a useful hypothesis, but it's not really getting SWIFT, it's getting W1P. So, one can look at what does that mean? Why are we getting W1P? So, for W1P versus SWIFT for the compactness conjecture, what is W1P convergence? It's a convergence of metric tensors with respect to some background metric G0 on a fixed manifold. So, this is a little bit difficult because we have to fix our manifold. Swift convergence, you're changing your manifolds and you're justometry classes of distinct spaces. So, this allows you to change the topology. Allows you to change the topology. The W1P as it is requires a fixed manifold with a fixed background metric. By Wenger's compactness theorem, we do have a SWIFT limit, but those other compactness theorems that I just mentioned give you a W1P metric. So how do we relate these two? We have two things. We have an M infinity, D infinity, and we have an M with the G infinity and W1P. And we would like to know what is the relationship between these two, especially since the W1P is giving us this. Is giving us this generalized scalar non-negative using the Lead Laflock sense. So it would be really nice to relate these two. When G infinity is finite, positive, definite, continuous on M, then M G infinity is C0, Riemannian manifold, and a metric space, and then things are working fine. The W1P limit gives it non-negative scalar. When G infinity is bounded, positive, definite, and continuous on a neighborhood inside M, and GJC0 converges to G infinity on that. C0 converges to G infinity on that neighborhood and the volume of everything away from it and distance bounce. So that's a little bit more. You also need distance bounce. You get MJDJ converges in swift sense using a paper I had with Laxian long ago. So we got some hope of relationship. You can also see work of Alan and Bryden talking about Sobolev, Sobolev functions and convergence, and Alan Peral's. And Alan Perala-Sarmani, we have a paper about volume convergence and distances below, giving some more limits. And in the process of doing that, inside that paper, we also have various controls on the metric tensor. So maybe if this min A bound and scalar bound could be used together, we might be able to bound G infinity well enough to set up a relationship between the SWIFT limit and the W1P limit. But no, we aren't able to bound G infinity, and that's what the new extreme limit space is about. So, the new extreme limit space is about saying, no, G infinity is not going to be bounded. We can have examples where it's not. So, this is the example, the extreme limit. You have an M3 S2 cross F S1 dr squared. This is the standard metric on S2 plus this F squared. Now, this is just not radial, purely radial. So we have. Purely radial. So we have all these S1s, and as we go around, we're going to have a certain size at the equator, and it's going to be an even function here around the equator. And we're going to have the right side and left side will be the largest values for f. So f will be at its maximum at zero and pi. And I can redraw this in a way that's easier to picture, where you take this hemisphere here and you identify it to a disk. And now I draw the circles as intervals. So now we see. As intervals. So now we see these functions here: the warping function running from 0 to pi over 2, just to see how it looks. Okay, this is a way to sort of picture what's going on. I always like to have good drawings of all examples so I can deeply understand them. All right, so this is an example, and it's going to have non-negative scalar curvature if f obeys certain rules. This particular function, natural log of 1 plus a over sine squared r plus a plus beta with a greater than. plus a plus beta with a greater than zero and beta greater than or equal to two is going to have scalar curvature bigger than equal to zero because f will be bigger than or equal to beta, which is bigger than or equal to two, which is bigger than the Laplacian of F. Okay, so that's this is enough to get scalar greater than or equal to zero. And we see that this natural, this function is going to be large here on the thing, and then it's going to go down to a beta here at the equator. The diameter is actually very well under control. Diameter is actually very well under control. If you take any two points in here, you can always travel over to the equator in a distance pi over two. Then inside this equator, you can travel around the circle and pi times beta to get around to any point on the equator. So any point on this equatorial torus. These are all pi plus pi over beta apart. And then we can travel another pi over two distance to reach any other point in the manifold. So the diameter is uniform. In the manifold. So the diameter is uniformly bounded here. Okay, just travel to the equatorial torus, travel inside the equatorial torus, travel away. So, okay, we've got the diameter upper bound that we wanted, right? And now we take a sequence of these where we're going to take these aj's to zero. So when we do the sequence where we take a j's to zero, what happens is we still have this beta value at the equator, which is At the equator, which is 2, beta equals 2 at the equator here, and then we're going to spread further and further out at the pole. So we're getting longer and longer things. And in the limit, we're going to get an F infinity, which is infinite valued at that one fiber. So this fiber above the pole is stretching to be infinitely long. So the sequence satisfies all the hypotheses of the IAS compactness conjecture: min A mj is greater than or equal to a. min A mj is greater than equal to a. This is, I can show you slides about that in a minute. The scalar curvature is greater than equal to zero. I already explained that. Diameter is less than two pi plus pi beta. I explained that. And the volume is also bounded because they show W1P converges, their compactness theorem, and they can W convert. This is strong enough to get the volume to converge. And the F infinity space, if you look at it, the AJ's have gone to zero. So this is just natural log. have gone to zero. So this is just natural log 1 over sine squared r plus 2, which is negative 2 natural log sine r plus 2, which is something which takes values between 2 at the equator and including infinity at the pole. So I have a closed bracket because we're including infinity, and it's important that this spiral was infinitely long, and that's why we're calling it an extreme limit. So this is different from a pulled thread. The pulled thread took a curve and made it into a point, and we're doing the opposite. We're stretching it out to infinite length. That we're stretching it out to infinite length. All right, so that makes perfect sense in WMP. So now we want to understand what it is as a metric space. The circles above the pole have stretched infinitely long. Do we even have a metric space? Yes, we know that there's an intrinsic flat limit. How are they related? So, oh, before we do that, let me just, I do have time. So, I will quickly explain why we have this min A condition satisfied. Condition satisfied. So notice that if you consider closed minimal surfaces inside our MJs, we have a few of them. We have this, you know, like any of these spheres with constant theta fiber value. We have the equatorial torus. That is a minimal surface, which seems to achieve the width. And then we have these kinds where you go around radius this way, which is another kind of torus that's a minimal surface. All of these have length greater than 4 pi. Are these all the pi? Greater than equal to four pi? Are these all the possibilities for small ones? Excuse me. Sorry. Yes. We cannot hear you well as before. Maybe if you get closer to the microphone, please. Sorry. Thank you. Do you hear me now? Is this good? It's fine. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Sorry. I probably just got tired. So if you first we prove that there is a point in the surface. That there is a point in the surfaces, any minimal closed minimal surface, intersecting with the equatorial torus. So, you see, this one intersects with the equatorial, this is the equatorial torus, and this one intersects over there. We actually prove that always happens using the mean curvature of the other level sets of R as non-zero and the maximum principle. So, we force every minimal surface that must reach as far as this equatorial torus at some point. It may pass through it. Then, since F. Then, since Fj converges to F infinity smoothly away from the poles, there is an S naught between 0 and pi over 4, so we avoid the poles completely, such that every point in the B PjS0 have uniform bounds on their sectional curvature and injectivity radii. So now we have that kind of control because we have this nice smooth convergence away from these poles. And the Kolding-Minni-Cozy monotonicity theorem then says there is an A such that the area of these sets is bigger than or equal to A greater than zero. Is bigger than or equal to a greater than zero, so therefore the area of the minimal surface is bigger than equal to a, and so we have the min A lower bound. Is this a bigger than or equal to four pi? We suspect it is, but we did not prove that. That's okay, we have the min A bound. Something also worth noting is that our sequence of GJs is actually increasing. So we really have other lower bounds as well. If you want to use a different condition than min A, there's a very good. Condition than min A, there's a very good chance this sequence will also satisfy that. So we do want to understand the extreme limit well. We can't just expect to disappear this limit by changing the hypothesis. So what is the extreme limit space? If we let m infinity be this, where we have this value of infinity included, we need to worry about what we mean. We have this W1P sense, it satisfies a weak scalar and the distributional Lee LaFlock sense. G infinity is so small. Sense. G infinity is a smooth Riemanniometric away from the two poles. And the FJ is going to infinity as we move toward the pulse. So it's not like they're just suddenly infinity. They are increasing to infinity as we go toward the pulse. So what should our M infinity D infinity be? What is the Swift limit? So this is in paperwork to appear. It takes a long time to actually write up the proofs when you're doing Swift convergence. But we take the metric completion of M, taking away this thing. Of M taking away this singular set with the distance defined by G infinity. So if you take the smooth part and you take away that singular set, we've proven that the distance in this space between two points of this sort is equal to R1 minus R2. So if we just change only radially, and in this way, we're able to show, oh, okay, we have such strong control radially that we prove the metric completion is homeomorphic to S2 cross. Completion is homeomorphic to S2 cross S1. So we really actually just, this infinitely long fiber is just an S1 in a homeomorphic way. It's just infinitely long. And the distance between the points should be the infinite lengths of curves measured with G infinity, where the end points are any pair of points, and then the interior of the curve is an M takeaway S. So as long as a curve avoids the singular set, we're fine. set, we're fine, we can take its metric completion and we can actually show it's homeomorphic to S2 cross S1. It is not by Lipschitz to S2 cross S1, it is only homeomorphic. Okay, and then we prove the MJDJs converge to M infinity, D infinity in the uniform Gromoff-Hausdorff and intrinsic flat sense, and that the volumes converge as well. The trick here, the thing that makes this difficult is it's not bilipschitz, S2 cross S1. And since it's not bilipschitz, One and since it's not by Lipschitz, extra work has to be done in order to obtain these controls. So you have the space that's homeomorphic to S2 cross S1, but one of its S1 fibers, or two of them on both poles, are infinitely long. So now you might want to test notions of scale and non-negative on this extreme limit space. So generalized notions of scale and non-negative on Swift GH uniform or W1P limit spaces can be tested on this extreme limit space. Tested on this extreme limit space. Okay. So, because it is actually, we show it's a Gromov-Hausworth limit and a uniform limit, not just an intrinsic flat limit. Okay, so let's look at this extreme limit space again. I already described it, and this is just a repeat of what I said before. Notice that this, I'm going to draw this limit space as having these two fibers. I made them dashed because they're infinitely long. And the distances between points on this fiber are going to be achieved by traveling. Fiber are going to be achieved by traveling in a little bit and back out. So I just drew these paths just to emphasize these radial lengths, these extra gray curves, are actually indicating these paths that are only radial direction and very well controlled. Leader flux scalar non-negative. Yes, this is shown by Tian Wang, even when for their entire class of possible W1P limits. But what about the Bamler-Burkhard-Gwyn-Ritchie flow approach? Burkhard Gwyn-Ritchie flow approach. Is it possible that there is a Ricci flow on S2 cross S1 for t greater than zero with scalar greater than zero, such that S2 cross S1 distance on that space, depending on GT, Swift converges as T goes to zero to this space? So that's an interesting question. I think it would be kind of interesting to try to check it. It is a radial function, so it seems like one could define Ricci flow on this specific kind of Flow on this specific kind of a space with a warping function f and actually test this out. Then there's a Gromov prism condition. Check cubes with mean, semi-convex sides, and dihedral angles. Let's see multiple pi over 2 fail to exist. Can you extend the work of Chali to this space? Again, it's smooth everywhere except on this infinite fiber. So pretty much everything works except if a cube overlaps with one of the fibers. Overlaps with one of the fibers. So, this would be another thing that would be interesting to check into. There is hope that both of these could work. Okay, so now in general, not just this extreme limit. What if we have other examples that actually Tian and Wang have been working on more examples with W1P convergence and extreme limits that are worse than this extreme limit? That are worse than this extreme limit. When studying sequences of manifolds of scale and non-negative, just adding the volume and diameter, so you get this, we get the Swift limit. What generalized scalar and non-negative properties hold on M infinity? When can we show the volumes converge? What if we add additional hypotheses like min A, but maybe not just min A? Maybe we want to consider other possibilities. What alternate or additional hypotheses might be used? If MJ is equal to M, when do we get GJ going to GJ? Equal to M, when do we get GJ going to G infinity in the W1P sense? That only works when we have constant. So here's something that I would really be interested. When is the metric completion of M takeaway S D G infinity actually isometric to the Swift limit? Under what situations can you hope for this? Keep in mind that example I mentioned that somebody could one day work on where you do those tunnels that are weird lengths and get a strange limit. But that's not. But that's not all on the same manifold. So it's not really clear what it would mean to say W1P convergence if you don't have a fixed manifold. If they're not isometric, how are they related? And can this be applied to define scale and non-negative in the Swift limit? So suppose you have a metric completion, or you just have this G infinity on W1P, and then you have the Swift limit, and you don't have that they're equal, they're not isometric, it's possible. Isometric, it's possible that you could have some sort of barrier notion of non-negative scale curvature coming from the W, the one, the G infinity related to this M infinity. Like maybe you could say the distances have to behave certain ways because there is also this G infinity there. So, this is something that would be interesting to look at. I'm giving you all the questions. The questions. Back to sequences of MJ, GHA that are not dyemorphic. Is there an isometry invariant notion of convergence stronger than Swift, something that will be a little stronger, that actually captures W1P? Is there a way to do them both together? And then there are questions you can ask: what do you do if a Questions you can ask: What do you do if a Swift limit space is badly behaved? What if you just decide you check the prism inequality and it fails on the extreme limit? What if that happens? What if the Richie flow fails? What if you don't like the pulled string spaces that Kazaros and Shua found? What if that really disturbs you and you don't want to include these spaces in your world of scale and non-negative? You have this notion of scale and non-negative, you could adapt or extend your notion of scale and non-negative or. Of scalar non-negative, or you can adapt the hypotheses on the MJs. The Min A hypothesis is just one choice. It was a very weak assumption, and it was chosen to be about as weak as possible to get rid of the tunnels. But maybe a hypothesis about CMC surfaces might be more appropriate. The nice thing about CMC surfaces and boundaries of isoparametric regions is you can kind of control them pretty well now with scalar curvature. Well, now with scalar curvature, you don't only have to use Shane Yautrics on minimal surfaces. There's a lot of results now about CMC, and these are nice because the regions inside the volume area interplay would interact very nicely with intrinsic flat. So you should look at the work of Jurugui and Lee, for example, where they were studying ADM mass semi-converging under volume-preserving intrinsic flat. And there they have Control of the Huskins isoparametric mass. Then there's the possibility of choosing a min-L hypothesis. This would be the length of the shortest closed geodesic in a closed minimal surface. So this is like iterating down, like Shenyao or iterating down. They're going from minimal surface and then something minimal inside the minimal surface. This is stronger than the Min A hypothesis by Ethereum of Croke. So this length will bound the Min A by from below. Length will bound the Minaba from below. And it also controls filling volumes by a theorem of Rotman. And the nice thing about controlling filling volumes is that Gromma's Filling-Riemannian Manifolds paper was one of the things that inspired Swift convergence in the first place, because Swift convergence is like a filling between the two manifolds. It's saying you're filling it in. And there's actually work I've done with Portuguese that says that if you have this Swift convergence, then you get the filling volumes of boundaries of balls converge to the Volumes of boundaries of balls converge to the filling volumes, the boundaries of the limit balls, and all other sorts of relationships, sliced filling volumes, different kinds of coarea formulas involving filling volumes. So there's a lot of control we have involving filling volumes. That's never been looked at with the scalar curvature setting because we were focused on min A. With stronger hypotheses, you can receive, you can achieve VADB convergence. That's GJ grading to G infinity, volume J converting to. Volume J converting to volume infinity diameter J less than or equal to D. This is defined in work with Alan and Porales. They have a beautiful version with boundary, and this has been applied to questions with scale and non-negative by Huang Li Porales, Cabrera Pacheco, Graf Porales, Alan Bright and Kazaras, Hirsch and Zhang. Both use this notion. Stronger, it implies intrinsic flat, but it has stronger controls. This G J gradient to G infinity, for example. And open. And open, find a hypothesis that prevents limit spaces you dislike, or define generalized scale and non-negative that allows for those limits.
