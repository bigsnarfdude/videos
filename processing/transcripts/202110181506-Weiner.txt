It's been pretty isolating pandemic times, and so it's nice to have a mechanism of actually getting us together again. It's not as good as in person, but it's much, much better than actually having to wait two or three years for this conference series again. Okay, so the, so the, and also thanks for actually having this, this hybrid format to accommodate us. I know it's not easy to schedule and sort of logistics of a hybrid meeting, but appreciate that. Okay, and so the Appreciate that. Okay, and so the talk I'll be giving today will be focused much as a few of the last things you've actually heard on cell self-organization of shape and movement. And in the past, we've actually covered how cells like neutrophils, so these are amazing cells in your innate immune system, that every time you get a cut or a scrape, these cells can rush in to the side of injury to sterilize the wound. At least in the past, we actually focused a lot on how the cells mediate their guidance in the first place, mediate cell-wide events like polar. Mediate cell-wide events like polarization. So here's a couple of my own neutrophils responding to a fine-drawn glass needle containing the chemotrack that actually drives them. We can actually watch how good the cells are at rearranging their cytoskeleton in response to that source. But today I'm actually going to focus, zoom much more on where the rubber meets the road and actually focus on actually how the cells are organizing their motility apparatus itself to change their shape. And what we'll actually find is some of the rules we're finding in terms of actually. Some of the rules we're finding in terms of actually how shape is established can explain a number of the other emergent features of cell behavior. And in particular, biochemistry talking to shape, shape talking back to the biochemical cascades that drive it is going to be an origin of some of the complex emergent behaviors of moving cells. And really the goal in this work is to go from molecules to cell behaviors. And so we know a number of the key molecules that drive complex behaviors in cells. You take them out, the process doesn't happen anymore. We'd love to get to the level of, for instance, where I calculate. To get to the level of, for instance, where a calcium wave or an action potential is, we know not only the molecules that drive these behaviors, but exactly how cells set the threshold for activation, exactly how rapid a wave would propagate through a given shape portion of a cell. So that's the level at which we'd actually like to get some of our understanding of the molecules that drive cell motility. And so at the end of the day, these processes are mediated by proteins. Proteins only know who's touching them within. Who's touching them within sort of say nanometers and milliseconds? But the cell has to come to cell-wide decisions of its shape and movement. And so, for molecules like tubulin, we actually know how the rules of how tubulin associates with the cell actually generate a polymer, how rules of how monomers come and leave the polymer actually leads to processes like dynamic stability. This is responsible for setting the organization of the spindle. Similarly, for actin, we actually know how actin monomers come together. We actually know how actin monomers come together to form polymers that are important for processes like cell motility. And what I'll focus on today is: are there similar rules of self-organizations of the molecules that actually regulate actin organization that actually set up some of the larger emergent features of cell behavior? So just like actin monomers like to assemble to a polymer, are there specific rules how, say, nucleation-promoting factors associate with themselves that lead to the emergent features of cell morphogenesis? And we'll find out that they are. Morphogenesis, and we'll find out that they are. So, this will be a story of two different nucleators that I'll focus on today that have very different rules of how they oligramize with themselves. And those, in turn, will actually lead to some very different behaviors for how cells will control their response to objects and their surroundings. So, cells have the way that cells control their shape is via nucleation-promoting factors. So, these are proteins that turn on actin nucleation. And when and where cells assemble actin polymer will largely. Cells assemble actin polymer will largely dictate a number of their key morphogenesis events. Strikingly, there's very different morphogenetic programs cells execute and actually have different actinucleators who are responsible for those different morphogenetic programs. So for instance, I'll very quickly cover some of the work we've actually done recently for the wave complex that's responsible for building these flat sheet-like protrusions that cells extend with. But there's other classes of nucleators, for instance, the WASP family of proteins. Proteins. Most well-characterized N-WASP that actually builds these membrane invaginations that power endocytosis. And we'll actually focus on a related protein WASP that has a very different piece of morphogenesis that it executes. So we'd like to understand how these different nucleators interact with their various components to actually build these very different morphological programs. I should also say that I'm happy to entertain questions during the talk. I found it frustrating as an audience member to hold my questions. As an audience member, to hold my questions to the end. I try to carve this talk down to the bone. So I should be plenty of time for interaction. So please feel free to hop in during if you would like. Okay, so one key finding in the field is different patterns of actinucleation can dictate different patterns of actin networks. And so from beautiful work from the Blanche Wand lab shown in vitro, if you pattern different spatial organizations of actin nucleators, you can get very different. Nucleators, you can get very different morphological programs for the actin network. So, here on the left, these are in vitro assays where they have the actinucleation motility mix in solution. You pattern either a dot of a nucleator on the left or a line of a nucleator on the right. What you get on the left is the little finger-like actin extension. And on the right, we actually get is this bar of an actin nucleator generates a sheet of actin network that's very reminiscent of a lamellopod. And so, if what you want to build is a And so, if what you want to build is a finger-like extension, you need a point of a nucleator. If what you want to build is a sheet-like extension, like a lamellopod, what you actually need is a linear organization of your nucleator. And in the next portion of the talk, we actually will cover where some of these organizational principles for the spatial distribution of these nucleators arise from. In the case of WASP, we actually know from in vitro reconstitution, some really nice experiments by Mike Rosen's lab showing these liquid-liquid phase. Showing these liquid-liquid phase separating systems where WASP behaves like a liquid and then vitro actually forms these little biomolecular condensates that behave like a liquid. So WASP on its own in vitro, if you mix it with some of its binding partners, forms the point-like association that one would expect for a finger-like extension, either sticking out of the cell for something like a thilipod, or sticking into the cell for something like an endocytic pit. Pit for the wave complex, because it's mainly responsible for building these sheet-like extensions that cells make, and we expect it to have a linear organization within cells. There's not been any in vitro reconstitutions that have actually shown that waves can actually form these patterns in vitro. But in Vivo, so here's a lattice light sheet experiment in collaboration with Max Crummel's lab. This is a pseudopod coming out of the screen. Pseudopod coming out of the screen at you. And what you actually find is we found is Dyke Mullen's lab found that the pseudopodial extensions these cells make, you can decompose into a lot of little lamellopodia, each of which is this sheet-like extension sticking out perpendicular to the cell surface, each of which is painted by one line of the wave complex right at the tip of the lamellopod. Okay, so the wave complex in vivo has the expected distribution you would want to make a sheet, this line-like distribution in cells, this is the tip. Distribution in cells, this is the tip of extending lamellopodia. We don't really know where that line comes from. So, what are the rules that enable the cells to build that line? Is that a function of the protein oligomerization, as was the case for WASP, or do you actually need interactions with the actin-side of skeleton, this might be the case for, say, an excitable system? So, we've actually found for the actin network in our cells, just like the actin network in Bill Bemett's or another Edmund's systems, that the actin network is network Systems that the actin network is excitable. In the case of the wave complex, this excitability is used to power cell movement. So here's one spreading cell. It's going to polarize in this direction. And the leading edge of these cells, all these little fireworks or explosions of actin assembly. They're actually built with a very similar organization that Bill showed you for his talk. It's autocatalysis coupled with delayed inhibition that gives you these moving zones of new. That gives you these moving zones of nucleation of the wave complex. One possibility is this excitable system was the origin of the crisp linear organization of a nucleator you actually need for lamellopod organization. But importantly, what we find is even when we get rid of the negative feedback for this excitable system, if excitability was the only thing dictating the pattern of wave complex localization on membranes, if we got rid of the negative feedback regularly. On membranes, if we got rid of the negative feedback regulator, the whole system would just light up with wave everywhere. But what we actually find is a very discrete organization of the wave complex, even in the absence of this actin-based negative feedback loop. So the wave complex on its own likes to oligomerize into linear oligomers within cells, the distribution you expect for building a lamellopod. And the only slight variant on that is that it forms a curved polymer that likes to localize to saddle-shaped. Localized to saddle-shaped curvature within cells. That's the curvature that one would expect at the tip of a lamellopod for a portion that's lagging behind the rest of it. So a lagging portion of an advancing leading edge is where the wave complex likes to focus its activity. Some of the interesting emergent features, and I'll cover this briefly because this was recently published in a recent paper in JCB from our lab. An interesting feature of that interesting feature of that net that saddle curvature enriching wave complex is this is going to tend to give you an expanding self-straightening front. So if you start to stick out a tiny lamellopod out of cells, the edge of that lamellopod actually has the saddle curvature that if wave complex enriches is going to extend the size of the lamellopod. Also, if you actually have a region of the lamellopod shown here that hasn't caught up with the rest, it lags behind the rest of the advancing front. Of the advancing front, if you focus wave complex activity there, that's going to give you self-straightening behavior of the lamellopod. So, I think it's quite beautiful that a very simple curvature rule for how the wave complex assembles could lead to some of the emergent features of advancing cell motility, like an expanding self-straightening front. And when we analyze wave complex dynamics versus membrane shape in cells, here's some really nice shape analysis from Jason Town within the lab. We find out when the wave complex hops on the membrane, it tends to hop on. On the membrane, it tends to hop onto lagging regions. And the consequence, what actually happens next is that portion of the membrane flattens itself. And so it's consistent with a self-straightening algorithm for the lamellopod. And nice experiments done by Michael Sick's lab. If you perform an experiment where you cut a lamellopod to give a gap within the advancing front, here, the cell responds with acrontermization that accelerates out the movement of the front until it catches up with the rest to give you this really nice. Rest to give you this really nice coherent behavior of advancing front. So, we think that some of the rules of wave complex is it likes to form a linear oligomer that senses saddle curvature. And those two preferences alone give you sheets that extend from the cell surface that are expanding and self-straightening. So, really, really beautiful rule of morphogenesis from very simple rules of molecular organization. The last surprise I'll give you from those experiments was the reason we converge on the wave. The reason we converge on the wave complex in the first place to analyze and organize their lamellopodia morphology is both because it localizes two lamellopodia and it stimulates the ARP23 complex to mediate actinucleation. So what we expected is the wave complex would be dependent on the RP23 complex for its role in building a lamellopod. But shockingly, so here's wild-type cells showing lamellopodia organization. So it's a normal wave-like propagation of the front. Wave-like propagation of the front. If you get rid of the wave complex, cells are incapable of building these sheet-like protrusions and can only build these little finger-like extensions. But if you get rid of the ARP23 complex, cells can still build these sheet-like protrusions. Okay, so whereas the wave complex is essential for building a sheet-like protrusion, ARP complex is dispensable, suggesting the wave complex has other ways of talking to the actocytoskeleton besides the ARP23 complex. This was actually known. This was actually known from some really beautiful experiments by Dyke Mullenslav, showing that the wave complex not only can stimulate nucleation via R23 complex, but can act as a barbed end polymerase and shuttle actin monomers onto the end of actin filaments. So what our data would suggest is that that role of the wave complex is the one that's more essential to be able to build a sheet-like protrusion. So wave complex has built into it rules of oligomerization that make a linear Make a linear pattern of nucleator on its own. And that linear pattern of nucleator can talk directly to the acting cytoskeleton, even without other intermediaries like the ARP23 complex. So determining the differences between the ARP-dependent and ARP-independent lamellopode, I think will be an exciting direction for the future. So that's it for the published work, and I'll move on to the unpublished work for the bulk of this talk. So what I've told you is that the wave complex actually has rules of oligomerization. Actually, it has rules of oligomerization that build a structure like a lamellopod. There's other classes of nucleators that build very different actin organizations. So, NWASP builds these actinformization bursts that help pinch the membrane off during endocytosis. WASP was actually discovered before NWASP based on a human immune defect disorder where patients that are defective in the WASP protein have these recurrent infections, and their immune cells are defective at getting to site. And their immune cells are defective at getting to sites of injury and infection. But the basis of this defect is not really well understood. And so, most of what's been studied for WASP family of proteins has been studied via NWASP, this ubiquitous isoform, whereas this immune-specific isoform is actually much less well understood. What I'll be telling you today is actually WASP is going to build something that's related, but actually fundamentally different than what NWASP builds. Okay, and so the real context that sells. The real context that cells are moving within is not that cell setting on a cover slip that I showed for that first movie, but cells are actually moving in a very complex three-dimensional environment. So here's a neutrophil, a beautiful movie from Eric Betzig's lab moving in a collagen forest. So we can actually see a very complex three-dimensional meshwork of collagen that this neutrophil has to negotiate its way through. So it's a very complex three-dimensional environment that the cell actually needs. Environment that the cell actually needs to negotiate. I find it actually useful to try to anthropomorphize for cells, put yourself in the mind of a cell, and try to think about what different behaviors it actually has to execute, what you would be using to execute those behaviors, and what molecular machinery the cell might be using to accomplish those complex behaviors. And so, for me, I think an analogy that works quite well for a cell moving this collagen force. So, these cells don't have eyes, they don't have a brain, but they still have to find their way through. They don't have a brain, but they still have to find their way through this very complicated three-dimensional environment. So, I'm a rock climber. So, I like to think about a blind rock climber. So, if you're trying to move up a wall and you can't see where the holes are and you have to find your way up to the top of the wall, what would you do? And what can the cell actually do in terms of the molecular machinery that accomplishes this goal? So, this is work from a very talented graduate student in the lab, Rachel Brunetti. So, the first thing you would have to do if you're a blind rock climber is you can't see where. You're a blind rock climbers, you can't see where the holds are. You have to feel where the holds are. You would just reach around to try to feel when you actually contacted the hold to know where the holds are to power your advance. In your case, you'd actually use touch-sensitive neurons. They could actually tell when you've actually contacted a hold. The neutrals actually don't have the benefit of touch-sensitive neurons. So what I'm going to tell you is the way they can actually tell they contacted the hold is they extend their membrane. When that membrane actually hits the substrate and wraps around it, And wraps around it, that invagination induced in the membrane by a change in geometry is how the cell recognizes the substrate, not be its chemistry, but via its geometry. Once you find where the holds are, you've got to grab onto the holds. You actually have to use aconformization to grab onto the holds. As I'll show you, the cell is actually much more subtle about exactly where it grabs on these substrate features to power its movement. If you want to get up. If you want to get up the wall rather than just grab on and not fall, you've actually got to let hold of, let go of holds beneath you and grab onto holds in front of you. And so ideally, you'd actually like to regulate where relative to your body axis you grab onto versus release holds. And we'll actually find out that the cell has a polarization program that's superimposed on this geometry program it actually uses to power its advance. And so before I actually get into the data, I want to make one quick plug for. The data want to make one quick plug for the importance of tagging proteins at the endogenous locus. And so, throughout most of my career, I've mainly expressed fluorescent proteins on top of the native ones to analyze various bits of cell physiology. And that's sort of the easiest thing to do. But importantly, there's a number of biological processes that really care about what the exact dose of your protein of interest is. If you express anything on top of the native one, it dramatically affects the very biology you're actually trying to observe. The very biology you're actually trying to observe. And so, some really nice data for that comes from David Drubin's lab that studies clapromedi endocytosis. And if you overexpress the components that mediate clapromediate endocytosis at all, you dramatically affect both the lifetime of the clathrin-coated PITs, as well as the relative timing whereby proteins either enter or leave the claprin-coated PIDs. And so, here as a chymograph on the left for endogenously tagged clathrin dynamine, we get very, very acute bursts of dynamine-mediated scission. Dynamo-mediated incision through claprom-mediated endocytic pits form. If you overexpress either of these proteins, they're present for a much longer period of time and you completely perturb their spatial temporary dynamics. And so with CRISPR, genome editing has become easier than ever. And so all of what I will tell you next is with endogenously tagged proteins. It ends up being essential for analyzing WASP behavior. It's exquisitely sensitive to expression levels for its dynamics. Okay, so what I'll tell you. Okay, so what I'll tell you is both we're going to try to infer what is doing based on following it, spatial temporary dynamics. We're going to ask what recruits wasp by being able to control features of the environment to see what WASP is responding to. And then we'll actually try to use these to infer the phenotype of the WASP null. Critically here, we're going to have to learn to see what environment WASP is actually normally functioning in to get a sense of how we're going to interrogate the WASP deficient cells. Importantly, this WASP is one of these. Importantly, this wasp is one of these complicated genes for which the in vivo phenotype is very clear. The cells in vivo can't move well. In vivo, people have had difficulty uncovering or, in fact, even finding any defect for cell movement at all. And that ends up being because there's a very specific environment that WASP is utilized in. And you need to know that to set up the in vitro assays properly. So we tagged WASP with the endogenous locus, visualize it, and see what we. Visualize it and see what we see. This is in collaboration with Manuel Leonetti's lab that actually helped develop a really nice split-fluorescent protein approach to tag proteins with the endogenous locus. It's much easier than full-length GOP. So we tag wasp with the endogenous locus. And here's the pattern we observe. So in contrast to wave, which is primarily localized out at the tips of extended allocodial sheets, the primary distribution we observe for WASP is these little bright foci. Wasp is these little bright foci present at the ventral surface of advancing cells, and they stay fixed relative to the underlying substrates. If you actually follow one of these foci in the covers the frame of reference, it doesn't move. We also see a polarity of where these foci are observed. So primarily towards the front half of the cell, they disappear by the time they get to the back half of the cell. What are these foci? Initially, based on parallels to NWAS, we thought these might be sites of endocytosis, but if we actually co-localized endogenously tagged classes, Co-localized endogenously tagged clathrin, we observed there was clathrin-mediating cytosis towards the back end of the cells and WASP possid towards the front. And there's no co-localization at all between these components. So they're not sites of clathromedian cytosis. We thought they might be sites of cells interaction with the substrate. To test that, how we actually can block integrated median adhesion using dibelic cation chelation. And in contrast, in normal cells that actually have a foe-size to say fixed. That actually have a foci size to stay fixed relative to the substrate. Cells that are defective at intervent mediated adhesion to the substrate still form the foci and they're still polarized, but not like it's swept up with the flow of the actin network. It says two things. Both these foci are normally coupled to the actin cytoskeleton, and they normally interact with the substrate to maintain their fixed position relative to the substrate. We've done other experiments to actually look at other biomolecular markers. These are not protosomes, and so they're not. These are not protosomes, and so they're not at least some of the classic things that NWASP would be using to probe the substrate. They don't have the molecular markers of protosomes, but we think they might be playing a somewhat related role. So these cells aren't reading the substrate via the substrate's chemistry. We thought they might be detecting the substrate based on how the substrate deforms the cell membrane. So back to the Rock climber analogy, you would feel a hold based on touching the hold and feeling where you contacted the hold. The hold and feeling where you contacted the hold. Maybe the cell is detecting holds based on reaching out the membrane and being deformed by the shape of the substrate, using that membrane deformation to recognize where the substrate is. To test that, we're going to actually feed the cells a substrate that actually has geometric but not adherent features. And so these are beads that don't actually have any fiber injection or any sticky molecules on them. So here's a cell moving on a beaded carpet. Moving on a beaded carpet and wasp is in green, the beads are in red. What we see is every time the cell encounters a bead, we see profound enrichment of wasp at that site of membrane deformation. WASP localizes better than any curvature sensor we've actually ever tested, tested maybe a half dozen different curvature sensors. But WASP actually localizes much more profoundly than any of these proteins. It seems to be really exquisitely tuned to sense. Exquisitely tuned to sense these indeed membrane deformations. We can use beads of different local radii of curvature to see if there's a preferred handhold size that WASP likes. What we actually find is that for technical reasons, the smallest we can actually get is 100 nanometer diameter beads. But that seems to be the most preferred radius of curvature for WASP enrichment. So it really likes these fine inward curved service features for where the protein is enriching on the membrane. Sir, can I ask a quick question, Orion? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Question, Orion. If it's detecting inward membrane curvature, why would it not sense clathrin-coated pits that are sites of inward membrane curvature? Is there something that's excluding it from those sites? Yeah, no, it's a great question. So you're anticipating a little bit of. So basically, as I'll show you in a couple of slides, it's an AND gate for a specific radii of curvature and a specific position within the cell. So these cells, unlike a lot of normal curvature-sensitive proteins that only care about how curved that region of the membrane is, How curved that region of the membrane is. WASP is an AND gauge that requires certain polarity cues plus a certain radius of curvature. And so, even if you give it the same curvature in front versus back, it'll ignore the ones that are outside of the leading edge polarity zone and only recognize the other, the curvature towards the front. It's really clever. You can actually tell, can still repurpose similar shapes in different portions of the cell, but isolate them biochemically from one another based on a co-requirement. So, once WASP actually identifies a hold, it wants to grab onto the hold. So, it uses acronphalomization to grab onto the hold. We looked at the RP23 complex perfectly co-localized with WASP at each of these foci. If you knock out WASP, the cell is highly defective in recognizing beads. Here's the proportion of beads that are recognized by ARP, either in wild-type cells or WASP knockout cells. Even more intriguingly, though, if you were a rock climber, if you notice carefully, that rock climber is grabbing. That rock climber is grabbing onto the in-cut edge of a hold. Do you want to pinch onto some small surface features within the hold? So, wondered whether there might be a subtler curvature preference than just membrane invaginations for WASP enrichment. So, here teamed up with Dimitri Stamoslav to do super-resolution microscopy to build up in three dimensions what WASP pattern of enrichment is for these bead deformations to see whether it's just the general positive curve inward curvature or something more subtle. Inward curvature, or something more subtle about the geometry of the beads the cells responding to. Okay, so here's an experiment where we're going to use sted microscope to build up a very high spatial temporal resolution, both the membrane shape as well as the pattern of WASP enrichment. If you take a vertical cross-section through the cells, what you see is this omega shape, where the membrane has sort of a neck that actually reaches in, then has sort of a continuous positive curvature around the backside of the bead, and another omega on the other side. Of the bead, and another omega on the other side. We're going to ask what's the pattern of WASP enrichment. Is it continuously throughout the invagination or something finer than that? At early time points post-bead exposure, WASP localizes throughout the entire invagination, but at later time points, so here's an image of the bead, the cells sitting on top, the membranes wrapped around in this omega shape, and WASP specifically localizes to the necks of these imaginations, exactly like you would. Imaginations, exactly like you would want to be if you're a climber pinching onto a hole. In fact, even more shockingly, the pinching is even more similar to a climber. If we fully render the image of WASP around this particular bead, it's not a ring around the entire neck. It's two discrete foci, just as if you were using your fingers to pinch on the opposite sides. Wasp seems to actually prefer a focal-like association, maybe because it's condensate behavior, and doesn't form a continuous ring, it actually forms these. Continuous ring, but actually forms these focal distributions that might be like one or two or three foci around the neck. Maybe, this is very speculative, a geometry that's better for pinching than scission of the membrane itself, like the endocytic machinery, would want to execute for end wasp. And so I had already anticipated this portion. So that why isn't WASP localizing to the invachinations toward the back surface of the cell? Even for the beads, what we observed is that if you look at, you look at Is that if you look at so you'd like to let go at sites of association towards the back and grab onto sites of association in the front? And WASS is going to use a sort of polarity AND gate for that. So if you actually watch a cell moving on this beaded carpet, once these beads make it to the back side of the cell, they turn off, even though by stead microscopy, they actually have exactly the same curvature as beads in the front. And so WASP is an AND gate that actually requires both presence, some polarity. Presence, some polarity signal that's present in the front, plus a certain radii of curvature. This is very unusual. So, all the other known curvature-sensitive proteins, all they care about is how curved that local region of the membrane is. But WAS is quite unusual in that it seems to represent an AND gate and requires both curvature at a specific location within the cell. That potentially lets it grab on in the front and let go by the time the substrate makes it to the back. What might be What might that AND, the other arm of that AND gate be? So, CDC42 is by far the best candidate for that. So, WASP is a very well-known class of proteins that connects CDC42 activation with R23 complex activation. So, WASP binds active CDC42 directly. In fact, one of the biosensors we use for 42 activation is a small domain of WASP. If you look to see where in cells the domain of CDC42 activation is, it precisely corresponds with the domain. Precisely corresponds with the domain of the cell that actually forms these WASP foci. And if you knock out CDC42, you ablate essentially all the ventral foci within the cell. Strikingly, there's still a small pool of wasp that localizes the very tip of lembalipodia that appears to actually have a different ingredient that that pool of wasp uses for its association. But at least where cells are actually grabbing onto the substrate and holding on appears to be dependent on the CDC42 GGPS. Okay, so what's the consequence of all that for cell behavior? And so this is where the field has been a little murky in that although everyone agrees that in vivo, both human patients as well as animal models of WASP knockout immune cells show defects at getting into sites of injury and infection. But you take the cells out in in vitro, and most people don't observe any defect at all for cell motility in an in vitro setting. But maybe that's because reason. In vitro setting, but maybe that's because we're using the wrong in vitro setting. So we genome-attacked these cells to remove WASP and analyze them just on 2D substrates, like glass cover slips. What you observe is if you look at wild type versus knockout cells, no difference. Wild type cells versus knockout difference on smooth flat substrates. We don't observe any difference at all in motility behaviors. We thought that's maybe because what WASP is meant to do is connect substrate topology. Connect substrate topology with cell motility. If you're actually using a complicated collagen forest or a highly structured substrate, maybe that's the context under which WASP would manifest itself. So to really highlight this, we actually used extensions of some nice work that Wolfgang Lossertz lab and Carol Prant and others have actually found in the field. If you use a highly textured substrate with extreme alignment of the substrate features, so unlike a non-aligned collagen 4. Unlike a non-aligned collagen forest, if you actually give it a highly aligned grooved substrate, the cell will align its axis of polarity along the direction of grooves. Okay, so here we're going to use a grooved substrate that has surface features about the size that WASP likes to read. In this experiment, you can barely make them out, but in the horizontal axis where the grooves are running. So now what you observe is wild-type cells love it, love it, love it, and they'll align their polarity macility along those grooves, whereas the WASP knockout cells are highly defective. WASP knockout cells are highly effective in orienting their polarity motility response to the ordered substrate. So it seems specifically in the context where the substrate topology guides the movement, the WASP defective cells are deficient. So here, if you look at a simple metric of this, mean square displacement for cells on a wild type cells versus knockouts on flat substrates, no defect at all. Wild type cells versus a couple different independently derived WASP knockouts lines. Knockouts and lines, severe defect in moving to response to these textured substrates. So, briefly reiterate this portion of this talk, and then I'll give you some comparison and contrast for what we've learned about WASP versus WAVE. If you're a blind rock climber trying to get your way up the wall, the way you actually detect where the substrate is is how the substrate deforms your surface. You reach out, let it form an imagination, and that imagination is how you tell where the substrate is. That's where you light up WASP. Once you detect the substrate, you actually detect the You detect the substrate, you actually detect the fine in-cut edges of it by a more subtle curvature preference, either for saddles or very high radii of curvature, and you polymerize actin to perform the pinch to grab onto the substrate. And the way you actually grab onto holds in front and let go of holds in the back is this polarity and gates, polarity superimposed on this curvature preference where you require both a specific shape of the membrane plus a polarity more. Plus, a polarity marker to restrict where you engage with the substrate. This actually gives a directionality to the system. And there must be feedback not only from cell polarity to WASP, but WASP must also talk back to cell polarity because WASP is necessary to connect the substrate features with the cell motility apparatus. And so we're really keen to find out what the mechanism of feedback from WASP back to the polarity system. So WASP talking back to 42 would be a good candidate for that. To 42 would be a good candidate for that. Okay, so if you'd like to wrap up for questions soon, yeah, so last two slides, thanks. And so that so you have different roles for different morphogenetic programs, whereas endocytosis wants immediate membrane scission to pinch a membrane off and take it, take it within. WASP wants to hold onto the substrate and not let go. There's parallels to this in the endocytic field where cells can use clathrin to grab onto structures, arrested endocytic intermediates to grab onto structures. Progressive endocytic intermediates to grab onto structures and not let go. This is very different than protasomes that want to poke into the substrate and degrade the substrate. These cells don't want to degrade the matrix, they just want to migrate through it. Actually, I'm going to skip that. Okay, so the different rules of morphogenesis of WASP versus WAVE. WASP wants to be these focal-like assemblies. WAVE wants to build these linear-like associations that are good for a self-situating front and barrier avoidance. Front and barrier avoidance. Whereas WASP actually builds a structure that's appropriate for sensing inward curvature, recognizing the front to actually enable substrate-mediated cell guidance in complex environments. I think it's really nice how subtle rules of biophysical properties of the molecules can lead to very different morphogenetic programs they execute. So, I'd like to thank the folks that did the work. So, Annie did the first portion on WAVE, Rachel led the last portion on WASP, and Jason helped with the morphometric analysis. So, thanks, be happy to answer anything. For metric analysis. So, thanks, be happy to answer any questions. Thank you very much. So, maybe we'll take just a couple questions because I know in person folks have a coffee break, a real coffee break going on. But there's already one in the chat if you'd like to unmute. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Very nice talk, Orion. I might have missed this. Actually, I have two quick questions. Missed this. Actually, I have two quick questions. I might have missed this. So, in the first part, you said that you can correct for the curvature, but why can you not correct for the curvature in the second direction, in the perpendicular direction? Why does that not happen? And the second question I have is to carry on the analogy of the rock climber, have you verified that these localizations actually generate forces at the membrane and at the substrate? Yeah, two really good questions. Yeah, two really good questions. And so, in terms of correction for curvature, all I meant is if you actually look at a bead in the front versus back and you stead reconstruct, say, the geometry of the neck or the geometry of the invagination, the membrane shape is identical in both of those two physical locations. The WASP only recognizes the bead that's present in the front and not in the back. If the cell repolarizes and has a shifting domain of CDC402 activity, that'll relight up beads that are actually present within the back. That are actually present within the bath. So, for control, I'm just using the cell formation of its own structures, and only those structures that actually have the proper curvature location in the cell actually give enrichment of WASP. In terms of forces applied to those, that's a fantastic question. So, at the moment, there's actually really good techniques to do things like traction force microscopy, where actually you see where cells adhered to the substrate. What we really would like. Substrate. What we really would like here is where the cells are applying forces to the beads themselves, not where they've stuck to the substrate in general, but back to the rock climber analogy, if you could just measure the force applied to the handhold itself. So we're trying to edge towards experiments where you could have a passivated surface, passivated beads as well, that are stuck above the surface, and you could actually watch bead displacement in something of a known spring constant. So we haven't yet built structures that can do that. If you know anybody that can make If you know anybody that can make substrates that could actually enable you to infer forces, one real challenge in the migration field is really the only forces we can actually measure well are traction forces, and that's not exactly what you would want to measure for what we're analyzing here. I think you would actually want the cell only applying forces at the holds and look to see direction, sort of magnitude of the forces, say without WASP. Thank you. Yeah, building towards that. Thanks. I know there's one more question here, but I would. One more question here, but I would also like to open to in person before they have to go for a coffee break. So maybe we'll do that first, and then whoever can will stick around in the Zoom meeting for Fred's question, if that's okay. Questions? I think we're good in the room. Okay, go ahead. Bring us back a cup of coffee. I could use one. I think bouncing off the previous two. Bouncing off the previous two questions was: so, are these foci actually connected to actin and myosin or any other sort of structure that the cell can use to hang on to? That's another great question. So, based on the fact that if we remove the interaction of these foci with the underlying substrate, they get swept up within the bulk retrograde actin flow. We think they're definitely normally coupled to the actin network. The idea would be that they actually aren't. idea would be is if they actually aren't passively coupled to the, if aren't swept up with the retrograde flux itself, they're normally giving viscous drag on that flow and actually would actually help power the cell motion forward. I think sort of a neat parallel to what integrance would normally do. So for the cell interacting with the substrate chemically, you interact with the substrate and then you actually turn on tail and bankelin to grab onto the existing actin network. Whereas these membrane invaginations are going to give a cloud of actin formization that could then potentially intercalate into the rest. Potentially intercalate into the rest of the retrograde flowing network. So that's highly hypothetical, but that's how we actually might imagine you could have a substrate geometry-mediated engagement with the substrate as opposed to a chemical engagement, molecular clutch, like the integrance do. And also, if you have beads that are not attached to the surface, will it these dots move the beads? Dots are the beads. So, so far, if we have beads that are not linked to the surface, we haven't studied those as much. So, the autonomous wasposide that forms, some of those get swept up. The ones that are not engaged with the substrate, if you have like a passivated bilayer, the cell autonomously forms these membrane abatinations, they just swept backwards. That's as close as we've done to the experiment you're suggesting. Have you explored whether there's any preference for size or like Size or like to what over what range of sizes of surface topography does this mechanism work? Yep, yep. So it's somewhat striking that in contrast to normal curvature-sensitive proteins, they have a pretty small regime that will sense.
