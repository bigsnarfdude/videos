I mentioned two articles that we published on this on the structure factor in complex fluids. It has two parts. One is related with warm micelles, the structure factor, how do we calculate that and what numerical technique we use. And the second one is related with polymers. So a structure factor in polymers by non-existent. In polymers, by non-active molecular dynamic simulations. So, these two types of simulations, I think, is in the context of our Congress now. Now, the outline is first, the structure factor-in-flowing world-like minuscule solutions, the so-called fast-breaking regime, in which we found strong structural rebuilding of this of. Building of this of actually the surfactants and or these worm-like mesons interact each other. The effect of salts, and we found that in some salt concentrations, the Cox rule holds. And we use a constitutive equation, which has been mentioned before, the BMP model. And also we did predictions for the structure factor for various theorem. The structure factor for various key rates and solar concentrations. And finally, I will mention some polymer, the structure factor in polymer solutions. How do we calculate that by non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations? So let me just review some of the main features of the model. First, the structure factor, we use the BNP model, which I can P model, which I can summarize in two main equations. One is the so-called all-roy B, and the other one is an equation for the fluidity. The fluidity in this case is a structure factor. Sorry, it's the structural variable of the solution. In this case, the one-line solution. So if we divide the over-b equation by phi, which is the fluidity, Which is the fluidity, then we find that we have a variable relaxation charge because the fluidity actually conforms with this evolution equation in terms of various constants I mentioned, I will define in a moment. So if we develop, I said, the fluidity, then we will find variable relaxation time and variable viscosity as well. So, this model actually is a modification of all way B constitutive equation, allowing the fluidity to vary according with the evolution equation in terms of time and in terms of some constants. The first term on the right is related to the rebuilding of the structure, and phi zero is the fluidity of lowest frame rates. strain rates. Infinity is really the highest strain rates. And the second term here is proportional to the dissipation. So the dissipation destroys the structure if it's high. And if it's a low dissipation, then the first end dominates and you will have a rebuilding of the structure. Now, importantly, if you multiply this equation for the relaxation time and if it is sufficiently small, then you will Sufficiently small, then you will find that the first term dominates over the second term. And you will find that in the regime yourself, in the regime of fast structural recovery. So if this term, this is lambda, which is a characteristic time, is short enough, then it is possible that the first time dominates the kinetics. So if you substitute that. If they substitute that back into the overb equation, then you will find that you can actually use a steady state approximation in the sense that if the structure rebuilds in a time shorter than the stress relaxation time, then the time derivative tends to zero, and then you can solve for phi and substitute back in the Aldro B equation to have the so-called normalized rule term, which is a function of the dissipation. The dissipation. If you define these two characteristic times in terms of the fluidity, a zero shear rate and the fluidity high shear rates, then you will find that the variable relaxation times actually is a function of the dissipation. So if the dissipation is high, then the maximum relaxation time, which is lambda zero, will be decreased by a certain amount. So this variable relaxation time plays a role. Real essential time plays a very important role in the description of the structure factor that I will mention now. Now, what's the result of if you vary the salt concentration? But if you have small salt concentrations or no salt added to a system of CPAT, which is a warm-line solution, the salt is sodium chloride. And the salt is sodium chloride. So, if you add sodium chloride to this micellar solution, you will find that if this concentration that you have is high enough, you will find that the cocksmel rule holds. And that's important because it's a sign that you have a strong structural recovery as the cell content increases. And you will find here that in the regime of house high. In the regime of high salt sodium chloride concentration, then you have a strong structural recovery because both the shear viscosity and the small oscillatory shear viscosity coincide. So the structural rebuilding is fast. And this is called the regime of fast structural recovery that is important in the description of the scattering fat. Of the scattering factors that we're going to analyze. Now, in order to calculate the structure factor, we use the Langevin formulation in which we have two equations to solve. One is the equations in which you have two main matrices, the stability matrix and the The matrix that you will represent the variables that you need to actually work with and the Langevin, the Langevin formulation. So first, take the vector psi representing the variables, which is the concentration and the strain tensor. And you have several components of the strain tensor. You have these six components plus Six components plus the perturbation of the concentration. So, in terms of the perturbations, you analyze the scattering plane X. So XY is a flow plane, but Z is the perpendicular of the normal to the flow plane, and you will analyze that. We have an arrangement. We have an arrangement, experimental arrangement, in which you can solve for the, and you can experimentally find the X fed plane scattering plane. So for solving the equations, I didn't mention that GAM is the on-site matrix. For solving this equation, then you use the form. You use the formulation of the canonical orangevan equations, in which you have the vector psi, which represents the concentration and strain fluctuations, and F is a free energy. So the Onsager and Poisson equations, the Onsager is related to the dissipated energy, is used to obtain then the structure factor. factor now um the um the this provides with experimental i would say a thermodynamic basis for the fluctuation theorems and accordingly then the uh dissipation the fluctuation dissipation theorem must be held and then must be held then the um the uh the equations that we use in terms of the fluctuations either in the um Either in the concentrations and in the straight tensors, and this plus the noise terms, respectively, noise terms. And this lambda n contains the variable realization times from the constitutive equation. So in order to solve the second equation, you need the constitutive relations from the BMP model. So in doing so, we use the Milner's solution to Solution to the structure factor calculation and the scheme. And then you define this integral with the kernel in terms of the matrices that I just mentioned. So the correlation function matrix can be calculated according to this integral. And this integral can be actually Simplify by using this approximation by Milner's, in which we have on the scattering plane that we were looking at, which is XA, we solve for the weight number in this set direction. So upon this specification, then we obtain this equation which can be approximated by these exponential functions and where the And where the matrix gamma is actually exposed in terms of the matrix which contains the strain tensor and the fluctuations in the density or concentration. So in doing so, we can actually solve for the plane that we are interested in. That we are interested in, we actually solve for two planes: the flow plane and that normal to that, the explane. And on the steady state, in Fourier space, actually, stability matrix and the Onslaughter matrix can be defined. And we can solve this equation following the scheme by Health and in this publications in this quite auto. This is quite old qualification. So we use this scheme. Now, in solving this equation, you need numerical methods because you have a seven by seven equation. And the numerical sometimes, well, the system becomes quite stiff. But you don't need to solve this seven by seven equation. You can solve by one plane and then by the other plane. One plane and then by the other plane. And if you have a stiff matrices, you can overcome those problems by solving specific scattering planes. So instead of a seven by seven matrix, you may have a four by four matrix. And then in the other plane, you have a four by four, but you repeat elements and you can check your numerical scheme by actually working out the scattering pattern. The scattering patterns in various brains. So, what are the results of this simulation? Let me just show this experiment in which you will find the classic butterflies shape of the scuttle patterns. As you increase the shear rate, it becomes more prominent, and also if you increase the salt content. Now, remember that if you increase the salt content, you actually You actually come to the regime of fast breaking or fast recovery, and the Coxmere rule holds. So, in this regime, is where the rule holds, and you can actually work out, these are the experiments of data of the normalized intensity against normalized weight vector. So, in doing so, then you can actually predict. you can actually predict and compare with experimental data for, in this case, one solution, the CKT solution, with a soil concentration, specific soil concentration for two shear rates. And you will find that there is a shift in the peak of the structure factor against wave number. And this shift is due and this shift is due to the increase in shear rates. Now this shift has not been predicted by polymer solution analysis. This is the first time that this shift has been predicted. And here I show it for one line nicely. Now, what happened if you actually change the salt concentration? Well, although some of the predictions are not Some of the predictions are not as good as in here, but you will see also the shift in the maximum of the scattering pattern with wind edge. So this has been, we have more checks on that. And you can see the publication in the journal mechanics two months ago. Now, this is the first part. Now, I will show some quick, some resource on Some results on what we did on chain molecules using molecular dynamic simulations. And these are already published in the Journal of Chemical Physics seven years ago. So first, we use for molecular dynamic simulations the non-equilibrium aspect of these simulations. We use two potentials. One is related to the One is related to the solvent-polymer interactions and solvent-solvent molecules, and also those that are the ends of the polymer molecule. And affinity potential, which is actually the Leonard Jones for the solvent, and here it combines the Leonard Jones and the Finny potential for the polymers. For the polymers. So the explanation is: you have a bond potential between part of the chains, among the monomers, as we call them, with diameter sigma and interactions between the solvent and the polymer, these changes, which is different from that, the potential between these two bits of the polymer, and the Leonard-Johnson on this whole. Johnson on this whole model. So, for the structure factor, we use the usual definitions, the Fourier transform of the density. And you use a k vector, the k vector, the wave vector, in two dimensions and the plane of the scattering plane. And if you have n If you have n monomers in a chain, then the static structure factor for a single chain can be written as here. But also, if you have finite concentration in which you have interactions between the polymer molecules, then you use this extended expression for the structure factor. What you produce is these patterns in the plane xy and XY and of course you check first if the simulations actually comply with the static ones which are symmetric. But then if you increase or you put it on the flow, then it becomes a little bit elongated in the plane of shear. And we actually predict some of the experimental features that you can see. Features that you can see in these solutions, in which along the flow direction, then there are some peaks that emerge at some shear rate. For instance, a 0.7, then you have three peaks, and a scattering non-symmetric, I would say non-isotropic pattern in the solution. In the solution. You do that for several theoretics. And first, it becomes non-isotropic, anisotropic, but then some peaks emerge and you can find around six peaks as the shear rate increases along the scattered plane. And in perspective, you can see in this You can see in this simulation that actually for a shear thin and fluid, you will find at the low shear rates that the molecules are randomly dispersed. As you increase, the shear rate, then it becomes non-isotropic and then oriented, this critical shear rate, but then a very high shear rate, then several peaks emerge. Several peaks in the Earth, and the molecules are aligned with the flow. So that concludes my talk. And a summary of the results we have presented is that solutions of mice, in absence of salt, behave closely to polymer solutions. This is the cost of slow-breaking behavior, in which the classic theories like health and Theories like Helfand, Fredrikson, Milner, or Nuki find that the Coxmer rule is not obeyed. They can solve for these cutting patterns, but those are the ones for polymers. In my server system, you cannot use this approximation because you are in the fast-breaking regime in which you may have, you can control actually the. Actually, the relaxation time for the structure rebuilding in such a way that in some extreme you will find that the Coxmerge rule applies, and this is the fast recovery. And you can see that in the experiments. Now, as the soil content increases, then this rule holds, revealing a fast recovery process of the elastic negro mice. The BM model, BMP, can predict. Model, BMP, can predict the regional fast rate in approaching a single relaxation time dynamics, and the structure relaxation time influences the position of the maximum and the amplitude of the wings of the scattering butterfly patterns. The shift in the structure factor upon increasing shear rates was observed in experiments and predicted by the model for the first time. Now, relationships among the rheological properties, static structure factors on the Static structure factor on the molecular confoundation in chain molecules in the solutions can be actually analyzed. The world in polymer solutions by molecular dynamics predict the emerging peaks in the factor and an isotropy induced by flow. Now, the intensity of dispersion was also actually correlated inversely proportional to the change. Inversely proportional to the chain concentration, and finally, the ordering of chain molecules in this molecular dynamic simulations in polymer along the flow deduction is reflected in the shear-themed behavior fluid simulations and in qualitative agreement with scattering experiments. And that's accomplished my talks. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you very much for your talk and very interesting patterns. Very interesting patterns. And I think we will save the discussion because we are a little, we're almost back on track. We were a little behind when you started, but we're almost back on track. So save the discussion for the open discussion later. Thank you. All right. Thank you.
