In short, ATT. So I will basically summarize the following two papers written by Jin O An and Juni Kim. And then the two, and together with Zhang Bu Li, they actually produce more results on this stuff. But, you know, I can only summarize two of them. Summarize two of them. And actually, I'm not going to talk about the proof because there are so many results I'm going to talk about. And then I'm not the author, as you can see. So I somehow wanted to promote their results, although they are not here. Maybe, hopefully, you know, in the future event, they can come. Okay. Okay, so we all know the SOP1 and SOP2, but let me just remind you one more time, SOP2 and SOP1. So SOP2, a formula as SOP2, is another name is TP1, means there is a bunch of parameters indexed by the 2 to the less than omega. 2 to the less than omega, such that if you collect parameters along the path, then they are consistent. On the other hand, any two incomparable loads, they are sorry, the first one is consistent, the incomparable inconsistent. So this is actually quite a natural notion. On the other hand, Scholar defined this SOP1. So 20 or 30, I don't know. So, see, Know. So the same as consistency is the same as the SOP2. Only difference is not a necessary condition, only sufficient condition saying that two incomparable nodes of the form such that for some node alpha, one is the successor on the right-hand side, say alpha zero. The other one is anything above alpha one. So some of So, it's somehow a very unusual definition, but as we all know, that so-called this NSOP1, there are a lot of things going on. So, obviously, this is weaker notion, so that SOP2 implies SOP1. D, it has been burning question to know whether SOP1 implies SOP2, whether they are the same. Okay, the first The first kind of result that is actually a negative result obtained by Juni Kim and Jing Wan. I think it's mainly obtained by Juni Kim. So their assignment was to investigate some sort of this kind of thing written in the Jean-Munyan Sharla's paper. But it's whole nonsense. It's whole nonsense. And then even after published it. And then, even after the paper is published, they devise their paper, and then the new version is on the web, but still nonsense. But sure nonsense is like sometimes treasure land, so that one can invest, not every time, occasionally one can get some treasure out of it, and then they finally get discovered this treasure. What is that treasure? That is that they see. A C, there can exist a structure. I will explain what it is. This is very simple, not in the sense of simple theory, but simple, very transparent structure. Where a formula has SOP1, on the other hand, our expectation would be its finite conjunction would be SOP2, but any finite conjunction does not have SOP2. Not only that, not only that example. Not only that, not only that example, the positive result is that any such case, so it's non-bacchus assumption, any formula is SOP1, but this finite conjunction never produced SOP2, then it always had ATP. Okay? I will explain what I mean by ATP. It's in some sense a dual lotion of TT1, dual lotion of SOP2. Okay, well, Okay, well why do you look at finite conjunctions only? Because like you know, I mean I'm not saying that the this is only the way to look at SOP2, but usually something is K3 property, then this conjunction is two three property. So many many cases are you know expecting something, then you conjunct it, you can get it. So this is quite So this is quite, you know, this SOP1 is really, I would say, very beautiful in some sense. Do they show in that particular structure that no formula has SOP2 or only low formula? On the structure level, SOP1 has SOP2. I see. So let me let me explain. I will I'll explain possibly what you want and then uh at the end if you don't get from my explanation. Get from my explanation, just ask me questions. But Stock showed that to me, it's a surprising and striking result that answer is yes in the structure level. Structure-wise, theory-wise, wise is proper or level? I don't know. But structure level, it is equal. That means if a certain structure, certain theory has a surplus by some formula. SOP1 by some formula, but none necessarily is conjunction, but you can find some formula which must have SOP2. So, DOU wise, they are equal. So, this SOP on SOP2 has negative feature, on the other hand, positive feature. Okay, so what is then ATP? ATP is a dual ocean, so that again, formula with the same formula with the same parameter indexed by same tree binary tree and then only consistency inconsistency are somehow reverse so that the any anti-chain they are consistent on the other end any comparable one distinct comparable one they are inconsistent okay only that one so that actually you know as I said the result says SOP1 Result says SOP1 by finite conjunction does not have SOP2, then it has ATP. That's the result. I'm not talking about the proof. And then easy observation is ATP actually implies TP2 and then TP1. TP1 is SOP1 and SOP2 has many names, many names. It's easy to see why. Oh. Okay. By the triangle given by the same size. Okay, so look at this binary T and then this comb shape You know after passing so-called the modeling property under some language even by I think myself Lee Even by, I think, myself, Lee, and another team, Hyungjun Kim. So that you can see that this vitalises SOP property given by NIG and Arten. Catcher? Sorry, sorry, I was just... So if this is ATP, so then what happened? So that left-hand side, not consistent, inconsistent, can be in this one or TV, in this one over. Right-hand side, Right side, consistent. So only, you know, SOP3, SOP13, just, you know, things are swap. Okay, so great. So this must have ATP, must have SOP1. And it has TP2 as well. Why? It's easy to see that look at this subtree inside a TP tree. Inside ATP3, okay? It's another com shape, I don't know. Then, you know, again, this inconsistent. Yeah, because the password is inconsistent. On the other hand, if you take the anti-chain, like that, whatever the anti-chain, they are consistent. So that it has It has TP1 and TP2. Okay, the so that if I draw the map of the theory, then you have, and if you want here, you have want here you have here I don't know I should equally so here is NTP2 here simple and then here's NIP here stable but here's NATP so uh The okay, so in a sense that NATP is combining the idea developed in NTP1 and the combining idea developed in NTP2, right? So another thing they proved was the following. So ATP, the formula letter, then it has Then it has the SOP1 in the steric sense. So that this configuration having inconsistency is not only necessary, sufficient condition, is necessary condition. So that every other, not of this form, every other incomparable load must be consistent. So that in this strict sense, SOP implies. Okay, so that for any example, That for any example having SOP2, okay, so that implies SOP1, but not TP2, such as LIB non-stable theory or NTP2 non-simple theory. They have this condition, but they cannot have this strict sense of SOP1 because then you have ATP, then that produces SOP1 and TP2. And TP2. So that, in a sense, SOP1, even in formula level, there are a lot of kind of, you know, you know, we have to deal with this SOPN thing very carefully, but that makes things more interesting. This second version, that's the one that appears in the Jamon Shala. This one? Yeah. I don't think so. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. I don't think so. This is all new. All new. Honestly, this is all new. So, of course, they inspired, exploit the ideas from there, or even if the idea is wrong, I mean all the combined ideas, but they get some idea and then prove this. This all everything is, I think, mainly June, Juni, and then I think two papers by Juni and Two papers by Juny and Cheng. Okay, now let me show, as I promised, what can have ATP? So there's an easy example. Straightforward, kind of, you know, every region they have done is a kind of propotypical example, like a random graph. Typical example, like a random graph or simple theory is like a bypart random parameterized equivalence relation for NSOP1 and blah blah blah. I think this is the typical example for ATP. That is one sort. So, just Q two sort structure. Q is two T less than just three sort. Just brute force. Just brute force, you impose ATP in this structure. And then all is actually a power set of Q. Okay, so that the set of all maximal anti-chains. So here, let's say, you know, this is element of P R, sorry, sorry. P and then P is maximal anti-chain would be Would be element of P. And then there's a biangular relation between P and Q such that this, the collection of anti-chain has relation with node, just the membership relation, then this has ATP because the any anti-chain that's extended by That's extended by maximal anti-chain, that every element is contained in that maximal anti-chain. On the other hand, any comparable one, I mean the comparable two distant ones, then they don't have this can be contained in maximum change. Okay, so this is the typical example having ATP, and here XRY has a subject. Has SOP1, but any conjunction is not harder to show, not obviously. You need some proposition and investigation of the result of SOP1, SOP2, but you can get that in this example, any finite conjunction cannot have SOP2. But this has SOP2, not only SOP2, but actually SOP, it has, because SOP it has because this is the three-order, it's not hard to show that with respect to R, by combining R, you can find the SOP2. Not only that, I think in this example, swap the role of XY also has SOP2. Okay, another mathematical structure having Structure having the ATP is end product. Why? Again, the idea is very, very similar. Okay? So the formula is the x divides y, but x is not equal to 1. Then, just the even finite fee, maybe finite height. Then consider all this. All this, you know, maximal anti-chains. Then you assign there are finitely many because height is let's say n, then each maximal anti-chain, finitely many, you assign a prime number. Then each node, you just multiply all this, you know, assigned prime number passing through this point. Through this point. Okay? So that each node is assigned the multiplication of prime numbers. But, okay, then you can find this structure. I mean, this formula has ATP. Why? Because, you know, the parameter is 2TD less than omega, maybe 2TD less than n, and then each is just the product of some number. Is just the product of some numbers. But, you know, this is contained in maximal anti-chain, and then that prime number is assigned that divides all the nodes, because all the nodes is a product of all the possible anti-chain passing through that node. Okay? On the other hand, it's the same idea. If something is, you know, You know, comparable, then they are relatively prime. Two numbers assigned to those are relatively prime. So only one can devise, but one is not, one is eliminated, so they are inconsistent. By exactly the same idea, you can show that any atomist Boolean algebra, this formula, has ATP. But you know, the same idea also. But you know the same idea also shows that just any boolean infinite Boolean algebra has ATP Okay, so again when I draw the map so you know there's the NATP is somehow combining NTP1 and NTP2. So Nim is So, N-Nim is contained in NTP2, and simple is contained in NSOP1, which is NSO2, which is NTP1. Okay, so my understanding, I could be wrong, but somehow developing NTP2, although it fully contains simple, but somehow it's a parallel to NIP, in a sense. And then we all know the development of NSOP1 is, in a sense, parallel to CI. Parallel to simpler theories. So that now, NSOP T is now combining two territories, so that maybe you can apply combined items. Okay, they produce some more combinatorial properties that I'm going to talk about. But all this, you know, it itself is very interesting. But this idea, this development, Idea, this development propositions or theorems are used in applying or finding specific algebraic examples having HP or non-AP. Okay, this dichotomy on the HP line. So that if this is one variable theorem, you know, I appreciate one variable theorem. Okay? So another result. So, another result is this junction, then you have this. So, what variable theorem for TP1 case is, I think, proved by Ni or Yan? No, only Ni. Sorry. And then TP2 case is definitely alternate, right? Okay. Okay. Not only this, you know, this K-type thing. This is what we every. Versus ritually we do this kind of thing. So that you know only you impose inconsistency part, you k inconsistency you impose. Then, as expected, as you expected, you know, something has K ATP, then its finite conjunction has ATP. Of course, it's interesting itself, result itself, but this is used in applying, in finding the algebraic structure that I'm going to talk about. Algebraic structure that I want to talk about. Okay. Okay. So I remind you of the notion of strong in this number. So the 2d is not finite, but maybe lambda 2d kappa. So maybe just to work. So, maybe just work with omega to the last kappa. And then two sets of tuple having the same type, whenever the index is quantified pre-type, are equal, understood in the language of tree-order, and then this meat, and the next couple graphical. So, this is so-called in this summary. And then, looking at this proposition, I think this is mainly proof of the. I think this is mainly proved by Jing An. So, in his separate paper, he proved this and then he proved this. So, it's a striking kind of similarity, analogy. So, maybe horizontally and vertically. So, okay, so here, same setting. So, not binary 3, but omega less than kappa 3. Kappa sufficiently large may possibly Possibly random. Then, NTP1, given a finite triple B, you can find some left-edged paths, like all geo sequences, okay? And then looking at all the siblings here, then you know, something having the same time as this. Something having the same type as this node, right? So B prime, so that this horizontal siblings are in this one over V prime. Okay, how about D and A T P? It's very similar, but now it's vertical, so that given arbitrary V, you can find some node. Okay? And then, you know, starting You know, starting from here, and then the whole this geo sequence concatenated, attached to after this. So that this vertical, now this vertical sequence is, you know, after moving B to B prime over this lobe, okay, then this sequence is in this. So there's certain similarity so that this kind of investigation enables them to study kind of algebraic structures. So I'm going to talk about algebraic structures, graphs, groups, value field, and P speed. You know, I'm going to talk about really, really basic thing. So, to many of you, it's my So, too many of you, it might be too basic, but I'll talk about that. Okay, so now the so-called MATLAB construction. What is then MATLAB construction? I will talk about that. A binary graph is said to be nice if it has no cycle and no order. Sorry, it has no triangle, no square. On the other hand, for any distinct AD, there is some distinct. A D, there is some distinct C having attribute one, having no attribute the other. So that any nice graph, you can always find two vertices which are not connected, right? So then according to this definition, the simplest one might be five side, the circumponents of octagon. Yeah, that is nice graph. It is well known then. It is well known that any possibility non-empty structure in a phi language is fine interpretable with nice graph. Okay, now Maclea construction is transforming this nice graph into a group of the following form. It's a free unipontent group of class 2 with the exponent p. So that the in other words it is actually not abelian but modular. But modulo, the center, it is abelian. Modulo, the center, is abelian, is just described by word. Just all the commutators are in the center, you know, the word, all the commutators are committing with all other elements. So you can describe that. But, you know, another condition, constraint, is that generators commit, you can only, there's an edge. But nice script, there is no, there is always two vertexes. Vortexes are not connected. So it's not above yet. So it's completely described by said world. So that the well described definition. And the fact is that pure grab language and pure group language, this ATP property is preserved. And TP2. TP2 case is proved by Nadia and RTEM. And then the TP1 is proved by, again, Gino. At the time, he did not know, you know, SOP1 and SOP are distinct the same, so he has two proof, for SOP one and SOP two. So now they he doesn't need the two proof. But anyway, now he can uh able to transform this result to ATP. This result to ATP. So that again by interpretability, so that just name any ATP structure having ATP, like one sort, the natural non-mobile product that has ATP, then you change it to nice graph and then change it to group so that there is a pure group having ATP. Similarly, apply the previous result, you have, so the opposite is pure influence. The opposite is pure infidel group, but having TP2 and TP1. So NTP, NTP is larger than, you know, not just, you know, faith example, cheating example, but, you know, Jane example, you have that. Okay? So now I'm going to talk about the PAC field. Before talking about PAC field, you know, it's in general, Galois Abu. Galo Aburo given a field, then the way of understanding is so-called complete system. So the complete system is Zoe as an expert, so that the complete system understanding the language L sub G, so that there's a countably many sort. And then for each natural number, it only makes sense when M small M divides M so that you can. So that you can, less than relation, maybe you can understand as just division. And then this is containment to binary relation. And there's a predicate which reflect the group operation of the quotient group. So that the idea is for we all know that the Palois group is. Calois group is a profinite group as the inverse limit of colour group of finite colour extension of the base field. And that finite solo group is equal to, due to the empirical law theory, is equal to the potentiant group of the entire Galois group modulo a proton. A proton domes of group of finite index, so that you know the approaching parallel group of the inverse limit of finite group of proportional groups. So that's the idea. Maybe another description without Galois theory is that any group is there's a notion of proprietary completion. There is a notion of proprietary concretion. Very simply, you do the same thing. You just, you know, take the inverse limit of the quotient group by normal subgroup finite index. So it's the same approach, two thing, the same thing. And then it reflects, this setting reflects that kind of setting. So each sort is the coset, union of all the coset, make this joint, and then Joint and then clotting normal server group or finite index. And then, you know, given coset. So it all only makes sense when n divides n, then when n is larger, then corresponding normal group is smaller. So the containment is this, and then this. So that this first line reflects so-called transition map between the component. Between the component of this numbers system, and then this P simply catch the group operation of this quotient map. Okay, so this is, I think, developed by, introduced by Shirley and McIntyre and Zoe. Zoe actually. They didn't publish, but you published them. Published, but you published them. I think the main idea is: I mean, PH field, when you try to understand P's field, some property might not be elementary. So it might preserve on the elementary keywords. But on the other hand, the setting of this, you know, the complete system, Galogroup, preserves that property. That's the nice thing. So that in this setting, So that in this setting, so that you know, field, this piece field, you know, definition is there, and then in pure field language, it has ATP if and only if it's Kalogo in this context, or LG language is ATP. So that I think this is first PP1 case is Is proved by not only TP1 but the SOQN. All this SOQN classification is proved by NIP. Oh, no, by Zoe. So Zoe did ingredient variables in 3 first. I did one in 2 later. Okay, I'm not a good reporter. My reporter, that was a mistake. Okay, one direction, and then I think you must be involved with me. And then the other direction might be you. For S, SOP1. For S SOP one uh SOP one case, this correspondence is true. Uh one direction is proved by maybe U and Zoi, and then the other direction is negative. It's a coupler? Okay, but TP2 case doesn't make sense. TP2 case doesn't make sense because TP2 case, you know, the so-called The so-called omega-3 case field case is colloquial with omega-stable. And then so we showed that any non-simple case field has TP2. So it has to remove TP2. So TP2 case doesn't make much sense. Okay, now finally, I'm going to talk about this valid field. So that is a standard or language called PAR language or parse language, PAR. Language or pass language, pars, pass language. So that is just the pure pure language, and then the Abelian, Oldodian group language together with constant, and then valuation, and then so-called the angular component map. So there is a three-sorted structure where the definition of angular component is written there, but instead of reading it, I think the well-known example. Your well-known example for any field, consider this formal world cities field that is Henzillian, and then this standard evaluation is just the least degree having non-zero coefficient. And then that particular non-zero coefficient is actually angular component model. So that here, any field can appear as the racist field. As the resident field, because in this example, resident field is just k. So the coefficient field. Okay, so good. And the result is in this context, coli K contain all the information of small k so that, you know, we have field has ATP. You know, I assume you something. Then curly K already contain small k information so that doesn't make this it's So, that doesn't make this straightforward. But the point is: what if this rest field does not have ATP? Then this grand structure, still you cannot find ATP. Yes, in the case of Henzelian of character 0, 0. That is field and the resistance field was characteristic 0. More generally, you know, this called relative quantifier elimination, I don't want to say what it is. Field has satisfied that, then it works. But particularly, the Hesselian case has this relative point of elimination. Okay. What else I want to talk? So, this particular example, let's say the rest field is omega 40p's field or characteristic 0, then again, this one is Henzelian or characteristic 0, 0. Okay? So that, you know, this has, according to the result, the structure, three sort of parser language is NATP1, even if it has TP2. Has TP2 because this residence build is already has TP2 and then it due to the colour, the ododiabelian group, Berry group, it is SOP, so TP1. And as far as I know, the result of this form for NIP case shown by Pramps of Delta first, and then the TP2 case by R10, and then the R10. And then the ingredient is so-called indistructure, value group, and this resident field are stably embedded. And then other existing idea of expirating those ideas into the ATP context, they can get this result. And then again, TP one case doesn't make sense. I mean, doesn't really say much because it already has SOP, okay? Well, that's okay. Okay? I finish my talk. Can you get the same type of result for Hensillian fields of characteristics of 0P with P of 3 finite? Again, I'm reporter. I'm reporter. So with P of 3P finite. I don't know. I don't know. We can ask them, but does that have so-called relative quantum? Does that have relative quantifiable animation? I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Yes? You have to expand the language. You have to have the magic parameters. Just inform them, you form that to expend the technology. I mean, you see the gallery, the value grid, right? It's how you say. It's how do you say it's okay. In most cases, it's a z group. Okay. So you need to know when something is divisible by n or not. But the, how do you say the model theory of those n signal fields is really well known. Okay, thank you. So this I am can I ask a question about examples? Oh ATP? Yeah. Oh, ATP? Yeah, is that the question is if there's a known example with four things? TP1, TP2, NSOP, and ATP. TP1, TP2? Maybe write it. No strict order property and no ATP. Yeah, that's that. Did you give an example of that? Ah, so combining, just I quantified. Combining what? So four? What is that? What is that? So, you know, you you you know the map of the world. Somebody, uh two speakers shown the map of the world. Map of the world can communicate the United States. So what is your picture? TP1, TP2, TP1, TP2, NSOP, no subject. Yeah, actually one uh wai what is your name? No, no, no, it's not you, not you. Sorry. Atticus asked me this morning whether ATP implies SOP. I guess, well, yeah, so for older example, older example, he is. Example, older example, he is right that ATP implies SOP. So, if not, we know that it already contains an SOP1 and SOP2. What is the minimum number? That's another sensible question. So, maybe there's no node example. No SOP plus 0. Yeah, if ATP implies SOP. Wait, what? Yeah, yeah, okay, got it. Yeah, ATP implies SOP, then. Just show me an example of that. SOP TP2 and NHP. That's what I mean to get. But it has more questions. Oh, yeah, I thought so. So, you know, I think each time we introduce a tree property, normally this part of it that's about syntax, and then part of it that's about developing the structure theory in terms of independence or. In terms of dependence or something like that? Do you have a conjectural picture of what kind of structures you expect? Already it contains need and TP1, but what is the independence notion in NIAP and TP1? NTP1? Well, NTP2. Sorry, NTP2, sorry, sorry. It already contains NTP2. It's forking. Yeah, so yeah, in that sense, they started forking in NATP1 theory, and then I think the NATP. And then I think the NATP theory, and then I think the Scott already get some result. Did you? Just Scott? They produced some results. The students have some results. Yeah, they have some result and then he has also results. But what is the result? What is the result? Something new. As I said, I'm going to talk about two of them. They could have many of them. I'm not going to talk about the others. To have them their own chance to see. All right, so I think it's time to take my name. It is online, but we broadcast here.
