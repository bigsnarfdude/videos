Okay. So, why are we interested in general in the acting cortex? Well, the main reason which we are interested in is to understand what drive shape deformation in cells. And here I brought you some examples just for the sake of people who are not familiar with this kind of instabilities. Instabilities. You have some beautiful instabilities which are associated with some laminopodia wrinkling or don't like instability that you can see in cells. But adapting cortex is also important when we talk about interacting cells, where you have someone, this is a beautiful example from the Leveling Lab, where you can see nicely the actin cortex, which of two interacting cells. So this is one, this is the second, and you see here some. Second, and you see here some shape deformation. So, one of the things, what really is relating all these, I would say, examples is the fact that below the membrane of cells, what we have here is a very thin layer. So, I'm sure that you are all familiar with, I mean, which is called the actin cortex. So, it is a very thin atomizing layer, typically smaller. Typically smaller than one micron, but usually much less. Where you have mice and motor, which is which are embedded inside. And one of the things that this layer is doing is polymerizing from the membrane surface, this black line, and depolymerizing where the sickness of this small layer, at least I would say in a very simplified manner to believe, could be associated with. Associated with actually the rate at which actin polymerize on the membrane and depolymerize away of it. Let me convince you today that it's a little bit more complicated than that. So in order to study this, and I would say many people, I believe, tried to do that, namely to be able to couple an assembling active network on membrane, which is what we have here. On membrane, which is what we have here, we chose a configuration where we use a flat one. I mean, and the reason why we use flat configuration to generate such a cell mimicking acting cortex is because first, the first thing we would like to be able to understand are how these rates at which system polymerize of the membrane, where we can locate Nucleating agent like NWASP on the surface, which interacts with the membrane and G-protein like CDC42, when they reach the membrane, they are activated and they can trigger the formation of a branch network. Now, away from the membrane, what we add in this soup is a quite extensive amount of proteins, which are in particular important in order to control the rate at which. The rate at which this network deeply arrives. And the idea is that, sorry, we would like also to embed inside this network the activity of the motors, which is what you have here. The idea is to make these motors sufficiently small so that they really can incorporate inside, otherwise they will be left out, and that everything will be polymerized in the presence of these motors and generate a seam layer. Generate a thin layer. And here you can see here globally the way the system looks in the experiments. Namely, you have a membrane where we put where we have these full actinucleation factors like NWAS, which are only active when they reach the membrane. This is where they're activated. They record this RP3 system and polymerize the network. And then what we reach when we reach What we reach when we reach a turning over condition is a thin layer, which where you can have some sickness, which is defined what we are going to call along the way this steady state sickness. You can see also what we call the normal distribution, that is the distribution of actin throughout this layer. And let me try now to convince you that. Note to convince you that this system is really dynamic and can reach turnover condition. So, what I would like you to look at are these two movies. So, here you see two movies. One of a system that, again, you have the membrane here. You incorporate in the system all the soup of this component that I've shown you. And when the rate of disassembly, so how fast. Disassembly, so how fast the network can disassemble is strongly reduced. What you actually see in the system is that it essentially grows and grows and grows and grows. And we can continue see this indefinitely growing network. However, if you put in the soup sufficiently amount of disassembly factor, you see a totally different dynamic. See a totally different dynamic, and I will recapitulate it in these red images in a second. So, what you see here is a polymeroids, but at a certain time, it starts to generate this kind of very beautiful instability, these waves, the breakups, and then end up in a system which is very, very, very simple. Now, first of all, why do we have this kind of instability and whatever, why the system is growing like that? Growing like that, so it has to do with the fact that at t equals zero, what we do in the in our system is that we introduce all the components that we have in the soup, including the acting monomers, at once. The reason we do that is quite technical, but it allows us to start all the system regardless of the composition, namely the concentration of motors, the concentration of disassembly components. Of disassembly components, so that at t equals zero, let's say a very few, after a very few minutes, the system starts from a very, very, very thin layer where all these components have generated a very thin cortical network. And now, the system, what is going to do, is to start to depolymerize some actin, with style, and the pull of And the pull of component that is depolymerized will start to go back to the membrane and start to polymerize. So, the effect of sickening that you see here has to do with the fact, so it has some proof that disassembly occurs. However, if the system does not compose any very prominent disassembly in the system, globally what will happen is that these monomers that deeply rise coupled to the rows of the network and Growth of the network, and you what you will see is a sickening that of this system that grows with time, like any kind of system that cannot reach steady state. However, if disassembly of the networks start to be very prominent, what we will go into is, first of all, we will see initial growth process which shows some kind of instabilities. So, these kind of instable deformations. Instable deformation, some wavy patterns are beyond what I'm going to talk about today, but they are really very beautiful and very interesting on their own. But what will happen after this transient phase, what the system will end up is in a very stable state where the system reaches some turnover dynamic conditions. So today I would like to focus on this spot. Now, you could Now, you could do these experiments in the presence of myosin, you could do this experiment in the absence of myosin. Anyway, what you see that you need this assembly to be sufficiently important. If you add models, it slightly delays this transition from this transient regime into the turn of origin. Okay, so this is the first thing to mention. Now, what happened if you look on these systems from the side? On this system from the side, so you do a cut. So, globally, what you see is that you can look at this system to be polymerizing from the membranes with some rate K polymerization. You have some disassembly components that bind to the active filaments, induce an off-rate. So, this is the disassembly. They can diffuse, of course, back to the membrane and repolymerize. So, that the whole system polymerizes. You don't see here the motors. You don't see here the mottos, but this is globally what happens. Now, this is what you see here. It's an example again of the systems that will indefinitely grow when disassembly is not sufficiently important, or in a system where you can transit from a BRUSS regime into a steady-state, stable regime in the presence of both of motors and this important disassembly component. Now, just for the sake of people who are interested to look Of people who are interested to look at how the sickness changes with time. So, for systems that only grow like here, it will go and go and go and go. You can continue like that for hours and will never reach the final steady state conditions. However, for a system where we have strong disassembly across the sickness, you have this very fast transient wavy state that will end up in this. End up in this dynamic steady state condition, which again, this is what I'm focusing on today. Okay, so what gives rise to this growth or dynamic steady state regime is, of course, how fast, okay, actin disassemble. It is most prominent at the edge, where this is the original initial layer that grew and that was pushed away. And the rate that And the rate at which this layer depolymerize and the old network depolymerize really depends on how fast or how many disassembly components you have. So when you go in this direction, this is a system without any disassembly factor or not a lot of them, let's say like that. And when you increase them, clearly the disassembly rate is increased. Okay, so what does it mean in terms of the rate of turbulence? Of the rate of turnover, etc. So let's look at it a little bit more. So now we are focusing on the regime where the system reaches a steady state. And when you focus in this regime, what you see actually, it looks like a fire to my, for me, I mean, look at it, of course, it's not fire. I mean, you have here on the membrane polymerization, away depolymerization. It looks as if you have all the time a flow of actin that. Flow of actin that is driven upward. What you can do, this line is a line scan through which you can do some chemograph plots. So this is how they look like. You see these lines here, which represent the flow of the active through this thin layer. And you can actually extract from the slope the rate at which the system turns over. I mean, this is the flow. I mean, this is the flow. And what we find is that this flow is quite stable for hours, which is nice because it means that you can reach these dynamic states not only for a very short period of time, but quite long periods of time. So these are good news, I would say. Now, if you ask yourself the question, okay, so this rate, this rate of turnover, on what it depends, so the first thing that it depends on, The first thing that it depends on, and let's focus, for instance, not on the effect of the motors, I will come back to it in a second. If you look at how the rate at which the flow is passing through or moving across this thickness, so you have a flow of the own network which polymerizes on the merman and is pushed and disassembled, okay? And we are acting reassembled on the surface, etc. You see that again, this is a construction. You see that again, this is a construction of these disassembly factors that I was talking about. So, what you see is that you saturate. So, when you don't have these components that enhance acting disassembly, you have some rate. It's not zero, of course, but it's very close to it. But then, I mean, the rate of turnover increases, but such rates. Okay. However, what is quite interesting is that the sickness of this. Interesting that the sickness of this cortical layer, the sickness quite, I mean, as you can see, is globally unaffected, unaffected by the rate of disassembly of the whole network. Namely, what it means actually that, and please don't look at the black dots here, but only focus on this one. I will come back to the black dots in a second. If you look on the blue dots here, Do blue dots here, and these blue dots are actually the ratio of the rates of actin turnover and the sickness, which actually at steady state will give you an information about the rate at which the network disassembled. And here too, obviously, if this saturates a SSL point, also this one will saturate. Exactly. So, what we get an information about Edstein is said that actually what happened. That actually, what happened is that these assembly components are in fast equilibrium with the filaments that induce their depolymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, which saturated the certain part. Okay. Now, it's nice, but okay, the acting cortex in cell has motors embedded inside. So, the first thing that we had to do is to find conditions where motor will embed properly. And what you see here. And what you see here, these figures here, show you again two examples where we have embedded motors, used motor, which are labeled. I mean, they are labeled in science here. So you can see that Wisteim motor. And again, the position of the plane that you see here is where the membrane localizes. Okay, so these are the places of the active filaments. Anyway, what you see with time that you see with time that these are these are examples of a system where you have only uh motors but without these uh enhanced acting disassembly where this is a system where you have also motors and also important disassembly factors and what you see that in the case where motors are embedded you see some accumulation okay of motor with time but actually when you look at what happens When you look at what happens in this cortical layer, it is globally stuck. I mean, if you can look at it from the side, okay, it gets stuck quite at a certain point and doesn't move anymore or doesn't grow too much. Surely not even not like the system which did not have mysing embedded inside. So, mySin actually block or jam the system. But once, I mean, you use, you let the system to this. You let the system to disassemble, to enhance its disassembly rate. What you see is that again, you go, you get into a system where you have this transient growth regime. Again, it has to do with the fact that we start with a dense layer at the beginning of time, and it will go into this transient growth phase, and in the end, will stabilize into this turnover regime. Okay, so this is what you see here. So, actually, this, I mean, the transition. I mean, the transition from the gross to the transient regime actually occurs close to 15 minutes here. And if you see, look at the movie on top, again, this is an example of the system you see here, where myosin accumulates slowly and slowly, slowly at the membrane. So the red one here represents the motors, okay, and not the membrane. And let's see how it looks, let's say, quantitative. Uh, let's say quantitatively, okay. So, um, let's start with the system where we have essentially motors but without acting disassembly, uh permanent acting disassembly. And what you get into when you you when you look at this behavior, you see the following. So, here I brought, I showed you three graphs, one that represents the density of the Of the distribution of actin across the sickness. So, this is where the membrane localizes. So, this is what I see here. So, the dashed line here, everywhere here, is where the membrane is positioned. We don't see it here, just tell you where they are. So, what you see here is that the systems start, okay, we start. And you see that the distribution is initially looking like a Gaussian field, like Gaussian distribution, but it starts, the system starts. It starts, the system starts to repolymerize, and you start to see the formation of two peaks like that. When you look at how the thickness of this layer changes with time, this is the system with the motors. So globally, you see this is quite jammed. It grows very, very, very slow. In comparison, also with a system which is a non-motor. Okay, so the one that continuously grows, you don't have these assembly elements, which are important, so you don't reach steady state. Are important so you don't reach steady state, but you grow over much faster. This one is totally jammed in the presence of the motors. And if you look what happens in terms of the motors with time, so what you see, again, the black one is one that you see on you difficult to see, but it's one here. And with time, what you see that the mortals, they start to accumulate more and more and more and more toward the membrane, and their density really increases. And the density really increases with time. And you can see it very nicely here. Okay, so let me just show you what is that C and I that C. So, if this is an example where you see both the actin and the myosin at late stages. So, what you see here is the actin distribute quite compactly. Okay, this is something that Carlston Cruz and co-workers have seen when they did some theoretical model. Theoretical model of this cortical gels taking into account active polymerization, the polymerization misin activity. So it looks quite like what they've seen. But what you see here also is that you have some accumulation of motor, this bump that you see here, that you have some accumulation of motor not only at the front, but also some, which correlates also with this bump that appears in the actin density. Appears in the actin density. Anyway, if I want to look what happens with the first with time to the peak of this motor and where it is positioned, which is at C, and how much of this motor accumulate, which gives you some information about the intensity here. So what you see, please let's look at here. You see that globally the motors accumulate slowly, slowly, slowly. Accumulate slowly, slowly, slowly with time. So, this is the thickness in my context. You don't see it here. So, you can really fit this plot and extract very accurately the peak. Anyway, you can see that motors slowly, slowly, slowly accumulate. And you can see here how their intensity grows as a function of time, this stuff. Okay, cool. But what happens when you have now disassembled? You have now disassembly of actin, which plays an important role. So now you see a totally different phenomenon. So, first of all, let's start with the actin again. So, again, with time, we start with this system like that, okay, that starts to be pushed away, depolymerize quite fast and fall, okay, into the stable steady state regime, which is this deadlong times. That long times. Okay, we see it already after 20 minutes. In fact, again, the sickness goes through this transition regime and then stabilizes its final steady state sickness. But if you look at what happens in terms of the motors, while before we could see some bump, we don't see it anymore. So this is at long times. You don't see any bump in the motor distribution. Another thing that you see clearly. Another thing that you see clearly is that you don't have a big change in the motor density. And actually, this is what you see. So from the very, very, very initial times, motors are capable to go very fast towards the membrane, where acting plastic localized. So this has to do with the properties. Activity to move toward the Philamite Plus, hence. This is despite the fact that actin still goes through different kinds of dynamics. Nevertheless, we don't see much differences with the Ramyizin. Another thing which is quite clear about that is the fact that if you look at the density of this model, it's still smaller than what you see in the case of a system which do not have. A system which do not have disassembly. And this could have to be for two reasons. The first, of course, is the fact that the layer is much thinner. So accumulation, so like an antenna effect, the accumulation is smaller, only because the thickness is, you have much less motors that can accumulate. Also, you can have also some movement of the motors which are pushed away with the actin flow that such that overall at steady state. Such that overall at steady state, the system stabilizes at some kind of a relatively low density of mood. Anyway, it looks very, very similar. Just for the sake of looking a little bit what is going on. So we cannot, we cannot. So what I show you here are two things. This is a system at steady at stable turnover state. You see here only the motors, and I would say like that. And I would say, like that. So, here we see the big cluster of motors, the small ones where there are the distribution that I've shown you before, you cannot see them here. So this is what we do. We can look at what we call MAP, maximal intensity projection, where you can see big motor clusters. And when you look at big motor clusters, you can see different types of dynamics. When the system When the system is turning over, like I mean, let's say here we can look at it also here. You have some motors that are pushed away here, big motor clusters which are pushed by the action flow. So this is in the case where the system, where you have big motor clusters, some of them can be pulled inside when you have repolymerization effects. So this is an example of a movie where you have multiple such waves. Multiple such waves. Okay. But you see, the small motors clusters, which we have added, accumulate with time. You see it very nicely. So, this is the sine one, the very small one that you cannot see here, individual ones, accumulate with time. This is clear. The big ones, in many cases, show different dynamics. They can be pushed away, like those that are located and pushed by the growing network. Growing network and can fade away in the solution. Other ones can show some bidirectional motion, namely, they can be pushed away with the active flow and start to go back. So this is what we saw here. So different kind of dynamics which are associated with the concentration of this disassembly element. If I recapitulate everything that I've shown you, that when we don't, we have only a very small amount of We have only a very small amount of active disassembly, so the concentration of these factors is relatively low. The system is jammed, globally is jammed. So the sickness that I show you here is the sickness at after, let's say, one hour. In this case, the system is not reaching steady state, so the sickness is quite high. We could see that at very high concentration, we can go into a system where we have multiple waves that come back. We have multiple waves that come back again and again. Again, I'm not talking about it today. Let me just focus, and this is what I wanted to talk to you about today: the turtle regime. So it appears to exist in a certain range of where the coupling between acting dissembling is important. These are things that Kinere had saw within droplets, but using cell extracts. Droplets, but using cell extract, where you have all the soup, I would say, and where actin polymerization and misin contractivity can occur throughout the volume. So, here we are still confined to the membrane. Anyway, if we now concentrate on what happens really in the presence of mortals in terms of the turnover velocity, what we find out is that actually with no motors, we have a certain rate of active turnover. Have a certain rate of acting turnover, but the motors in their presence is increased quite unexpectedly. At least, this is not what I ever expected. Well, what we find, though, that the sickness is also increased in the same proportion. And actually, the reason what we see is that the sickness is increased is because if you look at the rate of acting disassembly at steady state. Acting disassembly at steady state is globally unaffected. Namely, what we see here is that what really controls the rate of acting disassembly are these disassembly factors. And the rate of turnover is actually governed by the myosin contractility, which actually what it does, it increases the rate of factin polymerization of the surface. Okay, so So I will say something in a second about that. Anyway, before that, I just want to thank Shachal for this beautiful work. The model, which I did not present at all due to the lack of time, was done by Neil Goebb and Eric. And that's all. I would just say two words about the About the reason why we believe that myosin induces this increase in actin turnover polymerization on the surface. It could be for two things. So if myosin contractivity increases, is playing a role here in the system, it could just reduce the forces which are exerted on the polymerizing filament. And this would increase the rate of polymerization. It could maybe bend the filament, providing some more space. Providing some more space for them to polymerize. This is something that we are trying to figure out. Thank you very much.
