But although it's not at the end of the week, it is the last formal talk, so please join me also to thank the organizers for having offered such a talk. So for this last formal talk, I actually am not planning to present you my last new results. Instead, I want to make occasion, use of this occasion, to be in front of people that think day and night about trading to ask a question. So it should be a question about the degenerically created categories, but let's Degenerically created categories, but let's first start with things that we are now comfortable all of us about. So, we saw this week: if you take, let's say, some algebra, you can always look at the category of modules. And this will be an abelian category, so we will have some direct sums to support that stuff. If this algebra is actually a bi algebra, then the representations should become also a monodal category. A monodal category, so it will have a tensor product, and we will actually have a braiding here if the algebra that you started with was actually quasi-triangular. So, quasi-triangular, as you saw, it meant that simply existed a universal L-matrix. So, there exists some element in the tensor squared, in vertical one. Invertible one that yielded a very explicit type of grading on the modules. So for every couple of modules we would get simple this. Okay, so universal L matrices give gradings on the category of representations, but not all graded modulo categories are of the form modules of an algebra. For instance, you could also take co-modules over a co-quasi-triangular algebra, or you could take yet quite some other things. But my talk is not about the classification. There is quite a lot of people who can tell you about that. I want to go to non-realistic categories. Okay. Okay. So let's go to non-grade exception. So Dmitry told us one emergency exit if you only are given a monolith category, namely you can always make it reinforce setter, you get again upgraded monolith category when you fix it. However, that's not what I want to do. I really want to embrace non-predict. So uh let's look at some Uh let's look at some basic examples of things that can work. See that some of you really like a lot of groups, I thought that the first example should be a group. So if you take a group, now we tell you one, you can always view it as a category in by viewing it as a discrete category. So explicitly the objects are simply the elements of the group. The elements of the code, and the most users are either empty or the identity. So you can view it as a discrete category, and if you do like this, and you take as tensor products into the multiplication, then the group viewed as a discrete category will be monoidal. Monohider even only if the group is available. So, what is the problem with this example? The problem is simply that we don't have enough air matrix. So, for the most common elements, you mean cheaper? Yes, thank you. That's definitely what I mean. How could I define the multiplication? And so the problem in this setting is that for the mass of tuples in the group, you simply don't have a map going from one to the other. So that's the first thing that can go wrong, is simply for some of the elements, you might maybe have no map. Okay? Another thing that can go wrong to get the breeding is it might be that still for all your elements A script for all your elements in your category that you actually have or not, but simply at this map is not an isomorphism. So in the case that you actually have them, but simply they are not all isomorphic, then we speak about Bakli-brele categories. So to be honest, I didn't solve many papers using this terminology, but it exists. Terminology, but it exists. And so, for example, we saw, or we almost saw two examples this week. So, for example so we saw this branded category this week made out of the brain group. Instead of taking the brain group, one could take the positive brain group. Take the positive rate code and associate the positive rate category. I will not go into detail, but so let's say on positive grades, you can get on this weekly graded structure which is not graded. Category. So, my example should be of a very different kind, so I prefer to go to that. Another thing that we somehow closely have created. Graded modules over some commutative thing and not graded over everything, but graded, like usually this week it would be over the integers, but over the notices. So on this you can also put some big grading, namely something like if you have a graded module, you take homogeneous elements, you can introduce some scalar. You can introduce some scalar. So here that's the homogeneous degree of the homogeneous element here. And so if K is not interruptable in a ground shift, then this will also be an example of a weak grading without being a. But okay, so what can happen? Either simply you don't have maps, or you actually have maps, but they are not isomorphic. Or you actually have maps, but they are not isomorphic. Now, in D-theory, there is many interesting examples coming from quantum groups where there is yet another problem that happens, which is a kind of a mixture. And these are really the examples that I now want to explain a bit more in detail. Okay, so let's look at it. So, first of all, recall that final dimension of simple Lie algebras have already been classified very well. Have already been classified very long ago. It is a very beautiful work of Edith Carcan. It said that they simply correspond to linking diagrams. And now, given a linking diagram, for example, you can always add at a very specific spot some extra vertex. So, for example, in the case of So, for example, in the case of Rn, I add it here. This is called the extended Dinking diagrams, or also the Euclidean ones, or also sometimes called affine thinking diagrams. And the work of Elie Carton was later on generalized by Katz and Woody to say that. By Katz and Woody, to say that even with these types of diagrams, you can still associate simple Lie algebras, but they will not necessarily be finite dimensional. Generally, they are infinite dimensional. And those corresponding to these linking diagrams with one vertex added are the so-called affine Lie algebras. So if I take a finite dimension simple one, the associated affine one See that a fine one I will denote by a j-hat. So it can also be described very explicitly what this j-hat looks like, but I will not read it. Okay. So we have these affiliate algebra. So, we have these affinity Lie algebras, but we want to look at certain modular categories. So, we will look at the representations again. Now, the representation of a Lie algebra is the same as simply the modules of the universal envelope. And so, I just introduced this construction of affinization. That we instead of G, we go to this affine Lie algebra. But another well-known construction that exists now is quantization. So we can take uq of g, or we could somehow make the both constructions. And if you do this, this is possible. This was realized by the Hinton Gugo. And large parts which are out of this are called point to affine algebra. Okay. Okay, so. Okay, so that's funny. We make some algebras, they are complicated, but again, we want to speak about another category, so let's look at the representations. And I will not be technical, so I will not go into detail about which type of representations you will take. And let's look at what happens to the properties of these categories when you do these constructions. Categories when you do this construction. So, since this is a fine-dimensional simple Lie algebra, this will learn that these things, so as an abelian category, so for the direct sum everything is really simple, and for the tensor product, everything is actually monomial. So, if you do this affinization process, you already start to lose one of the properties. So, it will not no longer be. It will not no longer be semi-simple, but it will still be monoidal. If you go to this quantization, so for me, Q will not be a root of unity, otherwise the world is quite different. So, in this case, this actually still remains semi-simple and monomidal, and actually, its representation theory is representation theory of this guy in this. The representation of this guy and this guy are quite the same. But if you now look here, it actually becomes interesting because it will no longer be semi-slider and it will have some object. And one can actually be more precise. This note that all the representations of this guy form a problem. This actually represents so-called level zero. But again, let's say this one. Again, let's say this one, there is some problems with certain types of representations. And my message is not: you should not be afraid of this and not look at it. No, instead, one should not get excited. I want it all right to understand this. And really, there is something very special happening. Let me explain that. So, what is happening is that this is not branded because it is not a quasi-triangular Hawk version. It is still a Hawk version first. Absorption transforms to be quasi-triangular, as I said, it would be mono-but it becomes quasi-triangular after completion. Yes, so this is quasi-triangular, but only after we extend the scalars, let's say, to a completion, so to form a power series in some etc. So this will become actually quite a triangular. So it means that there exists a universal F-matrix, but no. But not in the tensor square of this guy, in the tensor square with scalars extended to the formal values. So what does this concretely mean? But this means simply that for every modulus that I take, that I have a kind of an L matrix from M to N, but it will not simply go from M tens of N. I will have to extend scalar, so I will have here the fractions. So, I will have here the fraction field of the power series. I need to do a small modification of the model, but I will hide that detail. So, you will get this type of D, but on this extension. Okay? So, that's already a bit peculiar, that you have a braiding, but you call something big. But it the story doesn't stop there. It the story doesn't stop there. Because you can when you have this, it is quite attractive to simply try to get rid of this former power service. It will be very attractive to simply put z equal to one and then say, okay, then we have actually something between the modules that we want. Of course, this is something you cannot do, but you can. Is something you cannot do, but you can say why you cannot do it. So actually, there exists, so for every pair of tuples, of modules, there exists an invertible Laurent function, simplies, that you can multiply with universal F matrix, so that if you know actually between the modules. Restricted between the modules in the way that you would like. So, this I cannot simply restrict to this. If I would restrict it to this part, I will not end up where it is written. But after multiplying with some kind of or series, I can do it. But still, nothing that I received is Z that I'm writing, so this is simply a kind of extension called atomization. Productionization to some polynomial. So there is a kind of an extension, and this actually allows us one could now have to evaluate the variable z. So if we now take this expression that we just made, and we evaluate the scalar z into any variable z into any scalar, this will actually give something from. This will actually give something from n tens of n to n tens of m in the way that you want. And it is actually a non-zero now. This is for every scale. Okay, so what am I doing? So I said, well, because an algebra is no longer quite triangular, we need to extend careless to a completion. There you can find L matrices, and then you can simply go down again. It feels like there is some. This feels like there is something strange happening, but this going down is actually quite interesting because it gives information on the tensor product of modules from the star. So more precisely, this Laurent series could have been written as a quotient of some polynomial together with some other Order actual core surface that is invertible. But what is interesting is this polynomial. Because what is it saying is that if I would have taken this and I would start to simply evaluate that at a scalar log, it might not exist. Why? What would it exist? Because that was the zeros of this polynomial. Polynomial. So at exactly the zeros of this polynomial, I cannot evolve this. What is the conclusion? And the conclusion is certainly not technical at all. So the conclusion is that so every module that I take, that I always That I tell that I always exist an error matrix from n to subm to n to sub m. Let's say if there exists an isomorphism from n to sub n to n ton for all n except a finitely many one and these finitely many ones have Ones are measured by the zeros of this polynomial. Okay, so we were not graded, but actually we were quite graded, because for almost all objects we have an isomorphism, except a finite magnitude one, and it is really measured, and that's quite important. So, for example, the correlation of this is that if you take the representation, so if you take the The representation, so if you take the quote and decree, the representation of the quote-unquote algebra is that this is still commutative. But this is a property that you always get when you're upgraded due to the swapping. So you simply get commutativity on a k0. But here I cannot always swap. But because I can almost always swap, it still is commutative. So that's a very particular thing. And so we could somehow speak about the setting as we are. What is setting us with generically rate? So I will now try to make this a bit more precise and example in the conference. So this example is not the only one in lithium, but this happens. So for those who know it, it also happens for certain Youngian quantum groups. It also happens for credit models of other Also, happens for create that models over the proven of La Da Fouquier algebras. If you have a algebra, you can make look at this Borel. You can take the negative quantum O category O, there it also happens. But in certain examples, it is still a bit more complicated. So the fact that there is only finitely many ones, this is not always the case. So it might happen that there is still infinite amount of problem issues, but still these problem issues are always measured by something very precise. By something very precise. So it would be attractive to define generically graded as simply up to finitely money, you are graded, but that's not a good definition. And not already, not all examples from ETO would arrive, and also you would not have kind of something to touch to work with such a type of definition. So a good definition should also possess some type of measure. Some type of measurement. Okay. So I will. So in 2019, Sabin Cotis and Harvard Williams faced this problem of a kind of generic breadness, also in a very geometric context, in the so-called coherent setting category. And then they tried to, in my eyes, somehow they formalized what they were. What they were facing. They don't formulate it like that, but you can. And so, what did they define? They defined a system of renormalized analytics. So, if I take some one of the categories, for example, this representation of the quantum of fine, so a system of renormalized elements is regrading, first of all, so V reading, first of all, so so so is so for all tuple of elements you have a mapping from m tensor n to n tensor m, but we do not suppose that it needs to be isomorphisms. And we have some measurement. So n-associated numbers are numbers that I will not denote lambda mm. Will not denote lambda mm. These are integers or minus infinity, and they must satisfy some properties. So I will not write all properties, I will only mention some of them, but if you're interested, of course, in the questions time, I will write them down. So what are the properties that, for example, needs to satisfy? For example, you should in the day plenty guys are non-zero. Are not zero. So, for example, it is non-zero, even only if this number is not minus infinity. It should also detect something about what if you do triple tensor products. What happens with Morph this is for example these numbers, if you take M and you take the tensor of two modules, you put for first its two steps, and so there is a kind of Triangle inequality. Kind of triangle inequality that should be set. And not simply a triangle inequality, also equality should only hold if the L matrix between M and anti-stenza product is expressible for all the terms, so it will be So if it is equal, then the arithmetic is simply the composition of swapping first two terms and then swapping the last two terms. So that's there are natural condition and there is some other parts. So for example if the category you start with is actually already created Then you can simply take for these numbers all to be zero. So you can do this, and such a system of renormalized matrices have been constructed by the Korean Japanese school, so by Kashiwara, Kang or and Kim. Uh wasn't was constructed for the quantum affine algebra, was constructed for Kovanoflada Couquier algebras. Kovanofloda Rookier, the pass, and by forties ago, so by forties coherent static category. But so these are basically the only instances where they have been constructed. Myself, I try to make it yet in another geometrical setting called singularity category and matrix factorizations. But I will not explain this. I simply want to finish with some take last piece of motivation of why do you want categories between the system? It's a system which, of course, is not trivial, so they are not simply all zeros, it is not upgraded. So, the motivation is twofold. So, our first one is really a very basic one. It's simply usually if you have a monologue. Usually, if you have a model category, you want to understand fusion. So, you want, if you take the tensor product of two objects, so in your category, you would like to decompose it into symphonies, into your symphonies. So the coefficients at the highs are usually called fusion constants, and you would like to understand them. This is quite a hopeless question in general. But there is an instance. But there is an instance where you can actually get report diffusion groups. And what is a case where you can get control is that if by coincidence the k0, so in case of modules, this usually also called the representation ring, if this hotening ring has a very extra structure. So if this is a so-called cluster algebra, then you get And you get control on the constant. So I will not explain what is a cursor algebra, except that it is something combinatorial. So this is a procedure that takes as an input some graph, also called sometimes a quiver, without loops, without two cycles. And out of this graph, it And out of this graph, it makes out of you it gives you an algebra defined comple completely combinatorial. So this procedure comes together with some combinatorial rule called mutation and some very specific set of generators. And suppose that you would be able to prove that your rote and decline has such a structure, but not simply it has, it's isomorphic as an algebra to this, that is isomorphic with such an algebra that preserves the commitment. Morphic with a character that preserves a combinatorics. This would mean that these combinatorics would be lifted to the monolith category. If you can do this, then you can get control on the fusion. So that's one motivation for people who like simply, let's say, this type of fusion. And a second motivation, which is for myself, since that I like staring at a lot of different objects, is that this cluster algebra arise really, honestly, in a lot of Really, honestly, in a lot of topics. So, if you get your favorite monol category, prove that a K0 has such a structure, and very probably you get indications of potential connections with other type of categories that you would not have expected. So, it provides you also a guideline in a second step. So, this is my motivation for such things. And so, now my question to all of you is: by coincidence, you ever saw one of the settings you were working on, maybe some categories that are monolithic. Maybe some categories that are monomedal, but yet not created, but kind of close in this type of term. Yes, but I find things that the same case that the representation is more or less the same for Q or UV as in the So if I take in Q a root of unity, how would you? I know if Q is not a root of unity, is that the representation still sort of the same as in the classical cutscene algebra? So then so actually if you take the representation of this this T, so this casmoody has this one-dimensional center, yes. This one-dimensional center, yes. This center acts as a scalar. So, if this color is the level, and if the level is non-zero, yes. But then it is really simply semi-simple representations of this monologue. So, it is only if this colour is zero, actually. Because if the scalar is non-zero, you have this thing of cardane and yeah, okay, because then that's probably just because you know, in the cuts music, of course, if you cancel two cardinals, then you get some huge multiplicities, they say. And so, I guess. So I guess in this case we don't have this. Yes, so that is a very big point: is that actually already to have a category with all these, somehow if you start the tensor, these multi pieces will tend to be small. It will happen regularly, the tensor products are simple, simple, for example. But this is definitely something that doesn't happen in the most classical. But so I'm really also not stating that T should be the definition of a generically branded category for solar. Of a generically branded category for the work. It's simply a kind of potential way of looking at it. This is the definition that occurred in this work that you have done. So, on this board, so this one could say that a category is generically braided if it has a system of three normalized matrices. It's already in the literature, right? So, the thing is that this definition is in the literature. It was only constructed to actually get closer mass. The thing is that Get closer algebra. The thing is that if you actually are able to find these things, you can make what I call monodal categorical. And so I said that this differentiation is very much suited for this. You fix in all these examples from Nietzsche, let's say, and the K-L algebra. But I am not stating that T should be a generic liberated category because I think it's not it's too specific, maybe focus on that. But the measure the message is The message is you should have a mid-grading and a measurement for isomorphism. And this measurement should satisfy some natural properties like this type of things. So maybe it is simply the right definition that Cotes and Williams gave, but we are not thinking in terms of genetic wiggles. Do you category matrix factorizations typically categorized by cluster algorithms? Answer is no. Answer is no. But inside it, certain categories associated to it, you could. And yeah, so a certain subcategory generated by a certain type of object in the right quantum spectralizations, I expect. So you can make a certain type of renormalized instances. So in in the uh quantum mapping case, so if you take a note a uh object an object M and the configuration. So if you take M and M, then they are notics of this configuration. M den itself. M itself, M density M. So can you say that? So you can have exam you can have one of the categories for DC for shortness. You can have one of the categories where this for sure doesn't exist. Yeah, so this could happen, but in this setting, the condition of invariance makes such that they should exist. If you start with a model category and you try to define some invariance associated with your big grading, it will imply that at least you need m t2, m t m you always have operative computations. Yeah, so you still have gradient. Very quick. So usually this is an infinite sum, right? On the right-hand side, or is this on the first line and the one? Yeah, so TG theory could happen for arbitrary categories. So I have not been fully precise here, but so you could have... So for example, in examples that I have given, still that these are finite stops. So yeah, so the composition series are actually finite and that the coefficients somehow come down from the composition factors. A couple of quick announcements. So we resume at 1:30. We're going to do a problem session.
