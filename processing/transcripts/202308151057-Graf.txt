Wonderful. I'm just going to give a short intro on stationary and static, then turn it over to Melanie for the real meat of what's going on. So I just want to remind everyone of what the general physical, classical space-time meaning for all this is. So killing Killing vector field K on a just any semi Manian manifold M that just means the action, the flow of K is via isometries of the magnetic. via isometries of the metric. And if it M is stationary complete, well, M is stationary Brent's waterfall now. So space-time stationary, let's care for that a few if there exists a time-like killing. Killing the field. Often if part of the space-time has a, if the whole space-time has a killing field which is time-like in the asymptotic flat region, sometimes that's also called stationary. But I will be using stationary to mean the killing field is everywhere time-like. And so So stationary complete my own terminology that means that the flow of K is defined on the entire real line minus infinity. And in that case We have H. Since over Q by Q, I mean M mod the action of R as a V group of isometries. There's a quotient of the X in this sense. Q and the And the killing orbits in M correspond to points in the base space Q. So that's a really nice situation. We say that M is static if the perpendicular space to K is integrable. So that. So that K you have an actual hypersurface that is the everywhere perpendicular to K. Standards, and so then locally this implies that you can write the metric G as minus the length of k squared. The length k squared, t squared, plus pi upper star h, where h is a minion metric on Q and then standard static set that globalizes. And this is R cross Q and global T s minus 9 K squared T squared squared star H. L me. Oh, example. Example. Famous example Exterior Exterior Schwartz shield spherically symmetric symmetric vacuum black hole at least by exterior that means outside and ventriloquist. Yeah, thanks for the introduction to static and stationary space-times. So the next part will be Lorentzian length spaces, and then we are going to talk a little bit about how we intend to put those two concepts together. How we intend to put those two concepts together. Any questions? Yes, please. Okay. I do have a question. Yes, okay. Do you have a good reference for this that you have presented for us? Hawking and Ellis has that, so yeah, that then the classic. I mean, I'm not sure Hawking and Ellis is the standard. But it's the standard GR textbook that's more from a mathematical perspective. I'm not sure how much O'Neill does at all. How much O'Neill does about static institutional respect? I mean, for sure that's like a bunch of stuff. Yeah, O'Neill has a bunch of that too. That's why I like to teach different geometry out of O'Neill. Semi-Riemannian. Yeah, I'll talk about it. I forgot the title of Hawking and Minutes. Focus structure of space-time. Yes, of course. We're not going to tell them what we're talking about. I mean, these fellows are hyphens. I don't use hyphens anymore. So, Lorentzian Black Spaces, and that is a bit newer. I can put on the reference by the way, there's a paper by Kunzinger. And same on I think 2018 when we first introduced this concept, same title as Lemets and Lex Basis. And the idea behind this entire concept was to try and generalize things that, so in the let's take a step back, in the Riemannian setting, once you have your Riemannian manifold. Manifold just for motivation. In your Liemannian setting, of course, we all know if we have a Li Mannian manifold MG, then that's the stasis notation, called it QH. In the Demandian setting, if you have a Domenian manifold, then of course we get an. Manifold, and of course, we get a metric space with the induced metric from the Riemannian metric. And it's going to be very annoying. I will say metrics several times, meaning different things. I hopefully will clarify every time. Yes, in the Riemannian setting, one has this. And the nice thing is that. And the nice thing is that a lot of geometry constructions that one can do in a smooth manifold setting, one can also do in the metric space setting if one gives the metric space some additional structure, but not necessarily a manifold structure. So for example, one could ask for the um dH to be the the same as the distance that would be introduced by the variational length of carves. The variational length of curves. And then this thing is a length space. And I guess one doesn't even necessarily need a length space for that. But one of the important bits is that even in metric spaces, one can characterize curvature bounds. And for sectional curvature bounds, this is done by a triangle comparison. Well, can define curvature bounds in these metric spaces, I think. So can triangle comparison. Well, this would correspond to sectional coverages. Or if you add a Or if you add a measure so all of this is plus certain properties, I'm not going to list all of them. You do need more than just a plain vector space. That would be a little bit too bad. But if we add a measure, then we can do things like study convexity properties. Study convexity properties of certain entropy functionals. I'm not sure this has much to do with physical. I never really looked into it. And this would be the two colour chart. So the keyword for this characterization we are trying to compiles is in the smooth case component of CRM. And the idea is we look at the triangle form by minimizing segments in our metric space. In our metric space, and we construct a triangle in a constant curvature space with same side lengths so always geodesic kind of south side. We construct our comparison triangle and then we can ask what happens if from this point we can now look at the length of a curve to a midpoint here, but not necessarily a midpoint, just a point of this section. And then we have the corresponding P here and we have the corresponding X bar here. X bar here with the same distance to the end point. So that's how we find the corresponding point of the opposite sideline. And then you can characterize sectional curvature bounds by comparing the distance of P and X and asking whether this is less or greater than. Or data of the X bar in the model space Q bar. And if you have this for all triangles, then you can say that your metric space satisfies these curvature bounds, and the curvature is then bounded by the constant curvature of this. By the constant coverage of this Q-bar space. And I would have to think about how the sphere works, but distances on the sphere are larger than distances in the European space. So if the distance is larger, then the curvature is larger than the curvature in the Brown space. And yeah, this was a lot of motivation. But then the idea that people came up with was People came up with was to try and do something similar in a Lorentzian setting, and this has been a bit difficult because one needed to identify what the proper structure on this side should be, because we are not going to get an actual metric space, of course, because our Lorentzian distance is not positive definite. And what do I do? I kind of would like to keep the standard static at the action, but we have gotten take it off. So, in the Lorentzian setting, we will replace our space time. With the following object, and we now have much more data. So we need first of all this base, and I should probably call this M again simply call MSWAP metric, some relations, and a time separation function. So this is just the metric. This is just the metrics basically. And the idea behind this is that lots of results in Lorentzian geometry use as a tool in the background an unphysical sort of Riemannian background metric, and this is essentially where this debar comes for. And then these things all capture the Lorentzian structure. And of course, these causality relations have been studied a long time ago. These causal spaces go back to us. These causal spaces go back to us in contending panels. But the important bit is that we really need to have the time separation for tau. Okay, and what do they have to do? So the idea, of course, is that this would be there exists a causal curl. If we come from the smooth space-time and this would be like P less Q, if we wanted it to exist as a part of the power, P to Q, and so on. Less, less would be the time-like curve, and then tau would be the sublimal over the length of gamma. Is such a cause and future dielectric curve from Q and of correspondence to have two arguments. So this is the idea where this comes from. What is the definition? The definition is relatively complicated, which is unfortunate. There is an easy part of the definition, and that's then actually a Lorentzian pre-length space, because for an actual Lorentzian length space, we need some. Length space, we need some like, or we need that this has nicer properties locally than it might have globally among other things. So, uh, space is a two pair of. I took birth on epa less less less less less equal less less tau such that okay first um mdvar is a metric space and I don't necessarily um this is gonna This is going to take a while to write down. Then, what do we need of our relations? Less equal should be transitive and reflexive. Less, less also has to be transitive and we need that. and we need that P less less Q implies P less equal Q. So we need some compatibility condition for all points in our M. And then the last thing concerns the time separation function is these kind of a lot of properties that model that this time separation function is supposed to come exactly from sort of this construction in the Lorentzian case. This construct with the Lorentzian case. So we just need to bake this in sort of by hand. 0 infinity. Yes, and I should say our convention is that if they do not exist any causal terms, then they set it to 0. Some people like minus infinity. It is possible with many things. So, A, it should be lower semi-continuous. B, and I really want to fit this on this blackboard. If P is not causally related to Q, then tau should be zero. And see if tau pq is greater than zero. This should happen if and only if p is less than q. And the very last one, which I sometimes forget, tau should satisfy the reverse financial equality. And then that's a Lorenzian relax basically. One thing that I always like to point out is this part here, because that encodes that we have sort of a push up thing. So we are used to from lines and geometry and also making a lot of sense physically. Making a lot of sense physically, if we have p less equal q less less r r, then this also implies that q is less less than r. So if we can find a cause and then a time length curve, we have a time-like curve. And this is encoded in this upward essentially. This also, for example, then guarantees us that I plus of a point will be open. Maybe all some other mice topological things already. Um yeah, and then a log at the blank space, and that's all what we want to check it on. Ah, okay, so we have plenty of time left. is a Lorentzian prelimin space and P L S, what is L S plus some additional properties and this gets very technical very quickly. So we want something called localizability. And probably I should have skipped all these, but I have it in my notes. So I will say a quick word to each of them. Localizability is essentially a replacement for the existence of nice complex neighborhoods. So if around any point we can find a neighborhood such that tau restricted to Such that tau is linked to the neighborhood and the causal relations that is linked to that neighborhood are nicer than what a priori expect. Localizability, what else? Causally path connected. Okay, this one is almost self-explanatory. It means any. between any p less equal q there exists a causal curve from p to q so i'm not i don't have some weird disconnected bits hanging around um causally half connected and locally causally closed um again this is another one of these locally we have nicer properties so um if Properties. So if you restrict to a small enough neighborhood, then the less equal relation will be a closed relation. And the next and the last one, if we define a portal of P and Q as the sublimum over the length. Supremum over the length of gamma, where gamma is the causal curve, where future directed causal is defined as gamma of t is less equal than gamma of s for all t less equal s. And the length is then the The supremum over the sum of the tau separations of gamma of t i 1 of t i plus 1 plus 1. Can n the t i some efficient. Okay, so we can define a tor tilde and then we need the tor tilde just gives us back all original tor. This corresponds to in the Riemannian setting if one defines a length space as the infimum or the length of curves gives back the distance function we had previously. Okay, so those are sort of the basic objects and one can then add all the other, one can then add all the things that one requires for Lorentzian manifolds also there. So there are notions of global hyperbolicity, strong causality. Basically all the causality theory stuff works very nicely. Also curvature bounds work and people have been looking at adding measures to these and things. At adding measures to these and then installing richie coverage about and everything else. Maybe I can mention the plastic function because this is also one of the paths that we maybe want to do in a later project for the static variants and length spaces to be. We can define so in actually this only in its pre-line spaces, but we Only in its three length spaces, but we can define curvature bounds, time-like sectional curvature bounds. Fire again a time and comparison like uh explained a bit in the remaining something. I guess time like So I guess time like time. Fun fact, and at some point I want to talk to you about this. This goes back to work by Stacey, where she showed that time-like sectional curvature bounds in a Lorentzian manifold imply. Manifold imply time-like triangle comparison. And there's also work by Alexander and Bishop where they show that if they have sectional curvature bounds for all the sectional curvatures, so not only for the time-like planes, but for all planes, then they get triangle comparison for all triangles. And Alexander and Bishop have an equivalence. So they show if you have this comparison for all triangles, you get sectional curvature bots for all this. Sectional curvature bots for all the sectional curvature bots. I am still not aware whether there is any way to just go from time-like triangle comparison to time-like sectional curvatures. I'm not sure if I've done that or looked at it yet. But I think that would be a thing to do to fully justify this definition in the synthetic setting. Because, of course, the thing is in the synthetic setting, we can't really say what. Setting, we can't really say what the side lengths of triangles are if the sides are not time-like. Because we know the length for timeline curves because we have this tall time separation, but for things that are not time-like are caused in this flexible. Yeah, then this was the brief intro to Lorentz and length spaces. Um maybe I can mention a bit and I'm not going to write all of this down. Going to write all of this down. That's a downside of doing a blackboard talk on a slide. You can make one slide with the names of all the people that have done all the interesting stuff in this Lorentzian length space setting. But I should mention some names if I can. So Cavalletti Mondino put measures on such Lorentzian length spaces of define Ricci coverature bounds, and they then also show the synthetic Hawking singularity theorem, for example, which is pretty nice. Is pretty nice. Yeah, then people have looked at inextendability of space-times as Lorentzian length spaces. So, given some space-time, maybe we can't embed it into a larger space-time, but maybe we could embed it in something larger that then only has this Lorentzian length space structure. So, there are some results out there, for example, that if the I mean semi-unsurprising, but if the original space-time is geodesically complete, then you can't embed anything in an algorithm. Then you can't embed in any product in the next space without violating curvature bounds. You can always add real things because you don't really have any dimensional restriction or something. You can just add like a line going through one point that only intersects in this one point and not at this joint. Yeah, what else do we have? We do have a splitting theorem for these Lorentzian length spaces, which is pretty nice. I mean, it's a splitting theorem. Which is pretty nice. I mean, it's a splitting theorem using sectional curvature bonds and not rigid curvature bonds, so it's less strong than the neutral splitting theorems that one might expect from. Say in Riemannian metric geometry, of course, there's Giga-Coding splitting, which tells me that the metric space splits if you have a rigid curvature bound and a line. But this all goes too far. Anything else I really wanted to mention? Yeah. Ah, yes, but I'm gonna get to that in a second. Yeah, I think those are the main things. People are working on getting things like what does it mean for two Lorentzian length spaces to be close to one another. People are trying to find ways to deal with null geometry in this setting, because somehow it's very adapted to dealing with time-like settings and less adapted to dealing with null stuff. Yeah, I think those are the main things. And there is a lot more, so if you have any favorite site you want to know whether there's an analog in this setting, we can talk about it after. I'm sure I forgot to pick the tongue of tongue of folks. And so now I'm going to call back to Stacy's brief production for static and stationary space-times, because now really the question of our group is sort of how to To generalize concepts of staticity slash stationarity to MS setting. And if you remember Stacey, she had like several criteria that we are all mostly equivalent in the definition. So you either had the Killing vector field, that is probably hard to generalize because what is a vector field. Then there was the group action, which Action which acts via isometries, that seems more reasonable because we can impose, we can demand that this Lorentzian freelancer space has some sort of real action which leaves the tau invariant and which leaves the relations invariant, and then hopefully gets something out of that. And then the other thing, and this is probably for a starting point, the easiest, but also Would be to just start from the standard static form and then generalize standard static first. So we are kind of split into a big group, so we have been splitting ourselves and looking at two approaches simultaneously, namely first, and I will talk a bit more about that and then about the second. Stacy will tell you a little bit more again. Well again what the define standard standard and define and study of course because we would like to see what coverage these spaces have etc. Define and study standard standard L S by essentially using By essentially using a block product construction of some like minus n of x squared dt square plus um e. There now um we have Then now we have x, so space m would be some integral, I think we call it j at some point i cross some metric space xd. So we replace the Riemannian part in the standard static splitting by a metric space. And then we want to construct time separations functions and relations on this product that This product that looks like what we would get if we had a smooth form product metric of this form. The idea, and the other is our via existence of action because so important these And of course, the eventual hope is, and which is also kind of why we are still one group, both of these approaches will hopefully likely have some similarities in what tools we need to define things and do things. And of course, eventually we would like to have a We would like to have some characterization or stationary complete via this. And then we would like something that's analogous to in the smooth case where one can characterize, of course, one should imply two. One should imply two, and under some additional conditions, two should imply one. Yeah, somehow that's that's the plan, and I will be And I will be very quickly give you a little bit more detail on one. So one goes back to there's a paper by Daphne Alexander, Clemens Seman and Mike Kunzinger and myself on doing sort of this work product construction idea for FLRW work. Idea for FLRW products. So we know that how to do How to do um F L W where we also have on the pure metric space structure and topology structure we also just have an I cross metric space but then the time separations function and relations would be modeled after minus dt squared plus some f of dt squared. So we would have the warping function. We switch the base and the fiber essentially. F another w to standard static the other way around. Of course this means we have to in the standard static case unfortunately we don't have as nice of a character. Have as nice of a characterization as geodesics of locally maximizing curves anymore. In this FLRW product, if we have a geodesic in the space-time, then we know that the projection onto the spatial part must also be a geodesic. That's not true in the standard static splitting. However, if one introduces a modified distance here or a modified dimensional metric in a smooth case, then In a smooth case, then for night geodesics, one recovers something similar, and that should allow us to get enough structure. But yeah, maybe just what we've been working on. So we know how to define our causal relations and our tau. The main thing that we still need to get the Lorentzian predecessor spaces to fully characterise this trigger positive if and only if they are time like related. And only their time-like related. But they should follow from this nice description of geodesics. So I'm not sure if I should say it a little bit. So how to define how to use this talk. And actually, it is very similar because we are so close. Very similar because we are so close to smooth space-time geometry, it's very similar to how one does it in smooth spacetime. So, actually, we start by with causal curves. So, if we have a curve gamma from some integral j to i cos x, then of course this has components this component gamma t from j2i and gamma x from j2x. And then what we can say is if we demand this that gamma be absolutely continuous then Then that says gamma t dot almost F there and gamma t dot is the problem and it's a net one and there also exists something which we know from vx for now from j to l. 0 infinity, also in L1. And this would be the metric derivative of gamma x. So we would have Vx of some S being defined as the limit H going to 0, the distance of gamma x of S plus H. of S plus H to gamma X of S divided by H. So we don't have a tangent vector, but we do have a tangent velocity almost everywhere. And then we can just say, well, this curve is causal future diagram. future directed if gamma dot t is positive almost everywhere where it's defined and if we plug it in into our metric we get something negative. So um n squared of gamma x of s times uh gamma dot. uh gamma plot t of s squared is greater equal than um x s. And once we have our causal curves we define the relations as in the usual setting and then we can part with it. So yeah we are really the thing is our group kind of took a hiatus during Hiatus during all of COVID and between the workshops. So, we only really started work at the start of this summer. So, we are still in the early stages. But I think this approach should work out very nicely to give us more and more next basis and to also allow us to characterize, hopefully, curvature bounds for the timeline sectional curvatures via properties of this warping function n and curvature bounds. Function n and curvature bounds of this metric space Xt. Also, in the Riemannian setting, what products of all types with metric spaces have been studied. So there's lots of Riemannian things out there that we can also look for. What's inspiration? And yes, I think that's that. And then Stacy can tell us a little bit more about point two, which is super exciting. Super exciting. So, before we start, I just wanted to ask questions. Is it yes, anyone have questions? Oh, well, let me share the folder up.
