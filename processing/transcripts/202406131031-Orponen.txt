But quick recap what you have to remember. Yesterday, not very much. So what you have to remember is what is the delta S. So we have a small number delta, scale parameter, and then we have a dimension parameter S. And then we say that the subset of the metric space, any metric space X D, is a delta S set if it's delta separated and satisfies this sort of non-concentration condition on other walls for R bigger than delta. After some motivation, I posed the question that if you have a delta set of lines and a delta set of points, well, maybe a delta t set of points, then how many delta incidences can there be between those points and those lines? And a full answer to this question was given by Yuji Fu and people pronunciation, sorry, Yujiu Fu and Kimmy Gren in 21. And here I only state. And here I've only stated one special case of the result, which I hope to cover today. So, this is not the full result, this is just a part of it. So, in this result, or this part of the result, you have two parameters, alpha, beta, these are the dimensions, and then their sum has to be at most three. Then you would have a delta alpha set of points and a delta beta set of lines, and then the number of incidences between them, the delta incidences, bounded by the square root of delta minus 1. Square root of delta minus 1 times b times up. So I'll get back to this theorem later. Then, before we get to the theorem, I want to rediscuss a bit this train tracks counter example, because this shows the sharpness of this result. So, let me recap the train tracks counter example, or train tracks example. So, this is a delta 1 set. It consists of delta minus 1 ball. It consists of delta minus one balls, which are combined like these train tracks. And in each track, there is delta minus one ball, minus half floors, and the number of tracks is delta minus half as well. And as pointed out yesterday, by Brod, the separation is also crucial, so the separation between the tracks is quite the square root of delta. That makes sure that the set actually satisfies the non-concentration condition. Concentration copieship. Okay, so that was just a reminder. I will get back to this example in just a moment. Just the last thing, which was discussed yesterday, was the connection between the incidence theorem for delta alpha sets and delta beta sets and the first inverted problem. And there was this somewhat technical proposition which said that if you have any incident part of this sort, Getting incident bound of this sort, then you can actually recover a lower bond for the dimension first embroider sets by this sort of incident border. And I just will not do the calculations. I just mentioned that what can you get as a corollary of this proposition and this theorem that we are going to prove today. The corollary will be that every s the first and first set With t larger than 2 by s as also dimension. At least as possible. And it is a bit curious, and I'm not sure if I have time to explain today, but it's a bit curious, that this seems to be the only But this seems to be the only sharp result on first abroad sets you can derive even from the sharp sharp result on the incidences. There is a reason for that, and I can let's see if I have time to explain. Okay, so that was a recap of participating. Any questions about that? So now I would like to look more closely at this theorem and let's discuss first why it is. And let's discuss first why it is sharp, at least in some cases. So too many parameters, this alpha and beta. I just want to concentrate in the case when alpha and beta are one. So consider alpha beta equal to one. So now we're asking for incidences between a delta one set of points and a delta one set of lines. And now this result predicts the result predicts. The result predicts that the number of incidences in that case is counted from above by, well, here, delta power minus 3 over 2. That's the square root of delta minus 1 times 3 times delta. It's at most delta minus 3 over 2. And now I'm claiming to you that the train tracks example, coupled with a suitable set of lines, maximizes. Lines maximizes that inequality. So here is the set of points that also divisible, those are the train tracks. But what are the set of lines which maximize the inequality? I draw lines through every one of these columns. Right there. And then I draw these lines. So the set of lines, if you like a bit vague expression, it's a bit like a dual train track. So that's my set of lines. In every one of these bushies, there are again delta minus half lines. And of course, the number of bushies is the same as the number of tracks. So they're also delta minus half of the bushies. So all in all, yeah. There we go. I'll just make a corner here. Lines are they actually form a delta one set with maximum party maps, so delta equal to delta one as well. Okay, so of course that requires a bit of checking, but the separation is really good enough for them to be a delta one set. Moreover, the number of delta incidents is now easy to compute because the key point is here is that if the angle of this bush, that's something maybe I should have emphasized even earlier, so the angle of the bush is really like delta half. And since the angle is so narrow, it is actually possible that all the lines in a single bush meet all of the balls in a single track. So every line has delta minus half the incidences. Every line has delta minus half the incidences, and that's why the total number of incidences is just the number of lines times delta minus half. That gives delta 1 to 3 over 1. So, just to remark here that we saw maybe at the first lecture already, or at the beginning of the second lecture, that every squared of the alpha Every square root of delta separated set is also a delta one set. That's something we computed as the first example. And then we had for the square root of the alpha separated sets we had a very good incidence inequality, the seminar-trollery incidence inequality. And that inequality would predict, sorry. What do I want to say? I want to say that if P and L were square root of delta separated, you would actually get the better part here. So if P and L were square root of delta separated by what we have shown, we could By what we have shown, we could improve this boundary to the form like this one, which is actually like delta minus 4 over 3. So, what this says is that even though square root of delta separated sets are delta 1 sets, but sets are delta one sets, but you don't have equally, you don't have an equally good incidence theorem for delta one sets than we could prove for square root of delta separated sets. Okay, so I'll soon head to the towards the proof of this here. Still one more remark. Of course now you can start asking Of course, now you can start asking a bit more advanced questions. For example, now we know that for squared of delta separated sets, you have a better incidence inequality than for delta one sets. But could it be that if you only assume that one of the sets is squared of delta separated and the other one is just delta separated, or maybe a delta one set, would you then prove this inequality? And this is true. This is true. I mentioned this here. So, this is a very special case of a theorem of both solven and one. In a special case, it's from maybe 29 year. I'm not sure if this is the, I don't think it's the publication year. But if. P is square root of delta separated, and we also assume that P is maximum property delta minus one. Then this is best done. For all delta separate delta. I hope this is direct valid. So their formula formulation was slightly slightly different, but I hope this is equal to to their theorem. This is actually right to the theorem. But it's enough to assume that just one of the centers squared of delta is separated, as long as it has all kinds. So that's one sort of more advanced result. And this theorem used for the first time a method called the High Law method high law method in delta discretized incidence geometry, and this has become a very powerful method in these problems. And there was simply no time on this lecture series on the High Law method. Time on this lecture series on the Heidel method. If you want to pursue studies further on these topics, then you have to learn about the Highland method. It's very, very important. Okay. Final remark. This train tracks example, which I now have discussed at Nausia here, is showing that this inequality is sharp for delta one sets of lines and delta one sets of points. One could ask a sort of corniverse question: that what if you have any delta one set of lines, any delta one set of points maximizing this inequality, then how much does it resemble the train tracks? And in fact, we showed with my PhD student, Mark Tsengy, that the answer is that it has to resemble very much the train tracks. So I won't write anything down, it's a bit complicated to write down, but basically you can rotate the tracks and you. You can rotate the tracks and you can move the tracks, but you will always have to have that many of these bushes. So that's how all the extra mercies to this inequality for delta one sets have to look like. We have this number of bushies, which you allow to rotate and translate, but they will have to be the bushies. Alright, so then I think I will start moving towards the main topic of today's lecture. The main topic of today's lecture, namely proving this inequality. I think in general, the question of finding the extreme of configurations to separate structure is like a big open question. It's like a big open question, and this was a very, very, very easy question related to this big open question. But if you are interested in very hard research questions in this area, then try to classify X-grammers in several incidents. Okay, so let's start the proof of this theorem. Some tools. So, originally also Yu Chi Fu and Kevin Ren proved this using the Heiball method, but I'm going to show you an argument which uses the X-ray transform. So, and so if f is maybe a Schwarz function, well, it's just a continuous and complex function. I define the X-ray transform. of f by the formula x f. And then x-ray transformation is the function given on the space of lines. So this is defined on the space of lines by integrating f over the line j1. So there are a couple So, there are a couple of classical things which I will need about the X-ray transform. Actually, just one. It's the fact that it's a half-order Sobolev smoke opposition. This I'm not even sure who this is due to this, like, really, really, really classical information about X-ray transfer. I'll just write the inequality here. I will also define the sub-olar space, which is not happy in a moment. So the inequality says that if you're looking at the fractional sub-olar draw of x of f, and this is bounded by the fractional sub-boarder norm of f, but in this way. But you get half. In this way, but you get half orders moving in the L2 function of the L2 subordinate space. And at least I know this to be true for this range. In fact, the way I know how to prove this, you would also have to localize here. You would have to multiply this by a local kind of function. I'll not try to. So, what are these? So what are these fractional so-called norms that we write as here? So this is the homogeneous fractional order suball norm space L2. This is by definition. So that is the so we take the Fourier transform of f square it multiplied by psi to the power 2x and we squared over r2 that's the thing on the right hand side. The thing on the left hand side, this is a function living on the space of lines. So defining the fraction of Sobola space in the space of lines requires a bit of identification. We have to identify the space of lines we are Have to identify the space of lines required to make really sense of this. Uh I won't go there, because I don't really need this for anything. But uh this is basically the same thing as here, except after the identification of lines with R. So very simple thing inequality regarding polar terms. That's another tool. This is just saying that if you have two functions which are nice enough, then this is partly from abolished by the fractional subordinate norms with the reverse asymptotoxones. Often saying that the positive and negative relatives of all spaces are dual to each other, but I don't need anything so difficult, I just need this inequality here, which is basically Cauchy's quartz. Use Pluncture L, you put Fourier transform here and here, use Cauchy Schwartz with the right X by also introducing the factor and you get exactly that. So and still more tools. And still more tools. So these fractional or disabled spaces in fractal geometry are useful because they are connected to energies of measures. So if you have a radar measure of R2, then the so-called s-dimensional The so-called s-dimensional Ri's energy, S-dimensional Ries energy of mu, which is by definition this double integral. So, this is the definition: d mu x, d mu y. So the other is an R D at the same time. Why not? So other measured R D. So then the S dimensional piece energy, defined it this way, can be characterized or it is equivalent, it is equal up to a constant. Equivalent, which is equal up to a constant to a certain fractional subordinate of the measure. So this can be written as integral of u hat psi, I think this formula will be mentioned in John's lecture at least, psi to the power s minus b each psi. And this is true for all s strictly between 0 and d but then you have But then you have a negative exponent here, and this is the negative order fraction of the s minus p over 2. That would be very useful. Okay, any questions about the about this tool so far? So later we can get So next room we can get computing, but actually there is one final tool. So here I'm being a little bit inaccurate. Of course here I'm talking about solar norms of measures. I only define them for continuous functions. No, actually I did it for. So I went for there. Anyway, all of these will only be needed in the special case when you have continuous functions with compact support. So the definitions are. By the way, this is a little bit technical. So, how to relate these energies and supplement norms to these delta sets? So, that's explained by this proposition. So that's explained by this proposition. So let V subset now, in this case, just V2 delta S let's consider the measure mu which is uh just counting measure counting measure restricted to P, but normalized in this way. But normalized in these ways. This is a reasonable normalization for delta S countermeasure on P normalized by delta power S then the S-dimensional Ri's energy of mu that would be infinity because S-dimensional Ri's energy looks at all all scales and it would look at all scales down to zero that would just be infinity. That would just be in the but I on the wall I look at the modification modification of measures in delta here mu of delta is mu convolved with some standard approximate identity pi pi delta and now I can bound this convolved by double beagle delta s pip and here the double double beagle And here, the double recall here, and maybe already earlier somewhere, there's also a double recall here, they will find logarithmic constants, like log one over double. I think this is a, once you know it, it's a very straightforward computation, just using that using the definition of the resener. So I'll skip it. Alright, so those are all the tools I'll need to overcome. Now I'm out of Blackboard. Group of share out of Blackboard. So also I think I'll try to squeeze this with the upper line and there's not moving. By the way, I would like to mention at this point that the idea of using X-ray transforms in incidence geometry is really not a new idea, so I at least know of a paper by Kristal and Alex Josevich and I can't pronounce his name, but uh they have been actually probably for decades, or at least for many years, since this idea has been used, although maybe exactly not to this theorem, but uh using X-ray transforms and ISKS. Using X-ray transports and ECS promises. So let's make uh these two exponents, S T zero two and we have the restriction that S plus T has to be less than this. And then let's also fix the sets that we want to consider. So let's fix P V1 a delta S set. So now I'm back to the S and T notation instead of alpha, the alpha beta notation. So we have a delta S set and we have a delta T set. So as I mentioned on the So, as I mentioned on the maybe the second lecture, on the first lecture, increasing s and t is fine. These sets will also remain delta s prime sets and delta t prime sets if I increase s to s prime or t to t prime. So, because I have this upper bound that s plus t is atmos 3, I can just increase the exponents until I have exactly s plus t is equal to 3. So, that's why I just replace here s plus t is equal to 3. I just replace here s plus t is equal to three. Suffices to prove the special case. Then I define the measures. So these measures are inspired by this proposition. I define mu equal to delta s, half stock measure restricted to e, counting measure restricted to e, and mu equal to And u would be equal to delta t h zero rest u dl. So that's a measure of the set of lines, and that's a measure of the set of points. So, maybe I should have still mentioned, just in case somebody pays really, really a lot of attention, since the sum is three, we may assume that one of them is bigger than one. So let's also add here the assumption that t is bigger than one. T is bigger than one. That would be some implicit news somewhere if you've done that in the calculation. Alright, so those are the definitions. Now we can start to express the incidences in terms of these measures. So look at the number of incidences between P and L and the upper bound is. Well, first we just write an equation. This is in with the notation of these measures, this is precise. With the notation of these measures, this is precisely the same as delta minus s minus p double integral of the indicator of the delta q p d s d u d nu l. Just the number of incidents is a set of pairs. I can write this in terms of these indicator functions and these measures. Functions and these measures. I want to make my measures small functions for practical matters. So I want to put there a little delta down here. So I just put it there, maybe. And then this remains true up to a meaning body. So the morale being that if you just fatten fatten out the measure by a factor of delta, then this doesn't really have so much to do with the counting delta incidents. X-ray transport. Okay, so now maybe the crucial observation is that actually the thing inside here is very much very closely related to the. It's very much, very closely related to the X-ray transform. So for L in just, I guess, A21 fixed in my integral where I'm looking at the indicator of the cube, delta tube around L, and I'm counting d mu P. So here I have a delta tube, and I'm counting all the points. Delta cube, and I'm counting all the points, all the points of indexed by mu which happen to lie in the delta tube. I can actually count this from above by like this: delta times x-ray measure, x-ray transform of a suitable modification of mu demolitions. So, what is happening in this inequality is that I first thicken out mu a little bit. Thicken, thicken out mu a little bit. So then sort of the thickened mu already sees all of this Q. And then the X-ray transform of that measure, relative to this line bounce from above, all of these points which I was counting on the left-hand side, up to this factor, this is some sort of a Jacobian factor which pops off. All right. So now we have already managed. So now we have already managed to divide the number of incidences by a quantity which involves X-ray transfer. So I'll just plug it in there. So this is now bound by delta 1 minus S minus T, that's what you get the conduct of all of these delta vectors, integral of X du delta and then du also delta. So at this point, I have an expression which looks like this, so I'm tempted to use Hoshish works. I do. This is bounded from the top by, once again, the same factor which I cannot forget. Shouldn't forget times the X-ray transform of mu delta. But what which index, which index do I want to put? Which index, which index do I want to put here? So I have here complete freedom to put any r I want. And now I choose r to be one minus t over two. H dot one minus t over two here for the first factor, and for the second factor I have the s equal of that. So you jump up each dot t over two minus one. Alright, so what to do next? So now we still have X-ray transform here moving, so we have to get rid of it by using the half-order smoothing of the X-ray transform. So we bulk from this from pulp by delta 1 minus S minus T and then I have the longer X point by half, so I get U delta H dot and then one. And then uh one minus t over two like this. And here I just keep the same thing for a moment, t delta but it's not. Uh well I can write it in this way, maybe t minus two over t. Okay, so now we are very close to being finished. Because now we have already used the used the smoothing property of the x-ray transform. We have found these two measures on the right-hand side, and these measures were now associated with our delta s set of points and Our delta S set of points and delta T set of lines by this formula here. So, ah, okay, well, we still have to relate matters to the energy of the measures, but that's done by this formula here. So, this is comparable to delta. 1 minus s minus t of the suitable suitable release energy of mu delta. And this is, if I remember well, this is p minus t of mu delta. Of u delt buttons, and here I get I t of new delts just using this formula with the suitable suitable s. And finally, at this point, well, at this point, I have to have to use this inequality to prevent it. The one says minus P and then I have the square root here. Sorry, yeah, the square roots are missing still here because here this is the somewhat more. I probably forgot to write some squares on the right-hand side. So there should have been squares on the right-hand side, but here. Right-hand side, but here in my case, square volt axis. Because it's a I forgot about LP, LP squares. So that's where the squares come from. Alright, so now we are done, except that we have to remember, we have to remember that S plus T is equal to We have to remember that s plus d is equal to 3. This is exactly the same, hopefully, as f minus 1 e. Right. So we hop that the question about the value of t, is it t strictly greater than 1 or is strictly greater than 1. Strictly greater than one or greater than or equal to one? Because S could possibly be two. If you have a two-dimensional set. That is true. In fact, here I believe that that should be enough for it. So now I forget myself by rescuing that. Yeah, because then the H, the H1 minus 2 for G norm is still in a closed interval. What minus half you have? Right, okay. Yeah, okay, I guess that's where it has been muted. Although I'm not retrospective, I'm not exactly sure if that's necessary, that requirement, but at least the way you are. That requirement, but at least the way I which I know how to prove it, then I I use it first of all. But anyway, yeah, exactly. Pretty good. Okay. So maybe a few remarks about this inequality we just showed. So when is this any good? So this is of course not this is better than the This is better than the inequality which was true for all delta-separated sets. There we have this inequality. So this inequality is sharper than the easy one if and only exactly when the product of P and L exceeds delta minus 1. So if you have pretty small small sets P and L than any more. small sets P and L, then you might be better off using that the delta separated one. On the other hand, if you have smaller sets, then in this theorem of 4 and n, they are better inequalities. So they always always be the sharpest part of those two qualities. Alright. So now I think that's the only actual proof I want to do in this lecture. I will skip most of my remaining material. I will show one quick application of Württemberg's Let's Sam. First embark sets do some product, some product from the last ten minutes. So, these first effort sets, ever since they were invented, it was known that they have plenty of applications to other questions in fractal geometry. So, there was a very influential paper by NetKatz and Teritau in 2000, where they connected first empiric sets to the Faulkner distance set conjecture and something of the distance as suburban the Earth. And in the meanwhile, And in the meanwhile, new applications have been found. So it's also known that the first embers has cycles to connectivity projection problems. But instead of now surveying all of those things, I just focus on one connection, which is the sum product. Application to the thumb product problem. So this is a question by Anderson Seminary. Okay, here, if you have any subset of the You have any subset of the of the integers any norm you have the subset of integers is it true that either taking a sum or a product of A increases precisely and quite a lot in fact A so this So they conjecture, but this would be all the way up to this large or takes no bigger than zero, but constantly parameters. So I think they state is a question for subsets of the integers, but it is equally open and plausible for subsets of the reals. So you can also replace here the reals if you want. If you want. So now, the first improvement problem is connected to a continuum variant. Continuum variant of this question. That's what I want to talk about. At this point. So, in fact, this is also not very news. This is not very news. News, this is not fitting News, because there's an argument by Elekesh which connects the seminary Trotter theorem to the sample problem. And this Elekesh argument connecting seminary Trotter theorem to this question can also be turned into a continuous argument. I will show you this argument and what we get from the first inverse results. So Elena gets this argument. Okay, so let A subset of R any subset of the real time. Then, consider a set of R. Let also F be the set which is the product set in R2 of A plus A cross A dot. cross A dot A. I take both the sum and the product sets and then I take the Cartesian product of them. So then one can check, and this is Electric's beautiful observation, that the line set let's consider the line set first, let's consider the following lines. Well this looks a bit complicated now at first. So this is lines which are indexed by points of k. And they are lines of the form A1, LA1, LA2. And these, if I remember well, they are the following lines x A2x minus A1A2, so that x1 is in y. So that x1 cy So for every pair of points from A, I consider this specific line parameterized by x and with smoke a2 and I subtract a1 times a2. Okay, so then so here comes the crutch of the whole thing. This product set f when I integrate Product set if, when I intersect it with one of these lines, on change the set should I check the notes on change the set checkouts. P plus P one and P plus P times all that A C A. So that was actually similar to light, I thought. So when you fix these parameters A1 and A2, then this intersection, this intersection here, that would be L A1A2, contains such a set. And in particular, this set looks a lot like A. It's sort of an affine copy of A. So there's a, you just multiply the circumstope, and then you sort of find a copy of A. So find a copy of a path almost almost certain path. But what is the what do we get what can we learn from this fact? So I won't even prove it because it's just when you notice it it's it's just a computation. What we can learn from it is that if let's say that A is now a continuous certain like a fractal set of dimension S, then by the previous proposition, by the fraction proposition, F is an S to S was converged. Why is that so? Well, if we have just shown that if has a large intersection with many lines, if has a large intersection with every line from this family, this line family has dimension like A cross A. But you're looking at all possible pairs from a line star. So note that the dimension of the line family L as in electricity proposition, this line Proposition is by is exactly the same as the dimension of k cross k, which is at least 2s. On the other hand, we showed, or we observed, that every one of these lines has an s-dimensional intersection with s. So that's why it says 2, s, s2 s force to x. So therefore, we can use any available result on the first convert set problem and in parting vector solution. We can then use that the dimension of We can tell you that the dimension of this f, this first average has to be lower bounded by well, it's one of these bounds, it's in fact lower bounded by five raised over two and this rate. On the other hand, this is the same as the, and this is the Hallstorf dimension. So this is the Hallstorf dimension of a plus a cross a dot a and now Auschwitz dimension Hausdorff dimension and products don't work very well, but at least Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension work better. So you can deduce from this that the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of A plus A, or the mean constant dimension, or even the Packman dimension of A dot A has to be half of this guy. So this is the best that we can do using the first advertisement problem, at least at the moment, regarding that continuous, continuous sound product problem. I'm not entirely sure. I I guess it's possible as far as I know, as you believe I replace here five or two but just two. Of course, here you can also hold packing dimensions here and hold stock dimension here. But yeah, so today seems to have been a bit quicker than I had anticipated, so I think I'll just quit here and leave some time for questions. Okay, do we have questions first? Okay, do we have questions for our speaker? I'm really curious: do you have an intuition as to why the proof regarding the regularization with the X-ray transport for the Fu Ren Instance theorem and the Hilo method? Do you have any intuition as to why those both seem to work for the problem? Are there structural elements of them that are similar? Or what's going on that causes them both to work? In front of the peace audience, in Bodhisattva, Embarrassment, they're both based on fully elements. That's about my understanding of that. So, I don't know why they would otherwise be like the same form. Definitely, with the Heidel method, you can do many, many things, which you can't do as far as I know with the X-ray transform. But, in fact, the X-ray transform proof here gives an advantage. So, the X-ray transform proof allows you to give an endpoint, endpoint inequality here. So, in the Kleino method proof, So in the Kylo method proof, there's an inductional scales argument, which gives you eventually like a log factor, at least a delta motion factor, and that you can get rid of using the extra thread. So in that sense, for this problem, I would say, it's slightly sharper. So, first off, Elakesh's argument is one of my favorite arguments. Full stop. This is so beautiful. But so, I'm guessing other people. So, I'm guessing other people have thought of this. After Elakesh was sort of state of the art for a while and Shoy Moshi came up with his argument, can that be adapted, or is there an obvious reason why Shoy Moshi argued this question? I haven't actually, I haven't thought about that. So, yeah, maybe you can tell me uh after the lectures like what it is but it it is the one Schoenberg's argument is the one where you put in se sectors. Where you put in sectors? Yeah, so I was wondering if Shoy Moshi's argument, you're sort of declosing the plane. So I wonder if there's some reason why you lose control. Because the control here is so precise, because you have all these fibers that are, like you said, outhung A. And I wonder if Jamoshi's argument just run out of control for a second. Yeah, I haven't at least recently attempted Shortmosh's argument for this, but yeah, I it's Yeah, I I is is there like a very clear connection to the first two work sets and seminary charter in Scholemus's argument? I should be able to answer that question and I can't at the moment. Yeah, because I thought it's sort of independent of seminary charter, so it's just a different argument. So and here we have just made progress on sort of seminary charter for fractals. So that's why I don't really see how to apply that to that progress to Chobenos' argument. Definitely one could try it again now. Definitely one could try it again now with all the new information. Maybe maybe that make works. Yeah, just but whenever someone brings new toys, I might work. Yeah. So I I would imagine that the non-concentration questions are difficult to take care of in general cycle. We can talk about the question. So so you you show that this F is S to S first converted by just this clever geometry. By just this clever geometric observation that contains each of these slices contains a copy of A. Is there a chance, is there any chance at all that you could do better than just the dimension of A? A lot of stuff. Better than the dimension of A, but the slices would be one too. But you would have to cook up some entirely different set. I mean, for this particular set, I don't Good question. I mean, of course, conceivably the slices could be larger, because the slices can be up to this size or this size. So conceivably they could be much larger. But if algebraic relation I guess if if you have to show that the slices are uh much larger, then you actually Much larger, and you actually immediately make progress on some questions. So that's sort of equal in the training proof. I think that you can put here two. So you can put this instead of five or four, you can put a two to two. So in the So, in the D-stage after that question, it gets very embarrassing. I don't remember what is the best exponent, but it's definitely higher than 5 over 4. So, even so, this is shorting of the argument which I discussed. We placed 5 over 4 by 4 over 3. And do you happen to remember what is the highest experiment at the moment? It's 4 over 3 plus a number which changes in time. I seem to remember that in the real variety, it would be due to maybe let's say one soft screen and something like that. At least they had a rather recent. Actually, in the Z case, I don't even remember who got the short ones, but the best ones. The congressional also need to replace packing menu without something. No. No. I think this is false. So good question. But yeah, that's something I even meant to mention. So here, of course, very hard you would think that you just put your house out dimension both bases. I think this is just false. That you can construct sets which somehow look arithmetic on some scales and geometric on some other scales, and then you can actually make both of them be as small as k. So then you can't put any anything better than one here. Put any anything better than one here. Or the house dock half-drop image, right? Replace the the everything with packing events, and maybe it's everything with packing, even this one. Okay, that's a different question altogether. And you don't have any normal concentration anymore. Then I don't dare say anything. Quite likely everything breaks down as well. There are no further questions. Let's thank our speaker again. I also like to thank Paul and also give this lecture. It's my first mini course ever, and maybe the last one as well. So, thank you.
