Not everyone can hear me well. So, like I was introduced, my name is Jakob Boznitsky, and maybe I could introduce myself a bit better. I'm right now a fourth-year student at the University of Warsaw, and what I will be talking about here today is Measure Valid strong uniqueness for density-b-dependent incompressible non-Newtonian fluids. And I hope that since I'm pretty young, this will be a I'm pretty young. This will be a relatively relaxing and easy lecture for everybody. So, the system that I would like to talk about is the system of three equations. We have the mass conservation equation or the continuity equation. The second one is the momentum equation. And the third one is the incompressibility one. And here we have the U is the velocity gradient, as you can see. The velocity gradient, as you can see, the time is bounded, and the space that I'm concerned with will be the flat torus. So there will be no boundary conditions, only the conditions for the time zero. So rho is the density and piece pressure. I'm not really interested in what is actually the pressure because it disappears with the weak formulation. Simulation and the fan CS is the stress tensor. This will be, since we will be talking about neonutonal fluids, it will be connected to the symmetric gradient of the velocity field and it will appear shortly what I mean by that. So, what are the works on the similar topic? So, the one, a very recent one, because it's 2020, there is a work There is a work by Mr. Farazel and Mrs. Abbatiello about the measure-valid solutions to general incompressible and vicious fluids. It's basically the same analogic system to what I have shown you, but with a constant density. And there is also a proof of the existence of measure-valid solutions and the MV strong uniqueness result is also there. Result is also there. And from seven years ago, there is a work by Ms. Wublevska-Kaminska. And this work talks about the existence of weak solutions to density-dependent, incompressible non-Newtonian fluids. So this is the same system that I have shown you, but it also has some boundary conditions because the space is some set omega. And what's also important here. And what's also important here, since those are weak solutions, the n-function or the potential, which will also appear shortly after, I will talk about it, here is bounded below by the modulus to the power of p, where p is greater or equal to 11 over 5. And this is very important to have the existence of weak solutions. I will not assume that, and that's why we'll have some problems with constant. We'll have some problems with concentrations, and that's why the measure-valid solutions appear instead of weak solutions. So, what are the underlying assumptions here? So, we assume the existence of the convex potential f. Like I said before, this is also the n function. It is non-negative. It is zero in zero, and its effective domain is the whole space. And, like I mentioned before, we have some. Like I mentioned before, we have some connection of the stress tensor to the this du here is the symmetric gradient of the velocity field. And the connection is that the stress tensor is in the sub-differential of f in the point of the symmetric gradient. So if f was differentiable, it would mean that s is just the derivative. And what I mean that it's in And what I mean is that it's in sub-differential, it means basically that this colour product of S with this symmetric gradient, which is the normal colour product between matrices, is equal to the F in the point of symmetric gradient, and this F star is just the convex conjugate of F and this add point S, which is the stress tense. And there are some other assumptions. I list one of them. All of them are very technical. One of them is Are very technical. One of them is just the existence of the ball in the domain of the convex conjugate. And this is important because when we talk about the measure-valid solutions and when we are talking about those weak kind of solutions, this symmetric gradient becomes only a measure and we need to make sense of this thing here, this F on the measure. So we need to define it somehow. And all of those techniques. And all of those technical assumptions are important just to define it. And all of them are listed in this very short article by Demangel and Temmam, Convex Functions of a Measure, the Unbounded Case. And it talks about how to define this measure f of du when du is a measure and what are the needed assumptions to actually do it. So let's move to the definition of the Definition of the maybe the first the existence theorem. So the assumptions are very minor. We need the u0, so this is the velocity field at time zero. It belongs to the H space on the flat torus. And what this H space is, is just the closure of the compactly supported smooth functions with divergence zero. This is closure in the L2 norm and the And the row zero, which is the beginning for the density, it is bounded and it is cut off from the zero by some kind of constant. So it can be arbitrarily crossed to zero. And this is important for the proof of the existence and the proof of the measure-valid strong uniqueness. And then we have the dissipative measure-valid solution to our system. To our system. So, when I talk about dissipative measure value solution, what I actually mean. So, let's look at the definition. It's pretty long. It will take a few slides. So, we will say that the power rho u is a dissipative measure value solution to our system if, first of all, rho is continuous over time and it is L2 over space. U, which is the velocity field, is the bounded over time and L2 on space. And like I mentioned before, the And like I mentioned before, the symmetric gradient of our velocity field will be only considered as a measure. So it is a measure on the space-time and with the values in some symmetrical matrices free on free. And then there exists this S, which is a stress tensor. It is L1 on time and space. And since we talk about the measure-voyal solutions also, there is a problem with concentrations, which is the non-linear term in our term in our in our system. So the parametrizes, this parameterized family of measures, which is bounded in time with values in measures, this is due to concentrations only. So this non-real term will give us some concentrations and that is why this parameterized family of measures appear. So what are so So, what are the assumptions we have? That, first of all, the bounds on density won't change in time. So, if we have some bounds on row zero, the row itself will have similar bounds. We have obviously the incompressibility condition, this is the distributional sense, and we test for rho phi being C1. We have the momentum equation, and this is a normal distributional momentum equation, but the constant. But the concentration appears here, and you obviously test by divergence-free C1 functions. And the last thing is the total mass conservation or the continuity equation. This obviously the distributional sense, and there are no bonus things added. So, this concentration only appears for the momentum equation, and that is the only problem here. Here. And the last thing, because we need to talk about the, we want to talk about the measure value strong uniqueness, we need some energy inequality. So we have the standard energy here with the velocity and the dissipation defect. And this would normally be this color product between the matrices because S belongs to the subdifferential of F, but we rewrite it this way. But we rewrite it this way. And that is why, like I talked about, we need to make sense of this term F of DU, because DU is a measure. So since it appears here, it needs to be made sense of. And also the bonus term, since we talk about the density, is this term here. And the gamma here is just the arbitrary number which is bigger than one. So that is all, and this dÏ„ term which appears in the energy is just the one-half of a trace of m tau, and this is so-called the dissipation defect. And one last thing, which is also needed for the mv strong uniqueness, is this bound that the total variation in any point tau is bounded by some constant c and our dissipation defect. So, how do we prove this existence? And with the two-step approximation here, so the first one is very standard. We have approximation in n. So, we consider the basis of the Stokes operator and the Galerkin system for fixed n vectors. So, we just project our solution on the first n vectors. There are some tricks with There are some tricks with the Schauder fixed point theorem, but those are very standard for this kind of system. So and I omit all the technicalities. And obviously when we converge with n to infinity, we will have from the density argument our solution. And the more interesting one, more interesting approximation, at least for me, is the approximation in alpha. Here alpha is a strictly positive number. Strictly positive number, and we use the Mori-Yoshida approximation of the function f. So, this is the definition of it. We have f alpha on d is the infinite, and this is 1 over 2 alpha, the norm of s minus d plus f of s. And what is important here is that when alpha will converge to zero, those will converge to our function f. So, since this approximation in n is very standard, I won't really tell you. Is very standard. I won't really talk about it why we use it. I think it's very obvious. But what I would talk, what I would like to talk about is this approximation in alpha and what it gives us and what is very interesting about it. So why the Mori Yoshida approximation actually? So we have f of alpha are first of all convex functions. Second of all, f of alpha are positive, are non-negative. Positive are non-negative, f of alpha of zero is zero, and the domain of f of alpha is the effective domain is the whole space. So, as you can see, those f of alphas have the same assumptions as our potential f. So, when we have some kind of theory for our convex potential f, we can use it for f of alpha and just omit any like technique, new technical problems, and so on. And why do we actually use it? So, the reason why we use this approximation in alpha is we deal with the very troublesome assumption that S is in this sub-differential F of the U. So, what is the problem is that when F is not differentiable, this is a multivariate function, right? We have on the space-time point, we have some kind of set and And the usage of the Schauder fixed point theorem is maybe not impossible, but might be very hard. So if we use F alphas, they are differentiable with one over alpha Lips derivatives. So like I mentioned before, this assumption that S is in some kind of sub-differential is now just the assumption that S is a derivative of F alpha. Derivative of f alpha. So if you use this assumption, everything becomes much easier, and that is why we use this assumption, we use this approximation. And like I mentioned before, the fourth thing that is important for us is that f of alphas converges uniformly to f on compact sets as alpha goes to zero. And this is just an important for us when we want to converge from the approximate solutions to Approximate solutions to our measure-valid solution. So, how are the steps? We just fixed n, we converge with alpha to zero, we get some kind of approximation in n, and then we converge with n to infinity, and we get our measure-valid solutions. And the theorem that is The theorem that is the most important the most important one. So you have two basic theorems. You have the existent theorem. Obviously, if we define the solution, we want this solution to exist. And the second thing, we want some kind of uniqueness. And while we might not really hope for the uniqueness of the measure value solutions, we might hope for the measure value strong uniqueness. And this is the most basic one. Then with the basic one, so we assume that there exists a very strong solution because of C1. And if we take our measure-valid solution with obviously the same initial datum, rho 0 u0, then there exists a strong solution with the same initial conditions. And when you assume that the strong solution exists, then we have the equalities. So the strong velocity field is equal to the measure value 1. field is equal to the measure valued one the strong density is also equal to the to the measure valued density we have also that the stress tensor is the same and that our concentrations disappear so the concentration measure will be of zero and the proof if it's very standard here so we assume the we consider the relative energy so as we can see As we can see, the relative energy here is as always non-negative. This term is non-negative because we have this bound of the total variation, which was non-negative, so the tau is non-negative. This one is obviously a square, and rho is bounded below by some constant, which is cut off from zero. So this is obviously non-negative. And non-negativeness of maybe this term may be questionable for some, but this is. But this is a negative due to the standard Young inequality. So the standard Young inequality just states that A times B is lower than equal to A to the power of P over P plus B to the power of Q over Q when 1 over P plus 1 over Q is equal to 1. And if we use it for this term, for those three terms here, it will appear that this is non-negative and That this is non-negative, and the equality that this equals zero is if and only if those densities are actually the same. So, if we have the non-negative relative energy, we just need to show that this relative energy is bounded by some constant c, and we have the integral with the relative energy t dt. So, now if we apply So now, if we apply the standard Gunnels inequality, we'll just have that this relative term is zero and it will mean everything that we want. So let me, since I have a bit of time still, I will come back to one thing maybe here. So this concentration measure that appears here, I think one interesting thing is that if you consider measure-violed solutions, If you consider measure-valid solutions, a lot of works that are here are mostly concerned with young measures or appear young measure. The young measures appear. So those are work by, for example, Lyons, Diperna and Maida, or for example by Mr. Fiazda. Mostly the measure-valid solutions are concerned with young measures that are generated by the approximate solutions. So, what happens here? As you can see, I don't use the term of Young measures. These are only the weak limits of our approximate solutions. And this measure here is actually not generated by the difference, which is mostly what it is generated by the difference of this non-linear term with its supposed. Supposed limit on Young measure. This is actually generated by our nonlinear term and it's just its supposed nonlinear limits. So it's un tensor un minus u times u, and there are also this density here. So this is so-called the defect measure, or at least because you have this density here, it's not exactly a defect. Density here, it's not exactly a defect measure, but it is bounded by it. So, this is what I found pretty interesting in it: that actually, this usage of young measures, which is very popular in this kind of these lines of thinking, that it doesn't appear here. And I think that this is all I wanted really to talk about. I hope that everything was very simple, and thank you for your attention. Simple, and thank you for your attention. Thank you for a nice talk. So, there are some questions. I have a question. Anetta is speaking. Thank you, Jakum, for your talk. I have a question concerning this term raw to power gamma appearing in the energy inequality. Maybe it's a bit stupid question. It's a bit stupid question, but how did you get it? Like, how where did it come from? So, can you show the first slide with the equation, Jakub? Yes. So, this is we assume that the gamma is greater than one. And what we have here is if we have this strong solution, we would just multiply this first equation, this continuity equation by rho to the power of gamma minus one. And if we just integrate it, And if we just integrate it and we use this divergence-free condition, we would get that the integral over gamma over rho to power of gamma is equal to the integral of rho zero to the power of gamma also. And if we use just the strong convergence of the approximate solutions, we just get the inequality. So we just add this term here. So we have the add this term here. So we have the standard the standard energy here with this inequality and those two terms are connected like I said before. We just added to here. Okay I see thank you and I have a second question maybe a comment or if I understand well since you work with measure valued solutions and you do not have this restriction for the say growth of Growth of the stress tensor, you are able to consider both sheet thickening and sheet thinning through it, right? I think so. I believe so, yeah. Okay. Thanks. Thank you, Elot. Okay, some more questions. There are some questions. Please. Two? Okay, then let me ask my question. So you made this very interesting remark. So, you made this very interesting remark at the very end of your talk that somehow you're not considering measure-valued solutions, but simply measures that are solutions of the equation. I mean, you can always discuss about terminology. But anyway, there are no young measures appearing here, as opposed to a lot of the previous literature. I do remember when you mentioned this paper of Feyeraisel, Briazda, and Agnieshka and myself. And Agnieszka and myself, that we did also think about whether we actually needed the young measures. And we came to the conclusion we do need them. So could you explain further whether there is some special structure here? Is it due to incompressibility, or what's the reason that you do not need the Young measures? What is the. Oh hm What is actually I would ne probably need oh oh god actually I remember that I knew it but I probably forgot the answer to this question. There's the when we I would probably need to think about it. I might think about it for like a quick few minutes and I might give the answer by chat and talk about it because I don't want to. For uniqueness, you need it? For weak, strong uniqueness, yes, I think. Can I comment it? Emil, the story is he has a very particular structure, almost like in paper. structure almost like in paper of Edward means the only non-linearity on zero level is the the velocity tensor velocity and additionally rho is converging strongly because of the renormalized property of the transport equation means in fact in the product rho times faux tensor faux you have Fau, you have faux tensor faux converging only weakly, and you have a problem with the measure, and that the rest is just rho is converging strongly. And means you have something what is converging strongly and something what is converging quickly. This is not exactly the situation because, in fact, in this case, you need uniform convergence of rho, and you have only in arbitrary LP, but less. Lp but less than infinity, but still it's enough to pass to the limit and get this concentration measure. But this is something, in fact, the same approach you can do also for using, of course, Young measures. But this is following the line of the paper of Edward, which was quoted just on the beginning, not our paper. Okay, so I think it's a good point to stop. So, thank Jakub for nice talk. And now we have the last talk. The other. Time expired. What do you mean, time expired? Time expired for a question. Yes, yes. Time expired for the question. It doesn't cost raising hand. Ah, raising hand. Yes. Ah, raising hand. Yes, so please, please ask this question after a coffee break, okay? Joseph, sorry. No, I understood. I did not complain. And yes, we start the discussion, so then we will have some problems more than half an hour. So the last speaker of this session is Tony Lelivo. Okay, and the talk will be a fact. The talk will be about effective dynamics of stochastic equations. So, please, Tony, time is yours. Hello.
