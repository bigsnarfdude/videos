Pincer LaFolle, and he is from CNS and Institut des Mathémétique de Jusset, Paris. And he will tell us about spectral decomposition. So, yeah, go ahead. So, thank you for the invitation. So, my So my talk is related to the talk of Tsong Shu. And in fact, I will also use results from last talk, which will be this afternoon. I just admit these results. So I will begin with some very basic facts. The general setting for the long-launch program over global fields, number of fields. Fields, number fields, and function fields is the following. Let J be a reductive group over a global field F. We assume J is split to simplify. We denote by G add the Long Lance dual group of G. It is a split reductive group whose weights and roots are the co-weights and co-roots of G. Examples are given on the screen. The locally The locally compact ring of Adels A of F contains F discretely, and the goal of the Longlands program is to decompose a space of L2 functions on G of A mod G of F with complex values as a representation of G of A in terms of global long length parameters, which are, if we impose some If we impose some algebraicity condition in the case of number field, this condition occurs at Archimedean places. So then under this condition, the long loss parameters are continuous, semi-simple morphism from the Galois group to G hat of QL bar for some L up to conjugacy. And so And so, over function fields, there are no conditions, but we need to assume that L is prime to the characteristic. And so, from now on, we consider only function fields. Do you hear me? Yes. Yeah, okay. So, the geometric interpretation of the idyllic quotient is a beginning of everything for function fields. Everything for function field. So I assume that f is a function field, the field of rational function on a curve x over a finite field fq. So as usual, we assume x is a smooth projective and geometrically connected. There is only one such curve for each function field F. Let A be the ring of adults of F and O the And O the ring of integral adults and let G be a split reductive group over F. Then the quotient of G of A by G of F and G of O is bun G of FQ, the set of isomorphism classes of G principal bundles over X. So in fact, it is a group of it, but for the moment, we consider it as a set. It as a set. So we recall that the J principal bundle over X is a morphism from Y to X equipped with a simply transitive action of G on the fibers. And that the G L R principal bundles are the same as the vector bundles of franc R. So the equality above, in fact, it's a bit special to split groups, otherwise, there is a finite number of spaces. Spaces on the left, but okay. But it holds because any gene principle bundle over X can be trivialized over X minus S, where S is a finite set of places of X. And then it is given by an element of the product over these places of G of F V divided by G of O F V. Moreover, G of M or G of O of V of F of V of F of V G of M or G of O is a union of all finite products of this quotient when S varies. And two trivializations of a G principal bundle over X minus S for some S are related by the action of an element of G of F. So now I can give the definition of recall the definition of Definition of automorphic forms over function fields. So let n be a level, which means a finite subscheme of x or finite subset of places of x with multiplicities. Let O n be the ring of function on n. We know that g of is a finite group. And we define as the kernel of this morphism g of o, g of o n. G of O n. So it's a subgroup of G of O finite index. It is an open compact subgroup of G of A. And then we can take the quotient of G of A by G of F and Kn and it is bungee n of FQ, where bungee n of FQ is a set of isomorphism classes of G principal bundles over X together with a trivialization of the restriction to N. And an automorphic form with level N is a function on bungee n of FQ by definition. Bungee of FQ by definition. Now I have to recall the notion of stack. In fact, G principal bundles over X have automorphism groups which are finite. And bungee n of FQ is a group with whose elements have finite automorphism groups. Elements have finite automorphism groups. It is a group weight of points over FQ of a stack Bungian over FQ. The definition of Bengi N is that it's a group weight of points over a scheme S over FQ, by which we mean morphisms from S to Bungee N, classifies the G principal bundles over X times S together with the trivialization of the restriction to N times S. The products here are products of. The products here are products of schemes over spec FQ. And a stack is like a scheme whose points have algebraic automorphism groups. For example, the quotient of a scheme by an action of an affine smooth group scheme. And so he is what we call an artin stack, so Bungian is an artin stack. And later we will see that stack of tukas are in fact Dolin Bumform. In fact, During Manform, which means that the automorphism groups are finite at all. Okay. So now we consider cuspidal automorphic forms. So it's a subspace of all automorphic functions defined by as a kernel or some constant term operators involving parabolic subgroups. Parabolic subgroups. They form the elementary bricks to build all automorphic forms thanks to Eisenstein series. And we can define cuspidal automorphic forms with coefficient in Q. But here we take them with coefficient in QL because the helladic homology we need to use and the long-range parameters we want to construct are both with coefficients in QL. In QL. So now I can give the definition, recall the definition of unramified equip operators. So first I suppose that n is empty, the level is empty, let v a closed point of x, or place. If g and g prime are two principal bundles over x, you say that g prime is a modification of g at v if there is we if we are given an isomorphism between the restriction to x minus v. Restriction to x minus v. Then the relative position at v is a dominant coate lambda of g, where when lambda g equals ln it is a renuple of elementary divisors. And we introduce a ramified equal operator, T lambda v acting on function with the Reynolds support on bungi of FQ. The image of F takes its value at its value at g is the sum of f of g prime where g prime is a modification of g with relative position lambda the sum is finite more generally with a level n any close point v in x minus n and any coefficient lambda we have an operator t lambda v acting on the functions with on bungee n of fq when lambda varies the operator t lambda v spans unramified equalgebra hv Echo algebra HV, which is commutative and acts on automorphic forms and on caspetal automorphic forms. So they are ramified Echo operators at the places in V, but I do not introduce them in my talk. So now I can give the definition of global long-lance parameters. So let F-bar be an algebraic closure of F. And so for any open subscheme U of X, I denote by I denote by F bar U the subfield generated by all finite extension of F associated to unramified coverings of U. And the Galois group acts on F bar U by a quotient denoted by pi 1 of U. So it's a etal pi 1. I should specify the base point, spec F bar, but I will omit the base points everywhere. So F contain FQ and F bar contains FQ bar. And F bar contains F cubar, and F bar U also contains FQ bar. And from this, we deduce a short, usual short exact sequence. Pi one geometric of U is a subgroup of pi one of U with quotient Galois Fq bar over F U, which is the at with the generator of the Frobenius. And then we define the value group of U by the short exact sequence. So it's a fiber product by one of U. product by one of u and z over z hat so a global long length parameter is a conjugacy classes conjugacy class by g hat of q l bar of continuous and semi-simple morphisms sigma from the value group x minus n to g hat of q l bar so So, in fact, we have the V group instead of the Galois group because we take everything with the QL coefficient and we do not restrict to Caspindal homology later. So, to simplify the statement of the first theorem, so in my talk, there will be three spectral decompositions. The first one is just for cospital automorphic forms, the second one for all. Automorphic forms, the second one for all cohomologies, and the third one is spectral decomposition in the long-land geometric program. So I begin with the first spectral decomposition. So I assume that G is semi-simple, that is, at its center is finite. Then Paspidal automorphic forms are finite dimension and this. Dimension and this vector space of finite dimension admits a canonical decomposition indexed by global long-lance parameters. This decomposition is respected by all equipoperators, and we have a compatibility with the SATAK isomorphism at all close points in X minus N. So, the proof of the CRM uses a general stack of two cars, which were explained in the song, and the And the geometric state equivalent. So I recall the static isomorphism. It's an isomorphism of QL algebras from the algebra of algebraic representation of giat, where product is a transfer product, to the unramified equal algebra at V. V if capital V is an irreducible representation of G hat, T capital V V is a combination of the T lambda V or lambda weight of capital V. So to state the compatibility with the Sataka isomorphism, I need to introduce the following elements. So for each V in X minus N, I have a pi one of V. V, which is a generator of the at given by the Frobenius of the residue field, and Frop V denotes in pi one of x minus n denotes the image of Frob V by the morphism, but due to the choice of base points, in fact, which I omitted, it's defined up to conjugacy and. And so Frob V belongs to the Vein group. And the compatibility of the decomposition of space of caspital automorphic form with a static isomorphism means that for any close point V in X minus N and for any representation V of G hat, T capital V V preserves this decomposition and acts on H sigma by multiplication by the By multiplication by the trace of the representation capital V applied at, we take the trace at sigma of for V. So sigma of for V is an element of G hat of QL bar. And then you take the trace of this element. So it's an equality of elements in QL bar. Elements in total bar. So, in the next slides, I explain the idea of the proof of the theorem. So, we construct a commutative algebra B of excursion operators containing all the unramified echo operators such that it acts on automorphic forms and on preserves the subspace of caspidal automorphic forms. Each character. ν corresponds in a of B corresponds in a unique way to a long Lance parameter sigma and since B is commutative and space of automorphic forms is of finite dimension because we assume the group is semi-simple otherwise we have to take the quotient by Xi as some discrete subgroup in the center Z of A we will obtain a canonical spectrum We will obtain a canonical spectral decomposition in generalized eigenspaces where the sum is taken over the characters of B. And by associating to every character a long length parameter, we deduce the decomposition of the theorem indexed by long-range parameter. Okay, so now I recall the definition of the stack of Stukas for NMT to simplify. For NMT to simplify. So for any scheme S over FQ, we have the Frobenius of S and Stuka I, I is a finite set, is a stack over Xi, whose points over scheme S classify the points of the curve, which are the legs of the Stukas, the J principal bundle on the product, X times S, the product is over FQ, and an isomorphism. And an isomorphism with its pullback by identity of x times Frobenius of S with outside the graphs of the union of the graph of the Xi. So it's a Doulin Mummer stack. Its automorphism groups are finite at all. And so the stack of Stukas without legs is equal to 1 G of Fq. To Bungie of FQ. It's a discrete stack. An important point is that struck us do not have analogs over number of fields in general because nobody knows what spec Z to the I should be for a cardinal of I strictly bigger than one. So the work of Fark and Schultz uses analog of local Stukas over Qp. So it's a very important question to understand. Uh so it's a very important question to understand. Is there analogues of some kind of analog of to cut over number phase, but nobody knows how to do it? So the geometric Sataku equivalence is a geometrization of the Satakui isomorphism. So I define Mi so Mi is a quotient of an affine Bellingham affine Rasmanian by some uh group of the type G of O. Group of the stack G of O for those who know. But I here I define it geometrically as a stack over X I whose points over a scheme S over FQ classify points curve, G principal bundles over the formal compression of X times S along the union of the graph of the Xi and an isomorphism with modification of the graph of the Xi. X i and then so M i of S depends only on the union of the graphs and the fusion of the legs is what happens when some X I become equal so the geometrics of echo equivalence associates to any finite set I any algebraic finite dimensional QN linear representation W of GI to the I a perverse shift S I W and M I which is a Which is a functorial in W and compatible with the fusion of legs. I will not explain what it means, that compatibility with the fusion of legs, but we will have a consequence for the homology of Stukas later. So it's very important. And the obvious forgetful morphism from Stukas to I to Mi is smooth, so say formally smooth. And we define a period shift. And we define a period shift F I w on took I as a pullback of the set okay shift S I w so it's a very canonical when W is irreducible it's an intersection a comology shift but on Stukarai but it's better to see it as a pullback of the Satake shift it's more canonical And so now I introduce the eladic homology of a stack of Stukas. So we denote by Hiw the QL vector space of eladic homology with compact support of the fiber of Stuka I over a geometric generic point of Xi with coefficient in Fi. With coefficients in Fiw. So we can, of course, we can replace 2KI by the support of Fiw. So then it's an Arctin stack. And so it's a comology as a geometric generic point, but a posteriori, it's equivalent to take the comology over the geometric generic point of the diagonal. That's very important. And so now we no more assume Adam. So now we no more assume NMT. We can define a stack of stukas with level n. I forgot stuka i n i mean it should be denoted by stuka i n and we can construct fiw and h i w in the same way and but i will i do not want to to put n everywhere so i do not put the notation n here so Here. So we know that what matters is not the total space of Stukas with level n, but the morphism from Stuka I to x minus n to the i, because we take the homology of the fiber of our point of the base. And so the QL vector space is equipped, Hiw is equipped with a continuous action of a veil of x minus n to the i. Thanks to partial forbonus morphism introduced by Greenfeld and explained in the talk of Zong. Thanks to my work and the work of Zung. So here continuous means technically, the precise definition of continuous is that it's a union of subspace of finite dimension with a continuous action of pi one geometric to the I. I mean, the difference between pi one geometric The the difference between pi one geometric and valve is z and there is no topology in z so the continuity property is uh always given with a pi one geometric and the big advantage of this is that in all situations the action of pi one geometric preserves a finite dimension subspace i mean the hiw is infinite dimensional but it's a union of subspaces of finite dimension with continuous action of pi one geometric Of pi one geometry. And that's why it's easy to mean to say what continuity means. Okay, so the strategy to construct the algebra B of excursion operator is the following for I, M T, and W, the trivial one-dimensional representation. We have H empty set one. So H empty set one, it means that one is a representation of G to the power empty set, which is a trivial group. Okay. So H empty set one is a comology of the stack of two cars without legs, which is bunched n of FQ. So it's a discrete robot. So the comology is just The comology is just a space of function on the set associated to this discrete group, which is Benji N of Fq. And so this is also because F empty set one is a constant sheaf QL by static equivalent. And then we will use HIW to construct an algebra B of excursion operators acting on H empty set one. One and this action will preserve cuspidal automorphic forms. So, to go further, I need to recall the properties of the HIW. First, because the set IK equivalence is functorial in W, for any finite set I, H I W. Hiw is a QL linear functor from the category of representations W of GR to the I to the category of continuous representation of a whale of x minus n to the i. Continuous in the previous meaning, in the previous sense. So this means that for any morphism u from w to w prime of representation of g r to the i, we have a morphism h of u. So I will use again this notation h of u, right? H of u from h i w to h i w prime. Morphism of continuous representation of the value group to the right. And then the second property which comes from fusion in the set equivalence is that Is that we have fusion for the HIW. So, fusion property can be stated for any map zeta from I to G. I and G are two finite sets. But we consider here only on the case where G is a singleton, which we denote by zero. We always denote singletons by zero and sets with two elements by one, two. Okay, there is no reason for the choice of zero, one, two. Okay. The choice of 0, 1, 2. Okay. So for any representation W of a gi to the i, we have a fusion isomorphism, which is a factorial in w. Hi W is isomorphic to H zero W dag, where W dyag denotes the representation of G hat and W obtained by composition with a diagonal morphism from G hat to G hat to the. From GR to GR to the eye. And here I forgot to say something important: that on Hiw, I have an action of Vale group to the I, while on the right-hand side, H0W Diag, I have an action of the Veil group. And this is a fusion isomorphism is equivalent for the action of the V group, where the V group acts diagonally on the left-hand side by the diagonal embedding of Veil into Veil into the act. Of valing to valing to the eye. So the fusionism isomorphism is equivalent for the action of the value. So two examples of the fusion isomorphism of the previous slides are the following, the two which we will use. If W1 and W2 are two representations of G-Act, we have this fusion isomorphism associated to the obvious map from Associated to the obvious map from the set one, two to the set singleton zero, and we know the difference between w1 external product w2, which is a representation of g square and w1 tensor w2, which is a representation of gia. G and the next is fusion isomorphism is between H empty set one and H01. It's associated to the obvious one, obvious map from the empty set to zero. And so both are equal to the space of automorphic functions, of course. And the idea is that H01 is a stack, the commercial stack of two cases with a Commercial the stack of two cars with a leg, but without any modification at this leg. So it's the same stack of it's just the product of the stack of two cars without legs and the curve because the leg does not play any role. And so it's a homology is the same. And this is equal to the space of photomorphic functions. So now here is the construction of the algebra B of excursion operators for any algebraic function. For any algebraic function f on g hat to the y divided by g hat on the left and on the right for the diagonal embedding of g hat in g hat to the i. We can find a representation w of g hat to the y and vectors and a vector on a linear form on w which are invariant by the diagonal action of g h such that f is a matrix coefficient. F is a matrix coefficient. And then we take gamma i in the group to the i, and the excursion operator associated to if and the gamma i acting on h singleton 01 is defined as a composition go to h singleton one to h singleton w diag by functoriality because x is a vector in w so it's a morphism from the trivial representation to w diag. And because X is invariant, because we assume X is invariant by the diagonal action of G hat, that's why X is a morphism from the trivial representation to W diagnos. And then by fusion, H singleton, H0 double yang is Hi W. Then we can apply the action of the gamma I and then you have fusion again to H0 double yang, and then you apply this linear. Double giat, and then you apply this linear form because this since this linear form is invariant by the diagonal action of giat, it is a morphism of a giat representation from w diag to the trivial representation one and to the tautological representation, I should say, other than trivial. Sorry, okay. And uh the construction above does not depend on the choice of W, X and Xi. W, X, and Xi. Okay, which depends only on the function f. So now I can construct the decomposition of the CRM. Thanks to the properties of the HIW explained in the previous slides, we show that the algebra B of endomorphism of H01 generated by this excursion operator is. By this excursion operator is commutative, and that for any character nu of B, there is a unique long-launch parameter sigma, such that for any i f and gamma i, nu of this operator, S I f gamma i is equal to F applied at the sigma of gamma i, so gamma i are in the value group, sigma of gamma i are in g hat. are in g hat of ql bar and f is a function on g to the i an algebraic function so f of this lives in ql bar okay and now b since b is commutative and its action preserves the finite dimensional subspace of cuspied off automorphic forms we can prove it and do not prove it in Prove it in this talk. We have a canonical spectral decomposition of cospidal automorphic forms in characters indexed by new, indexed by characters new. I mean, you have a decomposition in direction of subspaces indexed by the characters new. And in fact, Hν is a generalized eigen space for the elements of B. I don't know how to prove it's exactly. I don't know how to prove it's exactly a true eigen space. And associating to new a unique Langlands parameter sigma and two, we deduce a decomposition of the serum of caspital automorphic forms as a direct sum of subspaces indexed by sigma. And the compatibility with the certain isomorphisms due to the following. Due to the following. The unramified echo operators are particular cases of excursion operators. Indeed, let V be an irreducible representation of gat. Then we take R equal one, two, f is this function, price of g1, g2 minus one, as a function on g hat to the one, two divided by g hat on the left and right. And biogeometric. And by a geometric argument, computing the intersection of Geric cycles in the stack of two cars to do things very concretely, we show that for any closed point V, T capital V V is equal, so the echo operator T capital V V is equal to the excursion operator associated to this function f and to Robinus V and one. So this equality plays an important role in technical arguments, the Richard Schimura relation. Refer Shimoi relation used by Tsong in her talk, and they justify the compatibility of the decomposition with such a cheesomorphism at close point V of sigma. That's easy. Okay. And now before explaining the other spectral decomposition, I state some open questions to show that the To show that all long lens parameters which appear in the decomposition come from elliptic archer parameters or even elliptic Langlands parameter in the general case. So this would imply the Ramanujan-Peterson conjecture for all reductive groups. It's not only for GLN. So we hope that the decomposition of The decomposition above is defined over q bar instead of q l bar and is independent of L and on the embedding of q bar and q l bar. This question makes sense because in a recent article Rinfeld defines a set of long lens parameters sigma independently on L and yet. So this is a very subtle argument of Rinfeld. We could prove that all this is true if we knew how to construct the excursion operators in a motivic way. And sigma would be a motivic long-lance parameter. But unfortunately, we do not have a motivic drain-filled lemma. This is what is lacking. Yes, drain-feld lemma is what allows to prove that there is. To prove that there is an action of vein to the eye. Explained by Tsong and Rotox. So now I explain a joint work with Gen STA. So in the CRM, we said that this decomposition is preserved by all echo operators and including a ramified echo operator. So the ramified echo operator, the echo operator, the places V and N and the compatibility with SATAK. And the compatibility with Satak isomorphisms at close points of x minus n does not say anything about the ramified echo operators. And so our joint work with Anang gives a local parametrization up to some simplification and we show a local global compatibility at all close points. All closed points. It implies that in the decomposition above, for any closed point V in N, the semi-simplification of sigma restricted to the local V group depends only on the character by which the center of the algebra of ramified echo operators at V acts on H sigma. So the simplification, in other words, the simplification of sigma restricted to the local value group depends only on the ramified, on the action of the ramified decay operators. Okay. And we can say it only for the summit simplification. Only for the summi-simplification. Otherwise, it's not true. And so now I switch to more refined spectral decomposition. So the Arcturka tweet heuristics, which exists also for number fields, says that for every sigma, there exists a dual-bar linear representation, A sigma of the centralizer of sigma of the centralizer of sigma in jet such that for all i w h i w is a direct sum of of this take the tensor product of a sigma and w sigma a the representation of v to the a obtained by composition of the representation w of g r to the i with the morphism sigma to the i so the sigma times sigma Sigma times sigma times sigma i times. Okay. And so, of course, this is only aneurysm, so there should be continuous parts. It's not a very discrete sum like this. And it would be true only for cospidal part, but that we have a direct sum. And thanks to an idea of green file, we can obtain something close to these heuristics. Something close to these heuristics from the case of function fields. So, first, we define a scheme S, locally of finite type. So, this is a joint work with Shi Wenzhu. First, we define a scheme S, locally of finite type of morphism sigma from the Veil group to G hat, such that for any QL algebra R, the R points of S. So, this is a precise definition. So this is a precise definition, so be careful. Okay. So the earth points of S are the morphism from sigma, the morphism sigma from the v group of x minus n to g r of r. So without continuity for the moment, such that for any morphism alpha from g r to gl n or for a phaseful representation, it's equivalent, the composed Equivalent, the composed morphism from the Veil group to G Ln R. So it gives an action of the Vale group on R to the n and the assumption that R to the n, seen as a QL vector space, because R is a QL algebra, is an inductive limit of continuous representation of pi one geometric on finite-dimensional QL vector spaces. And so And so it's we let reg be the left regular representation of giat, the action by left translation of giat on the vector space, on the QL vector space of all algebraic functions on gat. And we can undo H zero reg zero is the singleton, the notation for the singletons set with. For the singletons set with one element, so we can under H0 with a structure of O module on S and with an action of G hat compatible with conjugation by G hat on S. This gives rise to an O module on the algebraic stack S divided by G hat of long lance parameters because I recall that the long lance parameter it's a morphism from the value group to g hat up to conjugation so the stack has So the stack S is really the stack of long lengths. The quotient S divided by G h is the stack of long length parameters. And then the A sigma of the arterial characteristic should be the fiber of this omodule at sigma. And it would be equipped with an action of the centralizator S sigma, which is the centralized ater S sigma is the automorphism group of sigma in this stack, of course. Of course, and so she went on. I prove this works well over elliptic sigma. Elliptic means that sigma is finite. Assume that the giat is semi-simple. Okay. So now I will explain the structure A and B. So first I'll begin with structure A, the structure of omodulum S. The reformulation of this structure. Reformulation of this structure, in fact, is the following, but I will explain later why it's a reformulation. So, for any finite-dimensional QL linear representation V of giat with underlying vectors QL vector space V bar, then H0 rectangle V bar is equipped with an action of V of X minus N such that it's an inductive limit of finite dimensional continuous representation of pi one geometric of X minus n. Moreover, this trend. Moreover, this structure is functorial in V and compatible with tensor product. I will explain the compatibility later. This structure is obtained in the following way. We have a G hat equivariant isomorphism between the regular representation tense V bar, where so on the left-hand side, G hat acts only on the regular representation by left translation, not on V bar. Not on V bar. And this is isomorphic to reg tens V, where G hat acts diagonally on the right-hand side. And so it's well known that sometimes the regular presentation, tensor, anything is a sum of copies of the regular presentation. Okay. And so, but I wrote explicitly the formula where to make sense, we have to consider the right-hand side. have to consider the right hand side as a vector space of algebraic functions from g to v and then the formula makes sense the formula for theta makes sense okay and from the isomorphism theta we did use an isomorphism which is very important between h0 reg tensor vibar and h0 union one zero one the set with two One zero one, the set with two elements. Uh reg external product v. So, reg external product v is a representation of g hat square. Okay, so the first equality is tautological, just uh put inside the because it's tautological because v bar is just a QL vector space, okay. Just a QL vector space. Okay. Then in the middle, we have theta. And the last isomorphism is just fusion. And then we define the action of Val of X minus L on the left hand side as the action of Vail of X minus L on the right hand side corresponding to the leg one. Because I recall that the right hand side is equipped with an action of V square. And so you have an action of V square. So you have an action of val, one copy of val for the leg zero, one copy of val for the leg one. And so you take the second action of this copy of val for the leg one. Okay. You can see this because we want the trivial action with v is a trivial representation. Okay. Okay. And so now I have defined the structure. Now I have defined the structure which was on the top of the slide, okay? That now I define an action of V and H0 rect and survivibar. And now I will explain how this gives the structure A. The H0 is the O module on S, the scheme S of the morphism of the V group to G at. Okay. So So, before doing this, I explained that this construction is compatible with tensor products. So, if V1 and V2 are two representations of G hat, the two action of Galois, it's not Galois, it's a Vale of X minus N here. I'm sorry, it's a bad copy-paste. So, it's here, it's you replace Galois by Vale of X minus N. So, the two actions on H0Egg, and you can remove the cusp. And you can remove the cusp. I am very sorry. Can remove the cusp. The two actions associated to actions of g hat on v1 and v2 commute with each other, and the diagonal action of the V group is equal to the action associated to the diagonal action of g hat on v1 tense v2. And so now I will explain the structure air. Okay, so if v is as above, x in v and x in. V and xi in V star, f is a function of the matrix coefficient, gamma is in the value group. Then I define, then I have a function f of gamma on s which associate to sigma f of sigma of gamma. You see, it's a function on s. And so we want that, we want to define, in fact, we see that this function generates s, all function on s in some sense. And so to define the structure of H0 reg. H0 reg as a row module on S, we say that the action of this function ff gamma on L0 reg is the following. You go from A0x to L0 Reg tensor V bar by identity tensor X, then you make use this action of gamma of the previous slide, and then you apply identity tensor psi. So any function f of angiat can be. any function f of angiat can be written as a matrix coefficient and there is a continuity property that for any f only gamma zero in the pi one of x minus n and c in a zero x the space generated by the ff gamma c for gamma in the class for pi one geometric so finite dimension and and is continuous in gamma okay and the property in the previous line with The property in the previous line with V1 and V2 implies a relation between the FF gamma that we expect. Okay. And from this, in fact, S is essentially defined as a spec of the algebra generated by the F F gamma with this relation, taking in account the continuity property by one geometric. In fact, it can be defined even as a derived stack, but here we consider it only as a classical stack. Stack okay, and so we have established structure A above. Structure B, so I go back. Structure B was the action of g hat compatible with the conjugation. So the structure B is the action of G at on L0 reg associated to the right action of g hat on reg and the conjug the conjugation for G. For G in G is then equal to the action of F twisted by G. And this proves that structure B is compatible with conjugation by G hat on S. And so we are finished. Okay, so now there is a remark that these are function on S and the excursion operators, in fact, correspond exactly on function on S minus X divided by X divided by g hat. And this is how we see it. So for any finite set, any function f on g h and any gamma i, any family of gamma i, we can define ff gamma i similarly as before. And in fact, it is equal to the product of f f i gamma i, when f is a product of the internal product of the fi. Product of the Fi. And in fact, any F is a sum of such product of Fi, so there is nothing new. But it allowed to understand the expression operators exactly the F F gamma I when F is a function on G hat to the I, which is invariant on the right and on the left by G hat, diagonal G hat. Okay. So now for any morphism sigma from the V group to G hat sql bar, we can define A sigma as a bigger quotient of The biggest quotient of H0 sigma tensor QL bar tensor QL bar to have spectral decompositions, okay, such that for any for this it means the fiber of the O module, if you want, at sigma and then as the automorphism group of sigma x on A sigma, okay, and we say that sigma is elliptic is a if L sigma is is if F sigma is finite or in general finite modulus center and then in the joint work with Xiuenzhou he proved that denoting by Hiw sigma is a generalized eigenspace for the excursion operators with the eigenvalues associated to sigma it's also the true eigen space and we i forgot to say that the excursion operator acts not only on automorphic form but also on all the h i w okay and so the h i w And so the xiw sigma is equal to this formula as exactly as in the heuristics of artier cotrits, and all terms in the above formula are of finite dimension. Okay, so now in the last minutes, I will explain the link with the geometric long-lance program. So there are extraordinary developments, recent developments. Extraordinary developments, recent developments in the Long Launch program due to Arinkin, Gezori, Kashdan, Raskin, Rosen, Blum, and Varszewski. And also a recent article of Fegerman Raskin. So there is an extraordinary series of work. And they introduce a new geometric object, the stack of restricted local systems. So it's a geometric, okay. It's a local system on the curve over F cub with restrictive variation. This stack makes sense in any shift theoretic context. And in the autic setting, it's only one, only reasonable one which exists. So this stack is derived and is formal in some direction. And so for the moment, the curve is over FQ bar. The moment the curve is over FQ bar. Okay. So the author formulates the categorical geometric Lang Lance conjecture for the DG category of sheaves and bungee with support in the singular support in the important cone. And they prove that this category of sheaves and bungee with singular support and zipoten port emit a spectral decomposition over the Over the local system with a restricted variation. And the category, so now I assume that the curve is over FQ. Then I have an action of frubinous endomorphism of this category. And they define a categorical trace, which is a vector space. And is equal, in fact, to the space of automorphic forms. And also, we can. And also, we can consider the categorical trace of revenues composed with a nickel functor and they scan a nickel isomorphic to the HIW. So they recover all the HIW, in fact, but only in the unramified setting for the moment. And then they define the stack of arithmetic local systems on X as a formulaus invariant in a different. Frobenius invariant in a derived sense. So LOGSIS arithmetic is a for them is a quasi-compact algebraic derived stack, locally almost of finite type. And the classical stack associated to it by forgetting the derived structure is exactly the S divided by GR we had before. And they construct an object drift in a DG category of quasi-coherent sheaves on logisis arithmetic. On lock sys arithmetic, which allows to recover all the HIW, but not only as a comologic group with action as a veil to the eye, a veil of X to the eye because it's unramified, but as objects in a DG category of least shifts on X to the I equipped with partial for the news morphism. So in our talk, the Tsong will explain that all these HLW are lists. In fact, there is a W are leaves. In fact, they use this result, but they can recover all these leaf shifts in the DG category of leaf shifts from drink. So that's extraordinary. And for each elliptic sigma above, there is an, of course, there is an embedding of a connected component, point divided by sigma in this stack. And the restriction of drink to point divided by sigma is. Coin divided by sigma is exactly I sigma. So now I have finished and I'm ready to answer questions. Thank you very much. Thanks, Vincent. Are there any questions or comments from the audience on the Zoom? So, when you mentioned compatibility with tensor products, how does that come up with the representations of groups themselves in the composition? Compatibility. Compatibility where are the loops? Could you repeat that? Yes, I guess it's a different process when you do the exterior products, but it's usually with the same representation and the dual. I did not understand the question. Could you repeat? The main thing is a fusion isomorphism. This one. I did not understand the question. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Yes, I'm trying to understand this in the context of the functoriality. So if you're there. The example that you get would correspond to an automorphic representation, and you have the representation on the Galois side. So in this example, how can one interpret things on both sides? What do they correspond to in terms of Galois representations and automorphic representations? Other functoriality Longdance Functority Do you mean long-last functoriality? There's a functorality functor. Which functoriality functor? Mean functoriality from G to X? I mean, functionality from G to H? Yes. Ah. Well, functorality is obvious on the Galois side, but not on the automorphic side. So there is a conjecture that there are functority kernels on bunchit and bunchh. And then there are. And then there are in the geometric long lengths. The best way to look at geometric long lengths, you conjecture that shifts on bungee t and bun edge, which give functoriality. But they are not known. Yes, it is conjectural, but uh sometimes you have a an explicit case. For the theta correspondence, they are known by Sergei Disenko. They are known by Sergei Lysenko. Did I answer the question? Yes, thank you. There's still open conjectures there. So I guess I'm from Tori T, yes. Hi. May I ask a question? Yes. First of all, thank you for the talk. First of all, thank you for the talk. Very interesting. You mentioned an approach to proving generalized or managing conjecture for arbitrary reductive groups. Could you say a little bit more about the conjecture that came up with motivic parameters? I'm sorry that I don't have a precise recollection of the statement. Yes. So it's here. So the hope is that this decomposition is defined over Q bar and indexed by motivic long lens parameters, which means you replace the value group by a motiv Galois group. Okay. And the problem is that the Drinfed Lemma tells you that the homology HI. HIW are equal to an action of veil to the eye. But the problem is that we do not have a motivic Rinfield Lemmar. There are works in this direction by, I think, Timorishas, Kolba, and Embru. I forgot, but there are works, but it's still not finished, and it's very difficult. The motivated Greenfeld lemma would say that the stack of Stukas with their partial from the news morphisms are essentially amotivically equivalent to product of varieties over the curve. So it's well known that the Stuckers are not products even if they behave like Even if they behave like products of varieties over x. You see, the stack of stukas are very close to products of varieties over x. From the point of view of analytic zoomology, they are really the same because you have an action of value to the i. The point, the conjecture is to do the same for motivic, I mean to have cycles, algebraic cycles, giving equivalence between motif of Stukas with a partial formula. Of Stukas with the partial froms and products of motives over X. It's completely conjectural. But if you had this conjectural lemma, would you be able to deduce Ramanogen as a consequence? I see. And then you would get Ramanogen as a consequence of the spectral decomposition being defined over Q. Yeah. Okay, thank you. And thank you for the explanation. And thank you for the explanation. But it's horribly complicated, it's completely out of reach. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I just wanted to understand the deduction or the logic. Thank you. Yeah, no, I'm not. Thank you for your question. I take your words. Thank you. More questions? All right, so let's take a look at the Let's think.
