Inviting me here. And thanks to Diego for giving a one-hour motivation for this talk. So, yeah, I can shorten a little bit my introduction, but still I'm going to write some things up so that we're on the same page. Okay? So let me start by fixing notation. So K here will be an arbitrary field, including any field. Okay? So the definition of comological dimension, what's it is just, well, the coherent dimension of the Well, the homological dimension of the Galois group, right? If k is perfect. Okay? An easy definition to ego gave way to Galois modules. And there's a technical definition. In general, I'm not going to give it, but I do want to state one precise property. So it is defined in such a way so that the following holds. The following colours. So the cohomological diagnosis of a field k tilde, I won't define immediately what this is, is the cohomological diagnosion of k plus 1 when k tilde is a complete, discretely valued field with residue field. Okay. Okay. Okay, so the definition given by Kato is complicated, it uses differentials, it has to keep track of the p-basis of the film when it's imperfect. But once you start asking yourself, what do I need for this to hold true, it's essentially the definition. So you can use this as a definition, as a motivation for the technical definition that I won't give. Okay, so the title says Seras Conjecture 2. So the title says Seras Conductor 2, so let me write that down. I'll leave a space there for purpose. So Seras Conductor 2. What does it say? Well, as Diego already recalled, it tells you that for every k with a homological dimension more or equal than another space left on purpose, 2 for every semi-simple. Semi-simple simply connected connective group G and for every tutorial X well X and I write it down here X has a rational point okay so that's another way of Okay, so that's another way of saying that the chosen is trivial. So, yeah, that's sales conjecture two. Alright, and of course, as it was stated in the last talk, the original conjecture was for perfect fields, but once you get the correct definition, you would expect this conjecture to be true for any fields. So, again, I want to recall a little bit what's known. Well, the aggregate lots of fields for which this is known, so I'm not going to repeat that, but I do want to give the But I do want to give the list of groups once again. So this is okay if G is of type, well you got AN, BN, CN, DN, and non-traditarium here and we have for 22. So once again So, once again, this is Bayer Paimala, and for imperfect fields, it's very framed. And you can see a little bit more. So, there are these results by called quasi-split groups. So, quasi-split groups. What's this player? Of type D4, E6, and D7. So this essentially terms of NGO. I think it's separate, whatever. So that's pretty much all there is. If you need the whole information, reference, etc., actually rubber would be something. I mean, during this project, this has been my personal life. So, yeah, everything's there. You can find all the results, all the proofs. So, pretty nice stuff. And okay, so that's a conjecture as it is. But as Diego told you, we want to weaken this conjecture so that it becomes more flexible. So, we do not concern anymore with rational points, we don't like rational points, we want to work with Rational forms, we want to work with single cycles. Why? Because single cycles can be interpreted in terms of k-theory. So, let me now state what the weak Sausman dictator tree would be. And well, by weakening it, I don't want to say a rational point. So I want to say that x has a zero cycle of degree one. And that's a weakening of the conjecture. And that's a weakening of the conviction. Sure, that's great. And, well, in that case, then I can add two of these here. There's something else that's known. You can take KHGs of type E8. You can add E8 if you care about zero cycles. This is G once again. And you can also add D4, so it's D4th. Actually, we asked the expert, it seems to be well known, but nobody has written it. No, but nobody has winning it. So we give a short proof. But yeah, it's also okay for D4 if you are caring about zero cycles and not just points. Okay? Now, one last, I'm going to call it recall from last talk. So if you fix a k variety and an integer q vector more than zero, well then we can define this. Well, then we can define these norm groups mq x over k, which definition is the group generated by the norms of the whole group of L and leaves for all L's such that X has a rational product of L. This, of course, is a subgroup of the K, affiliate of K. Okay? And so now the key observation. And so now the key observations to keep in mind, to actually convince oneself that this is a good path if you want to weaken these conjectures, want to weaken these properties, accounting rational points to have actual deophantine properties that may characterize cohomological dimension. Well, they are the following. First of all, if you have rational points, well, then you know, trivially that the poly holds, right? So this will be equal to this. So, this will be equal to this because you can always take the norm from k to k, which is the identity of the norms. So, this is stronger than this. Right? Second, observation of the same kind. If you have the equality for a given Q, well then, it's not going to sit there, so I'm going to write down, then you get it for superior to be. And why is this so? And why is this so? Well, it's simple. I mean, K-theory, Table didn't mention, but it counts with a lot of properties, including Kappa product. Just put your tensor products and put them together and get to higher K-theory groups. So yeah, you can read the definition and see that if you make the Kappa product a generating theory, you get everything. So easy to prove, it's just an exercise on K-theory. To prove that the equality in degree Q implies the equality in degree Q plus 1. So this is stronger than this. So this is stronger than this. So in particular, the stronger one is 0 and 0. x over k is equivalent actually to k0. Okay, of course. This is equivalent to x having 0 cycle of G 1. So those are the key observations to keep in mind about these normals. They really first weaken the normal. First, weaken the notion of having a rational point two, having a zero cycle degree one, and then generalize to higher degrees. Great. So there's a second part of the title, not only service conjecture two, but there are these transfer principles. This is actually the subject of the talk. So I really want to be quickly done with Series Conjecture 2. It's the motivation. It's what brought us here. But what I really want to tell you is about the transfer principles. So let me go. So let me go straight to the result. Let me state the main result. I'll put it here. So the main result we got. Oh no, well, before the main result, of course I shouldn't. I think I left a space. I should use it. Which is exactly what Devo hinted at. So he told us, yeah, you can generalize sales conjecture one by replacing homological dimension more than a small equal than one. small equal than one by small equal than q plus one and having this property for homogeneous spaces in general. Okay, so let's just follow the same path. So let's just take exactly the same thing. And okay, so for every k, now I'm going to say higher. That's conjecture two. And we're going to say then that for every field k become logical dimension smaller equal to q plus two. dimensions more equal than q plus 2. And for every semi-sample simply connected group g for every g torso, now I want to replace this, but this again, 0 is equal to b1 is exactly this, it's the equality at level 0. So we just have to replace it by mq max, okay, equals kq. So this is what we expect. This is our proposal. This is our proposed proposition of a higher version of Sales conjecture. And now I can actually give you the result that concerns this conjecture. So this, of course, is with Diego. So we have two parts. Part A says essentially what we can get from this picture. Get from this conjecture, and it says it goes like this. So, let me put it in a conditional way first. So, weak sales conjecture two, if you manage to prove it for countable fields of characteristic zero, well then you get everything you want. And I don't say it. Higher circumjector 2. So this is a conditional result. So it explains that the highest rest and vector 2, in some sense, is, well, it's not much difficult, not more difficult than the weak circumstances. This implied immediately. And actually, we can reduce to the nicer fields. Counterall tails of crouch ACC. So in particular... Sorry, excuse me, what is the weak circ conjunction to just replace rational components by zero cycles of degree one? Rational means by zero cycles of degree one. Okay? So, yeah, what I mean is, I could have put it the other way: higher switch conjecture for q equals zero implies higher stress conjecture. Okay, so that's what I'm saying. In particular, if you take into account the list that's still here, well, you get an unconditional result. Okay, so in particular, higher, so let's continue to poles. Two poles for types, well, almost for all types, but D6 and E7. But there you have it. AN, BN, C and DN, including D4, F4, D2 and AE8. You got the same conjecture now for all those terms. So that's the first result. The first result we managed to get, but there's a part B to this theorem. Since we were, we started realizing that maybe the good point of view was focusing on moving fields and not just moving groups. We tried to see: okay, can we say anything about the original conjecture? So this higher serres injection two, isn't it more like higher or weak searching? Yeah, technically it's a yeah, it's a higher version of the weakening, of course. But it's the only one you can state. I mean no, I get that, but it's just somehow the fact that there were serious conjectures about having very long points. No, indeed, indeed, you have to moving back to remote. Yeah, uh the point is that yeah, K-theory you can you know Yeah, K-theory, you can work it prime by prime, and that's a thing you can do with zero cycles. You cannot do it with rational points. It is more difficult to work with volunteer points. So for me, it's natural to think that you cannot generalize volunteer points to that extent. Well, this would be something highly non-appealing. It's not K-theory at all. Let me put it that way. But yeah, so we are generalizing the weak conjecture. Are generalizing the weak objection. But as I was going to say, we do have something to say about the original conjecture. So that's for a beat. And what we can prove is the following. Well, it's in the same vein. If you have the original, that's conjecture two, four countable fields of characteristic zero. Well then, Well then, you get the conjecture in G. So, as a corollary, the result by Germi-Franks and Tino, now you can derive it immediately from parallel ambience results. Both results work on a type-by-type basis, I will get, and you will get that once I go into the proof. But okay, so those are our main results. But once again, the point here. The point here is to actually convince you that the transfer principles have their own interest. This is the main application. So let me present you what we call transfer principles. There are four of them. I'll just say them outright and then I'll start making comments. So they are called several chromological dimensions, okay? That's our point of view. The original way to attack Way to attack Sales Conjecture 2 was okay, so we got these classical cases where you actually grab the algebraic objects that are associated, quadratic forms, Hermitian forms, central simple algebra, etc. And you derive consequences on this context. And then the more complicated groups, usually what you try to do is find subgroups, find production of structure for your torsions, so you can get them to subgroups that you actually understand. But the point is, you're always But the point is, you're always moving within groups. You fix a field and you move within groups. Now we're doing the others, fixing a group and trying to move within fields. So that's in our transcendence. So these transfer principles will concern only fields. Oh no, first transfer principle. How to go from uncountable to countable fields. Okay? Fields. Right. Right. So, let K be a field of chromological dimension delta and let K0 be a subfield that is countable. So countable subfield. Okay? Well then there exists an intermediate subfield that we call k infinity that is countable. That is countable as well, and that has the correct homological image. Okay? You can always find, if you are an uncountable field, and you have a sub-field where everything is defined, whatever your problem might be, you can find a good intermediate field where you have the right quantity. Okay? Now, transfer principle two. Transfer principle two, this is probably the hardest one from positive positive to zero characteristic. Okay, so what's the setting here? Usually what you want to get from positive to zero characteristic, you have your field of positive characteristic and you construct a discretely valued field, a completely discretely valued field, but what is the field? Well, the one you had originally. You had originally. Problem, hypological dimension, growth. So you want to avoid that growth. So, how would you go about that? Well, take k tilde and k discrete evaluate field field of characteristic zero. Okay. The residue field K and well assume that the chemological dimension of K is delta. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Let's just feel K countable this important. It's a technical problem. We have to assume countable, but thanks to this, this is not very complicated and it's not a both hypothesis. We've come out to. Weak how much can they mention delta? Great. Then we can prove that there exists a field that we call k it's not actually dagger. I don't know how to draw daggers. Okay? So k dagger over k tilde. That is totally rammified and with chromological Common logical dimension delta. Okay, so we can, so then you have a complete, it's not discretely valued anymore, of course, but a complete valued field with the good, with your original resting field and with the good homological function. So we would expect to use these in different ways. But now, that's principle number three. Principle number three. So we presented higher versions of sales conjectures. So you would, and here's the condition of the cell that tells you you prove the lower case and you get all the others. So you need a tool that can take you from higher to lower chromological dimension. So how one would go about this? Okay. So if you take a field, has a central chromological dimension, you want to lower the combinational dimension, well You want to lower the complementary continuation, well, just take an extension, right? Take the algebraic closure, you get to zero. But yeah, you want to keep some information that reminds you of the original field you were working with. So in this context, the information we want to keep concerns norms. So we're going to try to build fields, extensions of smaller chronological dimensions, but that keeps information concerning norms. And now we have to get technical. Technical. So we have to take L special fields. So this is just fields whose only finite extensions are L primaries. So the Galo groups are pro-L groups. Car chasing zero would become, next to this, is number one. Okay, car chasing zero, countable, no problem. And what else? Yeah, we have chromological dimension. Nilk. Okay, well then for every small x of k, there exists an extension, k sub x of k, algebraic extension, of course, it's going to be infinite. It's not finite. So what's the point? Well, first of all, it has. Well, first of all, it has strictly smaller homological dimensions, it's a good thing, and it reminds you about x in the following way. So, in such that x is a universal norm. And what do I mean by that? Well, x is a norm for every finite sub-extension L that becomes plot to it. Okay, so it's an infinite extension, but whenever you take a finite thing in the middle, x is always 1. So that's how it reminds you of some information you have in the field. So you love the Kromological dimension and you keep some information about the original thing. Right, so I'm missing one transfer principle. And yeah, looking at this, it looks too technical, you wouldn't know how to use this. But the point is that this. But the point is that this particular theorem is tailor-made so that you can apply it to the norm rules that we are concerned with in the context of high SLS conjecture. And also in Karton-Kusomaki's conjectures. We do have applications of translations to Karton-Kusomaki's conjectures. But all these get appeared more clearly when we write down the fourth and last transfer principle. principle which is a transfer principle for normals okay which is also it is also in the same spirit we want to go from higher to lower chromological dimensions so now it's going to be a countable field of cartridge zero once again right and with the good quality of the bench okay so delta Okay, so delta. And now you fix a number which is 0 and delta and a variety, x over k, such that you have some information on the normal of the variety, but not for fields of collateral dimension delta, but for fields of smaller collateral dimensions. What do I mean by that? Well, I want n cube of x over L. x over L to be the whole group of L for every algebraic extension with homological dimension smaller or equal than delta minus R. Okay? Well then, what can I comply? Then I should get something at the level of K and the do. But the price raised, you got to shift. Shift the degree of faith very early. And this makes sense. This goes along the spirit of Adrian Peteraki's original conjectures. If you want to state something in a higher level of generality, mean considering fields of higher chromological dimensions, or more fields, well, you're going to pay the price, you've got to ask for something weaker. Of course, going up in the degree of the K-theory is something weaker. That's what they that was one of the key observations. That was one of the key observations. Okay, and this is named for the applications we had in mind in the context of sales conjecture. So now, yeah, as I told you, starting at 30, right? Let me quickly tell you how to apply these results in the context. In the context of our results. So, yes, all A is not there anymore, anyway. So, let me start with the B that I just missed. So, these two transfer principles, uncountable to countable plus positive characteristic to zero characteristic, they immediately give you better B we're considering A. Why? Well, you can see that That, um, what do I want to say? Uh, yeah, this is the really important part. Okay, so you want to prove it first. Okay, you want to prove a seller's conjecture for any field, okay? You assume you have it for countable fields of catching zero. Well, the transfer principle one that I just erased tells you that whatever symbol you have, well, it is defined over a countable extension. So you build this new extension. So, you build this new extension, this new field of the good chronological dimension. Everything lives there, you apply the hypothesis, the double. It's immediate. So, this GP1 gives you immediately the answer for all fields of characteristic 0. Now you want to go to a positive characteristic. And it's the same thing. You give yourself, okay, you apply TP1 to prove that counters in characteristic P imply any flow in calculus CP. So you are reduced to the context of this one. And here, Of this one. And here, well, you can apply some big gas here, so I'm going to say that. Yeah. So this application uses, I'm going to say that, right? The draft big set for DVRs. It's a classic result, but it's still a big gun. So this is Lisne Lich, if I'm not mistaken. Oh, complete VS. Sorry, forgot it. Completely. Sorry, I forgot the word. Important. Of course. That's the point. That's why it's classical. Yeah, we use that one, though. So yeah, you get your characteristic P field countable. You construct this one and you get this field with the good chromological dimensions. So all you have to do now, given a torso over the first field, you lift it to a model over the evaluation ring, and then And then you go up here, it has points, but if it has point here, it has points at a finite level. So you are still in the context of a discretely valued field, and you can apply what needs to make the information broke down. It's quite short, as a proof function, once you get these two. Okay? And yeah. So the second application is TP1 plus TP4 implied small a. By small A. And I'll remind you: small A said: if I got self-management 2 for zero cycles, the weak one, for countable fields of catches is zero, then I get all higher versions. Okay? So, again, how would one do all this? Well, sorry, I mean couldn't exactly want to group the uh all the Sure, but you start you set on the residue fields and you can always find a model of a So, you can always find a model of a GBR. You're starting with a. You start over the residue field and you lift it to a model, you can choose that. Yeah, we're in the good direction. Yeah, so maybe I misunderstood, but when you wrote part A, what I fully said was that if you have sales conjecture to weak for K160 and comfortable, then you Composible, then you have higher conjecture for this game. Not for any film. So, but so what you say is that if I have for every field, I have for every film. It's not field for fields. No, no, it's more complicated because look at it yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at this field. Exactly. This is the key point. And yeah, you cannot go K by K. You have to take all fields into account. That's the point. We're moving fields. We're not fixing a field. We're fixing a group. Or in this case, a type. You can go type by type. So, yeah, yeah, you have two movie fields. That's the point. That's the whole point. Okay? So, this one is interesting, though. So, okay, once again, TP1 allows you to always assume that all your fields are countable. That's essentially it. And well, this one, you can see, it's tailor-made so that I want something in Q. Okay, so I can go down and ask, okay, do I have something in? Down and ask, okay, do I have something in lower degree? Yeah, of course, I have it in degree zero. That's my hypothesis. I have weak surface contextual. And then I get in it. Well, you choose here r equal to delta, and that's it. You get it. Zero plus. You get it in the good Carlogon. So that's it. You might notice that I didn't use the number two. So I'm proving something for characteristic p-fields without using transputable two. And that's a nice slide. And that's a nice fact. You can use this one, but it's actually longer. Now, why is this? That's the problem of conjecture 2 in the sense that it fixes the commodity dimension and you cannot move. The higher version allows you to move. It's a whole set of statements for all commodial dimensions. So you give yourself a field of characteristic P, commodial dimension delta, you have a model problem. It has commodial dimension delta plus 1. Well, in the higher context, this is not a problem. The higher context, this is not a problem. You have a statement on delta plus one, and you use it, and it goes down smoothly. So that uses, this one also uses data mixer, of course, but it also uses residuals. And mil note. So you add that in, and you don't need translator. So this is an easier statement. And this is the hard one is TB2. And you see the hard one is TP2. So sorry. Okay. Not at all, you have to complete. Not at all. So yeah, you have to apply TP. I mean in this context for instance, so you have to apply TP1, then TP2, then TP1 again. Yeah. That's a good way of ordering stuff, but it works. Okay, but yeah. So that's why I said you first read for all skill subcrafts in zero. Of craft is in zero. And once you're done with that, well, you can apply this one with double. That's the logical order of zero. Alright, we have a few minutes, a bit more minutes. Great, so I have some time to give you some ideas of the proof of these four statements. I probably won't do the four of them. Okay, I'm going to start. Sorry? Yeah, that that's the point. That's the I'm going to set exactly there. The point is that's exactly the point. This one is tailor-mix, so that this one works. It might be useful in other contexts, I guess. That's what we kept in and we presented here. But yeah, for our purposes, the important one was that one. Okay? So let me show you how one. Okay, so let me show you how one has it. So, first of all, we're working with K-theory when a statement like this. K-theory is a torsion group, so you can reduce to the L primary part. So reduce to the L primary part of, well, theory. And that essentially tells you that you may assume after you. That you may assume after you write everything down that k is L special. So that's good because that's a technical hypothesis on 2 to 3. So you can assume K is L special. Well then, what do you do? You work by induction on R. So keep in mind that R equals 0 is just a tautology. So that condition is exactly this one. So that condition is exactly this one for conzier. So you can start somewhere. Okay, um now, what do you do? Okay, so you want to prove this equality, so you take a symbol here. You want to prove, we're going by induction, so you only take a symbol with one more variable. So you take, what you call a bar, a symbol, a1 up to aq plus r. Plus R in the K-theory of degree. You want to prove that it's a sum of norms coming from the extensions, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so what do you do? You consider the field that TP3 gives you. So you call K prime this field A Q plus R. So you take that little number, that element in the field, well, and you apply this here and there. Well, and you apply this here and there, so you get an extension such that this is a universal norm for every sub-extension. Okay? Well, now, so this is us in transfer case form. So this, after a while, tells you, well, it tells you immediately, this is the induction hypothesis, essentially, that x over k prime has the good equality. Equality. Okay? In degree, one less, because this guy has degree, has homological dimension, one less. So now, so this anequality of norm groups at the level of an infinite extension once again. Once you work down the definition and see what it means, I can write everything as a product of norms, blah, blah, blah. Everything's finally generated when I'm fixing a certain thing. So, in the end, you can actually prove that. Actually, prove that the symbol a1 up to aq plus r minus 1, I'm taking away the last one. Well, this guy is in a non-group, lives in a non-group x over L for some finite L over K. Okay? And of course, yeah, I'll write it this way. Okay, inside K. Inside k. That's why it's finite. So now that it's finite, well, I know then that this last element in the symbol is an order. Okay? So putting everything together now, but AQ plus R is a norm, right? From L. From L. So now you write what this means. So you know that this symbol, when you erase the last one, you can write it down as a sum of symbols coming from this extension, from L, right? You just do the cut product with the guy that gives you the norm here. And then you apply the norm again. Normal phenomena is another property of the norm groups, of the norm defined by Cattle. And yeah, so direct computations. So you have some direct computations. Computations, and you get well, essentially, yeah, A R is where you want. Okay? That's it. So that's how TP3 implies TP4. And that's how, so you can go down from any cosmological dimension to any degree in K-theory to zero-degree in K-theory. And that's how weak itself conjecture applies, the higher. The higher syscon temperature. Okay. So that's for how TP3 implies TP4. Let me talk about TP1 for a while. This is my favorite one. So for simplicity, assume that the characteristic is zero. It is really the same for the characteristic P, but since the definition is more complicated for common. But since the definition is more complicated for comparative dimension, it gets changed. But the ideas are the same. So now, what I'm going to do is fix, well, I'm going to fix k bar over k because I'm going to take composite fields and want them all to be in the same position. And I want to fix something else. I want to fix by tension. I want sigma 2 that goes from n to n squared. To n squared, it's got injection such that sigma 1 of i is normally not i for everything. Okay? So if you think about the classical snake-like bijection between elements, it's where it works. That one works. You can pick that one. But the only thing we'll need is that particular code. So now, having that thing. So now, having that fixed, oh yeah, I need to fix one last piece of notation. So, for every sub-extension between k0 and l, okay, so recall, k is the arbitrary field, k0 is the countable subfield. I want something in the middle, okay? I want to build an extension in the middle. So, for any sub-extension, we're going to denote define. Define the following set. So curly E of L, E for extension, I guess. So it's triples M L A, where M over L is a finite extension. Okay, what else do we want? Well, L is a finite number and A, it lives in H delta plus one. H delta plus 1, m mu l tensor delta plus 1. So why do we care about this set? Well, these are the kind of signals you want to kill if you want to have a chromological dimension delta. Classical criteria for chromological dimension tells you that if all of these are trivial, well, you have the good chromological dimension. So we want to analyze extensions and we want to make sure that all these are trivial. That's it. That's why we need those things. Okay, and the important remark is that this is countable. Is countable if L is countable. Okay? If L is countable, finite extensions are countable, it's just the models. Primaries are countable, that's okay. And these, well, it could be difficult to read at first glance, but let me throw a bazooka in. By Block Cato, this is just H1. So yeah, and H1 is just K star module. So yeah, K star L star, sorry. L star, sorry. Well, M star is. And M star is countable because M was. So anyway, it's countable. That's important. Right, so now we define L1 to be, well, our base location is 0, and we construct a tower of sub-extensions of our big k as follows. Asterisk. Okay, so what do we do? Okay, so you assume the LIs are defined at some point and you consider a triple that I'm going to call Mi Li Ai. And where do I take this triple form from? It's, well, it is defined as the Sigma two ith of curly E of L sigma one. Okay? So you got your L I defined. Sigma one of I is an order, so it has to be defined. I'm affected by tower. Then I have a list, okay, and I go I take the sigma two of i term of that, and I call it list. Okay? So that's the one we want to kill in the term. So that's the one we want to kill in the tunnel. And at some point this thing will buy some tail and work much better. That's why I love this order. It's still going to get. Anyway, so you know that your homological dimension is delta, right? So this implies that if you take this symbol AI right there and you restrict it to mi composite with k, well, Composite with k, well, it has to trigger us because it's already triggered on k. It's a finite extension of k, right? Well, now this, again, is a highly infinite extension of k0, right? It's a highly infinite extension of mi. But of course, it just gets trivialized, it gets trivialized at some finitely generated level. So this implies that A restricted to mi times mi plus one. LI plus 1 is 0 of some finitely generated extension Li plus 1 over L i. And finally generated over countable hits, of course, countable. So that's how it works. And of course you end by defining K infinity as the union of all the LI's. Of all the LI's. So, first things first, this is countable. Of course, I'm just thinking a union of countable fields. And secondly, so I want it to have the right monologual dimension, so I need, again, to kill symbols of this type. So let's take such a symbol. So I need to take A in H delta plus 1 of M mu L times delta plus 1. So delta plus one with m over k fin. The criteria for homological dimension needs you to work not only with the field itself, but with every finite extension. So you take that, okay? So this is this here for some finite extension of k. Here for some finite extension of k, but again, okay, it's a really infinite extension. Everything's defined at a finite level, at a finite generated level. So essentially, we know that A lives actually, in H delta plus 1, of, well, Mi, mu L times 3 delta plus 1, with Mi a finite extension of some Li, or some I. Right? This is just an infinite charm, but at some point, This is just an infinite time where at some point everything is defined. So I can take a finite extension over. Right? For some time. Okay, and here comes the magical step. So, now the triple, Mi, L, the only fixed. And this particular symbol I just fixed, that this, well, this is the J element of Of E Li for some J. And having that in mind, well, this implies immediately that A restricted to Mi L, this is the magical, sigma minus one of ij plus one, that is a failure. By construction. If you actually follow the definition, it takes a while. You can convince yourself that it's exactly the point. That is exactly the point. I mean, we have just constructed this thing in a way such that at this level, which is bigger than i, it will get zero. So, and that's it. This, of course, sits inside m, so we have proved that a is zero. And that's it. Well, that's how you prove tp1. So it's, I don't know, I just like this argument. Even though, once again, it's not the volume. So let me, yeah, I have only like four or two minutes left. Yeah, let me say some quick, I'll just write one sentence about TP3. So similarly, you order finite extensions in the sense that you put them in a list. sense that you could put them in a list, M1, M1, M2, A2, etc. And construct a tower. You don't need this weird sigma over here because you're only taking algebraic essential. So you're only considering finite else over k. It's finite over finite, it's just finite. So you can just use one list. In this case, but here comes a big gun. We use suslim and we call it skits called bits. Public ski or bits results on splitting varieties. So you get to do very precise computations using these very useful tools to construct a tower as before. So the point is you want to keep being a norm and well splitting variety actually tells you when somebody is a norm or not. So you use this Well, you use these tools to actually find an extension that will make you a norm while at the same time, well, you're killing symbols using the list trick. Okay? And finally, let me talk about, and you see this is a difficult one, this is the one we're probably most proud of, which is the one that allows you to go from characteristics P to characteristics 0. Okay? So this one. So this one, it goes the same way. We want to construct a tower. We do use this particular double index tower thing. It's the same argument. But the point is now, so you want to construct totally ramified extensions that will pile up in a nice way. Okay? So here, yeah, I'm not going to write that down because I don't have the time. There's an argument for playing with L collogical dimension for L different from P. That's an easy statement. That's an easy statement. You can build a nice total run by extension that is of L prime to P degree. So now you want to do totally run by P primary extensions to deal with P comological dimensions. So here the key proposition is the following. I'm going to write it down completely. This is a little bit ticky. Anyway, so k tilde k p and delta as above. And delta as above, as before, as in T2. You take L over K a finite, I know it, a finite Galois extension. Of course, this gives you a Gala extension L tilde over P tilde, right? So finite, unmummified, okay, and okay, so technical assumptions. Technical assumptions. These are not really complicated, but you must assume this for technical reasons within the proof. You want to assume that the residues of the symphony, it's not a problem. And finite fields, this is no. So this is classic. You want to assume that you have p is root of unity, and you want to assume that you have square root of minus one if p is two. Then the proposition says that before every says that for every A in. So now we're dealing with, we change from karmology to K theory logical P, it's essentially the same thing, but it's easier to work with this because we have an explicit description by count of these things. Well, for any symbol here in K-theory module P, for L tilde, there exists K tilde prime over K tilde. Tolato ramified P primary such that you can kill that particular C. A equals 3 equals 2 K prime. I will tilde. So you can kill your over the K theory of any finite extension and you can kill it with extensions that come from below. That was the hard part of the truth. That was a really, really hard part of the proof. But that is the Of the proof. But that is the key step to actually making your tower work. Okay? So, proof, I just want to write this down: six pages of horror. Computations. It's hard. It's hard, it's tricky. There's a lot of tricks involved. There's a lot of really interesting things behind, but it's really technical. It uses this explicit description. It uses this explicit description by Cato of the K-theory module P of a complete discretely valued field with respect in terms of the differentials of the recipient field that it's chemistry. But yeah, well, I guess I'll stop there. Thank you very much. Thank you. Any questions? Should make it smart, right? For what, sir? For the application, when you apply the using um what do you mean unrunify? Where sorry? My question is that is it is it uh unarmed similar in this project. It's unrunif what do you mean I don't want to say unrannified sense. No, no, no, you're notified in the sense where that uh P is a P is a of visualized parameters of the Visualize that proof. I don't know, you can take any. I don't think. Because if you're the results IP5, it's hidden there. It's hidden there. Actually, yeah, the description by cat actually needs this. It needs the P to be there. So actually, you immediately get away from the case where. No, no, no. Explain the distribution by catching needs this guy to be here. So it's immediately. P is not a uniformizer, but you have to keep track of the development of P, and you have to keep track. It's important the description, yeah. And it was really a problem. At some point, we were binding our tailware, we would go up, but the ramification will grow, so the description gets more complicated, and the boundary you want to get goes away. So yeah, it was a good one until we got the result. But it's highly technical, but no, you don't need to be in the base case. You can be anywhere you want. Anywhere you want. Just a remark for countability of Galois topology group. It's much easier than blockato, right? Because HILM, it's a direct limit of finite group of indexed by Galois extension. Contable if the field is wrong. No, it's actually not the need that you need. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Of course, of course. I like to use big girls sometimes. Big yellow subjects. So, what you consider as another conjecture about one rational? I don't do any of your results out of the check. To be honest, I have no idea. Uh to be honest, I have no idea. This is really really recent. Actually, we TP two, we pinned it down uh when Diego visited me in July. So uh yeah, uh we haven't thought yet about more applications rather than the one I presented here because but that's actually a good idea. We should look at one of your results is really clouds. The other one is not actually that's uh it's Yeah, you know, actually that's uh it's simply because of this the tool is about our special fields. So you have to work at that level. Uh actually this result if you recall it's only it's for Carlton fields, yeah, it's for Cartesic zero fields. I mean you could take away Cartesic zero if this thing was written in Cartesic B. So people in Cartesic B Cartesic 2 might be doable. There's a lot of specialists in Cartesic 2 here. So yeah, it is because of this. Because of this, I mean, you need plenty of varieties to actually keep track of uh of norms and uh well they exist in QRT60, L special things. So yeah, it's not a problem of the method, it's a problem of the particular tool we're using. So if these things are generalizable, and they could be, I don't know, yeah, then you could get more specific results in that direction. Just a naive question. I don't know what myself. I've never thought myself about principle one construction. Could it be done with the use of Hochschetzer spectral sequence or not? What was the use? Principle one. So you construct a countable subfield with a good ethnological dimension. Can it be done with the use of Hawkshaw CERT or not? You're getting K0, so you can take. You're doing k0, so you can take algebraic closure and then look at the house itself, maybe would be or not. I don't think so, in Mini, because yeah, you wouldn't kill an approach, it's about killing a subgroup if you take that approach. And killing a subgroup is difficult because the extensions have to be separated from the ones you want present. Separated from the ones you want to preserve. So just in some way, I guess it you will get to send difficulties in fixed, I guess. So I think it's time to go for lunch now. The next lecture this afternoon is at 1 p.m. Thank you again.
