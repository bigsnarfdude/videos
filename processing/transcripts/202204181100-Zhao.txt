For the first talk of this morning, we have Xian Chao from University Cote Dazur who will talk to us about quantum harmonic accelerator all of the visibility and growth of stable Form. So the floor is yours. Okay, thanks very much. Thanks very much to the organizers. I'm going to talk about the one-dimensional quantum Quantum harmonic oscillators with time quasi-periodic perturbations about almost the reducibility and about the growth of sobolethinome. It's not a really spectral problem, but anyway, there is some almost periodic elements, so I think it's still a really I think it's still related to the topic of this conference. This is based on several joint works with Zheng Guo Liang and Zhao Wengo from Fudai University and Qizhou from China Institute of Mathematics. Okay, I start briefly with some general formulations. formulations. Given space dimension n and for a given and the quantum harmonic oscillator is defined like this. Each narrow is minus Laplacian plus a square potential wave in each direction. It's xj square. It's anyway it's a shading operator. Operator on L2 ion space. Such an operator can be seen as a simplified approximation of the spring oscillator in quantum mechanics. Here, minus Laplacian and the potential, they are related to the kinetic energy and the potential energy in the quantum. Energy in the quantum in the quantum system, respectively. We know that, or we already know that its spectrum is a discrete coupon spectrum. And we know its eigenvectors are super exponentially localized in the space. Okay, this is some general formulation, and we also. And we also define the sovereign space. We call that also HS space. It's a weighted L2 space by adding the weight of its H0 power half S and the corresponding norm is called the Soblet non O H S. normal or hs norm and we remark that the hs norm is equivalent is equivalent to equivalent to this the sum of two l2 norms okay here the first one is the standard is the standard hs norm it can be just we can just interpret that as as the As the derivative of order s, okay, there is L2 norm, and the second L2 norm is the weighted L to norm with the multiplication x power s. The latter L to norm is related to the problem of ballistic transport for the continuous shaping operator. This is the definition of the H. This is the definition of the HS norm. We are mainly interested in the time dependent, this time-dependent equation, it's a linear equation. And for the linear operator, it's defined by H0 plus time-dependent perturbation. Here Here, in this time-dependent perturbation, it could be, okay, we assume that it's a self-adjoint time-dependent classical pseudo-differential operator. Of course, there are some cases we don't have this part, so it's just a time-dependent potential. What we want to know is about the reducibility. The first question is about the reducibility, it means if we can. It means if we can conjugate this equation to a time-independent equation, it means the linear part independent of time. The linear part, the linear operator independent of time. This is the reducibility. And for the solution to this linear equation, for this time-dependent equation, Equation, we ask if its sober F norm is founded because if there is no time-dependent part, just H0, the HF norm is conserved. Okay, so it's bounded. Or otherwise, if it is not bounded, we want to ask how does it grow with which growth rate. Okay, this is the main questions. About this equation, there are already many works. At first, it's about the reducibility and the stability. Here, we mean the stability by the bondedness of the HS operator, HS norm, sorry. And at first, for the time periodic potential, it depends on It depends on time in a periodic way. There are the works of CompesQ and Duclaus, Stobicek. And then about the time cosiport, periodic potential. There are the works of Wayne Wong and Crébert Oman, Crébert Patien, and Cheng Gu Wong and Liang and the Dauph. And Liana and the door. And later for the time course, it's periodic, not only in potential. It's the pseudo-differential operator. It depends on the multiplication and the differential operator. They are the works of Babusi, Montato, Greybert, Maspero-Hobert, a series of works. Okay, these are stability results. These are stability results. But maybe it is more interesting to say something about here we call that as instability. It means here instability, it means just means the norm it goes to infinity as t goes to infinity. We know, okay, at first we know the work of Jean-Marc Delor for the space dimension one. one he has constructed some time periodic pseudo pseudo-defression operator such that there are some solutions for some solutions the hs1 it grows like the t power half s such a growth rate and his proof has been simplified later by mastero and another one And another one is by a bamboo sick repair, Maspero Robert. They have considered such a concrete potential. Just the linear term, the linear with respect to x and the time periodic coefficient sine omega t. They have shown if such an operator, such as for such an such a for such an equation such an equation is reducible it can be conjugated to time independent but if the difference is is for omega different from plus or minus one the norm is always bounded hs norm is always bounded but for omega equals to plus or minus one for any non-vanishing hs initial condition the hs norm condition the hs norm it grows like t powers t power s such a polynomial grows okay this is for dimension dimension one and later for dimension two there are works of laurentouma and faux raphael uh they are there uh they have shown that the polynomial growth okay t power s and the logarithm growth okay I don't want to, I will not talk too much about this. Anyway, this instability, these are instability results only for time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillators. Of course, there are also many other works about the growth of sober norms for other types of Schrodinger equations. Other types of Schrödinger equations. I don't recall all of them. Okay, so now what we are interested in in the perturbation is given like that. It's a time quasi-periodic perturbation. But it's given by a polynomial, a polynomial of degree two. There we see that Okay, there are we see that the concrete form is there are four quadratic terms of the multiplication and the different differential operator. And there are also two linear terms like order two and order one. So we also assume that the coefficients coefficients are sufficiently small. That is kind of time quasi-periodic coefficients, but they are sufficiently small. And there are also, say, two dependents on the real parameter E with some known degeneracy condition. I will not precisely. And here we also assume that this the frequency. The frequency, the vector of the frequency omega, it satisfies such a diffuncting condition. Okay, this is the hypothesis for the equation. So we consider the reducibility. At first, we consider the reducibility in two works. In the first one, we just assume that the perturbation is the perturbation is a quadratic form a quadratic form of the multiplication and the differential okay it means there is no linear term the linear term the coefficients of the linear terms are vanishing and in the second one we consider all the other terms all the terms of the this polynomial and in both works we see the reducibility of this equation for Of this equation for almost every parameter E. But with different choice of parameter E, we can get different reduced normal form, reduced constant equation. Let me go across the form of the normal form and present directly Directly the behavior of the sobleth norm associated with this normal forms. Okay, of course, we assume that for here we assume that the cosparity coefficients are generic, in some sense, generic. Here we have the growth of sober norms. We have for most parameters E, for most parameters E, we have the boundedness of the sovereign node. No matter where if there is the linear term. And for a small subset of E, we can get the exponential growth. Here we see that in both cases, the linear term in the two works, the difference is one. In the first one, there is no linear term. In the second one, there is a linear term. But we see that in the first two cases, the linear term is almost nothing in front of the quadratic term. Term quadratic term okay, it's very weak in front of the quadratic term, but for countably many parameters, if there is no linear term, we can get the t power s growth. If there is the linear terms, we can get okay, we see possible, possible T power S growth. Here, Here we can go back to the normal form because for the count Bolly Mani parameters, if there is no linear term, we can get such a normal form. If kappa is non-vanishing, then we can get k or s groups. But if there is the linear term, we can get uh we can get the we can get such a normal form uh with here uh the constant uta if here kappa and yuta both of them are non-vanishing then uh we can we can get the t power 2s growth here we okay here we assume that the time We assume that the time post-periodic coefficients are generic. Otherwise, the two latter cases, exponential polynomial, will not happen. It means the two latter cases will be degenerated and there would not be growth. It means the non-form should be there and there. It can be related in some formulation. Be related in some formulations to the spectral gap of cross-parallelic shading operator, open or class. Okay, I will not develop too much on it. Okay, this is the reducibility and the growth of sober norm for almost every parameters. Here comes a natural question. How about the zero-measure subset? The zero measure subsets, okay, we haven't mentioned about the dispute. So this question is partially answered in recent work, okay, in a recent work with Young and Xizhou, where we considered, okay, it's also the quadratic perturbation, quadratic about the multiplication. The multiplication and the differential. It is shown that if the coefficients, quasi-parallel coefficients are sufficiently small, then this equation is almost irreducible. It means for a given index j, we can always find a unitary transformation. Transformation UJ, such that this equation is conjugated to this equation, the J's equation. Always constant part plus time quasi periodic part. And with the time quasi periodic part, it could be actually small. Here we don't ask for the convergence. We don't ask for the convergence of the sequence of transformations, so we call that it's almost reduced. Of course, here we remove the dependence of the parameter because here it contains it contains the because here almost reducibility is always true for all the parameters. It contains four measures. Four major subsets of parameters where there is reducibility, a real reducibility. Okay, here this is the conclusion about the almost reducibility. Here, and some remarks: if the sequence of transformations is converged, then the equation. converse okay then the equation is reducible it's a it's a really reducible it means uh with one unitary transformation we can uh conjugate the equation into a time independent one i mean the linear operator is time independent uh it's still a quadratic uh quadratic form okay okay uh and in the previous previous work uh we have uh given the growth rates of this uh reduced of this reduced equation we have shown that uh if here the coefficients a b c it satisfies such inequality Inequality: if this quantity is positive, strictly positive, then the HS norm is uniformly bounded. If it vanishes, it presents the T power s polynomial growth. Otherwise, if it's negative, then it presents the exponential growth. Indeed, here is Indeed, here we can see that the coefficients give a matrix like B tilde, B tilde, S L to R, okay, say tilde minus A tilde, something like that. Yeah, such a matrix. And this quantity is just the determinant of this. Determinant of this matrix. So the determinant of this matrix, when it's positive, vanishing negative, it presents three different types of dynamic behaviors. Then it gives three different behaviors of HS nodes. This is for the reduced printing. We can see that it's always It's always simple. It's always easier if we have the reduced speed. We can just focus on the reduced constant equation and just calculate directly the norm of the reduced equation. But if we have only almost reducibility, not the real reducibility. The real reducibility means for the sequence of uniform transformations, it does not converge. Then, from some details of the proof, we see that for the sequence, in the sequence of the constant part, in the constant coefficients, it satisfies such one, such a concept. Such a condition, such an inequality is always positive. So, with this one, the almost reducibility, it implies indeed an upper bound, a general upper bound of the growth of sobre norm. It's like the HS norm, the upper bound is The upper bound is, it means it's inferior T power S, not gross like T power S, always strong than T power S. And here we have a natural question, is this upper bound optimal? Okay, if it's optimal, can we give some examples to the growth is The growth is actually close to T power S. If it's not optimal, can we improve this one, for example, to be power half s or logarithm of logarithm of S? The answer is this upper bound is indeed optimal. Here we have the The example can be stated like that for a given s, because we calculated the hs norm for a given s and for any function f, we assume that it grows to infinity, but it grows fewer than t power s. With this given s, given This with this given s given and the function f, we can always find some coefficients, time cospheroid coefficients a, b, and c, such that, okay, at first, the growth of hs0 is slower than t power s, it's a general upper bound, and for the hs norm over ft, it's limit super real, it's a super real It's a super superior is it equals to infinity and the limit inferior of the HS norm is finite. So let's let's we try to interpret this argument in a direct way. If we choose, for example, f Choose, for example, f is just t power s over log log one plus t. It can be actually close to t power s, but slower than t power s. With the theorem, we see that there are two sequences of moments capitalized tj and tj and a constant l such that over Over capitalized TJ, the HS norm is always greater than F Tj. And over TJ, the HS norm is always less than a constant M. Okay, if we see that in the picture, try to see that in this graph. If obviously that's this one is T and this one is HS null. And if we have this graph as T power S and some F, okay, a little slower than T power S, it means there are a sequence of points, sequence of moments. It's like that. And for For constant L. Another sequence of moments is inferior L. So it's like we can see such behavior of the HS norm. So we call that as oscillatory growth of the sovereign node. And I think I have only And I think I have only maybe two or three minutes. I just talk briefly the idea of proof. For the idea of proof, the mass strategy is, as the previous works, to take advantage of the exact correspondence between classical Hamiltonian and the quantum Hamiltonian. One, because here this is. here this is why we can only deal with the case where the perturbation is a polynomial of degree two and for the classical Hamiltonian but with this correspondence we can transfer transfer the problem to to the almost irreducibility problem in classical Hamiltonian system and in the classical Hamiltonian system we have the KM scheme of Elliotson Scheme of Elliotson, and by which we can get the almost reducibility for the quasi-erotic linear systems and the quadratic classical Hamiltons. And with this, the T power S upper bound, it comes from here. And to get the solution with specific growth, we use a modified Anosol-Kartos construction to get a special perturbation. This is in. Perturbation. This is inspired by a previous work of Cala Liu-Liu, Xi, and Xi Jo about the anosotic construction on the cross-periodic shield cosycles. Okay, then in calculating the sobolith norm through almost reducibility, we used a technical which is called metaplectic representation, which transforms any, which can transform. any which can transform any symplectic transformations on the linear systems to a unitary change of L2 space. This is some technique points. Okay, I think I will stop here. Thanks for your patience. Thanks a lot for your uh talk. Do you have any questions either on to one of the audience here? Either on to one of the audience here. So I in your introduction, you spoke mostly about absolute differential perturbation w, but then in your results, unless I'm mistaken, w seems to be a differential operator of order two with small coefficients. Is there a way to get similar type of estimates? To get similar type of estimates if you only assume W to be super differential instead of differential. Was that a tech? Is that a technical issue, or it's a specific? I didn't hear your last phrase. Sorry. So it is the fact that you described results of a differential operator W today. Just for exposition, is it a technical issue? How would you go to the How would you go to the to the differential situation? For the so I don't really understand. Well, the example of W gave us this quadratic form, right? Yes, yes, or otherwise, we can also add some negative. Terms. Yeah, but in either case, these are differential operators, right? Yes, but it's a pseudo pseudo-differential operator. I mean, here, of course, here, if we can have only this one, square of the square of different operators is fine. It's of degree two. degree two okay but if the degree it uh it increase it increases uh then we don't have any uh yes we have some well quantizations to to to do that but but it's more complicated for this moment there are not many works about the the general uh differential operator case. Operator case. And can you also reduce the effect of operators with negative order? Do you see the effect of those things? Negative order with negative order, but only for the potential, yes. But for the differential for the differential operator, I'm not sure. Creator, I'm not sure. Because here in the previous works, there are a lot of works about the negative order. It's about X, about the multiplication. Yes, for example, the work of Wi Ming and the Creator of Doman, they are all about the bounded perturbation. It's bounded, but why is on? It's bounded, but while it's unbounded for this moment, not too many techniques. We have other questions for the speaker.
