So give me a second. So okay, so I'm very happy to introduce Buna Marie. He's talking on Honoriette and I'm the speaker question for that information. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. So thank you for the invitation. First, I would like to apologize because I didn't prepare a new talk, so this is an old talk. An old talk, and okay. This is: I have a small health problem, and I couldn't work. So, sorry for people who have already heard this talk. So, this is the title is the same. Okay, it's about the non-oriented Avila Giga functional. So, this is about the Avilaj Giga functional, but a variation of the variation on the Avilaj Giga functional. On the Avida Giga functional, and it's a work with Michael Golmald, Mark Pegun, and Silvia Serfati. So I'll first give a context. So the models comes from models from pattern formation. So you want to describe pattern formation. So in some So, in some physics phenomenon or biology for morphogenesis or patterns on shells, etc., zebras. And there is our various models for pattern formation. And I gave all reference here by Michael Cross and Pierre Hohenberg. And okay, for For this pattern formation, there is a leading equation, which is the Swift-Hohenberg equation, which is a time-dependent equation, so which describes the evolutions of patterns. And it's a quite complicated model with various constants that you can modify. And this model can describe various time-dependent situations, such as chaos or periodic in-time solutions, and so on. Here, we describe a very precise, a very small area of the possibilities. We talk about models which describe 2D stripe patterns, so patterns in the Patterns, so patterns is a form of stripes, and we consider a situation where the evolution model admits a Lyapunov functional. So we have a variational model, and we are going to study this Lyapunov functional. So we are looking for minimizers and local minimizers. Local minimizers of this function. Okay, so to describe patterns for me is this thing, so zebras. And so we want to represent a function f from a two-dimensional domain omega in R such that the function f oscillates rapidly in one direction. So, but the direction Direction. So, but the direction may vary a little, slightly. And a typical period is eta. So we have a speak period, which is typically eta, which is a small number. But again, this is not perfect. The direction varies and the period also may vary a little. So here in the picture, the function f takes only the values one and zero represented by black and white. Represented by black and white. So we consider the situation where the period eta is very small compared to the size of the domain. And we want to a model which describes the slowing varying directions of the oscillations, of the quick of the rapid oscillations. So the idea is to describe the oscillations thanks to a fixed profile. To a fixed profile. So we have a periodic profile P, which is one periodic, and we look for F of X of this form. F of X is the profile at some point theta of X divided by eta. So theta is the phase which and theta of X divided by eta, eta will say at where, at which point. At which point we are in the profile. So, in the previous picture, P is just a function which has value one on an interval of size one half, and then zero on the interval of size, on the next interval of size one half, and which is periodic. So, one, zero, one, zero, etc. So the constraint F, almost periodic with period eta with this and that, it just becomes this. The gradient of eta in norm must be almost one in omega. So we will forget about eta at some point and we write u in place of gradient of eta. So u will U will be a curl-free vector field. So, in 2D, it's just a curl of u, it's just a scalar, this color, and we assume that this is zero. So, with this notation, the constraint is that the u, the curved free vector field u, should be of norm one, almost one in omega. So, I just picture here is a picture of the is a picture of this the this the a vector field associated to to the to the previous stripes okay so this is a description given by some physicists and uh so they they propose a model which is they call the cross new Which is they called the cross-newell model here. And this is this list of physicists with two papers in 2000 and 2009. And the cross-new energy writes like this. So they introduce a small parameter epsilon. And we have epsilon divided by two integral on omega of the Laplace. integral on omega of the Laplacian of the phase squared plus one over two epsilon integral omega of one minus gradient of theta squared squared. So this is just a classical potential with a well on the on S1. So this potential vanishes only when the gradient of theta is of normal. Of theta is of norm one on the circle, the unit circle. And so we see that the first term is just a regularization because epsilon is small. So we will have a strong constraint on the fact that on the condition that the gradient of theta should be of norm almost almost one. And here we have a vanishing constraint term. Sorry. So, of course, if I don't care about the boundary, I can rewrite the boundary condition. I can rewrite the integral of Laplacian theta squared as integral of the squared of the Hessian, the square of the norm of the Hessian plus boundary terms. Okay, this is two integration by parts. And writing u is equal to equals gradient of theta, we recover the classical available functional. The classical Aviles-Giga functional introduced by Aviles and Giga in 1987 and which have been studied a lot from this time. So the Avilesh Giga function, I just rewrite it like this, and you must think about u is just prayer of theta. So it's defined when u is a h1 vector field, h1 vector field in omega and In omega, and which is curl-free. So, this is the condition as u is curl-free. Okay, so this is sad because in fact, we try to find a new model, an interesting model, and we recover already well-studied model. But, anyway, let's. But anyway, let me continue to describe things about the literature, about the Aviliq Giga functional. So we have first important results, which are by on one hand, Ambrosio de Levis and Monte Gazza in 1999, and De Simone, Kohn, MÃ¼ller, and Otto in 2001 about the compactness of sequence. So if you take a sequence. Sequence. So, if you take a sequence with a uniformly bonded Avilaga energy, then up to extraction, this sequence converges strongly in L1. And the limit is still because the limit is of norm one, because this is a strong convergence in L1. So, U epsilon is over, the limit of U epsilon is of norm one and is curl-free. After there has been the studies, the description of the limits of sequences where the energy goes to zero as epsilon goes to zero. And what happens is that the limits are are leaf sheets outside a set which is a locally finite. Which is locally finite. So you can remove a locally finite set of points, and outside this point, the vector field is finite. The vector field is Leapsheet and constants along U. So there are characteristics and on the line starting from X and with direction U of X, U is constant. Constant, so at least okay, and at least when you don't cross the boundary of the domain or a singular point, and the singular points are just vortex, vertices. So there are more precise results about the structure of limits of sequence by Dele Lis Otto in 2003. And the gamma limit, this is a question. The gamma limit is this is the question of the gamma limit of the functional is still an open problem, but it's solved in the case where you assume that your limit object is BV. And here we see the gamma limit is this thing. For u, when u is bv, you have that the gamma limit is given by so u in bv, so u as a jump set, g u here, and the Here and the gamma limit is just the integral along this jump set of the cube of the magnitude of the jump integrated along U and divided by 6. Okay, and you see that U must be of norm one everywhere, almost everywhere, and curl-free in the sense of distributions. So, this is the theorem for gamma conversions. Okay, so I insist here that the limit set is not well known. The vector field U in L1, which are with a finite gamma limit. This set I call A of omega is not well described. We know that it contains the function, the curve-free function BV mapping with value in S1 here, and it's contained in the set of L1 functions which is with value in S1, which are curl-free. So in fact, this set has been more described. more and more more described more and more finally described in terms of in terms of base of spaces by Giraldine and Lamy recently I don't remember maybe in 2018 but we know that the limits are S1 and curl free okay if the gamma limit is finite we have this condition so what we hope so this is a big picture so if everything happens like Picture. So if everything happens as we wish, when u epsilon epsilon goes to u and the avilagui energy of u epsilon is uniformly bounded, we obtain a vector field u at the limit, which is your vertex singularity, which is constant here when. Here, when there are no singularities, and we may have line discontinuities, and this line discontinuities corresponds to curl-free or curl-free in the sense of distribution. So, I represented on the right here. So, this is the jump set, U. On the bottom, you have U minus about. above you you you have u plus and the normal the the tangential part of u does not jump through the through the through the jump set so the tangential part of u is continuous through the jump set so here we have a jump between the angle minus phi and phi okay And phi. In this situation, I will call this a curl-free jump. Okay, so we may have, so I describe the singularities that we can have. So we may have singularities which have a cost. And here I replace this in the context of stripes. So I describe, I do not represent the vector field, but I represent the vector field but also the stripes. I have line singularities, and when I want to compute the cost of a line singularity, so I look at the singularity here between this vector field, this vector and this vector. So when epsilon is positive, here it's no more a straight line, but I have a Transition from this vector to this vector, a slow transition, a rapid transition, sorry, from this vector to this vector. And in the horizontal direction, I will assume that the vector field does not move, does not change locally, at least. So I made a mistake with my picture. Mistake with my picture. So you imagine that in the next slide, the vertical direction is x1. So the vertical direction in the next slide, it will be horizontal. Okay, so I represented the, so we have here is the transition from u minus and u plus in x1. And when we compute what is the what what is the we we consider the the want to compute the cost of a one-dimensional transition so our and that is that uh the u only depends on x1 and so when i write uh u as the components of u u1 and u2 and i say that u only depends on x1 and that u is curl free this means That u is curl-free, this means that u2 is constant. So, here I have a vector field, and it's second component, so the height here does not vary, it's constant. And so I obtain a reduced energy, which is this one, and this is just a Modica Mortola energy. So we have an explicit solution for this, and we know exactly what is the minimizer, and it scales as u plus minus u minus cube. So the cube of the size of the jump divided by six. So this is for 1D transition, and these are the best transition in the case of the avidation. Position in the case of the Avilesh Giga function. We have another kind of singularities, which are singularities here in the context of stripes of pattern formations as they are called they are called target. So, this is a target, you understand why. And the vector field is just a vortex. So consider this vertex or minus this vertex and they are both admissible singularities. And these singularities are curve-free and they have no cost. Their cost is zero in the limit. So we can approximate this by a sequence u epsilon with avilaga going to zero. So So if you pay attention that the terms in front of gradient of u epsilon squared, you have a coefficient epsilon in front of this term. And so compared to the Gings-Borr-Londo energy, where there is a constant one in front of this term. And for the Gings-Borlando energy, we have something, an energy which is in a logarithm of epsilon. The logarithm of epsilon on one over epsilon, which is the cost of the asymptotic cost of a vortex. And so here we have this extra factor epsilon. So the cost of the asymptotic cost of a vortex is epsilon time logarithm of one over epsilon, which goes to zero. So at the limit, this cost nothing. Okay. Okay, but when I looked to Stripe, so this was the situation of the Avilaga functional, but what is noticed by the physicist I already cited is that here we have another situation, which is that we may have half vortices, or they are called U-turns. If I look here at my stripe pattern, my pattern, and if so the pattern is this. And if so, the pattern is described by the periodic profile. But if the periodic profile is even, or a translate of the periodic profile is even, then I don't know when I'm going from the bottom to the top, I don't know in which direction I the I go through the profile. Do I progress in the profile toward the positive axis or towards the negative axis? There is no difference if the profile is symmetric. So here I described, I gave a symmetric profile. So there is no difference. I cannot see the difference. So in fact, So, in fact, if I return to the model, this means that I don't, there is no reason to make some difference between u and minus u, between gradient of theta and minus gradient of theta. And so this is why we may have this, we should admit this U-turn, so this half vortex, this half-vorticide. So, I look at U-turn. So, here, so in mechanics, maybe it will be called one-half discrimination, but here it's not a model coming from mechanics. Let's call it a U-turn. And I try to build a vector field associated with this U-turn, so I can do it. I can do a vector field which is currently. I can do a vector field which is curl-free, but I introduce a gem set. And this gem set has a finite energy. There is no problem. So this still fits in my model, but it fits in the model, but I don't want this to have a cost. Here, this line have a cost. Now you don't want, there is no reason, I'll come back here, there is no reason to see a cost. There is no reason to see a cost here. So we just do the obvious thing: is to identify u and minus u. So I just suppress the arrow, the arrows are the vectors, and I have a description like this. So now I need to make some description of the. Description of the model. I need to rewrite the model with this identification, and I want to modify the model the least possible. So a way to identify u and minus u is to consider here the tensor u tensor u. So I will read. So I will represent instead of considering vectors, I will consider symmetric rank one symmetric matrices, rank one or zero symmetric matrices. So u times are u. Okay, so this is a denoted p because it's a plane. In fact, it's a cone. You just you take the half space and you glue. And you glue again the line. So if you imagine C, you take the space of the half-complex plane with positive numbers with positive imaginary part, and you glue the axis. The axis, the alpha axis r plus to r minus, and you obtain a cone. And topologically, it's a plane, so we call it p. Okay. And the admissible functions are the function v from in h1 with from omega with values in the plane p, so in the this set. In P, so in this set P, which are curl-free. So I wrote curl bar of V equals zero because I need to give a meaning to the fact that V is curl-free. And this is the thing which is not clear. So what is this? So maybe, so I said that when U is a vector field, in our two curl of U is a scalar. of u is a scalar. Here curl of v, curl bar of v will be a matrix 2 times 2. So made of two vectors, curl 1 and curl 2 of v so maybe it's not necessary to read the formulas, but what you can see is that curl one is uh involves uh first order derivatives of V, but is not linear in V. Is not linear in V. Okay, and curl to just same formula but with vectors rotate with written in a base rotated by P over 4. Okay, the important thing is at the bottom of the slide is that when V writes as a U tensor U with U H one with value in R2, then pearl one of V and pearl two of V Of v and curl 2 of v can be expressed as a function of curl u, curl of u. And so we have factors here, but the thing is that curl of u vanishes if and if and only if curl bar of v, curl bar of v vanishes. So, if we want to describe a curl-free function, curl-free non-oriented vector fields or curl-free Vector fields or curl-free, okay, curl free non-oriented vector fields. I said it. Then curl bar does the trick. So there is no canonical way to describe what is a curl-free matrix of this form, vector field of this form. So here we pick one, there are other, we can take other ones. So there is. One, so there is a, and it turns out that it's not really important. The important thing is that you obtain something which is uh which really corresponds to the real thing that is color when V is a U tensor U. So we rewrite the energy, so Avila-Giga energy in terms of V. So we have a formula here, so it's the integral of gradient of V squared divided by. gradient of v squared divided by the norm of v. So no norm of gradient of v squared and the norm of v so these norms are computed as our flobinous norms if you wish or the norms associated with the V as an L2 operator. This doesn't change anything because V is a symmetric one symmetric rank one matrix. Rank one matrix. Okay, and you have the nonlinear potential here. Okay, and the condition is as V is curl bar free and with value in P. Okay. And so this function is chosen so that if U is H1 and curl free, then this energy at U tensor. At u translu is exactly the average Gaia energy of u. So with this, I see that I didn't change the model. The model is the same if for V of the form U tensor U. So at least for vector fields, U embeds in the previous models embeds in this one. So what could be the associated energy of this model? What could be the gamma limit or the let's say the line energy, the limit energy when epsilon goes to zero. So I need to consider to replace S1 where the Where the vector the limit vector fields were of norm one, here S1 is replaced by RP1, so the projective one-dimensional projective space. And then here it's just with the model, it's just the matrix of matrices of the form U tensor U with U vector unit vector. Okay, and the limit I tried, I could describe. I tried, I could describe them the admissible set of limits with which I hope that are the main hope that they are of exactly the vector field which has a bounded gamma limit or the function v in SBV with value in RP1 and I ask And I suppose that curl bar of V is zero, the absolutely continuous part of curl bar of V is zero, and I have jumps, so I may have absolutely continuous part, and the curl bar, the curl of V contains also a jump part, and this jump part should be zero. This jump part should be zero also in terms of curl v. So here V has traces V plus and V minus at the two sides of the jump set. But I can choose, so I can take I can write V plus as U plus tensor U plus and V minus as U minus tensor U minus. say u minus tons or u minus, but I can also replace u plus by minus u plus and u minus by minus u minus. Okay, and there is only one possibility for this choice so that this with the shear so u plus and u minus this corresponds to a curl-free vector field and okay so if if I can if I have a choice if I have a way If I have a choice, if I have a way to choose to choose a U plus or U minus, if this is true for plus or minus, then this corresponds to a Kerl bar-free jump for V. Okay, and the energy that I accept, the naive energy, is a line energy which is the same as before, but here I have. But here I have the jump of u, the cube of the jump of u on the jump set of v. And what is this jump? So this is u plus, plus or minus, u minus, and the plus or minus is the same as this one. So I need, so this corresponds to the sign which gives a a curl-free jump. Okay, so this is a naive possibility. Naive possibility. So let's give an example here because I talk about replacing U by V, the vector field V, non-oriented vector field V, to represent it by a vector field U. So here, what it could be on the less, you have a non-oriented vector field which is Kurlbar free. So Kurlbar V is zero. Bar of V is zero, and on the right, I look locally here. If I choose here U, so I choose U. It should be the E2 here or minus E2. So, here I choose E2. So, I look here to have a jump set, a curl-free jump set. This is minus E1. And I continue again. And when I rotate like this. When I rotate like this, I discover that once I have chosen the values of u on this line, then I have no choice. I have to make this. So when I do a lifting, I replace, I write a V as U tensor U, you see that there are many lines where there is a jump. There is a jump between u plus and my which is uh between uh vector xi and minus xi, which does not correspond to anything. So this just this jumps is just an artificial jump in terms of my model. So there is no cost here. But you see with this picture that it's not a good idea to consider this lifting because it may be very complicated. So let me give two So, let me give two results. So, we have the first theorem, so this is a compactness result, which shows that if we have a sequence with a uniformly bonded energy, then up to extraction, as epsilon goes to zero, the epsilon converges to some limit. To some limit vector field V, which, so since the limit, the convergence is strong, at the limit to obtain a vector with values in P, so sorry, at the limit to obtain a vector with in RP1, so you need a unit matrix, unit matrices and we are so banned. But the things that I want to add here, the limit is not curl bar-free in general. So we lose the limit. Since the curl bar operator is not in error, there is no reason that it passes to the limit when we have convergence in the sense of distribution. So, and in fact, it does not. And in fact, it does not pass to the limit. We have obtained something which is not, in general, is not curl-free. And we have also complete descriptions of zero states. So zero states are considered the previous limits, but when the energy goes to zero as epsilon goes to zero. So the limits of sequence with vanishing energy. Of sequence with vanishing energy limit. So, in this case, this is very close to the avid-giga situation. We have a locally finite set S in omega and in the complement of S V is locally Lipschitz continuous. And in fact, V is constant along characteristic functions. Along characteristic functions, which are given by if V of X writes X say psi tensor psi, so in X on the line passing through X and with direction Xi, V is constant. This is expressed like by this. Okay, and if I have a singular point X naught with in S and the ball B R And the ball BRFX0 is in omega and does not intersect S except at X naught, then I have two possibilities. Either I have a vortex, so V is a vortex centered at X naught, or V is an half vortex. So I will show you a picture. So either I have this situation, a vortex, or I have a half vortex. So this corresponds to a U turn. corresponds to a U-turn. So I have a U-turn in the half of the ball and in the rest of the ball, the field, the vectors, the non-nutrient vector field is Lipschitz continuous. And you see that along n it's constant along its own directions. So we have a very so this is a description. So please can you tell me how many times I have left? How many times I have left? Because I think that five minutes. Five minutes. You started five minutes late. Okay. So, okay. So I will not say anything about what I will jump. Sorry, I'm very late. So I just will just describe why we have non-curl-free limits. non-curl free limit. So this is a situation where here I have at the bottom I have a vector field which is a u minus tensor u minus so e1 tensor e1 so I have a horizontal direction at the bottom so you imagine it's that I think about it at a limit at About it as a limit at y going to minus infinity, but when y goes to plus in infinity, I consider the limit U2, tensor U2. And this does not correspond to a curl-free jump. Okay, here when I'm going from bottom to top, even if I change the signs, If I change the signs, the tangent component jumps because at plus infinity, it's zero, no tangent component, so the tangent is here. The direction of the jump is the jump line is horizontal. So here I have no tangential component. Here I have a plus or minus one tangential component. So it's not curl-free. Component. So it's not curl-free in any cases, but I can build curl-free a curl-free structure, periodic structure. So here you see we have at points A and B towards plus infinity, you see that you have a vortex, a pieces of vortex. Of vortex to vortex, and so they meant this region meets at the blue line, and you have a jump set at the blue line, which is perfectly curl-free. And okay, and when okay, so here we have a triangle ABC, so So in this region here, the vector field is constant and it has the same values given by continuity by the vertex here. Here also this is constant and here you have a jump set also. And on the two other green segments you have jump sets also and that's it. And that's it. You have jump set, and here the dotted, the dashed lines correspond to fake jump set, which is just a change of sign. And so u change of signs, but v is the same. V does not jump at all. And so if I call L the period of this object, so Sorry, so this this this um this drawing corresponds to uh this drawing corresponds to to the limit epsilon. I have already sent epsilon to zero. So you should imagine that I replace this jump set by transition, by 1D transition at a small scale epsilon. So I have a very small scale epsilon. So, I have a very small scale epsilon, and I have an intermediate small scale L, which is larger than epsilon, but which I will send to zero. And when I send L to zero, what I obtain is something which has a finite energy, uniformly finite energy, and which goes to U minus, from U minus to U plus through this line. So through the line passing from A to B. Passing from A to B. And so at the limit, we obtain something which is not a curl-free jump, but which has finite energy. So it's as perfectly, its gamma limit is finite, but it's not curl-bar-free. Okay, and we can, in fact, so I skip this. In fact, we can, if I call I0, the the gamma limit. The gamma limit for a vector field B in B V, which is which is a unit vector field, non-oriented vector field V, which is B V, we obtain that, with other construction for general angles, that the the gamma limit is finite and controlled in fact by the mu mass of the measure gradient of V. The measure gradient of V, and this is very different from the Avid Giga functional because for the Avid Giga functional, this is only true if V is square-free. And here we have completely lost the differential constraint. In fact, the differential constraint has been transformed as a cost. So to violate the differential constraint, Kerl bar equals zero. Col bar equals zero, we pay it by a certain amount of energy. Sorry, your time is up. Can you wrap up? Okay, this is my conclusion. Sure. Okay, so thank you for your attention. Does anybody have questions? Firstly, thank you for this talk. It's clarified many things for me. I have many questions, but the first, if you go back one slide, I'm only going to ask one. I thought this wasn't true for the ability to function on that. If you look at the theorem on this slide, the ability to wasn't true because the energy is. Because the energy is not the jump, it's the jump to the power 3. So you can't control it with the norm of the gradient, even in a medium case. But he's saying that in the Atlas Giga, you don't expect this followed by just a total variation of the right of V because it should have jumped to power 3. Jump of R? Jump to power 3, right? Right, so no, no, no, we don't have jumps to power free. This is not the here, here we have jumps, even you here jumps are allowed, which does not which do not respect the curl-free condition. So the album is in Kavanaugh is what you say. So there is much more freedom here because we are not, we allow that, okay. That uh, okay, so curl free. Uh, will you thanks? Uh, um, I have a second question just quickly. So, if you have zero energy, does it is it still the case you have examples with zero curve? Example you have. Yes, yes. If we have in the zero limit case for zero states, uh the curl-free condition is conserved. So the limits are curl bar free. The limits are curbar free. Okay. Kerbar free. So for the interest of one more here from Amit and then Amit, go ahead. So nice talk. One question I have for you is spectrics would be the application for this sort of problem, except because spectrums have half destinations too. Except your graduate regularization term. Regularization term would not have an epsilon in front of it. In that case, how does the consequences of your model change? Sorry, I don't understand. Maybe my. So, so in your basic functional, you have the term graduation squared, right? Yes. In front of that, you have a In front of that, you have an epsilon which allows you to get these half and plus one vertices. Yeah. Yes, for many real applications, you will not have that epsilon term. That will correspond to the Aussie-Frank energy. If you did not have that, so this is the Ausin-Frank or Gins-Bolando energy adapted for smectics. So, in that case, can you comment on how? Can you comment on how the consequences of your model will change? In this case, in fact, what we prove that if you assume that you have in the case where the limit energy vanishes, in fact, you can prove that. In fact, you can prove that the limit you obtain is the limit of a function with vanishing Guies-Bollandol energy. So there is a strong regularization there. So it means that if your energy limit is zero, then you can drop the epsilon. And the energy is bounded by a constant times the logarithm of epsilon. Okay, so I think I'm afraid we have. Okay, so I think I'm afraid we have to wrap up here, otherwise, there's no coffee break. So, thank you, Benoit. There will be more questions, but anyway, thank you so much again. Thank you.
