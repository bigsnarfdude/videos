We've got twenty five minutes to talk and five minutes of questions, and I guess Flaminia is gonna start the recording soon in a couple of seconds. Oh, yeah, you can go ahead, get started. Okay, thanks. Yeah, hello, everyone. Yes, first I'd like to thank the organizers. Yeah, Flaminia, Robin, Lucian. Yeah, I've been enjoying the talks a lot. I've been enjoying the kind of different backgrounds people are from. Different backgrounds, people are from, kind of different topics. So, because people might have different expertises, I'm going to try and keep this talk relatively high level. So, I'm not going to go in as much detail as this first figure might suggest. So, yeah, I want to start off by kind of referencing my collaborators. So, yeah, I'm going to be talking about the quantum relativity of subsystems. This is joint work with Philip Poohn, Max Min and Locke. Work with Philip Poohn, Max Min and Locke, Shadi Ahmad, Alexander Smith, and myself. So I see that, yeah, Alex and Shadi are here. And yeah, if you want to jump in at any point, please feel free to. And if anyone else has questions, I'm also happy to discuss them. I'm not going to be giving like an exhaustive list of everything that's in the paper. I just want to highlight a few points, a few results, which I think might be of interest for the purpose of this conference. Okay. Okay, um, I don't know either, I know very little about quantum gravity, but yeah, I think there's a few conceptual issues which are interesting in here. I also want to refer people back to the talks of, well, Alex, Esteban, and Marcus already. There'll be a bit of common ground with those. Yeah, so what are we building on? I just want to highlight two papers, because this first paper here by Flaminia, Esteban, and Chaslav, introducing these changes of quantum reference. Introducing these changes of quantum reference frames. I'll kind of explain it a bit. Then there's a second follow-up work here by Augustin, Philip, Flamini, and Esteban, which links these changes of quantum reference frame to kind of constrained system with this perspective neutral framework. And this is also something that I'll be using in this talk and I'll be explaining. Okay, I also want to highlight: you know, historically, there's been a lot of work on quantum reference frames beforehand, quantum gravity, quantum. Beforehand, you know, quantum gravity, quantum information. There'd also been, you know, a lot of work since these two papers on this topic. But this is kind of the kind of concept just for people to kind of map out where we're starting from. Okay, so what's the talk? How's it going to kind of unfold? First, I'm going to talk about the kind of core concepts. Okay, so quantum relativity of subsystems. So, you know, what are subsystems? What are quantum reference frames? What are constraints? Reference frames, what are constraint systems, that type of thing? Then I want to kind of tie them together, case of using some existing results as well. And then I just want to present some results from the paper, which I think are interesting. And then the final section, I'm going to allow myself a few comments on the potential relevance of these results for quantum gravity. Kind of two things. So first I'm going to make a specific comment with respect to Lucian's recent work, and then just a more general comment about the And then, just a more general comment about the nature of subsystems. Okay, so yeah, I'm just going to start off with a few of the core concepts for the talk. So, typically, when you do quantum mechanics, okay, so maybe not in quantum foundations or quantum gravity, but typically the division to subsystems is given. You start with a factorization of your Hilbert space. Okay, so what's a subsystem? Well, there's two ways of looking at it: formally, mathematically. A subsystem corresponds to a tensor factor of your Hilbert space. To a tensor factor of your Hilbert space. And what does that mean out there in the world? Well, the notion of subsystem really is closely connected to locality, to the classical space-time within which we're doing quantum mechanics. Okay, so, you know, in quantum information, let's say you have Alice who has her lab over here. She has access to certain degrees of freedom, right? She can perform certain operation. Those degrees of freedom, she models with a Hilbert space HA. Now, Bob over here has his lab. He can do certain, he has access to certain He can do certain he has access to certain degrees of freedom. Okay, so he has the Hilbert, he models them with the Hilbert space HB. Then H8 and so HB describes the joint degrees of freedom. Okay, so I mean, we have, you know, one often kind of pre-theoretic kind of given factorization of the Hilbert space, but you can refactor a Hilbert space. I think the easiest way to kind of explain this or show this is via examples. Examples. So the first example I want to look at is the case of you have two quantum particles on the line. Okay, so let's say here we have a position basis. So x0, the position of particle 0, and x1, the position of particle 1. Now I can do a classical change of coordinates into center of mass coordinates and relative coordinates. And this induces, okay, this leads to a refactorization of the Hilbert space. So in the new coordinates, I can write Coordinates, I can write the state in this way. Okay, so the first factor is the center of mass, and the second is the relative position. Okay, let's do another example. This is an example I like as well. Now, I'm going to look at two qubits. Okay, and so typically you have this factorization, let's say, of A and B in the kind of computational basis. Okay, so 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, your basis states. Now, in this basis, in this factorization, I can take the fail states. I can take the Bell states, okay, the maximally entangled states, to have them here, and I can refactor the Hilbert space such that 0, 0 plus 1, 1 is mapped to C plus. So this first factor here, C, in slight abusive language, I call it correlated. It just means that, you know, the 0, 0, and 1, 1, these are the same, okay, in each one. And then the plus refers to the global phase. So 0, 0, minus, sorry, not global, they're like relative phase. 0, 0, minus 1, 1. 00 minus 11. Okay, so they're the same, see 0011, and then minus the phase, see minus 0, 1 plus 1, 0 is anti-correlated, they're different here, and plus. Okay, so you see here we have entangled states, and then I've repartitioned, refactored, and they're product states. Okay, so entanglement is dependent on Hilbert space factorization, first observation. The other point I want to make is that given That given two qubits, they're actually continuously many different factorizations of the Hilbert space. And you can actually parameterize them like this. Okay, so what's this thing? Well, u4 are your unit trees in four dimensions. So all possible changes of basis, right? All changes of basis related by unit tree. And you mod out, okay, you quotient out just local changes of basis. Okay, so this like manifold, this homogenous space, is the space of. Um, is the space of all possible factorizations of C2 tensor C2? Good. Okay, so what defines hybrid space factorization? I've kind of explained it in terms of bases, okay, but really, if you want to link it back to the lab, you want to link it back to observables. Okay, and we're talking now about algebras of observables. So, really, it's commuting sub-algebras of observables, which define tensor product factorizations. So, I'll go back to the example from before. Have two particles on the line, okay? Have two particles on the line, okay? Square integral functions on R and square integral functions on R. L2R tends to L2R. This here, we have two commuting sub-algebras. So for particle zero, we have X0 and P0. Okay, these don't commute, but this sub-algebra here, X0 and P0, commutes with X1 and P1. Each element of this commutes with each element of this. Okay, so we have these two commuting sub-algebras, and they define the tensor product, the standard tensor product factorization of the Hilda space. Of the Hilda space. Here I can find a different set of commuting sub-algebras. Okay, so we have the one here on the left and the one on the right. These are two different commuting sub-algebras of the same global algebra. And these define a different factorization of the Hilbert space. Okay, the one I discussed before, the central mass. Okay, next ingredient, quantum reference frames. So what's the quantum reference frame? So, what's the quantum reference frame? Well, what we mean by quantum reference frame here is just a quantum system relative to which other systems are described. So, in the case of particles on a line, let's say I have perfectly localized, three perfectly localized particles, okay, in position eigenstates. I just center my coordinate system on particle A. Okay, that's what it means to have A as my reference frame. So, A is at position zero, center my coordinate system, B is at position. End of my coordinate system. B is at position two, let's say. Okay, so it's you know two steps from A, and three, and C is three steps away. Now I can do a classical change of coordinates, so I can decide, okay, I want to center my coordinate system, coordinate system on B. So B will be my reference frame. Okay, now you know, from the perspective of B, B's at the origin, A will be minus two steps, okay, two steps in the opposite direction, and C will be one step, three minus two. Two. If you extend this chain of coordinates linearly, okay, to superpositions, you get quantum changes of coordinates, quantum reference frame changes. And as was observed in the first, okay, so this was defined in the first paper I mentioned by Flaminias Devan and Chaslav. It was observed that entanglement is dependent on the choice of reference frame. Okay, so if I have a particle, you know, I center my reference frame on A, and then I have B in a superposition of positions and C, if I move into the perspective of B, Into the perspective of B, so I take this change and I extend it linearly. I see that A and C are now entangled. Okay. Now the final ingredient before we start tying stuff together and looking at results. So I'll be discussing constrained systems. So in this approach to quantum theory, you have a kinematical Hilbert space. Okay, so HA tensor HB tensor HC. HB tensor HC, and then we're going to impose a symmetry constraint on it by which we have this constraint, this operator C hat. Okay, and the only physical states are the ones which are annihilated by the constraint. So I start off with this kind of mathematical construction. I now have bunch of states which aren't physical, but then I narrow them down to just the physical states by the symmetry constraint. Then it's a kernel, the constraint. Okay, what's this? It's just, you know, the state to map. States which are mapped to zero, the kernel, they constitute the physical Hilbert space, which morally you can think of as a subspace of the kinematical Hilbert space. As Alex discussed in his talks, there's a few subtleties, but for the purpose of this talk, we can ignore them. So in the preprint, we consider the case where the constraints of the form CA plus CB plus CC. So an example of this would be a total momentum. So PA plus PB plus PC is zero. Okay, so if your total momentum is zero, you can say, I allow all the states of particles. I allow all the states of particles A, B, and C, and now I only look at the ones whose total momentum is zero, and those are the physical states. I mean, this can be generalized, right, to have got constraints which are, if you exponentiate them, give like one parameter group, okay? And so you've seen Esteban's talk, or you might have seen Esteban's talk, okay, where he talks about this more general groups. There's also some work in progress with the following people where we look into this. Okay, so physics. Okay, so physical states are annihilated by the constraint. In the case of momentum, total momentum is zero. If you exponentiate this, essentially you're saying that your system is translationally invariant, because remember, if you exponentiate momentum, you get translation. And an example of physical state, okay, in this case, is this kind of big entangled state, which you may be able to see is kind of translationally invariant. If I like shift A, B, and C by the same amount, I can just relabel the integration. Integration. This physical state is entangled across the kinematical partition. It's entangled across A, B, and C. But this entanglement isn't really meaningful. Because remember, this kinematical space is just kind of this thing we constructed, this mathematical thing, in order to be then able to talk about physical states. Let's be more precise, this entanglement is not gay's invariant. Okay, so why did I start talking about constrained systems? And it turns out you can study quantum. Turns out you can study quantum reference frames via these constrained systems. And this now is a lot simpler picture than the one at the start of the talk, and it explains the core of how you relate constrained systems to quantum reference frames. So what's the quantum reference frame? It's a system relative to which other quantum systems are described. So in this picture, now we start with the physical state, okay, like the one I gave, this entangled state. And we can obtain the state of AB from the perspective of C. Of AB from the perspective of C by conditioning the physical state on C being at the origin, for instance. Okay, so it allows us to go from the physical Hilbert space to the Hilbert space, H of A B given C, which describes the state of AB from the perspective, quote unquote, of C. Similarly, I could just instead descend this way. So I condition on system A and I obtained the state from the perspective of A. State from the perspective of A, B, C. And then the map between these two is this change of quantum reference frame. Okay, so here I've talked about states, they can extend to like the Hilbert space they live in and also to the algebras of observables, okay, the bounded operators of those Hilbert spaces. Good. So, yeah, this is just to give the example from before. So, I have my physical state, okay? It's entangled state. Can people hear shouting? Might close the windows. Sorry, I've never crossed the homeless shelter, so I have lots of like shouting at random times of the day. Okay, so back to physics. Yeah, so we have. Yeah, so we have the disentangled the physical state. Okay, we can condition. So if I fix, you know, for c equals zero, position zero, this is you know, x plus c equals zero, so x equals minus c, I fill in the blanks here, and I get this. So only for a. And you have this change of quantum reference rate. And this behaves as expected. Okay, a few comments. Now we can define this physical algebra, okay, which is the algebra on this kind of physical Hilbert space. On this kind of physical Hilbert space. This contains the physical observables. Okay, so once again, remember there's this kind of distinction between this kinematical stuff, this mathematical structure, which is not necessarily physically meaningful, and we then identify the physically meaningful content. So physical observables. The physical Hilbert space, it does not inherit the kinematical tensor product structure. Okay, so I started with three kinematical systems, HA, tensor HB, tensor HC. What did I do? I said the physical Hilbert space is a subspace. I've chopped a bunch of stuff off. Subspace have chopped a bunch of stuff off. You can kind of see, like, intuitively, that if you take this tensor product and you chop a bunch of things off, you don't preserve the tensor product. Okay, but the reduced Hilbert space, okay, remember how I said we could obtain the perspective of B, for instance, the HAC given B, it may factor into A and C subsystems. That's kind of the question is when does the algebra of observables, okay, on the reduced space A C given B factor into A given B? Factor into A given B and C given B. Okay, so given these three systems, I impose a constraint and then I look at the perspective of B and ask: Does B see two different systems or not? And in most work so far, it's always been, people have always studied the case when, yes, that's true. But here we're really looking at the case when sometimes it doesn't happen. Good. So now you can start glazing over slightly if you're not studying quantum reference frames. If you're not studying quantum reference frames, and I'll like study bring it back to more conceptual stuff. An important point, okay, some details is we can map directly from the kinematical to the reduced spaces. Okay, so HA, tensor, HB, these are the kind of kinematical things. We can map directly to the reduced space, the perspective of C, HA, B given C. And similarly, okay, so we can do this for the algebra, and then for the algebra, for the system A given C, we can also just apply these projectors to the algebra of A. These projectors to the algebra of A identity. First, there's going to be two steps. First, I'm going to assume that we have all this, we look at the perspective of B, and indeed, B sees two systems. It sees A and C. Okay. So let's just say the reduced Tilbert space factors or the algebras factor. The first point is that although, you know, A, C, system C, you know. A C's system C, you know, describes it a certain way, and B describes it a certain way with these two algebras. They may be isomorphic, but they're not equal. By which I mean that if I take the change of reference frame operator and I apply it to the algebra of C given A, I don't obtain the algebra of C given B. I obtain some mixture of these C and A degrees of freedom. This actually, so this sounds weird, and this was very counterintuitive to me. But if you go back to the first paper, product states can be mapped. Product states can be mapped to entangled states under this change of quantum reference frame. So here we're kind of just re-saying it in this algebraic setting, right? There's this kind of like mixture, coherent mixture degrees of freedom. In other words, the tensor factorization does not matter to changes of reference frame. Okay, so the notion of subsystem locality is quantum reference frame. Okay, but now I want to look at kind of the even more extreme case, and I think that's that's kind of. More extreme case, and I think that's that's kind of that's well, I find it very interesting. I said, in most cases studied, you have this kind of nice thing: you have three systems, then you take the perspective of one system and it sees two systems. That's kind of what you expect, right? If you have three particles, you sit on one particle, it sees two particles. If it turns out that you could have, for instance, your three particles, then you take the point of view of B and it sees two particles. Okay, now decide, let's see what's C, you take the point of view, sorry, I've got A, you take the point of view. View, sorry, I've got A. You take the point of view of A, and then it sees, you know, this reduced Hilbert space, which doesn't factor into these two HB given A and H C given A. Can we find now necessary and sufficient conditions for this? Okay. Okay, so this is the final slide where you can like kind of keep sleeping a bit if you're not into quantum reference frames, because now this is a bunch of maths, and I'm going to bring it back afterwards. Going to bring it back afterwards. Okay, so when is it the case that I have two kinematical subsystems and they map to these kind of physical subsystems? Okay, so HA given B times H C given B. Now it turns out it's the condition on the spectra of the constraints. Okay, so I define this sigma AC given B to be the spectrum of C A plus C C minus the spectrum of C B. We have this factorization condition if and only if. If and only if this quantity here is the Minkowski sum of some subset of the spectrum of CA and some subset of the spectrum of CB. The Minkowski sum is defined here. Okay, so maybe one point which is maybe important, the final technical point is, you know, if H, A, C, given B doesn't factor into these two, These two, there might still be some other factorization, right? It just won't be into like inherited from the kinematical subsystems by this projector that I mentioned. Okay, okay, so an example where this fails is the following constraint. I have, you know, PA squared over 2 plus PB squared over 2 plus PC. And if you condition on C, then it sees the two systems. If you condition on A, then it doesn't have this nice. Then it doesn't have this nice tensor product factorization here. And you could kind of, I mean, for people who've worked on this before, I think there's work by Alex, Max, and Philip, which do look at these types of things, but often we consider kind of nicer constraints. And you can see why the spectra are kind of different, right? This spectrum is R, and here we've only got the positive R plus. There's kind of imbalance, which leads to this condition not being met. Okay, so summary. Okay, so summary. Yeah, I mean, in this work, we kind of combine algebraic definitions of subsystems with existing results in quantum reference frames. And we get this kind of quantum reference frame dependence and constraint dependence of subsystems. There's also this nice thing that although you might think that given three systems, conditioning on one system, it would see two systems, this is not always the case. And finally, yeah. And finally, we have this kind of gauge-invariant frame-dependent notion of subsystems and entanglement, which I haven't emphasized too much in this talk. Because, yep, what I wanted to kind of get at with all this is the following. So, I've got kind of two separate points. Okay, so typically, as I said, the tensor product factorization of your Hilbert space, the subsystems, are given by a classical notion of locality, your ambient space-time. Here in this work, we show that quantum reference frames. Work, we show that you know, quantum reference frames and a constraint can also determine a tensor product factorization. Okay, remember, quantum reference frames are systems internal to your physics, right? We're not appealing to some external classical background. Your quantum reference frame, your systems themselves, can in a way determine the factorization, the notion of locality. Okay, so now I'm going to refer to some of Jusson's work. So, what are quantum reference frames? They're changes of quantum coordinates, but they're associated to a specific. But they're associated to a specific specific system. Okay, and so how would I generalize changes of quantum reference frame? Well, at least when I look at this, I say just take an arbitrary refactorization. That would be how I change a quantum reference. The quantum reference frame gives me a specific choice of factorization, right? You condition on this system, it tells you how to refactor the space. But you could just refactor the space without appeal to a system. So, yeah, but I'm not an expert on nuclear. Yeah, but I'm not an expert on Newsen's approach, but from the talk he gave at PI a while ago, he also was trying to inspire himself from quantum reference frames and then define changes of coordinates, which are like changes of quantum reference frame, but no longer associated to a quantum system. Again, to me, this looks a lot like a refactorization of Hilbert space. Okay, so why might this be important for kind of quantum gravity generally? It's based on my limited understanding. Based on my limited understanding, in quantum gravity, we do not want to assume classical space-time as a background. And if we don't have this assumption, how can we define subsystems, right? If we don't have classical locality? Well, here we've seen that quantum reference frames and constrained systems, they provide an alternative way of defining subsystems, a way which is internal to the physics you're doing. Okay, maybe now I just want to state that, say, what's neat about quantum reference frames is that it actually singles out a refactorization. Singles out a refactorization. In general, refactoring is very permissive. Okay. If I allow, Thomas, thank you. Okay. If I allow kind of arbitrary refactorings, I mean, to me, it seems like too much freedom. Okay, I can just transform any evolution to any other. I can transform something non-local, something local, you know, something which has indefinite causal structure, just maps something with causal structure, with definite causal structure. But there's a lot of freedom, okay? There's a lot of freedom. And importantly, I just want to note that the possible refactorings of a Hilbert space are a lot larger than the group of all diffeomorphisms. For instance, if you've got like L2 of R, the group of refactorings of that space is a lot larger than the group of diffeomorphisms on R. Okay, or for a finite set, if you've got L2 of some finite set, then it's a lot larger than the space of permutation. Okay, so I think, yep, I will end there. End there. Okay, perfect. Thanks, Donna. Very interesting talk and perfectly on time. Questions? Flaminia has one. Go for it, Emma. Thank you. So, actually, just have a curiosity. So, when you mentioned that the relativity of subsystems depends on the constraint, I guess that here you're assuming. I guess that here you're assuming that you choose a specific set of relational variables, right? So once you fix that, then it depends on the constraint. But does it also depend on your choice of relational variables? Okay, good. So let me go back. So, yeah, we make use of this projector here, which is, you know, which maps straight from, so it kind of bypasses. Which maps straight from so it kind of bypasses this is something which was new to me. So we have this projector which goes from the kinematical things straight to the reduced ones. I didn't write the form of this projector, but it's essentially written in terms of projections onto the kind of eigenstates of the constraint. Well, like, you know, the constraint is something. So it's directly from the constraint in that sense. Yeah. And yeah, because basically you identify the relational variables by using well, but the trivialization operator, right? And this. Operator, right? And this identifies whether you go to relative coordinates or you can change this realization operator, you can go to relative momenta, for instance. So I would expect it also depends on this, right? Let me check if Alex, Alex, are you here? Are you willing to save me? Yeah, I think, I mean, I think what would I say is that. Um, what would I say is that, yeah, this projection is just basically all of the like states that are compatible with solving the constraint. So, like, but but uh, I'm not sure exactly what the like it does depend on the form of the constraint, and it does depend on what reference frame you choose to maybe trivialize the constraint with respect to, like you said, or project down onto in the page router's thing. So, it does depend, that partition does depend on like the C there. Depend on the C there. I'm not sure if that's getting at what you're asking, though, Tamil. Yeah, so thanks. I think now, Alexa made me realize. So, this choice of relative variables, it actually doesn't really appear here too much. And yeah, because in a sense, we go directly from this kinematical thing down to the reduced space without choosing. Because, yeah, in general, I remember when we were thinking about this, you know, if you take position, you know, relative position, there's lots of different choices of like conjugate momenta you could have for this conjugate variable. Could have for this unit variable, but for some reason that Philip explained to me and I didn't fully understand, um, yeah, we could kind of do away with this. Um, I mean, okay, if because if you choose, for instance, the total momentum as a constraint, then this is translational invariant. Yeah. And then you're basically choosing relative positions, but you still have some choice. Like, so this doesn't compute. So for instance, you could also go to position. You could also go to position. I mean, okay, this is more technical, but you could reproduce also the superposition of translations and superpositions of boosts with this technique. And I think that, and the same constraint, I think, also. Yes. So I think here what happens is once you have this projector, because you remember I was saying this weird thing where you kind of apply the change of reference frame to the like algebra of observables at A and kind of mix this up. Of observables at A and kind of mixes up with B and C, for instance. This is kind of what happens if you would choose the conjugate momenta to be like you know mixtures pb plus pc. But here, really, we're fixing the conjugate momenta. Even if you've got this relative position, you know, xa minus xb, the conjugate momentum would be like this pa, which also works. So I think it fixes them like this. And then there's some deeper reason why this is like kind of a canonical choice, which I didn't fully understand, which was to do with, yeah, some arguments from classical mechanics, which Philip said. I don't know if you remember those, Alex. I, yeah. Do you know if you remember those, Alex? I, yeah, I understand. Yeah, yeah, I'm aware of this. It's just that I mean, this doesn't fully fix that. So, just have some freedom there. I mean, maybe another way to think of it is if you map the observables from this AB condition C onto the physical Hilbert space, they're all defined relative to the reference frame that you've conditioned on. And, like, yes, like if you want to condition on, say, the position or the momentum, you do have a choice in that way. And that would define different. Uh, that would define different relational observations. I believe, yeah, I think. Um, okay, no, actually, I think it should be the same. Uh, but maybe we can talk offline. I don't know. Yeah, okay, we get post-polites, yes. Yeah, I've had a solid block of like five months of teaching since thinking about this paper to now, and it's kind of like eradicated everything from my mind. But I'm definitely happy to chat about it more. Um, well, are there any more questions? Are there any more quiet questions? Because I think we just got into discussion time. So Lucien has some questions. I don't know how do we want to do it, Lucien, because now you are supposed to do the discussion. Do we want to go directly into there? Okay, maybe we should try to keep things on time. So let's move into discussion. You're still the chair at this point. Yeah, no, I was thinking actually, like, if you want to bring the questions that you guys have into the discussion time, since. Guys, have into the discussion time since we are already in it. So we can keep going until the end of discussion time. And I okay, so maybe we should close the previous talk and then. Okay. Yes, sure. Yeah. Let's thanks, Thomas, again. Thanks for the talk. Little cap. And
