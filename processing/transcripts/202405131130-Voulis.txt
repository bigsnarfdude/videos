Already mentioned where we're first of solving Stokes problems with Kraft methods. And I'm going to tell you about that. So what do we have? We start with the Stokes problem, obviously. So you have the operator, the Stokes operator, which you have the Laplace part, and you have the mass preserved condition here with the general G, because that's the way we will set up our traffic space anyway. We will set up our traffic space anyway, and you have your pressure Lagrange multiplier, or you have your pressure physically, depending on what kind of view you have on the world. And of course, you can have to first go to the weak formulation to look at this problem in general. And then this is your weak formulation, then you can discretize this. And the old way to do this is to use finite elements. And then you know that you have things like LBB stability and so on to solve such problems. So, on to solve such problems. And now, this is a criterion for finite elements. Now, you have to go and look how this interacts with an interactive method. So, this is what we're going to solve. And our space, we'll take a DG space, order k for the velocity unknown, order k minus 1 for the pressure unknown, pressure is only defined up to a constant, and you get these jumps and the. Jumps and the averages which you get for a DG method from integrating by parts on all the sides. And this is what your operator, your weak operator on the DG space looks like. And you have to scale it properly with some alpha for this last part. And you have this AB structure with an A block. With an A block in the upper left part, and then you have B and B transpose for the these two blocks, and this is how a setup one problem looks like. And this is set up in your typical finite element space. And in your finite element space, your U and your P live independently of one another. You could, of course, go wild and then for this Cartesian product space, take some very weird basis where you take them independently, but you never do this because. Them dependently, but you never do this because this is crazy. But that's just to fix your thought: that this is actually a Cartesian product of spaces, and you could take a basis as you wish. And we're going to look the B in the trapped subspace of this space. So, indeed, let's do that. So, we have our dogs operator, which is this part, and this part with divergence free, and the Laplace. The Laplace of U plus the gradient of P has to be my right-hand side, projected to the appropriate space because here I'm a degree k, so it falls down by two degrees for the Laplacian part, by one degree for the pressure part, and it perfectly fits in the K-man space. So I project my right-hand side accordingly. Of course, you see that these two are now coupled. My U and my P depend on one another. My u and my p depend on one another. Even imagine this is this is zero. This then this says that my gradient of p is exactly mu times the Laplacian of U. So now in my subspace of space x that I have over there, I have some pairs of u and p that will be part of my transparency. From a different point of view, this is of course exactly what Paul told in a previous uh talk. Told in a previous talk, ah, we have some operator that has to be zero or a given right-hand side, and this operator happens to be the Stokes operator. You just have to forget that this is a Cartesian product of two spaces. So yes, please do forget that. And then you know what's happening. Okay, of course, you have the particular solution in this space, and everything else happens in the space that you get. The space that you get if the zero, that's where you have your linear problem that remains after doing the draft thing. And your solution splits up in this particular part that you do on each of the, let's say, triangles one by one. If you want to do octa eithers, please do. But if you do this on each triangle one by one, you solve this local problem, and then you get a particular. Problem, and then you get a particular solution, and then you have the global problem on this smaller space. And your bilinear form. If we completely forget that this is a Cartesian product, okay, here is my new U, it's the pair UP, and here's my new testing, it's again a pair. And other than that, it's a present operator. Of course, it's not elliptic. So that's where the Where the questions do I always have a particular solution? That's an obvious question to ask because I have set up some space here. That's one thing to do. I'll do a compute it. I'll tell you how to compute it. I hope for an optimal error you will get to that. And how much do I get? Very good. First, let us briefly look at these spaces and fix a norm for them so that we know that. And fix a norm for them so that we know that these are for all reasonable spaces. So you have the H1 norm, which you need to add a little bit of these jump terms over here to take care of all of them. These are again these interior facets where you need the jump terms of the constant pressure because the constant pressure behaves a bit oddly as it is in the current. As it is in the kernel of the gradient itself, and then doesn't interact with you whatsoever. So that behaves differently from everything else. And you have these norms, and these are the natural norms for our space. I have to look at a little slightly stronger equivalent on my discrete spaces norms to scale everything to deal with this kind of problem. Okay, enough complicated norms. Let's look at. Complicated norms. Let's look at our actual basis that we had two slides ago. I told you I have completely forgotten that I had this Cartesian product, so each of my bases are now a pair of U and P. How do I depict a pair of U and P? Here you have a function. The arrows are the U. The colorful plane is the P, and on each of these ten things that I have plotted is now a pair, a basis function in my. put a basis function in my uh draft space. So if you look at uh say this one then you have some maybe constant or maybe linear flow and my pressure is zero constant. If you look over here that my pressure does something and my velocity also does something and I know that Laplace of U is Know that Laplace of U is exactly equal to the gradient of V for each of these guys. And therefore, they are in the kernel of my operator. Additionally, I also know that the divergence of U is also zero. So this all together says, ah, it's in the kernel of my operator. So this is how basis functions look in this space, which we have forgotten to be a kernel. Which we have forgotten to be a strategic product. Come again? No, no, no. I will, I have always in my space, let me go to I have a U and a P, and I'm always considering pairs. They are now linked. They are hard linked by this equation may be equal to zero. So each pair I have to plot somehow, and I plot it by plotting arrows for my U and the color for my P. My P. No, the yeah, the magnitude is not completely independent. It's weirdly dependent through this condition, but here I have a large magnitude and a zero pressures. So they are dependent. So say you have a harmonic function that's divergence-free, that could be this one. Because then it's in the kernel of your Laplace, your pressure. kernel of your Laplace, your pressure is zero, and it's also that also you have some flexibility on how to pick this function. Moving for the local dimensions for each of the triangles, we want to know, are we saving anything? And yes, we are, otherwise we wouldn't be giving this talk. So you have to check, okay, good, this Stokes operator, that's indeed just surjective onto the space MM looking. Projective onto the space MM looking at. So these dimensions you can also easily compute. It's a slightly smaller dimension. So it's k to the third minus k to the third kind of problem or k squared minus k squared kind of story. And then if you subtract the space from my origin space, the dimension of my origin, from the dimension of the space where I'm subjective to, I get. The space where I'm subjective to, I get the dimension of the kernel and that's linear algebra for the first patch, and you get that you have lower dimension for your actual spaces, and it goes from k squared to k in two dimensions, k to the third to k to the two in one dimension as expected. It's just how you now have to think of slightly harder operators. Very good. Now, what already told me? Now, what already told for a general operator, I don't know who now will do for a specific operator. So we have this u and my velocity and my pressure, or in general, v of z. These are some functions in my polynomial space. And now I want to know if I'm doing this SVD thing to compute the kernel, how does this look like? How does this work? So please do keep in mind at all times that here this Here, there's these blue parts or these brownish-orange parts. These are always pairs. So, these are our coefficients of the pairs. We have forgotten that it is a Cartesian problem. And then, okay, if I have this singular value decomposition, then I have some kernel which I can compute by exactly filtering out these guys that are in the kernel. And these guys in the kernel are some functions here, some sets of coefficients for both pressure and. Coefficients for both pressure and velocity that altogether live them. And if I rewrite them as the functions u and p that I want to have, then I get exactly the nice plots I had previously that are in my. So this is what I get to compute my kernel of my space. So then I have my curved space, homogeneous one. The non-homogeneous one, but I can get by a pseudo-inverse the particular solution, and from that in the next step, I will get the full solution. What do I do? I use a pseudo-inverse on each of the triangles, and I get my solution. So, maybe to comment on your question to what you said when Paul was asking, I will have to invert here something. I will have to invert here something slightly different if my new is varying throughout my domain, then something interesting happens on all the domains. And I know that it works if my u is maybe smooth enough, if my new has jumps, I will get into a headache. But if my new is, say, to exaggerate C2 and my triangles are small enough, I know that nothing can go wrong. But that's also an exaggeration. You can get maybe something better. Okay, so then you have locally all the things. So then you have locally all the things that you need for your particular solution for this. Pseudo-inverse, that's your affine offsets to your solution. So your solution lives in this affine space. And now I'm trying to compute this. Of course, this is I can rewrite this by splitting it up into two parts on the right and the left side. So I have just now a problem that I need to solve, solve in my traffic based in T that will give me the difference between my particular solution and the part. Difference between my particular solution and the part I still want to have in my actual solutions. So that's what we have. We have the particular solution we have to get. Now we have to look at this saddle point problem in T. And this is a saddle point problem. For elliptic problems, maybe everything is somewhat clear. Now we have to look at the saddle point structure problem. Then we have to ask what's the role of the pressure in this thing. In uh, in this thing, uh, okay, my pressure. If it's my pressure is constant, that's a space I have completely for free. Other than that, uh, my pressure is completely determined by my u. So if I have a u, I can also tell you, and I know that my where u p is in this space, then I also can give you the p, because it has to be the gradient of something. That's how that works. Unless my p has a constant on a single triangle, so that's a bunch of uh Triangle, so that's a bunch of constants all over the domain. That's not the constant that you have globally as a pre-lunch that doesn't do anything because now you have it on every triangle, and that will give us the saddle point structure of the story. We have, of course, locally on each triangle that my divergence of u is zero. I have put this in my red space, so this is so. Doesn't mean that my u is. Is so, doesn't mean that my u is exactly divergence-free because over the boundaries, I still have jumps in the normal direction. So, in that sense, it's not exactly divergence-free. So, the part that you keep with you have your these wide constants here, you have your normal direction here for your V operator, and so this is more or less the structure of my. Let's see the structure of my saddle point problem that I want to deal with. And I want to formalize this and divide this up into parts. Which parts? One part is the constant pressures up to a global constant. So the constant pressures are that part that lives in my B block and everything else lives in my A block of my saddle point. Okay, then I can write my UP. Can write my UP. Okay, this UP, this is, we have long forgotten that this comes from a Cartesian space. So, this is also not the right way to write this saddle point problem. This U and this P are not related to or very indirectly related to the current saddle point structure because I have this for my B block and everything else is more of my A block of my saddle. So, I introduced the two projections to look. Projections to look at one side on the constant pressures on each triangle and on the other hand to literally everything else. So, okay, they have of course reasonable norms that behave reasonably. I have, if I project this, okay, I have not done anything but project away my constant pressures. So if I subtract these, I can write down new norms for H. Right, there are new norms for H and L that behave naturally on these bases and they are very closely related to the H1 space, H1 norm, and maybe the L2 norm of the things I'm looking at. So because I am just moving the constant parts of my piece, and this is also this vanishes in the gradient, this Uh, this may be orthogonal to some polynomials in L2 if I really want to do it construct things by hand. Of course, there's some things I need to do on the boundaries of my elements that I have to look dialogue and this will fit neatly together with my not completely divergence freeness of u because I had these jumps over the norm. Okay, let us rewrite this problem as a setup point problem. This problem as a settle point problem because this is not quite a settlement problem I want, but rather I want to have this. So, okay, I write everything as the projection to H and the projection to L. Then I get first I get this. This is zero because the appropriate term vanished. I can write this more explicitly because the parts in L have only a pressure part and this becomes. And this becomes this kind of statement. So I have my new A block, and these are the B blocks of my problem. And I have to deal with that. So I need an in-sub statement for this thing. So the in-sub, the premium of this should be larger than that. That's standard in sub formulation, but we're in an odd space. Odd space. Okay, what do we do to do that? What happens to this constant? We look at the zero pressures, whole constant pressures. We look at the related problem, BDM1, P0. That's a common problem. It's just the problem that deals with, in fact, deals with these P0 pressure. With these P0 pressures, where we already naturally know how this LDB constant looks like for BDM space with performance velocity and a constant locally square constant pressures. And the A block is typical to treat. So we look at the subproblem. And to look at the sub-problem, we look at the special. Special problem, but we look at pressures that are in T0. We look at the so my divergence would be something in T0 as well, because this is a Lagrange multiplier and appropriate space for the velocities. And we also allow additionally jumps to the in the normal direction of my velocity with that. My velocity did that. Actually, this problem is backwards from what you would typically see for such a Stokes problem. Typically, you would say, ah, here I have a velocity, no, a force here, non-zero. This would be zero because I don't want the normal jumps. But of course, I can formulate the problem more generally with some prescribed normal jumps for my velocity. And this might be zero. But this is completely backwards. We set this part to non-zero, something on my right. zero something on my right hand side and the other two two zeros and from standard theory you know that this is lbb stable here for a given p tilde i can get a solution w that has the appropriate norm and you're happy about that we will use that this is the solution w that you need to treat the other problem The other problem should not come as too big a surprise because we indeed have this structure of having zero elements for the pressure and v1 principles in the normal discontinuous for the velocity. So, indeed, this is what you do. Say, okay, I want to look at that. That I can look here at these zero elements because the These zero elements, because in the L space the velocity was zero anyway. And then you say, ah, I want to take a supremum over pairs in this space. And how do I calculate the appropriate velocity? Once I have my velocity table, I automatically have a pressure. So I only can hope that the pressure will fit once I have the velocity that I picked. But of course, I have my problem that I have. A problem that I had, my auxiliary problem that we do do this. So, indeed, I use this, I pick this u from my auxiliary problem, but this is an in sub statement. It's for a given pressure, I need for a given Lagrange multiplier, I need to find the suitable velocity, a suitable u, and show that this is indeed large enough. So, okay. Large enough. So, okay, the properties of these things fit indeed because I have put the statements about the normals in there manually. The norms match up because you picked the norms properly scaled and as needed to do this. This is divergence-free. You also exploit that your do in your identity. do in your I get to do q in your space if as great zero and then you get to uh indeed the statement that you need to have so this is what you get for the influence problem the other two I mentioned you have the the R lemma for this problem and you have an approxima mation lemma from Maybe lemma from this problem, which you do by average Taylor polynomial if you want to prove that. But the most interesting or more special part of this problem is that it has a saddle point infrastructure rather than an elliptic structure for other problems. But also the standard results, like the convergence and so on. So, okay, you have the expected DG convergence rate, and you're happy about that. You go and implement this now, or you do it. Implement this now, or you do it the other way around. You first implement, check it, and then try to prove it. And then you do some numerical results, and indeed, you get the same things for the traffic space as for the or very similar results for the traft space test for the polynomial space. Of course, trafts makes maybe a slightly larger error each time because it's not really the projection using the appropriate operator, but rather you do something. Appropriate operator, but rather you do something else on each human triangle. So it's slightly larger, but you save in cost as we have. So you get the same story in 3D. Again, it looks perfectly nice. And it's also not a large factor that you have in between the good in that sense. That was it. The results are published. The results are published online. The next steps are, of course, we're going to work further on this problem, are doing this, asking ourselves, what about pressure robustness? Standard for these kinds of problems. Okay, if my pressure is very large compared to my velocities, or so to say, my new is very small, can I still recover a reasonable velocity from that? Hopefully, you can. We're working on that. I'll tell you something. On that, tell you some other time when speech. Of course, you can ask other questions as well: normal continuity, other kinds of continuity of my velocity. Or you can go to non-linear problems. That's an exciting challenge. All right. Thank you very much. I'm double checking at the same time the microphone to see people. To see if people can join with this microphone, excellent. So, do we have any questions in the room or online? Yeah, I'm going to give you the microphone that I'm sure is working. Thank you. That was a very good thought. So my main interest is the third bullet that you have over there, and what the first word that you have in the parenthesis, the non-linear. non-linear do you have any ideas how you can extend something like this that's uh that's uh it's very far down the list because that's uh not not not completely obvious there's nothing at this point that i could no no the it's it's it's it's a gradient from ongoing from to desired let me put it that way okay Not sure I have naive questions. It's almost like a shared reaction. Every time that I see this SVD decomposition, I can't help thinking about compression. In this case, we have singular values that are exactly zero. Yes. But you could just think about sort of having a threshold. And so the question is, would your And so the question is, would your construct work if you just throw away some of the non-zero values? You would hope about. This is not huge. This is your polynomial space on one triangle. So this is. I mean, maybe not. It might not be worth it. Would it work? I would. Well, first thing that could happen is that the zeros. That could happen is that the zeros that you had get here, you have made some numerical mistakes and you do something very odd. And then these zeros are not exactly zeros, and these you should throw out. You would hope wholeheartedly that this smallest singular value is large enough for not getting into these kinds of troubles, because otherwise you have the wrong space. Yeah, yeah, but that would be, I think that would be worrisome if that would be happening. But of course, if they're that small, that Okay, then you have to compare. If you start throwing around out very small ones here, but there should be smaller than your expected error and somehow still related to your new. But that sounds very iffy. The method is not. The method is not really made too well. Maybe you can do this for a very large gate. That's something that's something this so highly, but I highly doubt that you can gain anything there. Let me put it that way. If this one becomes close to zero, then you have some kind of conditioning problems anyway. Anyway, it's independent on how you and basically that's saying that it's probably saying that this draft space construction is somewhat unstable on an abstract sense rather than due to preconditioning. So it would be worrisome rather than helpful from my view. Okay, do we have any Do we have any question online? I think I missed your convergence theorem. It holds with the homogeneous problem or with general source? It holds for general source. That's not a problem. But of course, you do you prove it in steps. But but it holds for a general source. Yes. It's proven by an average. It's it's proven by even a average Taylor Polyno that's kind of beginning you have to project the source so it depends on the projection operator or the projection does not break anything you have to project the source but you actually always project the source because you only always test on only with some functions and then you have projected your source so in the in the same sense you project your source here okay so it doesn't break anything in that Then I will ask you questions, but because we try to do this kind of things and we fail, okay? Well, let's thank our speaker again. Okay, and we have now a ten minutes break.
