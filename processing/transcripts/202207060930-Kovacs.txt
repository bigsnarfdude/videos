Thanks, John. Thanks, everybody. When I spoke with John about what to talk about today, we came up with the title Using Science to Advance Climate Resilience, and I've got seven or eight slides on that. And the goal was to have a lot of time to chat because I like talking with you rather than lecturing you. Over the last couple of days, I have a different speech and I borrowed a dozen slides from that one and shoved them in the front here. So I'm going to give you two in one, which means I have to go faster to get through in the time we have. Faster to get through in the time we have. The other speech I do is I wrote a book for insurance companies called Climate Risk Implications for Insurance Industry in Canada. And I've been on a lecture tour for the last four or five years, explaining to the senior management insurance companies what they need to do. So the speech is more the motivation. Natalie, you're into the specifics. What do you do? How do you achieve all of that? The presentation I'm making is to try to get them excited to make them want. Making is to try to get them excited and make them want to do this and want to reach out and get on with all of that. So, um, I think I came up in one of Francis' comments right at the beginning: why? What do they want to know? And all of that kind of stuff. So, um, I added that part in because I thought it might be interesting when I give the speech, but this will be the short version of what that group of financial institutions want to know about climate risk. Let me jump in. Okay, so as John mentioned, we're at Western. That's our, we're in the new engineering building. We're in the new engineering building. We're a multidisciplinary group with the engineers who take all the money. Anyone been part of that? You offer an economist $10,000 for a student for the summer and he's really happy, but engineers, $10 million doesn't seem to make them happy. Anyway, so our role, we want to reduce the losses from climate-related and seismic risks. We're focused on climate and seismic resilience. Our board, Matt Davis, is on our board. We've got a number of Board. We've got a number of company CEOs who volunteer to sit on the board and guide us about where we're going. We get funding from private industry and from government. We have a new mandate. And for many years, our goal was to write reports about what would be a good thing to do and think we were done when we published the report. And we're now being told, no, no, you're not done now. You have to go and convince somebody to do it. And that's a whole different conversation for many of us. So trying to figure out how to get implementation of these ideas. Implementation of these ideas that we have. For me, like Francis, I've been a volunteer with the government panel on climate change for 20 years. I'm part of Working Group 2. Francis is leading Working Group 1. I'm one of the people in Working Group 2 and really proud of that work. It's some of the hardest work you ever get to do, but it's really rewarding. I'm chairman of Ontario's Advisory Committee on Climate Change. I'm chairman of the Global Alliance of Chairman of the Global Alliance of Disaster Research Institute. So I do lots of things. So you don't need to hear all of that. Okay, you're invited to a party. So there's cake, balloons, all that kind of stuff. October 18, two in the afternoon, come to university in London. We're going to do this at the Windy Research Institute. You can be 25 meters away from a tornado, which will spin around in front of you. We'll blast you with a downburst, all kinds of fun things. But our idea of a party, we are going to show. We are going to show how a simulated hailstone bounces off a roof if you have the right kind of roof, and how you can stop water from getting into your basement if it rains really hard, and how you can stop your building from collapsing if there's a tornado. All the wildfire elements won't be ready for this fall. That's next year's plan is to add wildfire to what we're doing. Anyway, if you're free, there's cake. Come. So, well, great. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we will definitely try. And for those who might want to finance things also, we perfectly set it up so it has some mobility. So, if somebody really wanted us to bring all this stuff somewhere else, we can pack it up and move it. The company that gave us all the basement flooding stuff wants T. All the basement flooding stuff wants to use it in Edmonton. So we're going to pack it all up and move it from the university out to Edmonton and just look at the basement flooding part because that's they got into a lot of trouble last time with the basement flooding in Alberta. And so they want to work with us on that. So part of this will be movable, but not easily. So I'm going to jump into the first of the two presentations I've slammed together. This is a variation of the same slide that Francis gave. Across the bottom, this is a cumulative greenhouse. This is cumulative greenhouse carbon dioxide emissions since 1870, so going back 150 years, and showing a very high correlation between cumulative emissions and the global average temperature. The black part is what's happened over the last 150 years. The red part is the path we're on. The orange in between is if we worked hard to reduce from where we are right now. And the blue is if we work even harder. And the blue is if we work even harder. And this isn't as current as what Francis presented. This is the older version of this. But anyway, the key point for me is I add three ovals. This is what economists do. We stick ovals on and think we've added some value to all of this. So in 2030, it doesn't matter which path you're on. You end up at the same spot in a few years from now. In 2050, there's a little bit of difference. In my opinion, not very much. In 2100, there's an enormous difference. I mean, we can really make a difference. Difference. I mean, we can really make a difference. It won't show up quickly, maybe not even in my lifetime, but we are controlling what happens here. And if we make the right choices, things can be much better. I don't want to see a 4% or 5% increase in global temperatures and much higher for Canada. We can control this, but most of that shows up over longer periods of time. The key point I'm presenting here is that 30 years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio, all the world. Summit in Rio, all the world leaders, including Prime Minister Moroney, got together and said, We need to stop this. And for 30 years, they get together every year saying we will stop this, and they're not making any progress. This is not going very well. We're on a scary trend that's going the wrong way fast. Second piece. So this is my chart of direct physical damage in Canada from extreme weather. Wildfires thrown in with floods thrown in with all together. Anybody looking at the camera? All together. Anybody who looks around, you won't find this in a database anywhere because there isn't one. So I had to take various databases and lots of assumptions and all that kind of. This is my sense of what's happened. I put an oval around, economists put ovals around things. I put an oval around three outliers, which I hope you remember as the ice storm in Quebec, the flooding in Calgary, and the wildfire in Fort McMurray. I see a trend, and I see a trend that's been going for 40 years. So I think this is long term. So, I think there's this long-term trend that's driven by a number of things. This is normal climate change. There's a lot of things behind this, but there's a lot of noise here. And, but my sense, economists, I see a trend that we're on a path that's uncomfortable. Okay, and I'll try to back that up a little bit more with the next slide. Francis? There's many factors behind this. Yes, it's not all climate for sure. BC floods, so it's not on there yet, and we are still waiting for some numbers on that. And there's remarkable diversity about the estimated damage from the BC floods. Not a lot was paid by insurance, which is some of the data I have to work with, because the people in those areas didn't have insurance. So, Mark Carney in 2015. In 2015, said, We're not doing very well with this transition to a lower or a net zero carbon economy, but there's this political commitment. What does that mean for the financial sector? What does that mean about stability for the financial sector? And Mark Carney said, physical risks are really important for you, defaults and claims, payments, and all that kind of stuff. So how are we going to deal with these broad... Going to deal with these broad societal risks, what does this mean for you? He set up a task force. This was to allow the banks to collectively come around together and say, here's how we will tell people how we're dealing with these things. And this was to allow the insurance companies who have a different group to report on what they're doing. The key was to press regulators, press the industry to come up with their own way of describing how they're coping with these two broad societal issues of failure to meet. Issues of failure to meet our climate goals and growth in extremes. What does that mean for you? And how will you report on that and tell the government? How will you report to your shareholders? How you report to the public? Carney didn't come out of nowhere with all of this. So there's a group that meets every January called the World Economic Forum, and they have some really big name political leaders and business leaders who go to Switzerland and have a good time. Part of that process is they send a survey to them all ahead of time and said, here's three. survey to them all ahead of time and said here's three really bad 30 really bad things we can think of would you tell me the chance of it happening in the next year 10 years in your opinion and would you tell me how bad it would be so in this graph more to the right means it's more likely and higher means it'll be worse so of the 30 worst things they could come up with to ask these world leaders about the two at the top were failure to do something about climate change and damage from extreme weather Damage from extreme weather. So, when business leaders get together and talk, this is on their mind. And they're saying, I'm really worried about this. Usually, when I'm in the room, I hear they say, and somebody should solve it. And I wish you'd get on with it. And I hope you do it soon, right? But what Carney was doing is this conversation happening in the political community, but increasingly in the business community, that we need to start to have our own opinions on what failure to do something about climate risk means for us and what does the increasing extreme weather. And what does the increased extreme weather damage mean for us? Please, Matt. It's interesting that military conflict wasn't bother radar at all. Yep. For the economists, the colors mean things. So blue things are interesting to economists. Near the bottom, inflation, deflation, trade problems, right? All the stuff that economies, because we're so good and we've solved all those problems. They're not worried about. And we solved all those problems, they're not worried about the stuff that we care about. But the environmental ones are the green ones, and they're all shot up into the corner. They've been doing this survey for 20 years now, and it's fascinating to watch how these have moved. Some of them, they move quickly in a year, like military conflict. Anyway, yeah, I know the writing is very small, but it's a very intriguing report to look at. So this is another piece by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, documenting what's needed to achieve the goal agreed to in Paris: that we would try to keep warming to less than two degrees and try for one and a half degrees. So the red is across time, what has been the one-year emissions. So I've changed the scales here a little bit. And it's just gone up despite the last 30 years of trying to do something about it. It just keeps going up and keeps going up. So COVID messed this up a little bit, but basically it's just, we're not making any progress on. Basically, it's just, we're not making any progress on this. And the black is what that looks like it's going to continue to do. And the blue is what we would need to do to achieve what was promised in Paris. So the comment in the business community is we need to transition from this trend line to where we're trying to get to that hasn't gone very well for the last 30 years. What does that mean for my company? What does that mean for society? So this is the broader conversation that I'm trying to take the senior people in the insurance industry. Take the senior people in the insurance industry and said, This is the question you need to figure out. The politicians are promising one thing, we're nowhere near it. What is it they might do? Could they put the price of gasoline way, way higher than it was before? Could they tell you, as the California insurance regulator said, it is illegal for an insurance company to invest in a coal company? Like, where did that come from? But anyway, it was just declared one day. And some places have said that you're not allowed to invest in. Have said that you're not allowed to invest in oil sands companies. That's outside of Canada. Anyway, so what might this transition mean? Think about it, go through. And the second one, this is me taking the same data before, but I've changed it just a little bit. So across the bottom is years. Up the left is dollars paid, in this case, by insurance companies in Canada, not my other one that was trying to do insurance and uninsured. You can see I did on log scale. And by doing on a log scale, And by doing analog scale, for me, there's a tighter trend. Those three big outliers don't look quite as big anymore. So there's a fair amount of noise in all of this, but they don't stand out as much as to me they did before. And most of the people in the insurance industry say, oh, the last 10 years are really bad. Well, no, this has been going on for a while. And there's data that says this is not just a couple of years. This is a long-term trend. Economists who don't have to struggle with all the modeling questions you've been. Have to struggle with all the modeling questions you've been raising. We just do a regression and stretch out, and where might we be 10 years from now? Kind of thing. So on this scale, at the beginning, it was $70 million. And at present, it's $2 billion. Log scales make you go up fast. So, where might we be 10 years from now? Well, I think four or five billion dollars. I mean, right? Where are we going? Now, that's no fancy climate. Going. Now, that's no fancy climate model or any of that kind of stuff. It's just looking at a trend that's been going on for a while and where might that take you. And if you've got a model that tells you, I'm not going to plan for four or five billion, well, explain why and what number are you going to go for. But you want a starting point? 10 years from now, you're probably going to have to pay out four or five billion dollars a year. And right now, you're set up to pay out $2 billion a year. So all of this, as Natalie shared, is taken by the Senior People Insurance. Is taken by the senior people in insurance and put into their decision framework at the high level. So the senior people say, I think about risk, explain this as risk. In insurance, they've completely bought into enterprise risk management. So risk in enterprise risk management is positive and negative. Insurance companies see lots of opportunities in this. This is not necessarily a problem. This is a trend as opposed to a problem. This is a trend. So the insurance companies are looking. What are the adverse consequences? What are the adverse consequences? But what are the opportunities that we can take out of the failure to achieve our climate goals and the rising damage that occur? So that's first. Second, as Natalie shared, there is a framework in insurance, just as there is in banking. You start in banking with credit risk and you start in banking with investment risk and operational risk. So insurance, they start in different places. It's insurance risk is the first point they go with. So they would look at this from, I've got six. So, they would look at this from. I've got six here that I race through here: insurance risk. So, did I anticipate my expenses so that I have enough revenue to come out ahead of the gate? So, I have 40 years of data. The insurance companies made a profit, if you add them all together, made a profit every year. So, we went from 70 million to 2 billion, and they're still making money. So, this is not a threat to their profitability. This is a threat to did I have enough people and did I solve the claim and did I collect enough money? And did I solve the claim? And did I collect enough money? They also did not sell anybody a 40-year policy. So they sold a policy for the next year. And each year they can come back and they figure out what do I need now for your risk as a customer for me. So the insurance companies have come out ahead of the game every year through all of this. In the last 18 years, they made an underwriting profit in all but one year, which is a tougher standard. So, anyway, they've taken this to heart. This is to heart. So I'm sharing with them: hey, you should anticipate probably four or five billion dollars a year of payments in 10 years. As everybody here would say, if somebody asked you, where am I going to be 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 2,100, right? You don't just draw a line like this and think that does a lot for you. But if you're going out, if you got 40 years a day and you go 10 years, economists are usually kind of comfortable. But the more you stretch out, the more uncomfortable you get. The more you stretch out, the more uncomfortable you get. And that's where most of the conversations are going saying, drawing a line beyond 10 years. I need some more help. I need some more feedback. I need to know what is growth in population, more people living at risk. What is changing climate? What is all those sorts of things? But if you're just going out a few years, as insurance companies usually do, they didn't do a lot of the modeling. They just looked at trends. And the actuary led a lot of this. And the actuary said, what have I experienced and how extreme. What have I experienced and how extreme might it be? So, coming out of these data, they see growth. If they need to collect enough money for another two or three billions of dollars, right now they're collecting 50 billion a year, so they need to collect 52 or 53 billion a year. They don't have to double their revenue. They need to collect some more revenue to cover what's coming, if everything else is unchanged. And they're actually anticipating on auto insurance that the revenue is going to collapse. Revenue is going to collapse, most of production. Cars are safer. These cars that drive themselves, why would you buy insurance if the car is driving itself? Like, what am I getting insurance for? That's not happening this week, but that's happening over a longer period of time. So insurance companies are seeing other sources of revenue go down, and this is not all bad news for them. Climate risks have been increasing. So, in part building on now. So, in part, building on Natalie's comment, when talking with bankers, there are certain risks that they are thinking about. In my opinion, they're trying to tie climate to each of those risks they already are thinking about in insurance anyway. And the first one is insurance risk. Insurance risk, they don't even talk very long. I mean, I get to change every year. I get to experience whatever happens. I just nudge it a little bit and add a little bit on. They don't pause a little bit on the core risk for them. On the core risk for them. What does climate mean for insurance risk? Investment is driving the crazy. They are really, really uncomfortable about investment risk. They are not big investors, but they really don't know how much risk they have. And the few that have disclosed where they've done some homework on investment risk, they were really shocked. They did not realize that their portfolio was as exposed as it was to climate risk. They were going for ultimate blue chip companies and found out that these were companies that now are being viewed. Were companies that now are being viewed very differently when you look through a climate lens. So there's lots of these global exercises, and they're trying to tie into all of them and trying to get some guidance and looking for help. How do we understand our climate, our investment risk from a climate perspective? So this is a big issue. And if you're ever invited to talk to some financial companies, this is a different part of the company. So the ones who were talking about, you know, We're talking about insurance risk are not the same people as the ones thinking about investment risk sometimes. These are some charts about how many people are getting sued because of a climate dispute and it's gone up. Almost all of these are American disputes. A lot of them are governments getting sued, not companies getting sued. But insurance companies, typically, if you have insurance, it includes you are insured if someone takes you to court and the insurance companies get all the. Takes you to court, and the insurance companies get all the bills for that. So, liability risk is a big deal for them. And again, an opportunity for insurance. So, they were caught out with tobacco and asbestos, and they spent billions of dollars defending people that they had no intention of defending. They just weren't careful in describing what they were doing. And so, that has made them think about this for a long time. And they have been trying very hard. And they have been trying very, very hard to say, I am definitely not insuring you for this. And if anybody sues you, don't call your insurance company because I told you I'm not covering this. And some of that's gone well, but some of them has not gone well. There are some areas, and they've been working on this for more than a decade now, to say, I really am not insuring this, and I'm really not going to defend you. And I can't make it any clearer to you when you bought insurance from me. I'm just not there for you. There are. There are particular targets, this literature about carbon majors, these 100 companies that account for 70% of all the carbon emissions ever happen, whatever. There's a sense that if any of you touch any of those companies who were blue chip companies, right? But you could get caught up in all kinds of things. So the insurance companies are often running scared from certain kinds of customers right now. There are areas where they love this. The insurance guys are able to have customers who will pay a lot of money. To have customers who will pay a lot of money. So, if you're on a board of directors and you're worried about getting sued about climate, you want insurance, insurance guys say, sure, I'll sell you that. I don't think the risk is very high right now. There have not been a lot of cases, and I don't think it'll get very bad. So I'll probably collect more than I'll run into. And insurance companies are in that space. And again, professional liability. There's a number of different areas where there is the risk of liability, but insurance companies are trying to be really selective and think about it long before things get out of control. Long before things get out of control. Okay, the big one: regulatory. So, OSFI have issued for the banks and insurance companies. Here's what we expect from you. Bank of Canada's put out a paper in May about how they are thinking about all of this. Scenario testing is one of their favorite words. So, lots and lots of regulatory conversations. The global regulators are all comparing notes through the insurance. Are all comparing notes through the Insurance Association of Insurance Supervisors and Basel and whatever. So if somebody comes up with a clever idea, it quickly comes to another country and they give it a whirl. And there's a few that have been out there much further on this file, like California. And so the rest of the world sort of holds their breath saying, is that what's coming? In my writing, I think that the insurance guys are doing things very well. And having more regulation is actually going to show that they are. That they are not at risk and they're okay. And so, this will not be easy to satisfy, but they should not be afraid of what's coming. Anyway, I think the regulatory process is going to drive this. And there are so many other areas as an economist who is a working government where regulations come late after everybody's all agreed. Okay, now it's time for regulation because we all agree. This is one where I think the regulators are going to get in front and could be pushing this a little bit. So the financial companies. So, the financial companies will all be on edge about where this goes, but we'll see. Last one, again, in presenting this to senior management, you look across different risks, including reputational risk, much harder to quantify, as I said, Natalie. But this is on their list. I mean, what does reputational risk mean for me? And there are several insurance companies that are now branding themselves as more environmentally sensitive than the other insurance companies. And it's pretty soft in all of that, but it's. Soft in all of that, but it's you know, they're working really hard on this. And how do they get the word out there about what it means to build? So not all negative. There's an opportunity. There are things that go really, really bad on reputation, but they're looking really hard to build the reputation on the positive side on climate change. Presentation one, shift in your presentation two, but I'm going to make you save questions. Within all of that, what did the companies ask us? Within all of that, what did the companies ask ICLR to work on as we've been supporting them with what they do? So I start. Our focus is on science to support resilience, climate resilience, seismic resilience. Our new mandate focuses on three broad areas. So I'll quickly take you through the three. The first one, there are a lot of homes in Canada, 12, 14 million homes in Canada that are at risk right now of a broad range of climate hazards. What can be done to better protect them? Done to better protect them. So we work with FireSmart and we work with HailSmart and a number of different groups that are focusing on particular hazards. We start with the belief that existing homes can be better protected. Insurance companies on average pay 83,000 Canadians each year because they had damage. That's a lot of people. And much of what we see, you go by and you visit and you say, that didn't need to happen. Would have required some work in advance. Would have required some work in advance, would have required some money, but you did not need to have 83,000 losses. And there are some really basic things that we've identified that could be done for an existing home to make it safer. Costs money and requires decisions and action by, in particular, the property owner to take the lead. We got a program where we do up homes and we go in and we protect them and learn about how expensive it is and what it's like for the homeowner to go through the process. We have brochures, we have a whole bunch of things that we are doing. We have brochures, we have a whole bunch of things that we are doing just to try to get the word out and collaborate with other groups that are saying an existing home can be made more resilient. There's been a lot of conversation over the last few days about wildfire, so I just quickly share, maybe provocatively, a few of my thoughts about wildfire. And because this is not the core of what I'm presenting, I'm going to do this rather quickly. So in 2018, the campfire is the most destructive event worldwide for the insurance. Event worldwide for the insurance industry. In the upper left, this is a picture of Paradise, California, before that fire, and in the middle is after the fire. And in the right is zooming in on one of the homes, one of the damaged homes, one of the surviving homes. So from the pair of pictures, the two things of the many pieces that you might, Sean had us all come up with many different things you can get out of an image. Two things that I get out of this. One, you can see how much destruction happened. There's 90% of the. Happened. 90% of the homes, more are gone. They're just destroyed. That is terrible. I mean, this is a community just destroyed by fire. So one other caption my eye is, look at the trees. I mean, all the trees are still there. So what I understood happened in Fort McMurray and happened in Lytton, happened in Paradise. You had a terrible fire in the wetland and it sent embers on the wetland and it sent embers and the embers fell on this community and rained down and and it had some buildings ignite it went from building to building into building you don't incredibly rare for a fire to burn across a community this was a fire that burned near a community you don't want fires to burn near communities and when the embers fell these homes weren't able to stop the ignition the home on the right it was built under the new It was built under the new California building code, wildfire building code. It's got a roof that won't burn, siding that won't burn, all the things that all of us have been talking about are all in that home. Around it, you can see lots of protection around it, that there's nothing right next to it that would burn. That home is fine, and the home next to it is gone. So, part of the work we're doing for existing homes, for new homes, the next topic I'm going to get to, you can protect yourself. To. You can protect yourself even when enormous fires burn by and embers rain down on you. If you take the right steps, if your home doesn't ignite, if the home next to you doesn't ignite and spread it to you, you can be a survivor of these things. You just need to spend the money and do the right things. We're keen on what happens in the wildland. We're particularly keen in the people I'm talking to, what happens to the individual homes. How many of the homes have got all the right protection? So this is the part of. So this is the part of the seven disciplines of FireSmart and whatever that we're really keen on how to get homeowners to take action for their particular property. All the rest really, really matter. It's all part of a package, but this is the one that we're more focused on. Insurance companies ensure a home, not the community or the wildland. They ensure a home. Second broad theme, new structures. So once you have built a structure to make the Once you have built a structure, to make the changes require effort and require funds, require a lot of things that are hard. There's a lot of literature explaining that to come in afterward and to bring in protection is difficult for existing homes. But if you do it initially, it is so much easier. In some cases, so much cheaper. For wind, it has to be embedded in the whole structure and to get it in afterward is much more expensive. So we've got a different program. There are different people. We've got a different program. There are different people we're trying to influence. What do you do about new construction? One of the things I've learned through several angry exchanges with builders: builders don't want us to immediately say past building codes all the time. That's not where they want to get to. We still go there and we talk about having building codes as the right way to go. But builders would love to voluntarily do this and have incentives to do this and whatever. It's not that they disagree with it. They just worried about the cost and whatever. But we think that. But we think that how to build as safe as possible. Sometimes it's location, and I've heard come up here several times: should we be prohibiting construction in certain parts of the wildland? We talk about that all the time on flood. We don't talk about that a lot on wildland. We talk about that on flood all the time. But for the wildland urban interface, we're much more focused on does the new instruction. Focused on does the new instruction include a roof that doesn't burn, siding doesn't burn, fences that don't burn, decks that don't burn, landscaping around so that there's nothing that can burn within a meter and a half. And right? So we're much more focused on if the choice is made and you're in a riskier area, that you have all the right protection. The third one, and this is the one I'm going to do, just a couple slides to wrap up on: Build Back Better. So the So the literature finds consistently that you have a large number of people at risk and the majority choose not to do something. You have a large new construction going on and the most builders choose not to do something. So in the first two areas, it has been very challenging to make progress. And a lot of the programs out there are really delighted when they get 3% compliance or 5% compliance. So if you're looking for something bigger and more transformative, the literature Transformative. The literature says one of the opportunities is right after an event. There's a window. This comes a little bit out of what I was sharing in the political science literature about kingdoms, multiple streams literature. But there's a window of a year, year and a half. And if you get some decisions during that window, you can try for bigger change and go for more. So we've got a program which we call Cities Adapt. A program which we call Cities Adapt. We've written up 100 different communities that did good things about climate change. Most of them did it after something bad happened. And all of those case studies are out to be read and we share them with other communities. You should do this too. I prefer if you did it before something bad happened. But here's the cases and what you could do. We have a program where we're trying to get insurance companies, don't put things back the way they were. It burned down last time. It flooded last time. You should put it back differently. Put it back differently. You've got all the indicators that you don't want it the way it was before. The customer doesn't want it the way before. And if you're completely redoing the home, the extra cost is really, really low. And we're making some progress there, but that's been hard. It's not the mindset of insurance companies. They're not in the business of putting things back better. So we had to explain to them that if you put it back better, you will save money. You won't get another claim from these people in your time frame. Anyway, trying to sell that to insurance companies. But the last three slides I'm going to talk about. Uh, but the last three sides I'm going to talk about is: um, we put together a program and we go into a community and say, Would you like our help? You just said something terrible happened, and we're all volunteers and we do all these studies. Can we help you? So, we went to Calgary, Barry, and Lytton, and we had some good things happen. So, I'm going to quickly describe them and then close. So, Calgary, there's a lot of hail regularly happening in Calgary. This is Alberta is the hail center for the country. Hale center for the country. This one was bigger. So in 2020, this is $1.2 billion and only up to the corner of the community. So we had one program focused on awareness and we had thousands of people come to our Hail Smart program and learn what causes hail and what could you do about it and how can you be prepared for hail. Most of the damage was of two kinds. One was damage to the roof and the other was damage to siding. There's damage to siding, and there's a scientific consensus: here's how you avoid damage to the roof. And there's not agreement what to do about siding. So it was a little uncomfortable for us to say, here's the answer for half the problem. But again, we were just trying to stick with, we know the answer to this half, so here's what you can do. And there's not agreement about what to do with signing, but we have some ideas. But we didn't talk about it as much. Calgary agreed to put in a rebate program paid by the city. Program paid by the city. They paid $5 million. They gave everybody who changed their roof and put on a hail impact resilient roof $3,000 each, which is the extra cost for a resilient roof is about $3,000 more than a regular roof. So the city said, we'll cover that. And we had so many people apply for the program. The Calgary stopped it because they ran out of money at $5 million, but it was really popular. And when the storm happened, I had a team going around Calgary to find. I had a team going around Calgary to find somebody who had a hail impact resilient roof so I could prove that it was better. And I didn't find one. I'm sure there's one somewhere in Calgary, but I didn't find it. And now there's thousands. So anyway, we're really pleased that the right message at the right time with some money on the table, things have changed. Calgary is not quite the same, at least for the ones who did it. And everybody in Calgary that we know of who has a hail impact reserve are living in the corners of Calgary that had a storm in 2020. Well, there's a lot of other people in. 2020. Well, there's a lot of other people in Calgary that are also at risk, and the storm could hit any of them. But anyway, we sort out parts of Calgary. Calgary has agreed to go with us, and we are asking the province of Alberta to put in a new regulation require a hell impact resilient roof on every home at risk in Alberta that's built. Again, when we go from the university asking for this, it's not easy, but to go with the city and ask together, it's gone over very differently. And big secret, we're going to give a prize to the mayor in a couple of leavings time saying, Good job. Well done. She wasn't the mayor when all this happened, but she gets the prize. That's how politics go. Calgary is better than it was. And again, we went in, we had lots of science, but this is a different ICLR for us to really go in and say, how can we help you? And Calgary was very receptive. Barry. So Barry had an EF2 tornado. 95% of the tornado. 95% of the tornadoes in Western Canada and Ontario are EF2 or smaller. EF2, you don't have to work very hard to not have damage from an EF2. A tornado can be a three or a four or five. I mean, that's really hard. But these homes should not have experienced damage. Barry, 30 years ago, had a tornado, and we went in and said, you should start building differently. And here's what you do. Anyway, after years of making. Could do anyway. After years of making no progress in Barry, and this area that was hit was a new neighborhood, and they all experienced damage with a relatively small problem. Anyway, Barry worked with us. We've got an awareness campaign, a lot of positive conversations. More people in Barry understand tornadoes than before. Barry has crafted with us a request to change the building code and make it a rule in Ontario that every home at risk of tornado has to be built differently. Of tornado has to be built differently with all these things that we've wanted in. Again, not terribly optimistic because we've been trying to get this for years, but it's moving forward. We've presented it all again. And there were a few homes that were put back better, but most were put back the way they were before. Barry had a motion to think about offering a financial incentive, and they decided that they didn't have the money or didn't want to do it. So they did not offer incentive for people to put back the homes better than they were before. To put back the homes better than they were before. A couple of the insurance companies paid for it, but again, most of the homes that have been put back are the way they were. And most aren't done yet, but are likely the way they were. So we made some progress in Bury, but not as much as I was hoping we might get. Lytton. So I'm sure you're all aware, Lytton was destroyed. The process is very negative. I mean, it's taken much longer for all kinds of things to happen. Failure. To happen. Failure to get all the debris out of the way means you can't start the rebuild. Anyway, we showed up and we were asked to talk about wildfire in Lytton, not debris removal and all the other things. And we went in and used all of that time, all that extra time where everything else took more to get resolved to talk about what would make Lytton better protected from wildfire. So we helped draft a building bylaw based on the 2021 paper by the National Research Council about. Paper by the National Research Council about best new construction practices in the wildland. So Letton is the first community in Canada to have a municipal bylaw based on the new guide about best construction practices. And we hope that this could be leading to provincial building code regulations and certainly to other communities that have wildfire bylaws to borrow more of what is coming out of the scientific. Is coming out of the scientific consensus about the right thing to do. We gave Lytton money so that they could hire Bruce Blackwell and update their wildfire protection, community protection program. In my opinion, if you have meaningful damage, the province should go in right afterward and do an assessment. What do we know now and what do you need? Know now, and what do you need? Having a community welfare protection program that was done when everything was fine is not necessarily going to inform you if you just had a terrible fire. So, anyway, we gave the money, they hired Bruce, Bruce is presented to the council, and it had a lot of predictable things in it. What a community should do were all pretty straightforward. The biggest piece, because we drafted from council the request to the Union of BC municipalities for the funding to implement what's in the proposed. Funding to implement what's in the proposed community welfare protection plan. Mainly, it's the community awareness, some protection around the community, all the basic stuff. But we've put in now a request to the province to get the funding to implement the community welfare protection plan. We have been seeing Lytton as the possibility of something that could be talked about in other communities, about here's a package that focuses on how every building can go back and all be. How every building can go back and all be built with wildfire protection. You saw with that image a while ago with Paradise, if you got some buildings survive and others don't. In Lytton, every community is going to be done because there's a bylaw and it's a requirement. So every community in Lytton is going to be built with wildfire protection. For me, that's really exciting. And it's all based on FireSmart and the NRC Co. So I think Lytton, when the rebuilding is done, when this is all complete, is And this is all complete. Is going to be a model to talk about what a community bylaw should be: a model of having an entire community protected from wildfire, a model of a community that's updated its wildfire community protection program and got funding for it. All those things are not done yet, but that's where I hope we're going to end up with Alton going forward. So this is going in as volunteers to try help in some communities, say, here's what we know. Can we be useful to you? Can we help you move forward? Can we help you move forward? For us, that's very different than what we did in the past, where we just did a lot of papers and things. And we're quite satisfied with where we got to and all of that. So to close, we're having a party. Hope you can come. That'd be great. In my opinion, the discussion about climate change changed into a discussion about climate risk for business. The policy conversation about climate change didn't end, but the business conversation is what does this mean? Conversation is what does this mean for my company? What does it mean for my industry? So, this is a very different conversation that has emerged in the last 10 years in the business community. The regulators for financial institutions, the regulators intend to really push this, and they're going to have lots of things that they're going to ask of the financial institutions. When I present this, I have a paper on it if you want to read my paper, but when I present this to insurance companies, I think that the senior people understand it if it's presented in a risk management context. Management context. So, for years, I've been running the company with the rest of the senior management team, and I need to understand these big categories of risk and climate. How does that affect these big categories of risk? So how can I get better informed about how climate is affecting these categories of risk? For insurance, some of that's positive. There's a real opportunity in all of that, and they want to hear that. But some of it is scary, and they're worried about where that goes. And it's their issue to figure. It's their issue to figure out which is good and bad. When they've been asking us what to do, we're really focused on resilient structures, buildings and infrastructure. We think that the losses have been going up very fast for a long period of time, and there's no sense that that's stopping anytime soon. But the science about to do something about that is all well known. We know what to do. We just need to decide to get on with it. And so we've been trying to document that. And so we've been trying to document that for existing homes for one audience, document that for new construction for a different audience, and trying to take the special opportunity right after an event and go in and have a conversation, be as helpful as we can to see how that might change behavior. And we think that instead of looking at three or 5% doing something better, you can talk about 90 or 100% who can have a much better, safer situation if you win the. Situation if you win the right time after a big event. So that's part of the area we're excited about. That's it for me. Thank you.
