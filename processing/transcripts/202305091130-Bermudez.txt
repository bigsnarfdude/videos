I'm usually working in RNAs, especially in London, coding RNAs. And then the pandemic time started. I was planning to travel to be in Germany because it was my sabbatic year and then I was stuck in my home one year. And then I said, what could I do for applying what I know about early nights to work? About early nights, the work, and to help something about the pandemic time. So now we are here talking about computational biology, but it's important now to remember how computational biology and data science help to mitigate and contain COVID-19. What is really nice, these people were working in the influenza viruses. Viruses platform to trace back many of the spread of the influenza virus. And by that time, fortunately, they could move achieve quickly to work with the GISET platform. And then they started to promote the rapid sharing of data around the world, not only from the influenza virus, but also with the coronaviruses. And at the time, At the time, they implemented easily the spread of the different strains that were moving around the world. So this is the current dispersion pattern for all the different lexicon viruses distribution. And it's interesting because they also have all the genomic sequence data. They also combine. They also combine related clinical data and also the distribution of all the viruses around the world, and also start to think about the project of the spillover of the viruses that has the host as animal and how they jump from the animals to us. So, this is like it's the crossing over a species that happen. So, here for So, here for the case of Argentina, we have another representation that they use. They try to work with also some phylogenetic representation of the different strains of COVID-19 and also with other viruses. You could find there also Sika, dengue, and many others, Ebola viruses that now start to be a really concern in health, in public. Really concerned in health, in public health. So then, you know, maybe this is the cartoon of WHO that said that the world needs to collaborate together. So this is part of the different collaboration that joined together, aiming to solve and at least to mitigate and contain the pandemic. And here, as you are, for instance, today, many mathematicians, data scientists, Data scientists, computational biologists were talking how to solve things. And I guess that it's not to be proud, but if the stage of art in that science weren't at what was, it would be really impossible maybe to mitigate a contain the pandemic, even in the support size of molecular biologies. And you know that the stage of the study of RNAs has a specific As a specific therapy or RNA biomedicine therapy that we're working with the cancer, it was able to discover this nice and very interesting vaccine that was based on RNAs. So then it's not for making Pfizer propaganda, but it's interesting because last night I thought that this reflection that they did. Uh, reflection that they did is very interesting. For instance, he's a biology and he's working in systemic immunology. But he said, Okay, it's very interesting because Daniel, who is here, is the one who is understanding statistics computational model, and they complement each other to solve more fast the problems that they face. And then my husband was really like. Then my husband was really disappointed because he said, Oh, you work hard and now you are being here all the year. So he gave to me this book. He's the version of this book, the David Kwame. Maybe many of you know him. It's a very interesting scientific story guide that is moving around the world, really picking up all the information. All the information of different outbreaks that have happened around all the world. So David Komenevin was talking with us in Colombia by Zoom. And it's interesting because the last version of the book, it was 22. And in the last chapter of the book, he started to write like, I don't know, eight pages where he was really concerned about the pandemic. About the pandemic. And before this book, because this is in 2012, he said the emergency of strange two diseases is a frightening problem that seems to be getting worse. And happened, of course. And now the idea is at least to be prepared for the next chapter. Hopefully, we hope this is not coming soon, but it's important to make some reflection about that. So, what is That. So, what is a really complicated concern around the world is that the anthropogenic influence on the ecological and natural environments is making that the humans and the animals, and especially the wildlife animals are in contact. And this means that it's more easily to establish, easily path for the spillover of. The spin or spillover of pathogens to different human communities. Yes, and I found last night this interesting book. I say, okay, nice to, for instance, to start to read about it. So these people, people from Hong Kong, they were working, of course, in the different strains, they were working for the SARS-CoV- pandemic that wasn't too. That was in 2004, 2005. Well, now I don't remember except at the time, but these people were, you know, sample a lot of different viruses that are in the host of pets. And of course, they established this model of coevolution about the ancestor of the coronaviruses. And as maybe you remember, there are two lineages of this virus. Of these viruses. So we have the lineage of viruses that derive of the VAT host, and then we have the second one that derives of the viruses that have the virus as a host. So then we have at the end of the day, four different classification, and we started to think if we could do something different, what the people was doing around the world that was only using the idea. Only using the idea to compare the piece amount of genomic data that were sequenced for the COVID for the SARS-CoV-2. Okay, so there is a very complicated problem also with the taxonomic classification of viruses. So we have like an international committee of taxonomy of viruses that is an interesting committee that have established That have established different rules for the classification of the viruses, and they behave like the typical lineo classification that we have for different species. And it's interesting because the classification is still an ongoing problem. And we, anyway, for applying any classification method of sequences, we need, if we are using supervised method, we are going to use this classification. We are going to use this classification. It's like more or less what Maribel trying to explain last night of the problem that they have for the bacteria. We have this problem for the viruses here. Okay, because there is a second classification that is based on Baltimore, a classification that is more related to the stage of the genome, if the genome is based on DNA or if. DNA, or if it's made of RNA, and if it's like having different double, single, or different replication steps of the virus in the in the cell, in the cytoplasm. So I'm part of the RNA lovers. I started like 30 years ago working in quantum chemistry and graph theory, applied to study the RNA structure, and even I was more related to work with this beautiful structure. With this beautiful structure that is the clover leaf of a tRNA. And then, when I move to TypeSec to make my PhD, so then I have to change all my ideas to move to work with bioinformatics, apply for these sort of sequences that are more associated with the primary structure that is the normal RNA sequence. Okay, but the idea was to try to combine these two approaches. These two approaches that are very interesting because this secondary structure represents the folding and the map of the different harpings that build the third theory structure. So here we have this harping and it's here plotted. So there are a lot of interesting math and computational problems solved and applied here. Even last. And apply it here. Even last night, I found this one that was interesting because it was the review of machine learning methods for rare error in a secondary structure prediction. What is usually do is more like using dynamic programming, including thermodynamical data, to find the more stable structure that falls from this primary structure. So, this is good to know that there are also other approximations. Are also other approximations to work with this sort of problem. Now is coming the problem that the point is that you maybe think what is important to work with RNAs and this sort of viruses is because the RNA viruses, as you see before that we have this Baltimore classification, have very important folding structures on the genome that are very important to control replication of the biology. Control replication of the viruses. So, the viruses increase the fitness in the way that these base per bones are optimized. And then, it's interesting because you don't know how the evolution and at least the natural selection acts on the virus genome. Because, what usually the evolutionary biologists do is working with the Working with the change of the compensatory mutations and the complement of the virus think ASAD-CDS. So before or near to the pandemic, we published this nice paper that was working with SICA viruses. And it was like more or less the same approaches that it was then applied for the G. For the G8 platform, and at that time, because I am an RNA lover, I was trying to see if there is a way how to use the secondary structure information of the RNA viruses to trace back, for instance, the clustering of the lineage of the Sika viruses. And at that time, because it's not common to work with RNAs as a market. RNAs as a market for evolution, even now, this is an open program. If somebody would like to work with, it's very welcome because the trees are more or less based on the basic neighbor journey maximum livelihood approach that lets you to trace, for instance, here you have different colors that identify the lineage of the geographical origin of the different. Of the different SICA strains. So here we have Africa, Asia, America, and Oceani. And this is the model that is then corrected by using the maximum likelihood and the substitution model. Sorry, sorry, sorry. This is back. I don't know how it's coming back because it's only ah, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. Ah, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Ah, Ankira. Sorry, sorry. So at that time, we were able to present the origin of the different lineage, but at the same time, we wanted to use the secondary structure information of the different genomes that we use for this approach. And then we start to find that here, you have like the size of the genome, the Sikka genome, and here we use like 400. And here we use like 400 different genomes after a very carefully curatory step. And then we could identify at least these common and shared structures that somebody else later who identified that is really related with the Sika virus replication. Okay, so what I have as a motivation in my work is the following. So it's So it's the everyday loose only a CDS, it's a coding sequences that all the people assume, or it's going to slip up.              Yeah, I don't just find that. So, the good point here is that we repeat more or less that you. Repeat more or less that you see because next strain is the application you could use also to work with your own data. And here we reproduce that here. You see the genome of all the batch, for instance, genomes for SARS-CoV- Here are the intermediate and here you have the human strains. And here you see the same pattern that you see in the index strain. The same holds for oops, this block. Explicit no, no. Ah, ya, ya ja. Oh, no. Okay, here that's coming back. Okay, that's coming back to Well, so I could finish, but the idea is the following. We were working before the pandemic to work with emergency viruses in the Sierra Nevada, Santa Marta, with a group of pediologists that were looking for new emergency viruses. New emergency viruses because there are different, how do you say that? The kids in general have different symptoms that are not related to Zika, to Chikungunya, or with other sort of typical symptoms that the viruses produce. So then we got a special funding of our Ministry of Science and we started to look for a possible emerging and re emerging viruses. Emerging and re-emerging viruses. In this case, we sample. Well, I note the entomologists and the virologists were able to isolate RNAs from the different pools of mosquitoes. And then they called me as a biologist working in computational biology to try to define and design new methods to classify metabiromics data that could fix with the current classification. With the current classification of the families that the taxonomic unity in the world has. We have been using Kamer's approaches. So we ensemble all the metabilomics data and then we cut in different size of the genome. And for that, we found us. It's a pity that we can't see that because we then have the convolution matrix of 16 different families that. Of 16 different families that are pathogenic in the databases. And with this CAMERS approach, we were able using convolutional networks approaches to classify currently all the family of the viruses, but using only the primary structure of the RNAs. Now we move to a second approach that we would like, maybe if some of you would like to join to this project, because it's almost done and I've Project because she's almost done, and I've received now the magister thesis of this student, this mathematics girl. And she started to use the representation of RNAs. We have different homeomorphic, irresolutable tree representation of the structure of RNAs. And we are using convolutional networks, we are using suffix tree approaches, high approaches. The HMM approaches and also again the super vector machine approaches to classify this metagenomics data. And it's working. Yeah, it's working partially, but I was talking to you that maybe the Python approach that they are using is like, now we have to talk a lot now in the launch. Okay, but it's nice because, again, if you look at the database of RNA viruses, it's really a pity to see how the information is. How the information is so we have to work a lot of in the curatory of the data, and at the end, you have like I don't know how many millions of viruses that are still looking for a place in the Baltimore or in the ACTB classification system. So, you are very welcome to try to figure out how to solve this problem. And they are not here, but thank you to my students to. To Valentina, to Armando. Now we are working with viruses that are moving across all the birds and also to the biologists, the virologists and the biologists that are working with us, and also our university and our Ministry of Science who support our work. Thank you very much. I think I would take one question. No, I don't know if somebody would like to ask something. Unfortunately, I couldn't show too much the idea of the change of the structure, but maybe today in the meeting time for the projects, we are going to move to the IBM to work with these ideas. And we have all the data already currently and working with our approaches of matching learning. This is nice, even though you could read the papers are already published, but it's just here that at the end I would like to choose this only. So this is just only that really you are computational, but don't forget this problem because this is the global example of emerging and re-emerging battery. Of emerging and re-emerging viruses. So it's not N. And here are the new projects that we are working on. This guy is from Cuba. This is the point of the virus transmission, how our hunted and classification of sequences have been done for the data. There are many viruses, how the ah, here, this is the one I will. Ah, here, this is the one I would like to show you. That is really okay. The normalization of the compilation matrix shows us that at least with 16 families, we are able to make good classification. And then we change to this problem that is not having the usually camera representation, but also using the secondary structure representation that have this one, two, three, four, five, four different ways to be represented. Different way to be represented. And then we have to, we did that already. We represent all the these only four, five families that were used to classify the meta-epiromics data that we already got from the Santa Marta program. And this is what we did with Carolina now. We work and test these four different classificators. And the only ones that are working well are this one. Working well are this one and only one representation. And it's interesting because we thought before that maybe this representation that is the more general is going to work well. But the best that is working well is this one that we call the Fontana representation. Okay, and here are the people. Thank you, Alexis, Ernesto, Clara, our virology professor from Antiochia University, my student that we were working with this day. Students that we were working with this data were another virology working with us, and with Catherine Leighton, that was working at that time in this institute and was the first one who sequenced in Colombia the first strain that arrived to our country of the COVID. So, thank you. Okay.
