So, the real motivation for this talk is to try and see if there are pieces of the observational evidence that we can use to say something about the subglacial environment. And what I'm going to focus on is short-term transient responses because I think this is potentially going to give us something new in terms of how we think about what's going on in the subglacial environment. Both of these are going to Environment. Both of these are going to end up being something like a grounding line problem, and both are going to happen relatively quickly. So I'm going to start by talking about superglacial lakes, which drain very rapidly, and try and say something about what's the dynamics associated with those superglacial lakes, and can we tease apart the kind of uplift and flow velocity signature that we see from a lake drainage event? And then I'm going to wax not so eloquently. Wax not so eloquently about Brent's data from Rutford. So, to start off with, let's think about superglacial lakes. In Greenland, they form within about 150 kilometers of the ocean every summer, and there are hundreds and hundreds of them. The thing that I'm going to focus on is this really nice data set that Laura Stevens and Sarah Dass and others collected. This is a network of gene. This is a network of GPS receivers which they put out around a supraglacial lake that forms where the ice flows over basal topography. And so this lake forms every summer. And so it's about a 10 square kilometer size lake. And the interesting thing is that you get to watch this thing drain episodically. What I'm showing you is the movie from their data reanalysis from 2011. It'll loop, so I can walk my way through it again. Through it again. So these are now showing the uplift at NL08, the flow line velocity, so the velocity in that direction at NL08. There's a crack, a fissure that opens up along this black line. So that's here, and this is the opening of that crack, which goes all the way from the lake down to the bed. And then using their GPS network, they can do two things. They invert forward. Can do two things. They invert for the basal cavity opening spatially and the slip, extra slip along that basal cavity. And so, what they see is a precursor where there's a little bit of uplift, some extra sliding, no crack opening. Then this 10 square kilometer lake drains in an hour and a quarter. It's Niagara Falls for an hour and a quarter. The crack opens, that's how the water gets to the bed. It then pushes up a rather large blister and everything starts sliding very quickly. Blister and everything starts sliding very quickly. And then there's this long-term transient. And so we can talk at great length about all the bits and pieces about this piece of data. I'm just going to talk about a few elements of it. The first is that there's this precursor phase. All I'll say is that there's a mullin off to the side of the lake. It's plausible to suspect that some of that water is making its way down the mulin, that hydrates the base. That hydrates the base right in a patch that grows. You get extra basal slip, so this is actually seeing that basal water pressure decreasing the basal stress. And then the ice sheet essentially rips itself open. You open this basal crack. You very, very rapidly drain the water to the base of the ice sheet. So this is draining a 10-square-kilometer lake in an hour and a quarter. And then there's this subsequent post-drainage response. Subsequent post-drainage response where you see the cavity expand and the height then decrease again. So, how do we think about that? Well, I'm certainly not the first one to try and think about this. Victor Tsi and others have thought about, particularly about the rapid drainage event, as a bit of a hydrofracturing type of problem. I'm not going to think about that particular problem, asides to say I'm going to take a different model. Decides to say, I'm going to take a different model for this subglacial environment. So, in their model, they've essentially taken a crack tip that's being fed by a turbulent flow, and I'm going to try and treat something that's closer to what Victor did with Adekare, which is asking what's the influence of having this subglacial network. So, here we'll start off with a bit of a reduced model. Here is our reduced model of that subglacial environment. Of that subglacial environment. So, I'm going to take an elastic sheet of ice. This is a very rapid lake drainage event. We're going to put that water down in the form of essentially a large flux right down at the center. And then the subglacial environment, the easiest way to think about that to start with is a shallow film of water that stretches off to infinity. I'm going to relax that assumption later, but let's just see how that plays out to start with. If we think about the flow in the subject, If we think about the flow in the subglacial cavity, the water flux must be related to the pressure gradients. What I've written here is a laminar law. That's, of course, not the case when it's thundering down like Niagara Falls. You can adapt that. We've looked at what the differences are. But if we take this law just for illustrative purposes to start with, we find that the cavity evolves something like a gravity current equation. So the height of the cavity changes in time due to a divergence of the flux. Due to a divergence of the flux, and the flux is driven by pressure gradients, which can either be elastic or hydrostatic. We're going to focus on these elastic pressure gradients as that cavity is first spreading. Okay, and let me just start by saying that that question about how the cavity expands is the question that I think is related to how the grounding line, as it were, advances and recedes. And so, let's think about this just for a second. And so let's think about this just for a second. If we have a grounding line, or in this particular case, a grounding line, a circular grounding line, where our blister is expanding, there is a point at which the ice touches back down onto the bedrock, and so the height of the cavity goes to zero. That's just like, if you pour water onto the table, there's a point at which the water makes a contact line with the table. And it turns out that those kinds of problems, mathematically, you can't get the contact line to advance. And so you then need to go think very carefully. And so, you then need to go think very carefully about how you actually get the contact line to move. So, in our case, with this elastic blister, what you find is that in the center, you get something that looks like a bell-shaped curve. This is a fairly generic thing. But if you want to understand how the grounding line moves, the real challenge is figuring out how you get the water to the grounding line. So it is like if you take a cup of water on the table, you have a thin film at the bottom, how do you actually peel it off the table? Peel it off the table. It's almost a fluid-driven fracturing problem. And so the key piece of physics here is right at the front, you have to drive enough water into that front region to actually get the thing to bend off the base. And at that point, that's where our subglacial network comes in. And so in that particular case, you've got a pre-wetting film. You can draw the water out of the pre-welting film to fill the cavity, and that's why this can advance. So the punchline from this first part is to say, The punchline from this first part is to say that you can get a rate of advance, which is dependent on things like the thickness of that hydrological network, and then the forcing from the interior. This would be the curvature that that interior blister essentially puts at the grounding line. So this is, as it were, as that cavity of water is spreading, the interior blister is peeling up the edge, and it's like a fracture-driven problem. We can match those things together, and if you match Match those things together, and if you match this bell-shaped curve in the interior with this sort of peeling law, you can make predictions for how this blister should evolve with time. You can compare that to data from the lab. That's not really what I want to focus on here, so I'll skip over it. But there are other ways to regularize that problem at the front. And so here's, as it were, some of the pictures from what Ian and Neil Bongforth and John de Brud did. And Neil Bongforth and John de Bruden did. And I'll just point out that here you can either have a hydrological network, you could have an air gap if you don't think you have water at the base, you could have something that's more like what Victor Sein was thinking about, which is a cracking problem. But there are various pieces of physics which you have to think about carefully. How exactly do you do this problem at the front? What I'm going to think about now is a sub-glacial till type of problem. So this is a different. Problem. So, this is a different piece of physics at the front. We're going to take a porous medium and we're going to assume that at the bottom of the Greenland Lake, or the Greenland ice sheet, that porous till is always fully saturated with water. So now think about having the Greenlandic ice sheet with a rapid lake drainage event onto a subglacial till that's already full of water. Now, when you try and pull the ice sheet off, the thing that allows you to propagate that fracture forward is sucking. That fracture forward is sucking water out of the till and filling the cavity right at the front. And so that process is fairly fast. The slight detail is that we've also thought about poroelasticity at the front, so the pressure within the till can actually diffuse in front of our growing blister. What that gives you is the following kind of model. What this says is what I said before. This is the growth of that cavity as a function of time, and this gives you essentially the porelastic diffusion. Essentially, the pore elastic diffusion. This is the diffusion of pore pressure within that subglacial till. So, let me give you a picture so you can sort of get your eye into what sort of problem this or behavior this gives you. So, these are two different simulations where we've taken two different permeabilities of till, a high and a low permeability. We've injected a certain volume of water up till non-dimensional time t equals to one at the beginning. Time t equals to one at the beginning, you get a rapid cavity inflation followed by a period where this cavity deflates and the pore pressure is diffusing into the far field. So the behavior you get here is a rapid inflation, growth of the cavity, followed by a subsequent relaxation, the cavity gets longer, the height decays, and then a rapid decay or collapse of the cavity as the pore pressure allows water to leak into the far field. If we look at what that If we look at what that looks like in terms of numerical simulations where we vary things like the Darcy number, which is a measure of the permeability of the till, or this E number, which is essentially the stiffness of the till, we can see that you get this generic behavior, rapid inflation. So this would be the height of the blister, rapid inflation, long tail during which the height relaxes, followed by collapse. And these various pieces are, you know, a rapid inflation. Are a rapid inflation, that's the turbulent phase. This long phase during which the height decays is governed by this peeling process at the front. The fact that you get a rapid decay is a signature of porelasticity. That's the water essentially diffusing into the far field. Okay, so with those as the sort of the kinds of generic behaviors, if we now look at this Stevens data out to longer time, so this is now. Time, so this is now the Stevens data for NL08, but plotted for 50 days after the superglacial lake drainage event. What you find is an initial precursor phase, so this is that Mulin draining water down to the base, rapid drainage over an hour and a quarter, followed by a long period which is at least consistent with this sort of blister spreading as a function of time dominated by the permeability. Dominated by the permeability of the subglacial tilt, and then the whole thing collapses, potentially because you've got this pore elastic behavior in the tilt. So that gives you, as it were, a way to think about the transient pore pressure within the subglacial environment. And I think the sort of punchline of this is that by thinking about how that pore pressure moves around in the subglacial environment, you potentially have a spatial map of pore pressure as a function of time, which you can relate to velocity. Can relate to velocity. And so that's, as it were, the punchline from the superglacial lake drainage problem. Would the fact that it's not a flat surface, the bed is not flat, but there is some calf topography, would that change alter the whole picture? It does. So if I go back to the movie, for example. Then the fact that it's not flat gives you the fact that this isn't exactly a, it's more elliptical in terms of the shape of the blister. And as you, so this movie is playing out till two days, you also find that the blister, because it's now basically the constant volume of the lake, that blister translates and drifts downstream in the flow direction. So there's all sorts of interesting complications there. You have also the slope of the surface. So, the slope of the surface. Yeah, yeah, so the slope of the surface has to be commensurate with the flow direction, right? And so that's why this sort of deformation pattern drifts slowly that way. Yeah? So you've got this elastic plate model that applies not just in the blister but also the region where you're injecting water into the till. Now what's the length scale of that region in your simulations? Is that actually much longer than you know expected? Then you know, slickness. No, so contact line being modelled by an elastic thin plate. Yeah, so that hence, uh, uh, Colin and a postdoc of mine, Adam Butler, and I, so irritating this problem, so the height of the ice is about a kilometer, the blister gets to about two and a half kilometers, right? So that's not many times the thickness of the ice. It's also not very small compared to the thickness of the ice, it's irritating right in the middle. So you could have a white bliss. Middle. So you could have a white blister, but still, the zone in which you're injecting water into the till, which is actually essential to your treatment of the contact line, that zone could be small, so you'd still need a bandler treatment of the contact, of the elastic line. Yeah, yeah, but in terms of the overall flexure, it's not really bending beam. It's also not infinite elastic medium. It's somewhere in between. But I won't show you the solutions for that right now. Any other questions for lake drainage? Any other questions for lake drainage at the moment? Okay, so if you think of lake drainage as an advancing contact line problem, the tidal problem is now the contact line going both ways. And so to at least my mind, the lake drainage problem is an interesting problem because it's you know what the volume of the lake is. And the question is where does it go as a function of time and how does that relate to the speed up in the ice velocity? Relate to the speed up and ice velocity. This is the periodic version. Now I'm going to take the grounding line and I'm going to oscillate it by ocean tides and ask, what does the grounding line do in the grounding zone? And the problem that I've just told you about in the lake drainage is how that tide goes up. The question is, is it any different when it goes down? And this sort of problem has been approached before as well in a number of different ways. Classically, Different ways. Classically, either the grounding line is fixed or is solely determined as a flotation condition, or as Victor and Hillmar have done, is a flotation condition with a fracture condition at the front. What I'm going to argue is that the fluid dynamics of how you get the ocean in and out of that contact line is important just like it was for the Important just like it was for the superglacial lake drainage problem. The real key is how do you get water into the last bit where the ice touches down onto the bed. And so this is something that Cassia Warburton, a PhD student, has done with Duncan Hewitt and myself. And it's essentially doing something very similar to what I've just described in the lake drainage problem. We've got, on the tidal time scales, we've got an elastic ice sheet overlaying. Ice sheet overlaying some sort of till. The ocean has a far-field pressure or height which is going up and down tidally, and we'd like to understand where it touches down as a function of time. And in particular, we're going to try and understand what happens just in this contact region. How do you get the water in and out of that contact region? So here's the tide going in. This is the zoomed out version. This is the zoomed in version. This is the zoomed in version. And it's similar to what I showed you for the lake drainage problem. You have the ocean coming in, there's a slight flexural wave, but it's basically peeling the ice off the bed. And that peeling problem is like a fluids version of a fracturing problem. It's fast. You know, when you peel your cup off the table when it's got the thin film of water, that happens very quickly. And so that's essentially what I've talked to you about in the lake drainage problem. In the lake drainage problem, and we can think about how that rate of advance works. The wrinkle, as it were, is what happens on the way back down. So, think about it in the following way. If you have a bucket of water and you stick your hand into the bucket of water, your hand gets wet quickly. If you pull your hand back out, your hand stays wet, and that's because surface tension leaves a film of water behind on your hand. Surface tension is proportional to the curvature. For an elastic beam, you're proportional to the curvature of the curvature. Being your proportional to the curvature of the curvature, it's the same problem. As the tide goes out, it's hard to get that last bit of water out from between the ice and the tip. And so in order to squeeze that out, you essentially need the ice, the water to drain out, and what you leave is a macroscopic film behind. The question is, how big is that macroscopic film? Does it matter? So what we've done is the following analysis out in the Out in the main part of the cavity where the ocean is deep, of course, viscous resistance to the flow of the ocean is negligible. You really don't have to worry about it. It's just right in at the contact line that you have to think about that flux. How exactly you do that flux is not so important. We've taken, again, a laminar model with some flow through the porous till driven by the slope and the flexural, the elasticity of the ice. The elasticity of the ice, but I think these are, in essence, details. You still leave a film behind. If you take this kind of law, what you find is that the disposited film depth depends on things like the speed of the retreating tide and the slope angle and the bed properties in the following way. And how would you mix salt water and fresh water? I've not mixed salt water and fresh water. Done mixed salt water and fresh water, or done a melting problem on the bottom, either. It's a good question. So, yeah, you would get an extra density driving this flow out, right? But the punchline is that this process of drainage is slow because you're resisted by either the viscous resistance in the till or the viscous resistance in that narrow region between the ice and the bed. And the bed, whereas this peeling problem on the way the tide goes in is fast. So the question is: does that matter? Well, the interesting piece of this, at least to me, is that because you've got this fast process on the incoming tide and slow process on the outgoing tide, you have the possibility of a nonlinear filter on the tides. So if it's really hard to get the water out of that subglacial cavity, then basically the grounding line or the point at which the ice Grounding line, or the point at which the ice touches back down onto the bedrock, is pinned to the furthest in the tide ever goes, right? The very peak of the tidal amplitude. If, however, it's just incredibly easy to flush the water back out, then you follow the tidal signature completely. And in between, you can mix these tides, and in fact, you can therefore get the diurnal, sorry, the fortnightly signal from the tidal forcing. From the tidal forcing mixed into the response of the grounding line. And so, if we take something like observations from Beardmore Glacier, and we look at things like the velocity, which has both a diurnal and Fort Knightley signal, and we force this problem with something like the observed tides and take a punt on what we think the bed slope is and the properties of the slope. Of the subglacial till, you can reproduce this kind of mixed mode by this fast-in, slow-out kind of grounding-wine problem. And so, with that, what I'd like to say is we've looked at two processes in which you think about how you essentially fluid-driven fracture the ice off the bed. We've thought about how it's fast on the way in, it's slow on the way out. Fast on the way in, it's slow on the way out. And this gives us a way of thinking about, or at least starting to think about what the pore pressure is doing both spatially and temporally. The interesting part to do next is to try and then take these kind of predictions, which force the pore pressure here at the grounding line, and ask how do they actually impact, for example, the sliding speed via the kinds of friction laws that we've been talking about throughout the rest of the video. Been talking about throughout the rest of the meeting. All right, I'll leave it there. Is there a potential for cumulatively building up water there if the speed for that water to get back out is sort of overtopped by the coming back in again? Yeah, so what you've so the sort of the So what you've, so the sort of the what happens is that because it's slow on the way back out, right, you can have, you can have essentially a rectifier. So as you go through the spring leap cycle, you go fast up to the next maximum, slow fast up to the next maximum. That essentially allows you to trace out the fortnightly signal, which is essentially what that's doing up there, for example. So there's another So there's a another very simple geometrical reason why these asymmetrical relationships downstream of the grounding line is rotation. So you have a specific relationship between upper and lower surface and upper and lower surface gradients. And upstream of the grounding line, evolves. So unless you have a very particular type of a geometry, As you migraine, if you raise the height of the tide positive upwards, you will get a different shift, vertical shift upstream, downstream. And the asymmetry will... Yeah, so what Hilmar is saying is that, you know, in what I've shown, this analysis is strictly speaking for ice that's a constant thickness. And of course, the ice changes its characteristic thickness and its thickness gradients as you go across the grounding line. Across the grounding line. I think this is more of a question for the observations than anything. You know, that sort of characteristic change in the thickness, I think, gives you a nonlinear filter. But the question is, is that the same nonlinear filter at various outlet glaciers? Because you see this different amounts of mixed modes at different outlet glaciers. So this is this is a very significant caseologist. Very significant asymmetry is the bottom line. And you really have to create a specific geometry to avoid this asymmetry. So I suspect that you will sort of have to keep that in there somewhere. And we find that both portable constant eyes significances, whatever you look at, it totally dominates. As soon as you allow primary line migration, I guess my point is that if it's so dominant, then you should see the same asymmetric response everywhere. Exactly. Everywhere. And you don't. You see, sometimes you see the fortnightly, sometimes you see the diurnal. Right, so there's a huge variety in the sort of responses. We think this might be the reason why you see this wherever you have significantly semi-durnal tides. So you see this everywhere where you would expect it to be able to happen, you can have significant tides. You don't really see it that much across ISO because For cross-size shell, because there you have no tides that divert. So there's no way you can create this 0.7 point B frequency. So wherever you have significant seminar tides, you see this. So it's very universal. So your process will also explain that. But this other thing where the geometry is in there, and that just has to happen. You just click a very special geometry to avoid that asymmetry. This is just a geometrical. Suggest that geometrical. Or, as Alex pointed out, I mean, I was going to make that next point, which is that it's the asymmetry, but then at the end of the day, that slope is going to determine how much grounding line migration you have, like what the range is, right? And then so that will end up causing different modes or different amounts of mixing between the frequencies. Yeah, although, I mean, I think even if you have a complicated topography and even pinning points that you pin and de-pin off of, in some sense, Off of, yeah, in some sense, this is asking the question: how do you pin and de-pin off of those pinning points as well? Right? In terms of this, even as you pin de-pin off of a pinning point, you have to shove the water in and out. So I think you have to be a little bit careful about saying that there is an actual break and slope at the grounding lens. If I take tides out of the picture, there is a zone in which the ice bends viscously to transition from the far field steep to not steep downward slope. The far field having What slope, the far field having about those ratios that Homo just mentioned. However, that viscously bent zone has an extent that's probably comparable to the zone over which your short time scale elastic bending would happen. And so you starting to mix these things, and it's not really like you have this sharp brick when you cancel the drink things across a break and slurve. Yeah, no, I mean, I think in Yeah, no, I mean, I think in some sense it would, well, at least to me, it would be really interesting to start to try and disentangle from different observations in different places which, because there are now a number of mechanisms for this sort of asymmetry, which of those is operating where? Very quick comment. I believe there is always water in that what's called groundline zone. It's not that it completely kind of drains out and is a very full contact with the tail. With the tail. It's all about the wavelengths of radar, what it can resolve, what not. So, usually, people would tell you it's less than, say, six meters or less than three meters, but two meters flooded water. Just to reiterate, this is a simple point. This is a simple point, it has to be in the slope. If you have constant depth slope, if you have constant If you have constant surface flow, then the ice thickness gradient cannot be constant. And in that particular case, it's a very simple case, the asymmetry is exactly 90 times the intensity ratio. So that's a very significant asymmetry. Now, you can create other cases where the asymmetry is less or different, but in this particular case, constant depth slope, constant surface slope is upper nine. But you to your point. But you to your point then to that, like if you have sufficiently good GPS observations, right, on both sides of the grounding line, then you should be able to map out that asymmetry, right, both in terms of the types. Yeah, that is sort of, we have found that you get the ground in a migrant, it sort of is in the brand analysis in a way, it's in there, and you get some extra GPS service. GPS service processing and stuff or so we're sort of looking into this, yeah. Yeah, we did something similar to this in our in our paper as well. Yeah, you did that as well. So I'm not, get me right, I'm not criticizing your work of your process, I think it's very, very important. But there is just a like a really low-hanging fruit that's so simple, it's just based on geometry and hyperstatic equilibrium. Yeah, it should achieve. Yeah, it should achieve that.
