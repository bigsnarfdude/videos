Thank you. Thank you to the organizers for the opportunity to give this talk. It's really a pleasure to speak today, but I would prefer to be at Vanff seeing the weather outside. So what I wanted to talk today to you today is about some joint work with Kristen Schekohoff and Colony Talagotta. So Kristen was my master. So Kristen was my master's student. She's currently a first year student at PhD student at UVA now. Colony is my PhD student. In this work, we computed perfect forms over imaginary quadratic fields up to absolute discriminant 5000. We looked at some bounds on the types of polytopes that can arise and give some argument for a lower bound on the number of perfect forms. And so this idea. And so, this idea of Boronoi tessellations and perfect forms has been mentioned a couple times in the talks today and yesterday, and I'm going to say a little bit more about those. So, this picture, this shows up in basically any slide presentation that I make. Like, this is the motivating example. This is the picture you can keep in your head for all these various things. The idea here, this is a picture of the complex. The idea here, this is a picture of the complex upper half plane. And we're identifying points in the upper half plane with positive definite quadratic forms. You get in black here this tessellation by triangles, by ideal triangles in the upper half plane. So these black edges here correspond to geodesics in the complex upper half plane that join together cusps. That join together cusps that correspond to unimodular matrices. So if you view A over B, the cusp A over B is a vector AB, and C over D is a vector C D, and you compute the determinant of the matrix ABCD, you'll get plus minus one. And so the relationship to quadratic forms is each of the triangles in this tessellation, if you view its vertices as vertices as vectors in z squared, then these are vectors of a these are minimal vectors of a positive definite quadratic form that's perfect. So it's perfect in the sense that it's uniquely determined by the collection of minimal vectors and the minimum value it takes. In blue here, I have the Sayre tree. So this is a trivalent tree and another interpretation. And another interpretation of this tree is with the interpretation of the upper half plane as positive definite quadratic forms, these blue points on the tree correspond to well-rounded forms. So these are the quadratic forms whose minimal vectors generate R2. So I'll say more about this, but this is the picture that we're going to try to generalize when we talk about permanent. Perfect forms over imaginary quadratic fields. So, the way that I'm going to be thinking about these things is in the classical case, instead of the upper half plane, we're looking at the three-dimensional vector space of two by two real matrices. In there, there's an open cone, an open co-dimension zero cone of positive definite symmetric matrices. And then, if you mod that cone out by scaling, mod that cone out by scaling, you can get an identification with the disk or the upper half plane, however you prefer. Okay and so in the generalization, this is what we're going to do. So the rational numbers get replaced with a number field F. Instead of SL2 over Q or G L two over Q, we're looking at the restriction of scalars. Of scalars of GLN, but n is going to be 2 in today's talk. The upper half plane gets replaced by the corresponding symmetric space for the group of real points. And so just in terms of how this grows as n and the degree of the field changes, so if you write the degree of the number field f as r plus 2s, where r is the number of real places. R is the number of real places and s is the number of pairs of complex places. The dimension is you can think of it as the number of real places times n times n plus 1 over 2 plus s times n squared minus 1. And so this is coming from either the cone picture or maybe the positive definite matrix picture, right? So for every real place, So, for every real place, we're looking at an n by n symmetric matrix. And for every complex place, it'll be an n by n Hermitian matrix. And then we're computing the real dimension. And then the minus one is for subtracting scaling. And so, yeah, and so the group G, or the real points is a product of copies of G L and R with copy and Of GLNR with copy and copies of GLNC over the real places and the complex places. The ambient vector space where the cone is going to live is a product of n by n real matrices and n by n Hermitian matrices. And then the positive definite cone is just the product of the positive definite cones in each slot. And like I said, the corresponding symmetric space that we need to consider is the cone. Need to consider is the cone modulo positive scaling. And there's an action of the group on the cone by G acting on A is just G A G star in each of the slots. And then this will descend to an action on the symmetric space X. And so we're going to view these points in the cone as quadratic forms or Quadratic forms or Hermitian forms or some blend in a mixed signature case by evaluating at a vector by evaluating at each place. And so every vector X in, say, O has an image under each of the places, each of the embeddings. And then you evaluate the positive definite symmetric matrix or the positive definite Hermitian matrix on the corresponding vector. On the corresponding vector. So, with that, you can talk about arithmetic minima. So, the minimum of a point in this cone is going to be the minimum where you let x range over vectors in O n, where O is the ring of integers. Take away zero, the zero vector. And the collection of minimal vectors, this capital M A, is just the vector. Is just the vectors that attain this minimum. And just like in the classical case, a form is going to be called perfect if it's uniquely determined by those two bits of data, the collection of minimal vectors and the minimum value it attains. The vectors in O give rise to points on the boundary of the cone via this Q map. And so for each real and complex place V, Each real and complex place v, Q evaluated at a vector x is just x times x star, where x times x star means the corresponding image of the vector x at each place, and x star is conjugate transpose at the complex places and transpose at the real places. And so, if I take the image of O n under this Q map, I get a description. Then, under this Q map, I get a discrete set along the boundary of the cone under consideration. And then the Voronoi polyhedron is the convex hull of those points. And so I have this convex hull, this polyhedron around this cone, and then I mod that out by scaling, and it'll descend to this tessellation of the symmetric space X. And this is the same thing that you would get in the classical picture. The same thing that you would get in the classical picture to get the tessellation of the upper half plane by ideal triangles. And so there's been a lot of work that's been done for various values of n and f. So for n equals 2, I think the perfect forms have been enumerated out to, yeah, for f equals q, the perfect forms have been enumerated out to n equals 8. out to n equals eight. And I think for n equals nine, this is still not done. There's many experts on perfect forms in the audience that can correct me if I'm wrong. There are lower bounds, meaning you can just go and start finding perfect forms and checking that they are not equivalent to each other. And so there's at least over half a million perfect forms for n equals nine. nine over number fields the situation uh there's a lot less i think that that's been done so over number fields even the n equals one case is of interest and so um there's been work done by me in the real quadratic case uh by komatsu and watanabe for the mixed uh for a family of mixed signature cubics uh segreased for some cyclotomic cases Cyclotomic cases. As soon as you get to n equals 2, then as far as I know, the degree of the number field where computations have been done is just the highest degree is 4. And these are for some a small number of CM quartic examples. There's some data for real quadratic number fields and imaginary quadratic. And then the imaginary quadratic ones are the ones that this project sort of. That this project sort of extended the data on. So, previous to this project, I think the number of examples that were computed is fairly small. Here, when I say mixed cubic, this paper with Paul Gunnels, this mixed cubic example was just one example. So the techniques are there in order to do more, but the computation was only done for one. When you get down to n equals three and four, the number of examples is very. The number of examples is very, very small. So it's just a small number of a handful of imaginary quadratic for n equals three, and I think it's just two imaginary quadratic for n equals four. So here's an example of how the Borneo algorithm works to enumerate the perfect forms for n equals two for a specific imaginary quadratic field. And so you Field. And so you can compare this with work done by a Whitley student of Cremona back in 1990. And so I'm looking at q adjoining the square root of minus 163. And I'm going to let omega be 1 plus root minus 163 over 2. You can check that if you want, you can check that this matrix here that I've written, this matrix A, is a perfect form, meaning if you compute its collection. If you compute its collection of minimal vectors, then its minimal vectors together with, I think this one's normalized to have minimum value one, will uniquely determine the form. And so up to plus minus, so up to torsion, here are the minimal vectors. And under the Q map, if you map those onto the boundary of the four-dimensional cone, you'll see that this gives rise. Gives rise when you mod out by scaling, this gives rise to a triangular prism in hyperbolic three-space. And so what the algorithm would say to do is now you have to look at the faces of this polytope and find neighboring perfect forms and check whether they're equivalent to the ones that you've seen before. So you can do that. You take the triangular prism. The neighbor across one of the triangular faces is equivalent to the initial perfect line. Is equivalent to the initial perfect one that you found. The neighbor across the other triangular face is mu and you get a cube octahedron. The three quadrilaterals are, the neighbors across those are equivalent to each other and nu, and giving another triangular prism. And so now what you have left at this point is to check the faces of the cube octahedron and the faces of that new triangular prism. Faces of that new triangular prism that you found. The theory tells you that after finitely many steps, this is going to terminate because there's only finitely many perfect forms up to equivalence. And so if you do that and run through it, you'll see that you end up with 11 tetrahedra, eight prisms, three square pyramids, two hexagonal caps, and one cube octahedron. And so these correspond, each of these corresponds to a GL2O equivalent. A GL2O equivalence class of perfect forms where the configuration of minimal vectors under the Q map gives rise to these hyperbolic polytopes. And so what this tells you is sort of analogous to the classical case where you could tessellate hyperbolic two-space with one class of triangles. Here you're going to need more classes of more polytopes to tessellate hyperbolic three space. But that it can be done. But that it can be done with these polytopes. So, in the work that Colin and Kristen and I did, the first result is just the polytopes that arise, they're controlled by the perfect forms that arise. And so we wanted to make sure that we don't get arbitrarily complicated polytopes. And so we wanted. Complicated polytopes. So, we wanted to make sure that we don't get arbitrarily complicated configurations of minimal vectors. And so, what we're able to prove is up to sine, so the number of minimal vectors for a positive definite binary Hermitian form over any of these quadratic number fields is 12. So, if you include plus minus, it'll be 24. And so, what that means is the polytopes that could arise for Could arise for any of these imaginary quadratic fields, the corresponding hyperbolic polytope is going to have at most 12 vertices. There's 6,860,405 types of three-dimensional polytopes with 12 vertices. But that said, in the range of computation, which was discriminant less than 5,000, so that's 1,500 examples, we only observed eight. And so there's And so there's a big gap between what's, I guess, theoretically possible and what we saw. We didn't really investigate too much, trying to narrow down the 6 million to the 8 observed. These are the eight that we saw, and this is the same eight that was seen in an earlier paper that I had at Front ANS Proceedings, where the initial first Where the initial first small-scale computation was done. What I have on this table is the polytopes that we saw, the number of fields in which we saw those polytopes arise. And then in the last column is in the scope of the computation, what percentage of those polytopes were of each given type. So for example, you'll see that the tetrahedra were the most popular. They showed up in at least They showed up at least once in 1504 of the fields, and overall they contributed 91% of the polytopes we saw. The cube octahedron was very rare. We only saw it in 16 fields, and it's a very small percentage. We have some ideas on why some of the more complicated polytokes show up fewer times, but maybe I won't go into that. Maybe I won't go into that today. So, here's the distribution of the polytopes that we saw. And so, this is a sort of a distribution of the types of perfect forms. Along the horizontal axis is the absolute discriminant. And then the color of the dot tells you the type of polytope that the perfect form corresponds to. And then along the vertical axis is the percent. The vertical axis is the percentage of polytopes for that given discriminant. And so, what you'll see is: yeah, as the discriminant grows, it looks like the percentage of polytopes that are tetrahedra grows as well. Just overall, in terms of the number of perfect forms. Here's a plot. Along the horizontal axis is the discriminant, and along the vertical axis is the number of perfect forms. And again, we see this growth in the number of perfect forms. And so this gives you a sense of how much more complicated it's going to be to compute things using this Bourneois tessellation to compute things like cohomology of arithmetic groups. So we're getting these tessellations of spaces. We're getting these tessellations of spaces, but the number of polytopes that are involved in tessellating the space grows with discriminant. But it is still finite and it is still explicitly computable. Just remember, in contrast for the classical case where you're tessellating a hyperbolic two-space, you only need one triangle to tessellate, and the triangle is sort of the simplest polygon that you might expect, right? And so we seem to have the benefit that most of the polytopes are the same. That most of the polytopes are the simplest. Most of them are tetrahedra, but more of them show up in increasing number as the discriminant grows. We saw this plot and we decided that maybe it'd be nice to understand that growth a little bit. And so here's a bound, a lower bound on the number of perfect forms for an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant delta. So in order to So, in order to state the bound, we need two functions. One is the Lobachewski function. So, this is log of absolute sine of t from zero to theta. And then the Dedekin-Zeta function, which is the sum of one over the norms of integral ideals raised to the s. And with these two functions, we can give a lower bound on the number of perfect forms. It's the ceiling of It's the ceiling of the absolute discriminant to the three halves times the value of the Dedekind-Zeta function at 2 divided by 360 pi squared, and then the Lobachewski function evaluated at pi over 3. I can say a little bit, or I'm going to say a little bit about where this comes from. It comes from a volume argument. So here's. So here's right. So the first lemma is basically it's if you have a polytope, a convex polytope with more than six vertices, then there is a simplicial decomposition of that that doesn't include, that doesn't introduce new vertices consisting of at most two times the number of vertices minus nine tetrahedra. And so in particular, since Since the polytopes that we're considering, we can prove that there's at most 12 vertices. We'll have 2 times 12 minus 9 tetrahedra at most when we simplicly subdivide these. The Lobachevsky function is coming in because the volume of the maximum volume hyperbolic tetrahedron that has vertices at the cuffs, the biggest volume is. At the cups, the biggest volume is three times the value of the Lobachevsky function at pi over three. So it's approximately 1.01. And then the Dedekind-Zeta function comes in through a classical result of Humbert, computing the co-volume of GLN, GL2O. And so this is phrased in terms of the absolute value of the discriminant raised to the three halves, value of the zeta function at two, and then with some normal. At 2, and then with some normalization involving a power of 2 and a power of pi. And so now the bound comes out because we have a bound on the volume, on the co-volume of GL2OF involving the Dedek and Zeta function. Hyperbolic 3-space is going to be covered by GL2O translates of the text. Translates of the polytopes that we're considering. Each of the polytopes will decompose into at most two times 12 minus 9 tetrahedra. And each of those tetrahedra has volume less than 3 times the Lobachevsky function at pi over 3. And then just solving gives the bound. When we actually When we actually plot the bound against what we see in the data, it wasn't very good. And so we wanted to understand why. And so we were using, we were just looking for a bound at that point. And right, so the bound was using the fact that if you have a polytope with 12 vertices, then you can decompose it into like 15 tetrahedra. 15 tetrahedra. And then those 15 tetrahedra would contribute at most the volume of the biggest tetrahedron. But at least what the data suggests is most of the polytopes that arise aren't the ones with 12 vertices. Most of the ones that arise are the tetrahedra. And so if we're not after a bound, but just an estimate on the number of perfect forms, it suggests that maybe the number of perfect forms should just be 15 times what we computed. 15 times what we computed as the bound. And so if we let E of f be that value, so 15 times the bound from the theorem, what we did then was just plotted this ratio of the number of perfect forms divided by E of F. And what we find is shown here in blue. Again, on the horizontal axis, we have the discriminant, and on the vertical axis, we have this ratio. It isn't a It isn't a lower bound, right? Because there are points early on where the ratio is below one. But at least the data suggests that perhaps for discriminant large enough, maybe it is an actual lower bound. This ratio appears to tend towards a scalar that is strictly greater than one. We didn't investigate this any further either. This is any further either. And I thank you for your attention. Thank you, Dan, for this talk. Very nice. So, I think that could be several comments and questions. So, one one comment because about the bounds for the number of perfect forms in round nine, for instance, there will be a talk of Van Verden on Thursday morning where he will give Uh, well, it will give more precise bounds on this. So, in fact, there are more 10 millions, I think, for 1.9. And there is a lower bound and upper bound, but unfortunately, the upper bound is still very large, too large to be interesting in terms of computation. Do you have a list of those sixteen cube octahedral occurrences? In the data, so it can be extracted. Right, okay. You didn't find any regularity, like three times the square-free part minus two could be a square, for instance. That's what I would expect. No, yeah, so we didn't look at that. But can you say why you expect something special? Well, from these polytopes that I'm looking at. But although I'm looking at a different field, kind of a larger one, there the cubical symmetry or the yeah is much more apparent and much more expected. Can you say what you expect again, or I can check it? So check whether 3d minus 2, where d is sort of the square free part of the discriminant, is itself a square. Like 6 or 2 Okay, yeah, that's something I can check. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. So, Don, can you hear me? Yes. Yeah. So you might have said this, I might have missed it. The 15 in the last slide, was there a heuristic for the value or why it was 15? Oh, yeah. So the 15 shows up because of this first little lemma. I think this is well known, but we went ahead and proved it anyway because I couldn't find a reference. But if you have a polytope with But if you have a polytope with a convex polytope with V vertices, then there's a simplicial subdivision of it with at most 2v minus 9 tetrahedra. And so it was just this, you compute the average degree and then it just sort of pops out. But since for us, the maximum number of vertices that show up on the polytopes is. Vertices that show up on the polytopes is 12. 2 times 12 minus 9 is 15. And so we were bounding the volume of the polytope using 15 times the volume of the tetrahedra in this bound. But if most of the polytopes that show up are actually tetrahedra instead, then multiplying the bound by 15 gives us something closer to maybe the Something closer to maybe the expected number of perfect forms. So, other questions or comments? So simple question. So the data are available of the results? Yeah, so the data should be available on my webpage somewhere. I guess John has a link. But yeah, I then just think of things. Than just nature strings. So, quaternion algebra, say, over quadratic fields. I'm sorry, the audio is. I can't hear you. I have a problem with my audio. Yeah. You don't understand anything. Yeah? I can see a little better now. Yeah. Okay. So, did you look at quaternion algebras, indefinite quaternion algebras over real quadratic fields or other fields? quadratic fields or other fields? No, no. This was this was I was only looking at this one case for the or this this one families. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I put a link in the chat. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Okay. So if there are no other questions or comments, so thanks the speaker again. Thank you very much. No, it was good just a few minutes ago. Yeah, it was good just a few minutes ago. Okay, so I'm unsure that the next speaker is here. Alexander does he have an alarm clock on. Well, I mean, oh, come on. I mean, it is seven. It's seven o'clock in the morning. It's a quarter past seven in the morning. Yeah. Where is Alexander physically right now? In Tai Ti, in Pape. Oh, Lord. So it's UTC minus 10. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, we are going to. Okay, yeah, yeah, we are going to wait uh a few minutes just to have a a short break.  It it is less loud, but it is full of parasite. When you asked your question directly, it was perfect. The second time.
