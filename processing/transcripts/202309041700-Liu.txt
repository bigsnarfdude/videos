So thanks for the invitation and the tech for the organizer for organizing such a wonderful workshop. So today my talk is not so related to the haycater. So I want to talk about some of the results for final threeport. Okay. So let me first start with some notions and the basic facts about the About the prime final three faults and its typical components. Okay, so a prime final three force is just a final three force which is of PCR rank one. So then we can just define, just pick up ample generator of the PCR group and define the degree like this. And then we can also define the index of this time fast report like. the time fast report like this the index i satisfies the negative kx is uh equal to the i times h okay and uh for five found three form we have uh four classification results so their index is uh their index are between one and four and uh for index four the only point function The only point function 34 is just P3. And for index 3, there's also only one type of 0.54, which is quadratic 34 G4. And the situation is different for two cases. So in this case, the degree is between 1 and 5. And here are some, there are two examples which we will also mention later. Which we will also mention later. The first one is the TB2 case. It is called the quadricolid, which is the double cover of a T3 and the branch along a degree 4K surface. And the degree 3 case is called the cubic 34. And finally, the index 1 case has 10 deformation type. And the degree is uh and the degree is uh even number between two and 22 and not equal to 20. so here are also two examples the first one is the degree turn case which is called the gujan vokai report and it it is uh either a linear section and a quadratic section of the graph menu jar25 or a double cover of uh degree 5 index 2 panel bar 3 for there are two two different types of bushmbo category and another one is the degree 14 time fast report which is which is the codiment five linear section of the graph manual gr26 so this is the the classification of the prime function variables and now since since the the the index four and the index three case are uh Wickets are in some sense is simple, so we only consider index one and the index two kits. Okay, so for index one and index two primary for their rep category in general has does not have a full exceptional collection. So for example, for index 2 case, that's why we index 2.534, then we in general we have file three for then we in general we have such a similar organic composition of its direct category and uh so here oyh is just the generator of the pita group the ample one and then there's a residual category which we denote it by a q y and we will call it the cookness of components of one okay so this is the index two case and similarly uh index one case uh and uh for since this And for simplicity, we assume the degree is not, it's at least 10. So we have such a single sort of computation. And we also have a component. But here, the exceptional bundles are the structure shift and the rank Q, sorry, not rank Q, and a higher rank bundle, EX. And this EX is a gap of a universal sub-bundle from. A universal subbundle from some extra net. Okay, this is the definition of a component. Yeah. And it can be regarded as a non-commutative mood projective variety in a sense of a lot. This is an admissible subcategory of smooth predictive variety. Okay. Okay. And here are some existing examples of the components. First, for index one, final three of degree 12, 16, and 18, their component is just equivalent to the real category of a smooth particular car. So this AX is in some literature, it's called the homologous. Literature is called the homologic projective new curve of X. It can be put in the framework of the homological projective of the Kuzneto. Okay. And if we take Y to be a cubic three-fold, then in this case, its component is no longer equivalent to the geometric one. The geometric one, no longer even to the category of the scheme. It is a fractional collaborative category, which means the cube of its real functor is isomorphic to the shift is by 5. Yeah. And we can also regard this cooking component as a non-commutative curve. For example, first its field dimension is strictly smaller than two. Strictly is more than two. And then if the remote K group is very true, which is the same as the most limited car. And moreover, the stability concentration on this component behaves very similar to the slope stability on the smooth specific curve. So there are several reasons that we call this component a non-communicated curve. Non-communicated curve. Yeah, and this is a result of the Bayer Laha Larry that for any prime final threefold of index one or two, this is exist a family of resilient CB condition on the crypto component. And our results start with this classical. With this classical node, the reconstruction of the kind, which says that for any index one, prime plus three for of degree of degree 12 and 15, then we know that there's a homological prediction U-carb, a total is QN. And Mukai proved that this three-fold X is isomorphic to a generalized Bruin node locus of a moduli of a rectangular fungal over this curve, CX. So here the generalized Bruin node locus means so the ordinary Brune node condition is just give the fund of the global section of bundle. And in this case, the generalized one we This case, the generalized one, we so for generalized, we need we need to tensor with a higher rank bundle. So, for example, for degree 12 case, the bruno condition is just given by the dimension of the global section. And for degree 16 case, the brunette condition is given by first with cancer with this bundle fx, and then fund is the dimension of global protection. Yeah. Well, there's a nature question that if this brunoder type result can be extended to the other point reports. So our answer will make use of a cup component, which replace this commutative, this smooth carb, stage, by the non-commutative carb, the cushion component. The non-complex carbon component. So let me explain it. First, let me fix some location. So, first, this eye is the nature inclusion, and we denote the right adjoint of this functor by this eye of a streak. And if right adjoint is denoted by the eye of a star. And there are several distinct. Distinguished objects in this component. One of them is called the gluing object of this category or orthogonal. So for index one case, this gluing object GX is defined as the I up peak of the EX. Here EX is an exceptional bundle in the semi-dollar composition. And for index view case, this between objects This green object QY is defined as the eye six of QY, where QY is the kernel bundle of the evaluation map of OYH. So our theorem starts with this key observation. So we know that there's an equivalence between the QY and DB6 for degree 12 and degree 16 case. And moreover, However, actually it is proved in the classical paper that under such equivalence, this structure shift or this bundle effect will map to the green object. So this means, if we back to the theorem of Makai, this means if we identify the T B C X with C B say x with the component of x, then the moduli of a stable bundle design is morphed to a moduli of a stable object over this component with respect to some regional condition. And then, as we observe that this fluorino condition is exactly given by the green object we have defined. So, this is the main idea we generalize this pure node. We generalize this pre-node type result to other point-fast reports. So, more precisely, let me check to this page. Okay, so more precisely, we first replace the carved CX by a non-communicate curve, Kukno component. And then we replace the moduli of stable bundle over this card by the moduli of a stable object in the Kukno component. And finally, the generalized pre-node. The generalized node condition is replaced by the pre-node condition given by the GX, the green object. This is the main idea. Let me show the main theorem. So, first, for index one case, we have such a theorem. This is proving the joint work with Javowski, me, and John. So, for any index one times three-fold, whose degree is that? Whose degree is at least the 10. We prove that this X is isomorphic to a Brune node locus in such a Blue Gen model space, where the Brune node condition is given by the Green object. So here, this ND is just an integer depends on D, and this sigma is a still invariance condition. For example, you can take this sigma to be the stable. To be the steady condition constructed by Bayer, Lahore, Marquis, and Larry. And this notation is just a fixed numerical class. Yes. And this fixed is a scratch craper shift support on X. So the idea of the proof is just we start with a structure shift of points or it says the scratch paper shift of points. The scatter shape of points, and then we apply this i upper star functor to this object, and then we can prove that this object i up star say x is stable in the component. So this will induce an embedding of x into the bridge and model space. And moreover, we can show that it is contained in the brain node locus. And the most difficult part is to show this brainless locus is exactly Show this frame of the locus is exactly equal to the x itself. Yes, so this is the idea for proof. And this is for this is the theorem for index one case. And we have the similar result for index two case for index q 0.5 of degree not smaller than q. We also prove that y is the isomorphic to a real node locus in the Bridge and modular space. Focus in the bridge and model space. The ideal is exactly the same as the index one here. Any question about this? For low degree, we can prove that the mirrors will only stay for the higher degrees that for low degree. Higher degree is that for lower degree, the Kushnon component is simple. In most cases, the Kushnon component for lower degree is just the OX orthogonal. And in this case, actually, we can prove that this X is isomorphic to a three-time modular space in this OX orthogonal. But this is not very interesting. We don't know any application of this result. Yeah. That is the two green nose type theorem. And next, I want to talk about some applications of this to you guys. The first one is just it's called the categorical toralism. So this is a so the first query is for English one case. This is a direct query of our brain nodal construction. It says that if we have It says that if we have such an equivalence between components, such that it maps the gluing object to the gluing object, then we will get the x is isomorphic to x prime. Yeah, this is a very easy follow from this theorem, right? And similarly, for index 2 case, we have the same result, which says that for 2 index 2 time function 3 for if there is an equation. Is an equivalence between this component, such that if it speaks the green object, then these two quantum processes are isomorphic. However, we know that, for example, for cubic three-fold, their new component actually can determine its isomorphic class. So, which means the green object is redundant. So, this So this so the second theorem just explains why this queen office is redundant. So for any two index two prime of R3 of degree two, three or four, when we prove that up to some explicit auto equivalence on QY, any equivalence between QY and QY prime will affect the moving off. Of this, so this means whenever we have such an equivalence, we can compose it with a sign of equivalence, and we will get a new equivalent which fixes the Green object. Then, combined with our Brilliant reconstruction theorem for index 2 primarily, we can prove such a categorical correlation for index 2K. Yes, as I mentioned, this Kuznu component actually can determine this. Can determine this isomorphic class without the green object. So, for the D equal to three case, this category of theory is proved by different group of people using different methods. And for T equal to two case, Atavila, sorry, I don't know how to pronounce his name. So they proved this. They prove this query under some generic assumption. They need to assume this index Q converse rate of degree Q is general in the moduli. So RSM actually drops this generic function and works for all degree 2K. So this is the first application. And the second application is that we can use this to compute the Use this to compute the group of three market type auto equivalents of new components. For index 2 case, we have such a description of the group of auto equivalents. So here, this O is so-called your rotation functor. And this out of y in this group of only queries by just apply the put forward function. Apply the put forward function and restrict to the clicking component. And we have here we have the shift function. Okay. And for example, for t equal to three case, this rotation function shift by one is just the cell function of the component. And this case is also proved by GG Lio independently using a different method. And similarly, for integral. And similarly, if we index one case, we can also compute this group of our equations. So for degree 10 or degree 14, it is one prime minus 34. And for degree 10, we also need to assume this x is general in the moduli. Then we have a similar description of the group of other equivalents. So just replace the rotation functor by this field function. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And by a result of Krishna, for any degree 14 prime fast report, it has associated cubic report, which has equivalent components. So under this equivalent of components, we can Of question components, we can identify the auto equivalence, the group of equivalence of degree 14, three-fold with the group of equivalence of the true four-fold. And moreover, since this equivalence commutes with a field functor, right? So then we just take a quotient on both sides, and then we'll get this colory, which is that their group of automorphisms are. A group of automorphisms are actually isomorphic. Yeah. This is a pure categorical proof of a classical result. This is a decon application. And the idea of a proof is like, so these are two methods to prove this, to classify this group of equivalents. The first one is we start with a group of equivalents. We start with equivalence of a QY and the RQ composed with the shift functor and this is the rotation functor. We can assume that this equivalence maps the going object to the glooming object. So by some previous result on the on lifting equivalence, this equivalence of component actually can The equivalence of continuum component actually can be lifted to an equivalence between bigger categories. And then we can just finally distribute the equivalence between the ref category. And then we use the classical results of equivalence of the ref category, of a smooth predicted bride, of a fun bride. And the second approach is to play with the remokai kernel. With the free Mokai kernel. Yeah. And finally, we can prove that. Actually, we can prove using this green object and the brilliant condition, we can control the image of the projection of a skycrapper ship under any equivalence of the components. And then we can prove the favorable property of the MOCA kernel. And finally, we can get this polarity. And finally, we can get this coloring. So, for index2 case, we follow the first method, and for the index one case, we follow the second method. This is the second application. Finally, it's another single application. So, there's this conjecture of Guzmeto, sorry, which is that this correspondence correspondence between index one and index two prime of r34 such that they have the the equivalent components and when c is between three and five which is proved by himself and for the d equal one case this conjecture is not true for the hawkshow homology within since the hawkshow homology is not the same It's not the same the same as the dimension of the Hochshaw homology is not the same for x and y. And the remaining case is equal to true. I think the Bangarodara and Tabuta proved that if there exists such a correspondence, then this V cannot dominate the first vector by some factor. The first sector by some semi-constant and the remaining part of this context to prove this D cannot dominate the second vector. And this is disproved by Fayer, Perry, and John using different methods. They prove that for any X10 and Y2, their control component cannot be equivalent. And our results. Our results is not about the disproof of the whole conjecture, but just recover the results of Banarodara and Taputa, which means that for general X term, it's a cannot equivalent to the component of Y2, which means this V cannot dominate the first sector. Yeah, it's just an N. Yeah, this is just an interesting simple query. Okay, so this is the OI one simple problem.
