Good morning, everyone, for those here. Good afternoon, or whatever time it is. It is my pleasure to welcome you for the second day of our conference. And our first speaker is Bernardo Uribe from La Universidad del Norte in Colombia, and he's going to tell us all about all. About all, all, yes, yes, everything and more on equivariant unitary borders of surfaces. Thank you. Maria, thank you very much. Well, thank you very much to the organizers, Professor Baker, Ulrique, Tobias, and Omar. Thank you for the invitation. I'm very happy to be here. So, I'm just going to tell you about some story that I've Tell you about some story that I've unfortunately told many times in this Zoom pandemic. So I've given it to many audiences in Zoom, but that's not many people. But the idea is to tell you about all about equivalent measurement tripor system of surfaces. So the idea of the talk is I will give you the definition of the equivalent unitary border groups, some words about Some words about what is the evening's conjecture in this setup and how is it somehow addressed using borders of families. I will tell you about some of the composition result, how does it work here, the localization and fixed points, and some new results that we've had together with Andres Angel, who is here present, Carlos Segovia, who is not here present, but lives in this city, and I don't know why he's not here. And an Eric Samferton in the US. So, what is the subject of study here? These are, we're going to talk about bordism, but we're going to decorate the manifolds with two different decorations. One decoration is being unitary, namely that whenever you take the tangent bundle, there is a K or whenever just stabilize it. You stabilize it, it becomes at some point complex. So, namely, you add some copy of the reals at some point, and then the tangent bundle with this trivial copy of the reals may become a complex bundle. But also, we have another declaration. We have a finite group G, and we want all this to be equivariant. So, we want the action of the group on the manifold to extend on the tangent model, of course. And then here we put the trivial action. So, this is. Here we put the trivial action. So, this is we are stabilizing with the trivial representation, and then we want this complex bundle to be G-equivariant. So, these are our manifolds, the manifold we want to use here. And we say that two of these manifolds are cobordinate, the standard cobordism relation, whenever there is a unitary manifold on one dimension more, on which the boundary is just the disjoint union of one with the opposite of the complex structure of the second one. Structure of the second one, and this will be the coburism relation. And so, recall there are two decorations: one somehow on the tangent bundle or this structure, and the other one is a group acting from outside. These two things have to be compatible. So this is just a small drawing, of course. So I just talked about a manifold M1 and M2, and Borders and V, but they could be living in a different universe. They could be living in a space X. Living in a space X, and this space, of course, needs to have an action of the group. Good. So, these equivalence classes of manifolds define some set, and this set is denoted with this omega letter and the decorations up top, meaning unitary on the structure of the manifold, the finite group. It could be a Lie group, but for this talk, it's going to be finite. For this talk, it's going to be finite, and the n here is the dimension of the manifold. But of course, this set you can make it into a group with the disjoint union. And if you bundle them up, all the manifolds of all dimensions, then you get a graded group. And these are the borders and groups that we want to study. There are extra properties of this group. It's moreover. Of this group is moreover a ring because, of course, you can just take two manifolds and then the product of the two manifolds and take the induced diagonal action of the group. What we will be using strongly is that the Bordism group with the group action G is a module over the Bordism group without any action. So you take manifolds without any group action, but unitary. So this is well known, this is what this ring. And we want to use. Ring and we want to use the module structure of this graded group as a module over this algebra. That will tell you in a second what it is. So, no, in this case, you simply don't take any group acting simply manifolds, unitary manifolds. So, these are just we think of complex or stably complex manifolds. It's the empty set. Group is this is the empty set of the empty set the empty is the zero. Um so there is a homotopical way to do this using the TOM spectrum, which is on the title of this talk. So at least I got two words of the title of the conference, not strings, there are no strings, or maybe we draw some string. So what one can do is one take one takes the principal bundle whose structural group Bundle whose structural group is UN, and take the associated complex bundle, and you take this Rasmannian. And then you can do the one-point compactification of the principle of the associated complex bundle on it. And this is called the Tom space associated to this principle or to this vector bundle. And these Tom spaces stick together very well when you change the letter K. Well, when you change the letter k, and then you can take a limit of these spaces and the homotopy groups of this spectrum. Um, by a very nice theorem of Tom, um, I said pontragin the other day, but in the Land Weber was correcting me that Land Weber, of course, of course, this is a theorem of Tom and generalized by Novikov and Milner. And Tom took the ideas of Pontragin when he was studying the stable homologous. The stable homotopy groups of spheres and its relations to frame Bordisms. Anyway, so the point of this theorem is that on the left-hand side, we have geometrical objects, which is their Bordism relation. And on the right-hand side, we have, say, a homotopical object. And the calculation of the left-hand side was done through the right-hand side, because the left-hand side, as I just defined it, is very complicated to calculate. This is very complex. I'm not going to say that the right-hand side is. My, I'm not going to say that the right-hand side is easy, but there are tools to somehow calculate the right-hand side. And so, this was done by Milner and Novikov, generalizing the results of Tom himself on the oriented Bordism ring. And it turns out that the unitary Bordism ring without any finite group is a very nice polynomial algebra on even-dimensional generators, one for each even. Reach even dimension. So, one needs to understand this result as going back to what it is: the definition of the unitary Borism groups, namely manifolds up to the Borism relation. So, in particular, Lenny's telling you any odd-dimensional manifold that is unitary is bordered to the empty set. So, there is a Borism or is the boundary of an odd-dimensional, of an even-dimensional. Of an odd-dimensional, of an even-dimensional manifold, in particular. Whenever we tensor with the rationals, we may take the complex projective spaces our generators of this algebra. And of course, the complete invariants of manifolds here are the churn numbers. That's a very nice classic result. If you know the churn numbers of a manifold, you know what is the unitary Bordism class. Now, of course, well, one would like to understand what One would like to understand what are these Bordism groups whenever we add this extra little letter G. And this was started all the way back to the 60s, 70s with Atija, Connor, Floyd, Stong, because of the index theorem, of course, and the equivalent version of the index theorem. There is a homotopical version of the borders and spectrum. Of the bodies on the spectrum, which is due to Tom Dick. So the idea is to do everything equivariantly, whatever that means. So we define here the Grassmannian, the universal space of principle U and Bloodles with an action of G. So whatever this is, you may just think that you take a universe and we should have enough, but all the representations of G. Well, all the representations of G infinitely number of times, and then you define the Grassmannian of dimension k, and this is this space here. And then you take the associated bundle, complex bundle over it. You have an action of G, you have an action of U, they commute in this case. And you can also do the one-point compactification. With the Milner joint construction, I suppose. The Milner joint construction, I suppose it does. Yeah, if G is compact, yeah. Well, this is not and then, yes. The problem of having a nest in the audience is that their nest always knows more than me. He knows my purpose more than myself. And then yes, somehow it is what he has to. Somehow, it is what it has to be. So, it is the classifying space of complex bundles with the action of G. The point is you may play the same game, you may construct this equivarian Tom spectrum. But then, well, there are in the audience, there are experts here, like Namibia, there are experts on what should we do with these things, and Juana has to somehow stabilize using all possible representations of the group. Using all possible representations of the group. And somehow the stabilization makes it stable, and the stabilization makes it also difficult to compare with the geometrical construction. Somehow. So the stabilization has its advantages and disadvantages. So if we stabilize it here, we would simply put the what are these homotopic electives and bordersome groups? You need to simply take these homotopic groups with respect to all possible representations of the group. Of the group. And this stabilization defines this homotopical equivalent Bordism groups. The problem, or one of, there are many problems, but one of the problems, which is, well, it's good to have problems because then we have something to do. It is that whenever we take the G out, so we forget the little G, there is a G, there is a map from this geometrical Bordesian group to the homotopical one, and in the non-equivariate setup, it gives us an isomorphism. But in the non-equivariate setup, it's not an isomorphism anymore. There is a very nice map that is called the Thompon Traging map, but a priori, one cannot know one from the other. And so there are many reasons for this. One is called transversal intersection, equivalent. Is called transversal intersection. Equivarially, it's not possible to do it. That's the main problem. But it appears also because of these representations. So on the right-hand side, we may have elements of negative dimension. Meanwhile, on the left-hand side, it's only positive dimension because it's only manifolds. And they appear simply by taking the if you take a faithful representation, say, and they have some Euler classes in negative degree. So there are plenty of negative degree classes. Plenty of negative degree classes in the homotopical one, meanwhile, in the geometrical one. No. So if we want to understand either side, we need to use similar tools, but not exactly the same things. Sorry, let me go back because I went too far away. So the question arose on what is the structure of the Bordism group when it's equivariant as a module of this algebra that I just showed you before? Before. And so this has been calculational in some sense. Namely, you take the simplest group that you can imagine, a cyclic group, and then you simply calculate, calculate what is the structure of the border, a QR border group with respect to the other one. And this was done in the 70s first by Peter Land Weber and Stong, OSA, some of these people you might have heard from the Cubarian universe, from the 80s and 70s and 90s. The point is that if you see The point is that if you see somehow the idea here is most of most of it has been for abelian groups. So for abelian groups, things work nicely. Namely, that the Bordism group is a free module over the Bordism ring and only an even-dimensional generator. So it's similar structure than the one of the non-equivalent one. So this led to think that That it may be the case that the Bordism, the Cuivarian Bordism group, is a free module on even-dimensional generators whenever G is a compact Lie group, because somehow all the cases that had been worked on worked and there had no idea on how to construct a contract sample. So, this was written in many, in some papers there written as a comment. I took this comment. I took these comments when I was working on Borism like four years ago, and it intrigued me why some of these comments are there and nobody has proved it or disproved it and why nobody had somehow done any calculation to disprove it or proved it. So, in the 80s, it was there in 1996 in this book of Peter May and many people. That's the Alaska book, it's called the Alaska book, is there. Called the Alaska book, is there in the last chapter? Um, but then some years later, even then, up here in another paper of Greenleys and May, they said that it's probably false. Okay, it's probably false. And then I spoke like four years ago with Greenley's and I asked him about this comment. And he told me, Well, I believe it's false. And I asked him, Do you know why? I think it's false. Okay, nice, uh, nice to hear. Nice to hear. But then, when we started working on this, because Ulrika Tillman asked me if something that I had done on K-theory could be done in Bordism. We were working on this, and Peter Landberg, which is a very, very nice person, told us that he was very happy to see this thing coming back after so many years. So, what is the main somehow tool? The very classical one, or basically the main tool when you are working on equivalent Homology. Namely, you need you want to restrict the isotropy groups of the manifold. So you analyze piece by piece. It's more or less like doing the spectral sequence, but doing it piece by piece. So the idea is you choose a family of subgroups, which is a set of subgroups, which is closed under conjugation and taking subgroups. So you just think of that you are restricting the isotropy group. If you choose a group, then you may have any subgroup as isotropy. Group, then you may have any subgroup isotropy. And the idea is that you consider only manifolds on which the only isotropic groups that may appear are in this family. And then you restrict the Bordism relation and the Bordism manifolds only to those types of manifolds. And then you call these Bordism groups like this. And the ideas too, as you may think, you want to start adding. You want to start adding one isotropy group to the family one by one to see how what happens on each stage. Of course, this is the first page of the spectral sequence, but let's not call it that way. Let's simply call it geometrically that I want somehow to add one group to the family at the time and see how the borders changes. So the idea is to take two families, one inside the other one, and we want to study these relative borders and groups. Relative borders and groups, which means the following: you have a manifold with a boundary, and inside it may have all the isotropies on the big family, but on the boundary, you restrict only to a subset of the family. So, on the boundary, you have less isotropic groups than in the interior. Of course, it's just a relative term in homology in some sense, but geometrically, it has a very nice interpretation. And of course, it's And of course, it fits, as you may think, in a very nice long exact sequence because you simply have the boundary map that somehow goes one on degree. And of course, you may put a manifold with less isotropies to the one in more bigger isotropies, and so on. So, what I want you to see is that if we take the trivial family, just the trivial subgroup, then we have manifolds with free action and a manifold with a free action, you may just. And a manifold with a free action, you may just take the quotient and you end up having the Bordism groups of the classifying space of the group. So, somehow, the ways to use the Bordism groups of the classifying space is to recover the whole Bordism group. But as you may imagine, these things are not so easy to determine because we need to know the information of all finite groups which you don't know. So, I was working with Jose Manuel and Andres. And Andres, some years ago, on some decomposition result on vector bundles, complex vector bundles with actions of a group. Don't see this thing too much. It's just so many words, but it's somehow words, words and words. But I can somehow tell you, forget all these words. So the thing is, if I have two adjacent families, namely there is only one group different on the two families, this is what the group is called A. Group is called A. So I am allowing A to be in the interior and not in the boundary. Whenever you have such a manifold, then you can just take the fixed point sets of the group A and take the normal bundle. And the Borism class of the original manifold is equivalent to the normal bundle of the fixed point data. Because of that, then if you go at the fixed point data, you have a manifold, which is a fixed point set, but then you have a lot of bundles because the Bundles, because the normal bundle you can just split it in a lot of bundles. And this is just the splitting. So, namely, the fixed point is n minus 2k, that's the manifold, is living here, whatever there is, it's on Bordersome group. But then you need to classify the normal bundle. And this is just a classification of the normal bundle. So you take the irreducible representations of the group, because you're fixing, you're taking the fixed points of this group A, you take the reducible representations, then you take. Then you take this Q is the quotient of Q of the group by the normal group A. Then you see the orbits of the action of this group Q acting on A. You take an orbit, and then you take the fixed point, the isotropic group, which I call a Q rho. Namely, this is the elements that leave the representation fixed. And then you've seen this object before. I'm just putting a decoration. But this decoration is telling you that the way the Q acts and the U acts are not anymore. And the U acts are not anymore independent in the sense that you have a central extension of Q, which is which call it Q tilde. So, this is some sort of twisted K-theory groups, twisted equivalent K-theory groups. But so you have a central extension of this Q row and central with S1, and this S1 needs to act by multiplication on these complex bundles. So, the two actions are a little bit mixed, not too much, but enough to make it very confusing and complicated. And complicated. So, if we had a hold of what are all these spaces and what are the Bordeson groups of all these spaces, we would be able to calculate everything. But these things are not so easy to calculate, although they are Grasmanians and because this group here somehow entangles with the other group. And well, we don't know how to calculate still all these groups. This is just an idea how this is working. This idea by hand. So, this is a surface. By hand, so this is a surface with boundary with an action of the symmetric group on three letters. C3 acts by rotation 120 degrees, and C2 is acting by rotation 180 degrees. And the idea is, say, for example, I'm looking here at the Bordism group of surfaces, and I just take an adjacent family, F1, F naught. So the difference of the two families is the group generated by B, which is a Group generated by B, which is a rotation of degree two. This is the degree, the size three, size one. So the difference, if this is the difference, then I localize on the fixed point set of this element B, which is a point and a point here on top, two points. And I take the normal bundles and I take the normal bundles. So because I take the normal bundles, then I have an action of Z2 on the normal bundle. And in this case, it's the non-trivial action flipping. And then I just simply take the fixed point set and I localize at the appropriate Grasmanian and it gives me. Appropriate Grasmanian, and it gives me a map from this Bordism group of surfaces to the Bordism group of a point, because, of course, this is just dimension zero, and then I need to calculate the one. Of course, at this level, it sounds a little obvious, but you may think that this is how somehow it works. Good. Whenever the group is, say, a billion, nice things happen, and that's why one can calculate somehow easily. Easily, that is what I had before splits into just a product of Grasmanians, and the Grassmannians are very nicely and well-behaved. And the classifying space of abelian groups, which are nice and well-behaved. Therefore, if I know all these things on the right-hand side, then I know what is the Bordism groups of the adjacent families. And with this piece, I know the first page of the spectral sequence. And I also need to know what are the Bordism. Need to know what are the Bordeaux groups of the classifying space of the abelian groups, but that's also doable in some sense because we know what are the manifolds that generate, which are the manifolds with three actions that generate the Borism group. Whenever somehow we take this adjacent family to be all the possible groups here, but on the boundary we allow everything except the group G itself. Except the group G itself, as you might see. So the difference is just the whole group, then one may localize at the fixed point set data of the whole group, which is pretty useful in abelian, in the abelian set. In that case, we just have, as you can see, only Grasmarians. And this is Bordison group of Grasmanian. This is pretty well known. So we know exactly what it is. This is an even dimension and it's free. So in this case, we have a complete small control of what's going on. Yes. Yes. Didn't I? No, no, no. As long as you put all and almost all, you may take the fixed point set of G and then you have, this is a letter G, of course, which I should have said that because A is G. So you take all the irreducible representations. You don't need it to be abelian. Good. Let me just show you. Let me just show you an example of how EC might look like. Take the cyclic group with P a prime. And so what are the only families that are there? Either the whole, which is two groups, complete group, or just the identity, the trivial group. So it's only these two families. So whenever we put the whole family, it's just the Borison group. Whenever we put the family P is just simply a free action. Simply a free action. So, what we have here is exactly the ones that we just said. So, this one is just a bunch of Grasmanians. In this case, it's just the Bordism of the classifying space of Zp because it's a free action. And on this left-hand side, we know that because the homology of these cyclic groups is all odd, then there is no even bordism. So, this is just a zero at the torsion part. Just zero, the torsion part is zero. We just recover the coefficients. And what we see, we get an exact sequence of four terms on which this is the one we want to determine. But it's, as you can see, it's a kernel of some free object, very nice. And we know exactly what are the generators of this group because we know what are the manifolds, these are length spaces. So we can actually deduce, well, this is just a free module on even-dimensional generators because of the sequence. And as you see, what we need to know exactly is what are the generators of the bodies and groups of the. Generators of the borders and groups of the classifying space. Whenever we have a compact Lie group, abelian connected, and then this was already done by Tom Dick, which is if you localize the fixed point data of the whole group, then it turns out to be injective. So the connectness of this group makes this fact very nice. So in the case of the finite group case, of course, it's not going to work, but in the compact. Not going to work, but in the compact abelian connected ED. So we may know what is the information here just by knowing the information on the fixed point data. And the fixed point data, you just take the normal bundle and then you get a bunch of crescent. Also for the homotopical, one is injective in this circle case. Having said all this, so what is the main somehow tool? Very classical one is simply localize on all fixed points, not the fixed point only of the whole group, but on all possible subgroups. You may need to localize the information. Need to localize the information, and if the homology theory is super well behaved, then you may recover everything. And somehow, that's the idea. Let's see how far it is this homology theory equivariant, how far is it from detecting everything out of the fixed point data? And if we are happy, we're lucky, we will get everything from the fixed point data. So, what is going on here? You fix a group K, you restrict the action of the group G. You restrict the action of the group G to the subgroup. That's doing nothing. The manifold is the same, it's just your group changes to a subgroup. And then you just do this trick at localizing the information on the fixed points of exactly that group K. And of course, here it somehow splits as Grasmanians. And you have a map. And you have a map for each subgroup, for each somehow conjugacy class of subgroups, which is what it is here. So this is somehow restricting any manifold to the fixed point data of all conjugacy classes of subgroups. The point is that if you tensor it with the rationals, it is an isomorphism. So, what it says is rationally, rationally, the equivalent Bortism group and many other homology theories that are equivariant, rationally is just simply the same as localizing in the fixed point data. So, Baum is telling you that some spectral sequences collapse really quick and you can just recover everything from tensor with Q. So, of course, the question is now. Of course, the question is now: is there something else? Is there something else that is on the left-hand side that is not on the right-hand side? If we would know that the conjecture is true, this evenness conjecture, then we would know that this must be injective. If this is a free module on even-dimensional generators, automatically this map must be injective, because, of course, this is again. Course, this is again borderism of Brasmanians, and then we know that there cannot be any kernel here. But the whole point, somehow, in order to somehow prove the evenness conjecture or to disprove it, one needs to go to something easier. If we assume that the evenness conjecture is true, then take a look at the following setup. Imagine that you have a torsion element. Imagine that you have a torsion element. Imagine that you have a torsion element in here. No, just go backwards. Take the homology of the free action, which is here, the Bordism group of free actions. If you happen to have a torsion class in here, and if the Bordism group is free in even-dimensional generators, then any torsion manifold needs to bound equivalent. So, in particular, I would say any free action Any free action should bound. So the Evens conjecture implies any free action bounds. Of course, any free action of a torsion element here with plenty of torsion elements in the Bordism groups of Bg. And so this was somehow the question that some years ago, Carlos started, Carlos, who is not here, who should be here and will be taped, Carlos. And that Carlos started working. Carlos started working on. So the innovative conjecture was known for all these groups, and then Carlos started looking at the following question. So instead of doing it by all possible dimensions, he decided to start a little bit like the classical sense. Let us start dimension by dimension. Let's try to solve this problem dimension-wise. Somehow we don't, it's not somehow they have. It's not somehow the happy approach for the people in the Kibarian homotopy theory, but to have a hands-on question, that's somehow a very nice approach. So the question was take a surface, oriented or unitary in that case, are the same thing in some sense, and take a free action of a group on an oriented surface that is closed and compact and whatnot. The question is, could you extend the action to a three-dimensional manifold? To a three-dimensional manifold, namely, does it bound equivarially, not with a free action in the interior, but could be any action in the interior? So, Carlos, with his methods, if you know him, he has a very nice method of putting, of dealing with elements of the group and arrows. And I don't understand how he does it, but he's very good at understanding what are the, how to construct manifolds with G-actions or surfaces with G-actions. So, he showed that for any abelian symmetric dihydral and alternating group, any free action on a Group, any free action on a surface bounds equivalently. And at the same time, from different worlds of three-dimensional manifolds, Eric Samperton, he was working on G-covers on surfaces. He had noticed that if a group doesn't contain platonic subgroups, or A4, S4, A5, then the obstruction of Obstruction of peeling the surface equivalently lies in something that is called the Bogomolov multiplier, the group, which is, well, we'll show you in a second, a homology class. And I will tell you what it is. So this is, so we start working together, Carlos, Eric, Andres here, present, and I. And we generalize it to any finite group, and we got a hold of the complete obstruction to extend equivalently. To extend equivalently the action of a group, finite group on a surface. So let me just say what are all these letters. This is manifolds, surfaces oriented in this case, and with a free action of a finite group. So this is the Bordism group of manifolds with free actions, surface, say. And on the left-hand side, what I have is three-dimensional manifolds with boundary. Any action on the interior, but on the boundary has to be free. So. Free. So these are the ones that bound. And so I want to take the boundary map and I want to see what is the co-kernel. If the co-kernel is zero, namely all manifolds of the reaction bound. It turns out that the co-kernel is the second homology. Well, here the second Bortison group and the second homology are isomorphic. You need to divide by the classes that are called toral classes. Toral classes are classes that come from the circle across the circle to BG. Not a surface of higher genus. Not a surface of higher genus, just genus one. If you divide, but all these homology classes, whatever is left is precisely what you cannot somehow extend equivalently. Somehow it's already telling us, well, there are some manifolds with three actions, so no fixed points, you don't detect them with fixed point data. It's not detectable with fixed point data, which simply do not bound by some. Do not bound by somehow a very geometrical reason, and they cannot be extended. Of course, these are torsion classes. So, from this construction, then somehow it just gives a contra example of the conjecture because these are torsion classes that are not that you cannot extend, that you cannot extend. Of course, many questions arise from this result, but let me somehow tell you: it's not a proof, it's just a very nice geometrical idea how this thing was done. This thing was done. The idea is: let's suppose you have an action such that you have the three-dimensional manifold that bounds the surface. So the boundary of this surface has free action. So what we do is we construct some sort of fixed point loss i. So you construct, you just get whatever is the fixed points of all subgroups, of course, besides the trivial subgroup. And because the action of the boundary is free, then the dimension. Is three, then the dimension of this has to be one. There is no, because you can only rotate because it's oriented. Everything is oriented. You can only rotate. So the dimension of this is one. Now the question is whether it's a manifold or not, because it may have strange intersections. Well, if G does not have spherical subgroups, which is where the problems arise, namely the platonics of A4, S4, A5, then it's easy to see that this set is just a bunch of circles. Just a bunch of circles, so it's just a bunch of circles, and in some of the circles, there is some cyclic group action, and the rest is just translation. So, because it's a bunch of circles, then you see that the surface that is the boundary, the three-dimensional thickening of this bunch of circles is just a bunch of tori. And because of that, the image of this map is just tori. So, it sounds very simple. It's just a very simple proof in some sense. Very simple. It's just a very simple proof in some sense. Now, whenever you allow spherical subgroups, you need to do some tricks to get around these spherical subgroups. But then this allows to show that the Bordism, the unitary Bordism group or the oriented Bordism group in this case, is going to be the same. And it has a lot of torsion, and the torsion is all these Bogomolov classes for every conjugacy class. Uh, for every conjugacy class, so you take a conjugacy class, you take the normalizer, you take the quotient of the normalizer with the group, which is this called this vile group, and you calculate the Bogom model for all these conjugacy classes. And then this is the torsion that runs in all the servers. So Maria said we will tell you everything of the coherent politician groups, and I hope this is everything, although maybe there is more. And so there are distortion classes on the on the on the are distortion classes on the on the on the on the surfaces um what are these groups so there are infinitely many groups whose bookomolo of multiply is not trivial fortunately um of course the way to construct them is using p groups and then and you just simply construct them in a manner that somehow they have to be you need to construct them so that they cannot be somehow constructed through the ability Cannot be somehow constructed through the abelian parts. So, somehow that's the idea. So, in this case, this is the smallest one of this is the smallest, 664. Everything of a smaller size has no multiplier. And you can think of it that this is simply this is the quaternions acting on the cyclic group of order eight in this simple fashion. And the idea is how that you might get this group or the generators with the image of a source. Or the generators with the image of a surface of genus 2. You take these four generators and then you simply map them the following way. And it's easy to see that precisely the non-abelianity of the construction, namely that it's just a Riemann surface of genus 2, and you cannot get it through a Riemann surface genus 1, gives you the object that appears as the Bogomolov, which is just the second homology group in this case. There is nothing coming from the billion part. And it's precisely Z2. So this torsion part of this. So, this torsion part of this Bortisome group is precisely Z2 in this case, and it's coming from this very simple construction. Sample in some sense. Once you know what you need to look for, then you find it. So, somehow this conjecture is false in general, which is good because it gives us something to work on. If it were true, then it would be done. So, one can rephrase the question in several ways. First, could be what First, could be okay. Which groups satisfy this evenness condition? What do you need to put on the group so that there are no torsion classes on the vortex and groups? Perhaps even simpler, if you take a free action, how do you know if it's equivalently bound? Just this is very generic. What are the conditions on the group or on the manifold itself? And later on, it was, of course, asked, okay, Um, it was, of course, asked, okay, what does this conterexample say about the homotopical one? Because there is an evenness conjecture equivalently for the homotopical version of it. We didn't know what happens because we need to take these classes and stabilize them. And we don't know what happens in the stabilization. They may die. We don't know. Because, of course, you need an explicit calculation of how do you stabilize. But it turns out that it's also false for the homotopical setup. The homotopical setup, and this was done by Sophie Chris, the daughter of Igor Chris and Pohu, very, very smartly, of course, taking a conterexample that had done Igor Chris in the 90s about something that was called the HKR conjecture on the Morava-K theory of pioneer groups. So, the conjecture is very similar to the one in here, which stated that the The one in here stated that the Morava-K theory of any n of the classifying spaces of finite groups should be all concentrated in even-dimensional degrees. So what Igor did, he very smartly constructed a p-group of order p to the six, and he very smartly using spectral sequences constructed a class of odd degree on the Morava K-theory of this specific group. Somehow we get Somehow giving a contra example again for the more advocates. These things are highly related, of course, because you start with Bordism, you take the Brown-Peterson spectrum localizing at P, and then you just kill a lot of classes and you restrict to once, which is the Moravake theory. And then POHU, then POHU. Sophie Chris did it for the equivariant setup, somehow getting this example of ego and bringing it very smartly to the homotopy. It very smartly to the homotopic board isn't bring. Now, the class that they have and the classes that we have are similar, but are not somehow one cannot go from one to the other in either way. And it's still somehow open many questions on what is really going on in some sense. Because of course, one can do obstruction calculation in homology or in cohomology, but it's not clear what exactly is. But Carlos will have Sophie Chris in his online seminar this Friday. This Friday at one, I believe. So, if anybody wants to see her talk, it's very welcome. Well, thank you very much for the attention. Carlos is here. Carlos arrived. Carlos arrived. Carlos while listening to the talk and the radio. No, I should move. Okay, so well it seems that there is some more stuff to know about all this. So any questions from the audience and Marie? Do you know the relationship between the group in solutions, for example, and like for Roman multipliers? Like is it an example of a type of group? Okay, so Ana Maria is asking what is the relation between the contra example that Sophie Chris used and the Bogomola multiplier. So Sophie Chris already in her paper showed that her example, her contra example, the Bogomolo multiplier is zero. So that group of hers is not of this kind. This is what I've been looking at. It's the same type of idea. It's the same type of idea in the sense that you're smartly looking at some obstacles. Looking at some obstruction of some kind from a spectral sequence, it doesn't look like a spectral sequence here because everything is highly very geometrical. But if one kills the geometry and brings the algebra, then you'll see that it's some of the same type of obstruction theory. Because if you take this group, if you take this one that I told you what is the Bogomolov, and then you split it into a short concept sequence, and then you see where this thing is coming from, then you'll see that it's similar. Coming from, then you'll see that is similar result as hairs. I haven't done it, but I see the similarities. But I must say, I don't know what would be a way to say you give me a manifold with an election, and then I tell you, ha, is Bordeson class is this? Because I don't have a complete invariant. I don't have a churn class or a contracting class, or I don't know what would be the object. So that's what is missing in some sense. This is you calculate, but what is the Calculate, but what is the object that you can put in, and then you structure some information that you know what is the answer? This, this, I don't know. Any other questions here? Okay, so maybe people on Zoom, if you want to, you can unmute yourself and ask questions. Ask questions. Sorry, I have a question. Um, wow, can you hear me? Hi, so, um, for these like these relative plasma with two families, I don't quite understand how the boundary map is defined. Like, how does it go one dimension down? I understand that you can restrict to like the boundary, but then, like, why does it land in cobordism? In cobordism, one direction, yeah, it's this, it is what you may imagine it is. Somehow, whenever one learns homology, one should learn border, because then it's easy. If you have a manifold, which is n, well, let's put here, n-dimensional manifold, the boundary is n minus one dimension. Is n minus one dimensional, which is also manifold because that's the way borders are defined. You simply really simply take the boundary that you don't have anything to worry. That's the nice thing of bordism. And the boundary is one dimensionless. Well, yeah, I get that, but I just wonder why it lands in a co-border group. Again, why is that like ah, because whatever the manifold is, then you get its borders class. And of course, one has to show that it's well-defined. And of course, one has to show that it's well defined and all these things, but it's like when you do it in homology, this long exact sequence, you have to show that it's well defined and that the two classes here different goes to the same one. One has to show it. This is not the question either. So what is the question? I'm not understanding. Oh, no, that was more or less. I just thought that maybe you had like a, because like to me, like it seems like those families are sort of like on an equal level. So I just didn't understand how. didn't understand how why why the boundary map was like shifting a dimension but like i'll i'll just think about it why the boundary map shift a dimension well i understand that that a boundary map will shift a dimension but like i didn't understand why it would like uh why it like was well defined on no no you're right so of course there is there is a lot under the rock there is a lot of you need to this of course i just say that that that it's easy but it Just say that it's easy, but it's in the same as in homology. One has to show it. One has to show it that it's well-defined, and then you change here the wordism class, and then the wordism class is also here, it's bored. And you're right. But somehow, what I try to say is that it works and it's the easy thing to do. Yeah, exactly. She's asking, I guess, why? How do you get an n minus one manifold out of closed? No, it's not closed, it has boundary. No, it's not closed, but it has boundary. It has boundary. Relative classes have boundary. Is this the question? Oh, oh, wait. Okay, wait. Oh, so the object, the objects of the yeah, so there are a lot of things under the rock here, which so this is a manifold dimension n with a boundary of dimension n minus one, of course, and then a border class, a borderism here as corners as uh oh my Corners, as uh Omar said, but there is something that is called smoothing the corners theorem that you can smoothen them out, and then that's the way to prove it that it's well defined because of course there are some corners here. Yeah, I thought you meant like that you have a cobordism of closed manifolds and then you have like f on the cobordism and f prime on the boundary. So that's why I think it didn't make sense to me. But you have like a cobordism of manifolds with boundary. Boundary so you have to yeah, you have one step up, so you have two manifolds on the boundary whose with boundary, and so so the cobordism here is uh has yeah some corners like a square and which some border some some some some of the boundaries the boundary you want some of the other boundaries of the boundary of the borderism uh and but but but these groups are not like trivia or something because like normally if you take like a border groups with all boundary then they're O boundary, then they're trivial. I don't understand what is that you're that you're telling, tell me again, tell me again, and then we'll figure it out. Don't worry, don't worry. I have time, we have time. Manifolds, if you take a border on manifolds with boundary, and then you allow like free boundary. You allow like free boundary of the cobordism, then you can take, like, like, you can take any manifolds become cobordism, but within like normal cobordism, if you don't add any structure, if you're like in oriented cobordism or something. If we don't put any, yeah, yeah, of course, if we don't put any of these decorations in here, then it might become trivial, of course. But because these decorations here. But because these decorations are the ones that are blocking it to be real, because you're blocking the isotropies type. But again, to prove this is part of the book of Corner, Floyd and Stong, because there is a lot of geometrical things to do to smoothen corners out equivariantly. Otherwise, then you will see that this Bordism class here, you don't know whether it's well defined. Don't know whether it's well defined, but fortunately, everything was carried out in the 70s to us, fortunately, to us. René, thank you. René, thank you. Any other questions? What is the interpretation in terms of extensions of groups of the born of I don't know? What is the interpretation in terms of extensions of groups of the Bogomolov multiplier? Of the Bogomolov multiplier. What is the interpretation? Extension of groups, extension of groups. So let me go where this Vogomolov. Okay, this is originally the Vogomolov multiplier is cohomological. So it's a subgroup of the Schur multiplier. The Schur multiplier is H3 cohomologically of the group with integral coefficients. integral coefficients and is the subgroup of elements that vanish at any abelian subgroup when you restrict to an abelian subgroup. The point of that is that groups was a calculation of Bogomolov himself on which he calculated the Brouwer group of the variety associated to a faithful representation. And it turns out that the Brouwer group is equivalent to that Bogomolo thing, too, to H3, to the subgroup of H3. To the subgroup of H3, which survives after restricting to all abelian subgroups. That's the original case of the Bogomolov multiplier. This is called the homology Bogomolov multiplier. What does it say with respect to extension of groups, what you're asking? Yeah, but I was thinking that's homology. Homology, homology, but extensions in the sense of that homology is this homological object is calculating extensions in some sense? In extensions, in some sense, no, I was wrong. I think that was the answer. So, exactly. So, this H2 in homology is H3 with integral coefficients. Or if you want H2 homological with coefficients in U1 or C star. And then you have central extensions of the group with five or some sense U1. What is the relation? I don't know. I don't. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. So there are many questions regarding what is exactly happening with respect to finite groups on the Bogomolov multiplier. So people in group theory have asked me, what is it known about this? And I said very little because the group theorists don't know about this object in some sense. It appears in algebraic geometry, although it's also not clear why in algebraic geometry is giving what it gives. That gives you some non-profit. That gives you some non-projective varieties. But we don't know exactly. It's just somehow once this is a geometrical calculation. You just divide, you just calculate some group which this is not zero. But what exactly is meaning? I don't know. There must be. What is going on more or less is that you have a faithful representation of the loop. You can write equations for. Write equations for so that they have this group. So you have this algebraic variety with singularities, and then you resolve the singularity. And the geometry, of course, there will be a gerb on the resolution. This is the H3 where the H3 is coming from. This gerb has this avatar as a gerbil simulation, or if you're going to model story, and instead of mission, it invests. And if the relation if I ra if by rational relations between these two varieties that is giving you these two interpretations of this object, there is a bit a little bit akin to this Mackay correspondence. Yeah, so as Nersto was mentioning, there is a relation in this Mackay correspondence of resolution singularities of subgroups of SU2, which somehow let you control the So, let you control the resolution of singularities of the algebra library with respect to the covariant object in the beginning. And the only thing is that the groups that we're considering here need a lot of dimensions for the faithful representation. So, this group that I told you earlier need dimension eight. So, then your algebraic varieties of dimension eight, then you result singularities, but then this is not projective, whatever reason it is. Not projective, why whatever reason it is, uh, it's appearing there. But, um, yes, you're right. There, the gerb is in the H3 of BG, and some of these gerbs are good in some sense, and some of the gerbs are bad. The good ones are the abelian, the ones coming from a billion information, and the other gerbs are non-abelian in some sense. And the non-abelian part of the gerbs, although gerbs are abelian, but that in some sense constructing from the group are not abelian. These are the From the group that are not abelian. These are the bad ones in the sense that don't allow you to make it projective. So they're just obstruction to projectivize the object there. I don't know if this is related to what you asked. More or less. Well, it takes because this is kind of a central extension of the direct variety in the value. That that that but and in some sense, what Ernestus is talking about, it must be related to the homotopical version. Related to the homotopical version. The homotopical version, since you stabilize on representations, you may take this representation that Ernesto is talking about, which gives you a variety which is not projected. That is already a one that perhaps you, even if you stabilize it further, it will not somehow be the boundary of anybody. I mean, it's in some sort of a gerb structure that doesn't allow it to do it. But in this case, somehow the dimensions are very low, still very low in the homotopical sense. Very low in the homotopical sense, you may do all this dimension growing because this one that you're saying it may be in dimension what eight eight or no times two 16. 16. What is interesting is that it's appearing in the Bordism group, all these objects in algebraic geometry. Of course, no surprise. We knew from Milner construction that these algebraic varieties generate the Bordism group. But what is nice is that one can sum up perhaps. But what is nice is that one can somehow perhaps know exactly what is the algebraic variety, which is giving a manifold which cannot bound. Any other questions here or on Zoom? Any other questions here on Zoom? Okay, so I don't know. I believe that we have questions and answers. An answer, so we have another half an hour. Um, maybe are they? I don't know if they're chatting. Thank you for his talk. Well, absolutely, definitely. Take the lead.
