Gina, so I am going to talk to you about tantrum infinity categories. And part of what I'm trying to do is be kind of the connective tissue between the talk that Brenda gave before lunch about Bjort, the Bjort project, and some joint work that I've done recently with Matthew Burke and Michael Ching, which maybe will also help lead into Michael's talk. I'm not really going to give you an outline. I know it says outline, but it's a lie. An outline. I know it says outline, but it's a lie. I'll just say that the goal of the talk is just what I said: to explain connections between categorical differentiation and functor calculus. And to do this, we kind of need to invent a new homotopical tangent category. Before I get started working on that goal, there's a way that I give talks where I have these kind of pre-populated slides and then I fill them in as I go. And the populated slides are available at that website, which is now in the chat. Which is now in the chat. So, if it turns out that I'm going too fast or too slow, and you wish you had seen something that was on the slide before, or you can't wait for me to finish and need to jump ahead, you can access the slides and do so at any time during my talk. All right. So, in an effort to stay self-contained, I'm going to summarize some things that were already said. So, let me start by talking a little bit about functor calculus, which Tom Goodwilly talked about in another talk this morning. About in another talk this morning. So, first, I want to start with a homotopy functor of model categories. And by this, in this talk, it is sufficient to think about two examples. It would be fine to think about functors where C and D are abelian categories. In which case, functor calculus is very strongly related to homological algebra. Or it would be fine to think about C and D being the same category, and that is the category of base-pointed topological spaces, in which case functor calculus is very closely related to classical homotopy theory. And in both of these cases, there's this idea that you would like to try to produce a tower. Try to produce a tower of approximations to a functor that are a lot like the Taylor series. So I've written that on the bottom, but to just talk about what is in those polynomial pieces, it might be helpful to start with a definition, which is that a functor f is excisive if it takes push-out diagrams to. Out diagrams to pull back diagrams. In particular, this means that F should take the coproduct, which in the category of topological spaces is written with this V, to the product. Oh, and I don't want to write equals. And maybe they're not equal on the nose, but I at least want them to be homotopy equivalent. So I would like to write something squiggly. So that tells me what to expect out of the Taylor series. So there's a Taylor series-like tower of approximations due to Tom Goodwillie. Starting with my functor f, f has natural transformations to polynomial degree n functors. Polynomial degree n functors. And by polynomial degree n, what I really mean is that these are the best and excisive approximations to the functor. So one excisive means that you take push out cube, push out squares to pull back squares, and excisive means that you take push out n cubes to pull back n cubes. There's a little notation that I couldn't fit on this picture. DNF is just the homotopy fiber of these maps Q. And so in particular, I will want to So, in particular, I will want to remember that the functor D1, which is the fiber of this map Q1, is excisive. It's kind of like it's a piece of P1, but it's also reduced, meaning we'll take the base point to the base point. All right, so now I want to summarize a little bit about what this has to do with differential category theory. So from Brenda's talk, the homotopy category of abelian categories turns out to be a Cartesian differential category. Turns out to be a Cartesian differential category. And the only thing that I want to say about that is to remind you what the derivative is. So for a functor f from A to B, the derivative is the directional derivative. So the derivative of f in the direction V at the point A is D1, the excisive approximation. The excisive approximation of the functor f evaluated at a direct sum blank. So that's a composite evaluated in the direction V. Okay. So that's what happens for the derivative when it turns out that we're dealing with functors of abelian categories. And now one could ask, what about the other situation that I talked about, functors of topological spaces or other homotopy? Or other homotopy, other situations in which we want to do homotopy functor calculus. So we might expect that there would be a Cartesian differential category that kind of contained that kind of homotopy calculus as well. But it seems unlikely. And one quick way of saying why this is unlikely is because of this theorem, which is due to Blutcocket Seely on the one hand and Cockett LeMay on the other hand, which tells us that a category has differentiation. A category has differentiation if and only if it has linearization. But in this case, the linearization of a map is additive. And in the category of topological spaces, excisive does not. Excisive does not mean the same thing as additive because there aren't byproducts in the category of topological spaces. So, exactly the property that I wrote on the previous slide says that I expect that an excisive functor takes coproducts to products, not co-products to coproducts or products to products, and there is no byproduct. So, what it would even mean to be additive is a little bit unclear. So, in particular, the thing that is helping me figure out what the derivative is. That is helping me figure out what the derivative is: is this d1, and d1 has this property that d1 f of x plus y is d1 f of x times d1 f of y. And that somehow is not additive. And so, somehow that tells me that I need to do something other than look for a Cartesian differential category to contain whatever is happening with homotopy theory. So, instead, we're Theory. So instead, we're going to make this bigger and look in a tangent category. And to look at tangent categories, I'm going to use the approach that Richard Barner outlined in his first talk and talk about tangent categories as having something to do with Bay modules. The reason for that is that tangent categories are kind of hard to define up to homotopy. You all saw from Jeff Crupwell's talk that a tangent From Jeff Krepwell's talk, that the definition of a tangent category involves a lot of axioms. And so, for me to use that and try to define a notion of tangent category up to homotopy would mean having all of those axioms hold up to homotopy. That's a lot of coherences. And so, this is a way of doing things that is a little bit more packed up into kind of one package that maybe I can that we could handle. All right, so um. All right. So let me just remind you that there is a symmetric monoidal category called V. The objects are augmented commutative n algebras that have a particular form. So they're polynomial algebras mod out by some ideal. The point of this ideal is that it's idempotent. So xi squared must be in the ideal. And then it's possible that there are some xi xj's in there, and we have to enumerate which ones those are. I choose not to do so because. Those are. I choose not to do so because it was done earlier and it's not going to get in my way not to go through those details. The morphisms in this category are maps of augmented commutative n algebras, and the product is just the tensor product over n. So I'm going to use an upper n to denote the n-fold product of. So I have a special V algebra W, and I forgot to write down what it is, and it's the dual numbers. So in the category of V algebras, The category of V algebras. I could look in particular at this V algebra, nx mod x squared. So that's the one that's w. Every object in this category is going to be generated by that one somehow. So in particular, every object is isomorphic to one of the form W to the N1 tensor with other W to the NKs. Okay. I also just want to remind you that inside of this category, Remind you that inside of this category there are these special pullback diagrams. So, in particular, the product of W with itself is obtained as the tensor product. And I have written the map. So, epsilon is the unit map that takes W and evaluates it to X equals zero to get to N. And this is the inclusion of N into W. So, this is a nice pullback diagram, and it looks like it's a crazy. Pullback diagram, and it looks like it's a crazy thing to want to pay attention to, but it turns out that this somehow corresponds to the universal universality of the vertical lift pullback diagram in Cocken and Cratwell's formulation of tangent categories. And then there's this other pullback diagram on the right-hand side that doesn't look quite so crazy, which corresponds to the requirement that the tangent bundle functor has to preserve products. So these two things together are called the tangent pullbacks. And with the data of that category, And with the data of that category and these pullback diagrams, Pun Liang defined a tangent category a different way. So, a category X is a tangent category if and only if there's a strong monoidal functor from V as a monoidal category into the endomorphism category of X, which is monoidal under composition. And that functor has to preserve the tangent pullbacks. So, the idea of what I'm going to do in this talk. The idea of what I'm going to do in this talk is apply this definition to infinity categories, which are somehow homotopical, instead of applying them to one categories. All right. So to do that, I really felt like I should tell you something about what an infinity category is. I'm trying to follow my own advice and not leave things under the rug. And also, infinity categories. And also, infinity categories were a thing that stopped me from progress for a long time. I did not want to work in infinity categories. It took a lot of convincing from my co-authors to make me do it. So I thought that maybe other people would also feel like an infinity category was something somehow intractable, and it isn't. So let me explain. So to understand what an infinity category is, we'll start with simplicial sets. And it's been said before at this meeting that a simplicial set is just a functor from delta op to set. Delta op to set, where delta is the topologist simplex category. It has one object for each natural number, and the morphisms are just order-preserving maps between sets zero to n, you know, that are labeled zero to n. But it's easier to think about what a simplicial set is if you, or maybe not easier, but for the purpose of this talk, more relevant to think about a simplicial set as a geometric simplicial set. So simplicial set. So we can think about how the whatever two gets sent to should be pulling out a two simplex somehow. And so the geometric description of a simplicial set is that it's just n simplices glued together along some rules. So in particular, I'm allowed to glue together n simplices as long as where they meet is a face of lower dimension. So on the left-hand side, So on the left-hand side, I have three two simplicies. Those are just triangles. It's just the convex hull of n plus one points in whatever space you want to be in. And I'm allowed to glue these guys together. And I wrote some labels on the vertices to remind me how I want to do that. But let's see if I can actually do it. So I'm going to glue those two together to make a flag. Robin, you're out in Kenanascus. So if you happen to be stuck out. So, if you happen to be stuck outside and it rains, please use this construction of taking two simplicies and gluing them together this way to get yourself a nice tent. You'll be safe. And if you don't want to get your feet wet, you could also take another one and put it in the bottom. And I'm allowed to glue this one in in such a way that it meets the other two one simplices that are down there. All right, these labels are in the way, so I'll just get rid of them because they're not important anymore. They were just supposed. Important anymore. They were just supposed to remind me which pictures went together. But now that I've done that, I can see that this thing that we made, this kind of open tent, is actually a subset of this three-simplex, which is the full tetrahedron with every, it's solid, everything is filled in. And so to see this as a subset of the tetrahedron, all I have to remind myself to do is to label the vertices in the same way. To label the vertices in the same way. Okay, and just remember that this thing is a tent, it's empty and it has an entrance. And this particular simplicial set that I just made out of smaller dimensional triangles, first of all, exhibited the rules. You're allowed to glue things together as long as they meet at a common face. And secondly, it has a special name. So the name of this one is Capital Lambda 13. And it's And it's named that way because it is a sub-simplex, a subset of delta 3, the solid tetrahedron, which misses out the face opposite the vertex who's labeled 1. Okay, now I also maybe should have mentioned that the ordering of the vertices is important here, and I can think about that inducing orderings on or orientations on the simplices. The only ones I care about are the ones happening on the edges. So zero is less than one. So, zero is less than one. I could think about this edge being oriented from zero to one, and similarly for all the others. Okay, I won't fill them all in because the picture will get really messy. All right, so that's a geometric simplicial set, and that's going to be sufficient for what we want to do. All right, so what I said here is that that lambda one three is a subset of delta three. So, an infinity category turns out not to be any harder than being able to build a tent as the Being able to build a tent as the outside of a tetrahedron. So, an infinity category, or I maybe really should be calling them quasi-categories. So, in this talk, I will conflate those two terms, but please don't tell people who will get mad about that. Okay, so an infinity category is a simplicial set in which every inner horn has a filler. So, what does it mean to be an inner horn? Well, it's those lambda k n's. Remember that those things are supposed to be. Remember that those things are supposed to be subsets of delta n, and they're supposed to miss out one face, and that face should be opposite the vertex labeled k. So it's an inner horn if it turns out that vertex labeled k is not zero or n. It's one of the ones in between. Okay, so the tent that I drew you is in fact an inner horn. And what does it mean that every inner horn has a filler? Well, if I had some simplicial set X, Set X. X is built out of these simplicies. So maybe I would be able to find an inner horn sitting inside of X. So if I can identify a bunch of simplicies in X that put together are an inner horn, then in fact, I maybe wrote this from, I maybe flipped where I wanted the X and the delta N to be. I usually like my arrows to go left to right, but this one will go right to left. Will go right to left. If I knew how to find the horn inside of X, then actually it fills in. I'm able to find a whole tetrahedron inside of X as well. All right. So the important thing is that every category is an infinity category. Why is that? Well, this is via the nerve construction. And the nerve construction is just the thing that tells you that you're going to build one of these simplicial sets. Builds one of these simplicial sets out of the data of a category so that the vertices are just the objects of the category, the one simplices are just the arrows of the category, the two simplices are compositions of two arrows, and so on and so forth. And there's a way of thinking of these horns as coming from those composition of arrows. So, in particular, if I had a composition, so let me first put some objects. So, let's have objects A, B, and C, and let's have A, B, and C, and let's have a map from A to B and a map from B to C. Well, all of a sudden, if I draw that instead of as a straight line, as just a kinky line, then you can see that that looks like it might be a horn for a particular simplex. And indeed, this is the inner horn delta one or lambda one two. And the reason that it fills in in a category is because the composite. Is because the composite of the maps F and G is defined. So I should be able to find an arrow, first of all, from here to here. I do. It's F composed with G. And the fact that the diagram commutes tells me that I should fill in the entire simplex. That's what the nerve construction does is when it turns out that you have commuting diagrams and you get to fill in the whole thing. Whole thing. So this means, so this is just G composed with F. I think I said F composed with G, but I really want to write it the other way. Okay. So anyway, that's all it means to be an infinity category. And then I can think about what it might mean to be the category of infinity categories, or sometimes I'll want to talk about the infinity category of infinity categories. And for that, I just need to understand how to compare these things. Just need to understand how to compare these things. So, if I have two infinity categories, they're just two simplicial sets, and then an infinity functor between them. It's just a map of simplicial sets. That's it. All right, so most things that you can do in a regular category, you can do in an infinity category too. And here are some things that I like that you can do with infinity categories. So, first of all, there's a function complex. So, if x and y are infinity categories, then I get a new infinity category. Then I get a new infinity category, which whose vertices are the infinity functors from x to y. So if they were quasi-categories, then this thing is a quasi-category too. I don't have to look at simplicial sets. I could look at simplicial monoids. And if it turns out that I have a simplicial monoid whose underlying simplicial set satisfies the inner Horn condition, then that thing is a monoidal infinity category. And then I might ask, And then I might ask, okay, so that's extra structure on an infinity category. So clearly, I can add extra structure. So I might ask, how do I compare those things? Well, in the case of monoidal infinity category, I have two choices. One is that I could have a strict monoidal functor between them, and that would just be a map of simplicial sets, which strictly preserves the monoidal structure. So it preserves multiplication. But that's not the only choice. Because infinity categories have higher cells, it allows me to do things. It allows me to do things only up to homotopy. So there's another option, which is that I could have a strong monoidal infinity functor. So that would be a map of simplicial sets. It would preserve the monoidal structure, but not on the nose, only up to coherent isomorphism, which is a way of saying that this thing is preserving the structure up to homotopy. So I'm not going to say exactly what I mean by coherent isomorphism. That's not important right now, just so that you know that this is why we work in infinity categories. Why we work in infinity categories because it allows me to have these structures that are somehow weaker than the strict ones. Okay, all right, so that's everything that I need to tell you in order to tell you what the definition of a tangent infinity category is. So the category they, as I said at the beginning, is a monoidal category, and all categories are infinity categories. Categories are infinity categories. So, in particular, Ve is a monoidal infinity category. And it turns out that it's special as such. And I guess I'll come back to that. So then I can ask that a tangent infinity category be an infinity category x together with a strict monoidal functor from the monoidal infinity category V to the monoidal infinity category end x with composition. X with composition. Okay, so remember I said you can make function complexes out of infinity categories. That's all that happened there. That thing's monoidal under composition. And this is a nice map of monoidal, you know, T potentially could be a nice map of monoidal infinity categories. There's a little bit more. I want the underlying map of quasi-categories to preserve the tangent pullbacks. Okay, so this is like Leong's description, except made for. Except made for homotopy theory. So at this point, you should say, but wait, Christine, you just told me that to do homotopy theory, I didn't have to do things strictly. Why do we have a strict monoidal functor? And the reason is because V as a monoidal simplicial set, well, this is cofibrant. So that means that any strong monoidal functor from V into index is up to some nice equivalence actually a strict monoidal. Actually, a strict monoidal functor from V to X. So there's kind of a special trick that's happening here. Cofibrant things are just the things that make colimits, homotopy co-limits work. So if you wanted to construct homotopy co-limits and you want them to be some kind of strict co-limit, you normally have to replace with something co-fibrant. Well, they turns out to have that special property, and that means that it's enough for me to look at strict things. Look at strict things. All right, so every good definition needs examples. So here are two simple ones. The first example is that this generalizes what was done before. So any tangent category is also a tangent infinity category. Just using Leung's functor. And then the second thing is: okay, so maybe I don't want to start with ones that I already knew had tangent structure. So take an arbitrary infinity category X, and you can give it a trivial tangent structure. Give it a trivial tangent structure. And this is going to be the one that takes W and sends it to the identity. Actually, it's just going to be for it, it does send W to the identity. It does send W to the identity, but in fact, it's just going to be the constant functor with that value. Okay. Okay. I think there's something I'm, oh, right. So there is something I'm forgetting to tell you. I forgot to tell you this about Leung's definition as well, that somehow we want to think about the image of W as playing the role of the tangent functor. Of the tangent functor from x to x in the sense of the Cockett-Crutwell definition of what it means to be a tangent structure. So, the reason that I'm giving you this value w as determining this example is because somehow that's the important one. That's the one that gives you the tangent structure in the sense of the other definition. Okay, let me pause and see if there are any questions. I've been going awfully fast. Okay. All right. So most of the rest of this talk is going to have to deal with a particular tangent structure that's not so trivial. And now I want to get back to the original goal. What we wanted was a way of differentiating functions, which would somehow recover the Goodwilly calculus notion of what it meant to be a Taylor Tower. So we're going to need a tangent structure for that. Need a tangent structure for that. All right. So, to do that, I have to work with particular infinity categories. I need categories which I'm going to call Lurie differentiable. Lurie, of course, just calls these differentiable. But there is a danger of screwing up what it means to be differentiable in terms of Lurie and what it means to be differential in terms of Cockett and Crutwell. And so I'm adding the adjective to make it. And so, I'm adding the adjective to make it clearer in this talk. All right, so an infinity category is Lurie differentiable if it admits finite limits and sequential co-limits and they commute. Those of you who work in functor calculus, this probably looks like a familiar hypothesis to put on a category where you want to do homotopy functor calculus. All right. So now let cat infinity be, well, basically the infinity category of infinity categories. And inside of that, I want to restrict to the full subcategory. To the full subcategory of the Lurie differentiable things. Okay, so now I want to use a category that Eric was talking about earlier today, and maybe Tom talked about this too. So I'm going to decorate this slightly differently than they did. So I'm going to let script S fin star denote the infinity category. Of finite simplicial sets or finite spaces. Okay, so in the slides that I posted online, I went into some detail about what I meant by that. But basically, I want these spaces to be finite dimensional, finite cell complexes. Okay. Well, then Larie had our Well, then Lurie had already defined a tangent bundle functor. So he defined a tangent bundle on the Lurie differentiable infinity category. On a, sorry, on, I can't even read my own slides, on a, on a Lurie differentiable infinity category C, it should be the excise of functors from the quasi-category of finite spaces into C. So here the abbreviation. Here, the abbreviation exc is excisive functors. Okay, so this is some sub-infinity category of the function complex, functor complex. Okay, so that is a start. That's a tangent bundle, and that might be the thing that I'm looking for. So, what I need to know now is if I can extend that to one of these tangent infinity structures. Tangent infinity structures, that's a functor from all of V into the endomorphisms of C. And so here is the theorem that says you can. So the tangent bundle functor that I just showed you can indeed be extended as I described. And this gives a tangent infinity structure on cat infinity depth. Okay, so what I just showed you. Okay, so what I just showed you. So, what I just showed you is T to the W. I'm going to write it as T to the W instead of T of W. So, that is supposed to be a functor from V. Sorry. Right, what am I trying to say? All right, so T. Right, what am I trying to say? All right, so T to the W is supposed to be an endomorphism. So the image of the dual numbers is supposed to be an endomorphism from cat diff to cat diff. And I just showed you how to define that functor. So on a Lurie differentiable infinity category C, this thing is defined to be. Is defined to be excisive functors from finite spaces, finite pointed spaces into C. Okay. So remember, I told you that that thing is supposed to be like the tangent functor. So I can ask, is that thing even, is there a projection? Does it look like it could possibly be a tangent bundle? So that's maybe my first piece of structure. My second piece of structure is. My second piece of structure is that the projection map from TWC to C. Well, you define that by evaluation. So given an excisive functor in TWC, I'll send it to its value at the base point. And that is an object of C, okay. That is an object of C. Okay, and that's functorial, so everything's fine there. All right, well, maybe the next thing you want to know is: what about all the other objects of V? What do I do with those? All right, so remember at the outset, I said that any object A in the category V is of the form W to the N1 tensor W to the NK. Then what I will do with that. Then, what I will do with that is define a functor TA of C to be functors that are excisive in each variable separately. And I'm going to have to tell you what I mean by each variable from this product of infinity categories. Into C. All right, so each one of these guys defines a variable. So my variables are, each of them are products of S star fin themselves, of finite simplicial sets themselves. But I group them together so that I count being a variable as being corresponding to a W to the N1. And so. The n1. And so this one to one, the notation here means that if those are the way that I define variables, then these functors have to be excised in each of those. Okay, and then finally, actually, there's two more things. We'll see what happens. So if f is a functor from C to D, then Then, um, oh, yeah, right. Then, what do I do with TA of F? Okay, so now, how do I make this functorial? That's that's what I'm supposed to be doing here. So, this is supposed to be functorial in cat as well as functorial in V. So, that's why the two variables, we put them in different places to try to make things a little bit easier. So, what should I do with this? Well, so somehow I want this to just tell me to take an excisive functor. To take an excisive functor that goes to C and then compose with F to get an excisive functor that goes to D. But excisiveness doesn't work that way. It doesn't satisfy comp, it doesn't, you can't just compose with another functor and still expect it to be excisive. So I have to do something slightly different. This is going to be PA of a functor that I'll call F star. And F star is the function. Is the functor that denotes post-composition? So, in other words, on a functor L, what I need to be doing, so let me just work in one variable at a time. So the excisive approximation of L followed by F, post-composition with F is not just F applied to the excisive thing P1L. Applied to the excisive thing P1L. Rather, what I have to do is take P1 of whatever I got by composing F and P1L. Okay, so that's basically what's going on here. And there was one more thing that I wanted to tell you, but I've run out of space, so you have to guess. Okay, or I can add a page. There we go. Christine, I just have a question about the notation. So when you write PAF star. So when you write P A F star, like I know that means like F star of L and then apply P A to that, but is that also P A of F star as a function or as a functor between like functor categories? And you're taking like the A excisive approximation of the functor F star? Yeah, that's what I mean. So the A excisive approximation of the functor F star is determined exactly by this formula that's down below. Oh, cool. Okay. Down below. Oh, cool. Okay. Thanks. So I don't know why I went from A's to L's, but A to one or whatever, but that's the idea. I guess because I guess there was a reason for that now that I think about it. So I'll just be as vague as possible. Yeah. So just imagine the one variable case and we'll leave it like that because then everything's okay. All right. And so then the last thing I wanted to say is, okay, it has to also be. I wanted to say is okay, it has to also be functorial in V, and this is a little harder to say. So, if I have a map of V algebras, then I should be able to produce a map like this. Sorry, that's an A prime. Sorry, that's an A prime for each C. And so remember that these things are built out of these excisive maps in the way that I said with a bunch of factors. So maybe this is N1. I'm going to drop the fin star for speed here to NK. And then maybe this one is, let's move this over. Let's move this over. And maybe this one is something else. All right, and there's supposed to be a C in there. I just ran out of space. And the point is that what you have to do, and Michael wrote this down extremely carefully, and I struggled with it because it's hard. Struggled with it because it's hard. Is you have to mimic what phi is doing on the factors of W. And now you do those things on the factors of S. Okay, so this turns out not, I have not ever found an easy way to say what it is that that does, but that is what's needed in order to prove that this thing is functorial. All right, so that is the Goodwillie tangent infinity structure on cat diff. Affinity structure on CAT diff. And now let me say some things. So, Martin Franklin asked a question this morning, and I wanted to just say that this is the part where I'm starting to answer that question. So, first of all, an infinity category C is stable if it is pointed, admits finite limits. Finite limits and co-limits. And a commuting square is a pushout if and only if it's a pullback. So I think maybe Tom mentioned this in his talk this morning as well. Okay. So what does it mean to be differential? Well, from Cockett and Crutwell, being differential. Crutwell being differential. So X in a regular category, tangent category X, is differential if Tx is trivial. So it's product of X with itself. So we can now identify the differential. Now, identify the differential objects inside of the tangent infinity structure that I just showed you. So a Lurie differentiable infinity category is differential if and only if it is stable. I only have five minutes left and I want to say some other things. So I'm going to skip this proof and instead talk about the consequences of it and maybe get to one other thing. To one other thing, all right. So that allows us to connect to Bjort. So, um, from Cochin and Croutwell, their infinity tangent category paper. The significance of the differential objects, or one way in which they're significant, is that if you put them all together, Is that if you put them all together, you get a Cartesian differential category. So, the analog and infinity categories is that. Is that the differential objects? Sorry, that's not quite true. The homotopy category of the subcategory of differential objects form a Cartesian differential category. So that tells me that from the previous slide the homotopy category of stable infinity categories is Is a Cartesian differential category, and you can work out what the derivative has to be. The derivative, the directional derivative of a functor f of stable infinity categories in the direction v at the point x has to be, well, exactly what it was in the Bjork case. Same derivative. Okay. So that should tell us that the abelian functor calculus example is a special case of what is happening here. It turns out that it's a little bit tricky to say precisely that that's true for a few reasons. So for one thing, the abelian functor calculus case. The abelian functor calculus case where Bjort was pitched was not working in stable infinity categories or even stable categories. We were working with chain complexes, but they were bounded below. So it's a little hard to make this precise, but the result about stable categories does seem to recover exactly the same thing that Bjork showed was true to begin with. Okay. Great. And in my last minute, Great. And in my last minute, I'm just going to try to say what the connection is to annexive functors. I'm really not sure that I can quite get this in. All right, so in the category of smooth manifolds, two smooth functions, so just in regular manifolds, two smooth functions have a Taylor series at x. So I want to think about this in terms of local coordinates, and I want this Taylor series to be expressed as a multivariable Taylor series. Variable Taylor series. And we say that those two functions agree to degree n if the Taylor series, if the Taylor polynomials agree to degree n. And so there's an equivalence class of functions f under this relation, and we call that the n-jet of f. And so the n-jets determine the nth Taylor polynomial and vice versa. So there's an analog of this in our setting. An analog of this in our setting as well. So, a functor. So, actually, I'm going to skip some of the notation just so I can say what the theorem is, and I'll explain the notation as I go. So, there's an analog of n-jets for us. Oh, this was supposed to be up above. Okay, so suppose now that I have two functors of infinity categories, and suppose that I have a natural transformation comparing them, and I want to. I want to now restrict the. I want to be able to do the same thing that I did in manifolds, which is to think about everything locally. So, to do that, I'm going to restrict f to the slice category. I'll pick an x. That's where I'm looking. So, I'm looking near x. And I can make this new functor f slice x, which goes from c slice x to d. It's just a restriction of f to the slice category. Okay, well, then the nth, the p, then what happened, what turns out to be true is that. What turns out to be true is that p n of alpha from p n of f to p n of g, so somehow this is p n of this slice functor fx. Okay, so that's just the nth, the nth Goodwilling polynomial of the f slice x. That thing is an equivalence if and only if the n-fold tangent functor are the two n-fold tangent functors are equivalent. All right, so there's a little bit of extra notation. All right, so there's a little bit of extra notation here. This has to do with the fact that what I've really done is taken the n-fold tangent bundle and then taken the fiber over X and then included that back into the n-fold tangent bundle. So these are equivalent if and only if these are equivalent. And what that tells me is that, well, these things somehow should define the n-jets of F. And remember that n-jets get you Taylor polynomials, but I could instead think about Could instead think about the n-fold tangent bundle. So the tangent bundle functor applied n times as playing the same role. And so this connects this tangent infinity category business back to the Goodwillie calculus. Okay, I'm sorry, I went over a bit. Well, let's take a moment and thank Christine for her great talk. Does anyone have questions for Christine? I'm just curious. I wonder this method seems to bring new light on these questions of the derivative of a functor. But what about the derivative of the What about the derivative of the identity? What happened with the derivative of the identity in these examples? I guess off the top of my head, I don't know what the directional derivative of the identity is. I think you mean the identity of spaces. So it's well known that the derivative of the identity of spaces recovers stable homotopy. So it's somehow the functor Qx, the stabilization functor. So I guess. So, I guess I don't remember exactly what will happen if it turns out that I try to. I guess I don't even know what to say to answer the question because spaces aren't stable. So that formulation that I gave you for what the directional derivative is, I understand that really well in the stable case. And certainly we could say something about the directional derivative in the case of the identity functor, but it's not clear to me what really. It's not clear to me what relationship that would have to the tangent stuff that I just talked about because that's kind of the point that it's not that spaces aren't linear, so it doesn't the directional derivative doesn't play the same role somehow. Sorry, that's a long way of saying, I don't know. Sorry, Andre. Well, my question is a bit vague. I mean, because, yeah. Robin, you have a question? A question, Robin. You need to unmute. He's working on it, yeah. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the suggestion for the umbrella first. Yes, the tent. I was wondering, I mean, you use differential objects, right? But have you thought about differential bundles and what they are in? Are in these settings? So, right now, I don't know what to say about that. So, yes, you can think about differential bundles in these settings, but I don't know what to tell you as an answer for what they are. Yeah, well, I mean, the reason I ask is because, you know, if you take the differential bundles over a fixed space, actually, that gives you a differential category. So there's. Yeah, um way of getting at differential categories that uh might be interesting so um in this idea that um yeah so I mean maybe I've only thought about like one differential bundle but there is this way of thinking of okay so yes I can get to the differential categories by taking kind of the tangent category the tangent category itself is going to be differential right so I can figure out how to wrap all of them up and there's a way to think about that in terms of Up and there's a way to think about that in terms of parametrizations over the objects in the original category. So, in that sense, yes, I've thought about this. That maybe if it turned out that I wanted to think about, in one sense, space spectra are the differential bundle over spaces. And actually, I don't think I did think about this. I think that I heard somebody else say it at some point. That maybe what you should be looking at instead are parametrized spectra and then parametrized by all spaces. So, this idea of taking the slice over each. Of taking the slice over each thing, so that's all I know to say about what that is right now. Um, but but again, I'm coming from the perspective of I know what I want the tangent thing to be and building the bundle up instead of what you're suggesting, which is know what the bundle is and then think about the slices being your tangent spaces. So I've taken the opposite approach. Okay, thanks. Martin, Martin, do you have a question? Yeah, I do have a question. Well, first thank you. Yeah, I do have a question. Well, first, thank you very much for the nice talk and the shout out. I appreciate it. In Cat Infinity Diff, you said that the morphisms are functors that preserve sequential co-limits, but you don't impose that they preserve any of the finite limits, right? Did I read that correctly? I think maybe if you did, I think maybe I have a. Because my naive guess would have been that those punkers should preserve some of the fire. Should preserve some of the finite limits, at least, or so. My slide says it admits finite limits and sequential co-limits, and those commute. Um, and so I do want, so anyway, I do want it to preserve finite limits as well. Okay, so the morphisms should be the functors preserving sequential co-limits and all finite limits as well, right? Or I think so. I don't think so, actually. I think it's just what Christine said. It's just. It's just what Christine said. It's just they just preserve the sequential colonies. Oh, okay. Oh, sorry, it's through me then. I'm okay. Anyway, sorry about that. So why should I expect that to be the thing we want to study, to not impose that they preserve any finite limits? Oh, is that because that would be imposing some kind of linearity or excisiveness? I was just going to say, I mean, I guess the whole point is that you want excisive to mean that you take some kind of. mean that you take some kind of finite co-product to a finite product. So yeah, sure, that's backwards, but there's already this idea that that's kind of what Exep is trying to tell you. It's trying to tell you how to what extent things are preserved. I see. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And another question. In let's see. I'll reiterate in your model for the tangent infinity category as excisive functors from finite base space. From finite base spaces, that is equivalent to the fiber-wise stabilization of each comma category, right? Each slice category over each object, that is equivalent, right? That's the other description that I'm more used to. Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's true. I just I think that's true. Maybe I won't say I'm sure that's true because after a talk, I'm never sure of anything. But yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. But thinking of it this way, that, yeah, that makes. Yeah, that makes the statements certainly believable that you describe that an infinity category will have a trivial tangent infinity category if and only if it's stable. That's beautiful. That's exactly the analog of the one categorical statement that a category with finite limits has a trivial tangent category if and only if it's additive. So it's exactly what you would expect and it's it's beautiful. Yeah, somehow that this idea that you're trying to think about, I mean, Tom. This idea that you're trying to think about, I mean, Tom said this this morning. You're trying to think about what should the vector spaces be. So if you're in your category and your category somehow isn't flat, what should be the things that play the role of vector spaces? So abelianizing or additivizing or making something stable or whatever, these are all, I think, different versions of saying the same thing. And this is just a different way of saying that that has something to do with actually being curved. Got it. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Michael, you have a question? Yes, I actually just had a couple of quick comments in response to Andre and Robin's questions, if that's okay.
