First of all, very glad to be here and be able to present some of my works. I think when I put in the title, I just had like the main part about maintaining interpreting principal component analysis. But I'm really interested in population structure and telling population structures and specific contexts I'm gonna. Specific context: I'm gonna talk about and yeah. So, so the so I'm very interested in ancient DNA, and many of you will know that ancient DNA has been really a very rapidly growing field in the last decade. And you now have like, this is a map of all the samples that are in like that sort of compilation data that I dated, right? And you can see there's like several thousand dots that go all over the world to collect. Dots that go all over the world. The color here represents 20 samples per time. So we have lots of samples from the last 57 years or so. And what I'm interested in, like, how can we summarize the sort of the history that gave rise to this sample? Like, how can we take all these samples, learn about their history, and do that? And so the data I'm going to talk about is genetic variation data. So we have, basically, we're going to have some populations or each individual has its own population where it just has. Own population, where you just have two samples, and you have a matrix of genetic variation data with usually hundreds of thousands to millions of those sites. So, I can sort of summarize this in a matrix that I'm going to call next. I'm going to talk about PCI. I think many of you will know how PCI works. This is sort of my cartoon, where we just have two SNPs instead of a million or so. And so, what we could do is each dot here would be one population, and we could just plot those two populations. Those two populations, of course. So, this, in other words, each population lives in this high-dimensional space. And what we do is we find sort of the axis of highest variation, or first we mean center, then we find the axis of highest variation, and we rotate our data set along this axis. Then we sort of take this axis away and sort of find the second axis of variation, which in this 2D case is the rest of the variation, right? And we get our principal components. And then very often, what we do is you don't. Then, very often, what we do is we don't keep the full million or high-dimensional space, but we just funct it to a lower-dimensional space that gives an approximation of the underlying structure. Yeah, so this has been done extensively in humanitarian data. For example, if you do a data set that spans most of Eurasia and Africa, you get something like this. So, here I have some 500 populations. Populations, yeah, just followed by geographic location. And you can probably see here from the PCA that all the African samples are down here, all the European samples are up here, and then East Asian and Oceanian samples tend to be up here. This is Madagascar, which is in Africa or of Africa, but has a lot of Asian kind of features of both in the metal. So you can make this qualitative picture, then the picture that Matt showed of making. Then the picture that Matt showed of where we take people from Europe and plot them on a PCA, it kind of looks like a map. And then the last thing that people have been talking about a lot by Cavalius Schwarz, or that's a sort of distinctive comics by Cavalius Schwarza, where he in the 70s, 80s, 90s essentially accumulated data on variation and various loci and he published this. He published his book where he had many maps like this, where he took the PC axis on a map. And what he very often found is that these axis correspond with expansions. And that's sort of a population extended from, say, the Nalithic expansion sort of down here, and then expanded to Europe. And sort of the calibration follows this axis. And this is sort of a rule that Teeth postulated. But then NUA and another scheme of. Noah and others came along and proved us that this can be misshapen, but this is a paper by Michael Chorcho and Nua that they published 10 years ago and that is a very thin full simulation where they had a range expansion starts here in the middle and then expands outwards. And it's maybe a little bit hard to see, but in this case here, the sampling is just sort of this triangle here. And it's not shorter than this case here. It follows, so they call it fortify expectation, in that the axis of Expectation and that the axis of variation follows the expansion axis. But they also show that if you just change the sampling this axis, it's the exact same sort of population model, but instead of looking at this triangle, you look at triangle like this, you sort of get the main actual variation actually perpendicular to the expansion axis. So, this sort of interpretation that the volunteers have found empirically does not seem to hold, at least in this simulation. So, that's a So that's sort of, I think, where I was. Yeah, when I read this, I think I found it very convincing, and I was like, yeah, should be very careful about interpreting principal component analysis. And so, yeah, so that's it. Yeah, sorry. And yeah, so I'm going to talk about some other framework. And this is also actually inspired by ancient DNA. So a little bit of deeper and how people in ancient DNA think about their data. This is maybe not the best way of doing it, but I think it's, yeah, it's had some. It but I think it's yeah, it has some nice properties, and so people very often think about population trees, right? Which has some issues if you think about humans as populations that um evolve as a tree, but as some of Matt also discussed yesterday, but we think we have different populations from different parts of the world, and we sort of like to think of them as a tree. And in human population, the tree is actually mostly in the field of the null model, but for null model, where we are really interested. Uh, normal where we are really interested in admixture events where people from different parts of the world came together. For example, Amelia talked about Neanderthal and early Eurasians admixing or African Americans, right? Most of them have some European ancestry. And these are sort of these admixer events that you can sort of add to the tree by adding arrows either from this lineage from putting some entity over here or a new lineage being formed from two different parts of that tree. And the way people do that is. And the way people do that is using these very simple summary statistics, which are called F statistics. So you have heard a lot of things about F statistics. This is a different set of F statistics that we don't jump in. And yeah, so there's this F2 statistic, which is just the square difference in a lead frequency summed over loci. So if it's a tree metric, it has all these nice properties that you might expect from a tree metric. So we can add and subtract it over branches. And one thing we can do is And one thing you can do is you just sort of can add on subdirect branches that you get measure for external branches or internal branches that you can either write in terms of this F2 or you can also directly write it in terms of the allele frequencies that I've been doing here. And what people then do is they sort of look at properties of this F3 and F4 and compare them with trees. So for example, what you would expect is that if you sort of make this calculation, it is a proper tree that the branch lengths are non-negative because these branch lengths are Are non-negative because these branches correspond to genetic drift, and we know that genetic grid generally just accumulates variation and doesn't display variation. So you would expect there to be some variation. And so you can do the test, and if you calculate the test statistic from data and find the negative, then you can say that the tree for this particular set of samples is perched. Likewise, for the fourth statistic, which sort of measures the length of an internal parameter tree, we know that the samples S4, right? There's three possible names. As four, right? There's three possible internal branches that you might have, but actually, only one of them is realized, which means that for any set of four samples, you'll find one F4 statistic that will be zero, and the average is sort of a test of the four-point condition for the folks that do phylogenetics. Now, sort of, I think where this is sort of maybe a good talk for this audience that are interested in maths is sort of that a couple years ago, a guy that ancient DNA and his Guy, that ancient DNA and his mathematician came up and said, Hey, these f-statistics equations are really familiar in the sense that these are just Euclidean distances, right? So, F2 is just a squared Euclidean distance, and you can think of F3 and F4 as inner products in the space. Again, here, just thinking of each population as a point in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, right? And so, the sort of versus the idea for this project, I mean, is that high-dimensional spaces are. Project they mean that high-dimensional spaces are quite annoying to work with, but we have this history of using PCA in population static, so we can maybe find a low-dimensional space using PCA where you can sort of study our population stuff. And so it's very easy to show, right? Because the distance is invariant under rotation or under length state. Instead of writing f the sum over row sign, you can also sum it as a writer's sum over principal components and you get the exact same statistics if you allow. Save statistics, if you allow it. And then, if instead of using all the PCs, just use the couple PCs, we get an approximation. But this approximation is optimal in the sense that the total sum of error is minimal, which has a property of PCA. And so, in terms of like how does that deal with this interpretation, is that we can sort of use the terms of grid and admixture that we sort of can interpret in tree and can sort of translate them to. And can sort of translate them to the PCX space. And so the idea is of a simple cartoon, right? We have just four populations, x1 to x4. And running for example interface in the lengths or in drift between these two populations, then in a tree, this is sort of the branch that connects these two guys, whereas on PC gateway, this is sort of the distance between them, right? So this is sort of the intuition that you have that if things are similar, then on PCA they will be close together, which is if they're Be close together, but they're very distinct and they'll be far apart. And this is a fun way to control. Then, if you think about internal or external branches, right, then they're corresponding to inner products. Inner products are very closely related to projections. So, for example, when I represent this branch here, that this goes from X1 to the internal node that connects X1 to X3 and X4, one way we can sort of represent that is as the magnitude of the branch. Of the branch here and project x3 onto the axis of x1 to x4. And sometimes this is sort of the two-dimensional representation of the tree. And likewise, you can do that for F4. If you look at an internal branch, then you project these two populations x2 and x3 onto the axis x1 and x4. And so what yeah, the statistic measures is how long this branch is here. This branch is here, is relative to the entire length here, because the other way around with, yeah, so this is a normalization factor here that's glossy over, but this is sort of the intuition. And the last case is that if we sort of have two sets or pairs of population in the tree that are distinct, where for example, if you compare in this case, you have a difference of x1 and x2, which are different. And x2, which is different of x3 and x4, then these two paths in the tree are not overlapping, and we would expect then the distance, the difference between x1 and x2, and x3 and x4 to be our sock node to each other. Then the other process that we've interested in is admixture. And in admixture, and so I hope you can see the light right here, but the scenario here is that you have, again, you have four populations here that don't. four populations here because at some time in the past x2 and x3 meet and they have an offspring or some proportion of uh or there's a new population where some proportion comes from x2 the proportion alpha and some proportion one minus alpha comes from x3 and call this xy and then you have some additional channelic group that will change this to xx because yeah x and x and so if you think about this in um Um, ECA space, then the way this worked is that hecty here will be precisely in between these two points, and then there will be some sort of additional noise that will sort of make it move around. And so, one question you can then ask is, you know, given that one for example you can do with piece, you know, you can ask, for example, given that I have x2 and x3, where would an admix top? Where would an admin population lie in PTA filters? And so, in terms of if you look at the S3 statistics, it turns out to be this circle or hypersphere that's in the PCSK. So, yes, I have to, I think I wanted to mention what I forgot. So, this information PPA that technically only work if you look at all the PCs, right? Because if you approximate things, things may break, but very often, like, only if you But very often, like only a few PCs are actually quite sufficient to describe populations from the further. And so there's sometimes two circles here. Like the one is the gray one, it's sort of the ninety one, but just pretends that the two dimensions would be sufficient to write population structure. And then the liner gray one is how the circle or the regions where you look with the atomics looks like if you do this in the high-dimensional space. So very briefly, inquiet for that is again, just think about going from two-dimensional. Think about going from two dimensions to one dimensions, right? So, if you have assumed that two dimensions fully describe your population relationships, then you can say that this is the space where any other population would fall within this space. But then if you just look at one dimension, it will look something like this. And the difference of not everything in this circle will be between these two points, for example. If you had a population that's up. You had a population that's up there, this would look up here on just on one PC to look be outside the first two components. And then, likewise, you could have like the sample XC, which is not admixed in this PCA sense, still falls within the region. But then if you're outside the region in the lower images space, you're also going to be outside in the higher space. So, to summarize, I think one that you can think about. I think one way we can think about PCI 3 in terms of these two processes. But if you have genetic drift, then what will happen is that populations will move apart. And if they're in independent populations, they will move apart in orthogonal direction. And then the second process that's important if you study population structure is gene flow or admixture, where you sort of end up with linear combinations of spaces. Right. Then, yeah, a small Then, yeah, a small sort of statistical detour is that I think that Martin mentioned, I've been talking about population live frequencies, but what we actually have is genotype data, which is just a sample. And so we have to be often quite careful about how we measure these, yeah, and how we compute the statistics. And so, if you calculate edge statistics from data, what you have to do is add some correction factor that correct for sampling bias. Correct for sampling bias in your data. And if you get in PCA, what you want to do is to not use sort of the standard PCA where you just plug in your data, but you want to use some version of a probabilistic PCA where you assume you add some noise term, either you can add some normal noise or you can add some binomial noise that sort of measures that there's sort of both the genetic structure that you want to measure and the sampling variation that you only have a small. Variation is that you only have a small or yeah, a limited amount of sample from your population that you can actually look at. And so, to get these sort of interpretations, you need to take into account that you have some sampling variations. So, to end, I just want to very quickly show you some data. And so, here's Mr. Roto this mole data set of 35 human populations from all over the world. If you do a PC on that, you can look at that. You look at the V-shape that looks something like this. And yeah, though, many of you will not be familiar with what these people are, but there are mostly folks from South Saharan Africa. Then we have folks from Europe, Middle East, Southern South Asia. And then over here, we have East Asia and the Americas. And it's sort of all this V-shape that we'll expect if the variation that distinguishes Africa from non-Africa is largely independent from the variation that separates the racial. Variation that separates Eurasian populations. You can ask: Are the first two PCs like a good representation, or do you want to look at more? One way to look at that is to sort of take this F statistic and use it as a thumb of PC. So you can just look at the first couple terms for a bunch of F statistics where here I fix one African population, one European population, one Asian population, and then here I have a bunch of different populations from all across the world here in colours. All across the world. Here in colours, it's sort of the contributions of their coefficients of the first NPCs. And you can see in this particular case here, the first two of these are the vast majority of the statistic or of the measure of relatedness. And all the higher incidents only have much, much lower property shapes. And the last sort of second application about admixture is again talking about Europe. I've already talked southern PCA of. I've already talked so many PCA of some November is where so Europe is very non-free like in many ways, right? And so if you do a PCA, we get something like this, where again takes context. So here, mostly European samples, here Northern Europeans, here Southern European, and Slovenia, and Basque from Spain. Then, in terms of the second gradient, right here, we have samples from Iran and the Caucasus, and then up here we have samples from And then up here we have samples from, I think, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Peninsula and Levant. And so one thing you can add, you know, essentially in this sort of administrative somewhat arbitrary populations, say, for example, the Basques from Spain and Turkish from, yeah, which are from Turkey, and who is admixed between those two samples in this, I've streamed that this sense that the populations are in between in Populations like in between in this high-dimensional space. And so, all the atmospheres population high-dimension up here, the red ones. So, you can see there's some folks like the tennery islanders that appear to be in between them on the PCA, but in their blue, meaning that in the higher PC or some other PC, they're actually sort of in front or behind this circle. So, they're actually not at mixed in this sense. But many of the samples that are in between those. That are in between those would be annexed in distance. And we can ask: you know, this is sort of the circle that one gets directly on two PCs. If one uses the full data, then the circle gets slightly bigger. So that the black one's on the shop before, the gray one is the one in higher dimension. You can see it's not a huge effect on this particular data set. Okay, yeah, so this is all I wanted to show you. Again, sort of the take-home, I think, is that I think we should not interpret PC in terms of directional. PC in terms of directions of the first or second principal components because they are heavily influenced by sampling. But rather, what you can think about is that PCA sort of retains orthogonality in your data set. And so if you have different drifts, you get different orthogonal axis of variation in independent populations. And then you have admixtures, you'll get intermediate genotypes, which you have intermediate. You interpret to explore interpreting. You interpret to explore interpret things that are in between the two main acceptation because admixture sort of produces linear combinations of the original proposition. And yeah, that's all. I wanted to thank us. Yeah, so I just moved to the University of Project and I'm studying a new lab. I'm also very grateful to my previous lab at MKA in Leipzig. And yeah, thanks all for listening. I'm a little confused. So you know that the original is coming from the outside going in, you know, it's admixture, but it could have gone from the inside going out, and then it would have been isolated by drift. Wouldn't it have similarly in the middle of the pedal in here? Oh, sorry, that's that one that you were just showing with the green, the red spot. Yeah, I'm a little confused how you know just because it's linear and the large. Linear and the larger dimensional space that it's admixture as opposed to isolation by distance along that geography. Yeah, so yeah, I mean, I think this is, I think a distance in that sense is kind of similar to that, right? Essentially, and that's probably what really is going on here. It's not a discrete event. But I think the point, and I probably phrased it somewhat forward, right? We really, I think it helps to distinguish between sort of having isolation, where you sort of end up with population monitoring and With population monitoring in different directions and admixture or migration of any form, right? So it doesn't matter if it's a single event or consistent event, any kind of team flow will get you sort of into intermediate points in the space that you get from drift or differentiation. Yeah. Is there an easy interpretation of two causes of nature? So, could you interpret that as moving a bit and then again changing? Yeah, I mean, I think that would be very difficult to do. I mean, in part, if you had say two pulses between the exact same population. I mean, I think you would have. I mean, yes, I think it depends on how much these populations change between the cultures. I mean, for example, one thing I could imagine if you, for example, had I could imagine if you, for example, had think about people that have you know somewhere between sub-Saharan African and Eurasian ancestry, and you could think of African-American, where this ancestry is saved by generations or so old on average, and possibly North African, where the gene flow happened probably several thousand years ago. And so, I think those would probably fall in different spaces on a PCA because if you have enough sort of present samples, you can. If you have enough sort of present samples, you can place them. Not sure if there's a general framework to look at that, but there might be those, you know, look at the statistic in terms of PCs you probably might get different answers for different dynamics or events. But yeah, I'm not 100% sure on that.
