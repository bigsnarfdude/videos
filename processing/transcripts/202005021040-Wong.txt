Thanks for the introduction, and thanks everyone for joining us for the virtual Apple Tanner Search Day for the first time. Today I will talk about the refinements for a strong multiplicity one and I would like to delegate this talk to Professor Richard Guide. For my first talk at a bench for the upper diamond recipe, the Richard Guy, Professor Richard Guide, he was sitting in the front floor and Was sitting in the front row, and well, he was quite encouraging. So, good memory. Okay. So, now we should start with the quiet baby example. If you remember some theory from the real analysis, is that we have the Hilbert space for the L201 of the complex value function or square integrable complex value function. And we know that it omits the. And we know that it emits the orthogonal basis e to the 2Ï€i and x. And so for this space, any function we have the nice Fourier expansion of ignites for. So in particular, if you have all the same Fourier coefficients for two functions, they are the same in the L2 sense. So if these two functions are smooth, they are exactly the same. So now from this example, is that the From this example, is that the general question is that how can one determine a function from its Fourier coefficient? So, if we have the so if we have the module form and the nice module form, so now we start with the two nice module form. So, layout of the even weight for the full module groups, and so in particular for each one, they are holomorphic on the upper half plane, and the satisfaction modularity comes. Satisfy the majority computation. So, again, we can write the layer four expansion at infinity in this form. So, by nice, we mean they are in fact hospital new forms. And so, it's not hard to check that, okay, if they are with the exactly same Fourier coefficient, then these two functions should be the same. So, in better, one can do slightly better because we know these Fourier coefficients are multiplicative. So, we can So we can, in fact, once you know they agree over all price, they are exactly the same two forms. So the next question is: Can one do slightly better not required for the O price? So this one in very classical strong multiplicity one. Is that if we have two new phones, they are super nice module phone over for the congruent subgroup. So if we first thing we have to normalize them. We have to normalize them. The reason why is that from the proof of the Delinx proof for the Ramouja-Peterson conjecture, we know that at least lambda fila are bounding by two, if you over a prime. So we need, we want lay about the same size, so we normalize them. So by the work of the Jaguar and Charlika, we know that if you have two new forms, they are with Fourier coefficient over almost all prime. Here coefficient over almost all price, and in fact, they will be the same form. So, by almost all, we mean the they agree for all but financially many price. So, again, we have a further question. Can we do even better? So, for this one was answered by the Roman Kashinuan around 1994. He showed that, okay, if you have two new phones and therefore if you agree, outside the set of price of Are the set of price of lower deleted density less than one over a, and these two phones should be the same. So, in this talk, every time I talk about a density, I will talk about a lower deleted density, and I will define that present. So, there is a related result. Is that if one only cares about a twist equivalence, one can do somewhat better. Is that if you have two module phones that are of the same weight and Your phones are of the same weight and the same character. Once there, squares of the Fourier coefficients are the same outside the set of primes of a density less than 1 over 18. And at least two of them will be twist equivalent. So then you can find the difficulty characteristics such that you have a least relation. So in particular, what we have is here is that your lambda F1P will equal to lambda F2P times the chi P. So now you know nowadays people somewhat care about a modern setting for from the point of view of language program. So we are going to do in that setting. So in this talk, I will fix a number field F and fix the other ring for it or write it as an AF. And we will give an we will be And then we will be given two unitary hospital automobiles for this 0 to AF. And then we write a Fourier coefficient for pi i as the lambda pi i v. So for the low delique density, we define this following manner. It's that we consider sum over the V inside the set A, and then we weight each prime by the one over. By the 1 over mvs, and we divide everything by log 1 over s minus 1 and take the limit. So the quick note is that this one will less than the natural, the upper natural density and the bigger than lower natural density. So if you have a natural density, this one is exactly the same the natural density. Okay, so now okay, so let us state our problem. So now the problem is that Problem. So now the problem is that if you know something about a Fourier coefficient of two phones, what can we say? What will be sufficient for us to say that, okay, these two phones will be the same. So we consider, say, S alpha, we collect all unremembered primes for both pi 1 and pi 2. Such layer Fourier coefficients are not the same and optual rotation. Okay. So. Okay. So, so what we know is in fact Jagann Sharaika, he lets show that if your set S naught, namely you have the set of the price or for which layer Fourier coefficient of pi one and pi two layer are not the same. As long as the least stay is finite and these two forms will be the same. And Roman Kanchinan, what he really showed is the following state. What he really showed is the following state: as long as your SNART is of density less than strictly less than one over eight, then these two forms will again be the same. So in fact, the result of Roman constraint is sharp because we have an example given by SEC. That is the example of the 2CM module from the satellite. This one over there was hit. So now one may wonder. And one may wonder how if we can improve if we exclude all the dihedral forms. So, this one was answered recently by Waji. He showed that if you have a pair of non-dihedral automobiles of inferred GO2 phones, and the density of that biaset, this biaset is less than a quarter, then this two phones will be a set. So, by dihedral, I will. So, by dihedral, we means that you can find a heck character such that you satisfy the least twist equivalent relation. Then, you have use amid the non-trivial self-twist. And in the language of a module volume, it means that if the pi aris is arising from the module volume, that means that module phone has to be CN. So, now if we go back a bit to the Go back a bit to the result of Roman construction. If you look at this result carefully, you can see that somewhat you can put a sign in front of your Fourier coefficient and the information will give you something about the occurrence between your forms. So that's why we set out this S alpha. And then the natural question is if we can do anything about this S alpha to recover the equilibrium module forms. So reason. So recently I can do something about it is that if you have a two a pair of distinct hospital reposition for GO2 and then you we consider this as alpha. Like we again collect all on real prime for both pi 1 and pi 2. Such layer Fourier coefficient are not less than after this rotation. And so we will have a nice lower bound for the lower duplicate density of S alpha. Density of x alpha. So it's huge. So let me emphasize the first case. So if you pick the alpha equal to zero, then you we are creating the all prime secular lambda pi one v naught equal to the lambda pi two v. So this one is one. And if you put the alpha equal to zero here, you will recover a result for Roman cushion. So consequently, you negation this negation list the list inequality. You will get if you have the lambda pi 1v equal to the e to the i var lambda pi 2v and the for some given so for some given will fix alpha outside the set of a price of the density less than 1 over 16 and the least two form will be the same. So let me so you can so in fact at least 1 over 16 is given by the the The, I think, the second case. And one can do, I believe one can do slightly better if you really try to find a maximum of this one. Okay, so now we have a second question. Is that in light of a result of a Roman question? One can ask somewhat the weaker question. Is that if we only care about a twist equivalence between two phones? Equivalence between two forms and what kind of information on the S alpha will be sufficient for us to determine that this pi 1 and pi 2 layer are twist equivalent. So this one was proved by Roman Kajunan. He showed that if you have the two cospital automorphism representation for GO2 and the layer with a trivial central character, once they are square. Square or square or well, yeah, square of their Fourier coefficients agree for all on reveal. And this two, pi one and pi two, they will be twist equivalent. So in other words, if you have the non-twist equivalent forms, this set has to be non-empty. Okay, so here is a remark about this theorem is that Is that if you look at the if you go back to look at the theorem of a Roman construction result here, he only needs to require your the best set. It's equality only holds outside the set of the primes of the density less than 18, 1 over 18. And the result here, we need to go through the whole ammunition. We need to go through the whole MORE. The reason why Le Roman Cargin could do much better for the classical holomorphic module form is that we know how to attach the holomorphic module forms with the erodic Gala representation. So we can put everything into the Gala side and one can do much better over there. So now you can see that one might wonder if we can get rid of this old unremarked price condition and On remote price condition, and we get over this trivial central characteristic. So, again, recently I can prove the following things that if you have a non-twist equivalent of Q02 forms, and we can say a slightly smaller size, that we can say a star. And this one, we collect all alumina price layer with different Fourier coefficients. And once you have this. And once you have a listing, the lower bound of the lower deleted density of S star will always be greater than 1 over 12.15. So if you recover this result, you can do the following thing. If you have 0, 2 forms, and the layer Fourier coefficient agree after taking the absolute value outside the set of Delicate density less than 1 over 12.15 and at least 12. 0.15 and at least two phones will be twist equivalent. So you can see this one is much stronger than the previous result of random constraint because we don't need to require now list to be a trivial central character and we only consider that we allow this one happened for the inventory many of the price. Okay. So second half part of my talk where I will tell you how to prove this one. I told you that some By tell you some key ingredients of the proof. So we consider harder cases that both pi 1 and pi 2 layer are in fact non-dihedral. And for this case, we should invoke the result of a dual bar injected. They show that if you consider a tensor product of the pi i and the pi i bar, this one will in fact is the isobotic sum of the trivial trivial representative and the adjoint. Trivial and the adjoint one. And this adjoint one, because each pi i is non-dihedral, so we know that they are in very cosmetal. And from this relation, and this one in fact tells us about the relation between the Fourier coefficient of this representation. So we know that the Fourier coefficient of the adjoint lift of the pi i will equal to the Fourier coefficient you take this opposite value and take a square and the minus one. Square and the minus one. So now, if we want to study the list S star, now by that relation is suffice to study the Fourier coefficient of the adjoint leaves of the pi one and pi two. So now we get this. So now we have this equivalent relation is that, or by computation, is that we identify the least two sets together. So we are now considering the O prime such that the Fourier coefficient of Fourier. Exactly, the Fourier coefficient of adjoint leaves of the pi one and pi two, they are not the same. So now we are going to do the case analysis. So, first one we are doing somewhat easier is that we consider both pi one and pi two that are solvable polygraph. So, in particular here, we mean that we what we really want is that they satisfy the Roman PGS and configure. So, what we mean is a least fun. So, we know the nice. So we know the nice outer bound and a uniformly in V is bounded by 4. So once we know this bound, we consider difference of this lambda 80 pi 1 and lambda 80 pi 2. And so you can check that this bound is bounding by 16. So now you plug this one back to this inequality. So now we have this somewhat truly variable from this point. From this point. And what we want to do this thing is that if you go back to see what is the lower delivery density, lay looks like this one. So what we want is that we want to create something, some overprice and of this form. So now this one does the job. So now if you divide both sides by the log 1 over s minus 1, and then you take Over s minus one, and then you take s goes to one. This one, this term will give you the lower Dirac density of the SAD, so that the S star. So, what we want is that we really want to know the asymptotic behavior of this sun when S goes to one. So, to do so, first thing we need to open the observed value. So, the thing is that we have at least somewhat trivial identity. The reason why we have the first identity is that this chi. Is that this chi SAD is the indicator function of the set of SAD? So if you have V inside this SAD, that means that from the definition, they are with a different Fourier coefficient. So namely this one is one and so they just vanish and then you have the identity. So if your V is not inside the SAT, it means that you have the equal equality of the Fourier coefficient. So Holy Stern will be zero and at least Holist term will be zero and the least term will be zero. So now we have the least identity. So we expand the whole term into three sums of least form. So to analyze this sum, we notice that this sound infect comes from the log of the arrow function attached to 80 pi i times 80 pi j and the plus up to the big O1. The big O1 was given, was given by the non-bound powered non-bound powered toast Ramanujan Peterson contrast so infallibly contributes by the prime power okay so in particular if you divide it both sides by the log one over s minus one and take s goes to one you will get an order of a whole of this error function so now we it's suffice to study the order of whole of this error function and we are done okay so to do So, to do so, we are going to use a Rankin-Server theory. So, there are two things we need to know. First thing, by the work of a Roman culture, we know the adjoint lifts of the pi1 and pi2, they are not the same as long as the pi1 and pi2 are not twisted through. Second thing, we know that these adjoint lifts, they are always self-dual. So, the biology zero theory, we have least bond of the order. So, the in way, in this case, the longing zero theory tells us that if this Every series told us that if these two represent if they are the same, you get one, and otherwise, you get zero. So, after this, you just put everything back. So, you get this thing. So, let me tell you what's really going on. First thing we know that we rewrite these things as a sum as a three-tenth of this one. And we divide everything by this log one over s minus one. And we somehow. Minus one, and we somehow, if you take s goes to one, you get an order of pole. Okay, so now if you collect everything together, you see this turn will give you one if you list 80 pi one times 80 pi one, and the zero if you have 80 pi one times 80 pi two. And the last turn is given by the function attached to 80 pi two times 80 pi two. And this 16 just comes from previously, and the least turn is coming from a different initial. So now if you Definition. So now, if you divide both sides by the 16, you we got a lower bound for the lower delected density of stars greater than 1 over A. Okay, so you can see that our life is much easier if we know the Roman Jones-Peterson construction. So the problem is that there are cases that the Roman John-Peterson constructure is unknown. So, in particular, is that if you have Is that if you have one of the pi 1 and pi 2 layer is not so polyhedral. So, in particular, if you in the language of the classical modular form, that means that your pi 1, either pi 1 or pi 2, it arise from the non-CN modular form. So, in this case, the well, fortunately, if you are doing the Holomovi phone, the Roman John conjecture is known by the work of Derlink. So, another case is that if you have the mass phone. Other cases say if you have the mass form and the label, we don't know anything about that. So, in this case, we cannot use that boundarily above by the 16th. So, we need to do something clever is that we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality twice to get the upper bound of Holy Sun. So, the reason why we want to do this trick is that, as you, if you remember, this term, if you divide this one by the log 1 over s minus 1, you have to. 1 over s minus 1, you take s goes to 1. This term will give you a low delicate density of s star. And we already analyzed this term. This one is give you right here. You will give you the 1 minus 0 plus 1. So we already know this term will give you 2 and this one will give you a lowest deleted of S star. So now it remains to study all these terms. So this one, again, we sort of We sort of use this relation. So, this relation tells us that we know how to relate to the sum over certain tries for the Fourier coefficient and the error function related to it. So, in particular, here we are going to study the error function of this type. Okay. So, in fact, this one has some issue. We call it the error function. So, however, in general, this is not the case, or at least it's on. Is not the case, or at least it's unknown because we only know the runtime server theory for the pair of the hospital or the mobile, and here we have two menu, we have four of them. So, we again we need to do something smarter than what we have done previously. So, to do so, and fortunately, we know so we are doing the following case is that we assume both pi 1 and pi 2 are not so polyhedral. So, in this case, it's probably the worst case is that we know nothing about. That we know nothing about a Roman John-Peterson conjecture. However, fortunately, we have at least lovely decomposition for the product of the pi i. So the first one is again, we are using the fact that if you have a tensor product of the two self-dual representation, you always get a one and a joint lift. And the second thing is that we know what is the adjoint lift of the adjoint lift. Remember, this pi capital Pi I is the adjoint. capital pi i is the adjoint lift of the little pi i. And then we have a horizontal breaks down to the adjoint little pi i and the isobolic sum to the fourth symmetric power up to a twisting. And at least here the omega i is a central character of the pi i. And the good thing is that once the pi 1 and pi 2 are not so polyhedral, we know that this false power or false symmetric power of pi i is cospital. So every Cospito. So everything is nice here. So now we can rewrite all this L function into the products of the or into the product of the four L functions. So again, remember that our goal is we want to know the order of a pulse of this L function. So first thing is that for this one, for LS1, this one is in fact essentially the thing zeta function of f. Zeta function of f. So this one will give you a pole of order one at s equal to one. And the second thing we notice a joint lift of the capital pi will be least for is the isobaric sum of two cospital automotive representation. So these two arrow functions won't emit pole at s equal to one. So now we have the order only pole of order one here. So last thing we are going to again apply the rounding zero theory to study this one. Theory to study this one. So, study is that you are looking at the both sides of this thing and you plug. So, plug here. So, by an easy calculation, you will see that the upper bound of the pole of the order of pole bounding by three. And so now you plug everything back to least relation. If you divide, so you then you divide both sides by the log one over. The both sides by the log 1 over x minus 1 and take x goes to 1. This one gives you 2, this one gives you a square root of 2, square root, wait, this one is square root of 3, square root of 2, and square root of 3, and this one gives you a lower delivery density. So now we have a last relation. So we obtain the lower bound of this set is always greater than the lower bound of the density of the S star is always greater than 1 over. S star is always greater than one over 9.9. Okay. Yeah, I have one. So before I start, let me tell you something about the theorem. So here is a thing. If you look at the theorem here, and you might wonder, as I told you, if you have a distinct one, you can find the example so that the bound is sharp. And you might wonder if this is a case for the least type of series, in particular, if list. Type of theories in particular if this bound is sharp. So, first thing you can see that if you do the case analysis, in some cases, you can do better than it's 1 over 12.15. For example, if you have a pair of the non-solvo pohedial type representation, you will get a 1 over 9.9. And you might want to ask again if it is sharp. So, the answer is no. In fact, the least bound will give you one. The reason, the one is that if you really want The one is that if you really want to use the recent result of the automorphic for the owmetric power, and then you have the sort of subtle text distribution, you can do much better than this one. However, that only works for the HoloMovie Huber new forms. Okay, so I think I should stop here. Any question? Thank you, thank you. Are there uh Okay, thank you, Pengji. Are there any questions? Can I ask a question? Pengji, are you able to? Is it possible to prove any results with something other than Dirichlet density? Yes. The reason why we are using the Richley densities, I believe, is where is that? Is this if you see the least one is there? It's a big O1 here. Big O1 here. And then the problem is that in general, we don't know about the Roman John-Peterson construction. So we don't have a good control for the prime powers. So we can only suggest the big O1. However, if you are doing the like your forms, they both arise from the holomorphic huber module form. We know the biological PDS and construction. So we don't need to do this thing. We can, in fact, just use the standard Winner Ikehara top-oriented CWN2. Know I can have a top orientation theorem to just get the exactly order of this one. So we in fact for the case, or once you know the Roman John P hasn't come here, we can in fact this one is a natural density. And do you get, so if you prove something for natural density, will give you the same results for dirtier density that the dense numbers you get? Yeah, because your low deleted density will in between the upper natural density and the lower natural density. Natural density and lower natural density. But once your natural density is a less than you just clap the delivery density. Thanks. Are there any other questions? Yes, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
