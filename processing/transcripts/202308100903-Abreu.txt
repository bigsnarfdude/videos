And we changed today. And okay, so I'm going to talk about what we're also cycles. The brilliant cycles already made an appearance yesterday, so I would just quickly remember. So let's take Mgm and its degree Disacobian. Desacovian has a universal family. A universal family together with the shift. Topological shift. And here I would just be interested in the case where r equals zero. So I would just want to look inside the Jacobian of the locus W D, which are the pairs C L, say L has a section. And so Isabel already talked about this. And we can give a schematic construction of that. I'll be more interested in the cycle. So the cycle can be given by a turn class of the derived push forward profile. So we can do R1, which in this case Which in this case is minus the right push forward. So let's say D is not unit. Let's say D is less than u minus 1. Otherwise, this locus is the whole jacobian, it's not of the expected dimension. Okay, so now what we want to do is we want to Do is we want to extend this to M-Gen Bar and the first thing we have to do to extend to MJN bar is to extend the Jacobian. So how to compact file. So to answer these, we have to answer how to compact file. The universal recorder. And this has a long history, starting for simple parades. And the more recent story is what you have to do to compactify is you have to notice that units are not. And not unique. And this already appears in Journal of Stock. If you have a semi-offer, you can take a line bundle and twist it with any components of the special fiber, and you get a different unit on the genitive fiber. But and so what you have to do is you have to limit so you have to bound the degrees the special fiber. So in our case, every time I tweet steals, so if I do all of C1, every I do O of C1 and restrict it to the perfect C. That's something that has degree minus 3, 3. But here you have three nodes. And then what happens is if you list all the possible degrees of L in these components. So, this is the binding way? This is the binding way, yes. Okay. Every time you twist, you make like this jump. So, if you want to say that the limits are unique, all you have to do, you have to choose three consecutive degrees. And once you choose three consecutive degrees, then the limit is unique. You have only one way to use this thing. And how do you do in general? So, in general, what we do, we choose some number, let's say some rational thing, which we can choose 0.3 minus 0.3, and you just take the three things that are closest to these. To these to this. And that's a way to limit the degrees. But we want to do that, so that's for a single curve. So how to do that for every curve? And essentially, what you have to do is you have to choose such a number for each curve, for each component, of each node curve in a medium. Objects, not occur in a magnet, and you want to ask that it is compatible with these movements. So if you choose such a number A here, such a number B here, and then use move this node, then the chosen number here should be A plus B. And there's a much better way to think of it. We can recall from We can recall Francett's conjecture. What Franceto's conjecture says is that if you have a linear bundle on the universal curve of mgn, then there is not many choices. You either do the canonical or you have dissections. And something also happens here. So how to choose? So to choose is this is called the stability condition. This is called the stability condition is essentially the same as choosing a rational lining bundle on the universal paper. Sorry, what is the word to choose a white condition? Stability. Sorry, thank you. Yeah, so I don't write as small as Sen, but my handwriting is not easy to read, so feel free to ask anything. Okay, so then what you can think of choosing the numeric squared curve, you choose some omega to the k, a1 p1. A1, P1, AN, PM. But then you can just ask that these things are rational. And then you can just look at the degree of this thing in each component. This thing is compatible with just calculations. And okay. And then what it means to bound the limits here, you just ask for, so let me call this H5. So let me call this H type. And you can add things here. You can do something compact type. But let's not dwell too much on that. And then you can define the compact phi Jacobian of I as the pairs C L such that L is closed or not. Too far. And okay, I'm putting all the things under the rug. This L, you have to also do some torsion for your endpoint ships. Or you can do C to be a pass-stable curve. And this does not work all the time for all files because if I choose here A file that is right in the middle of these things, then it's not clear how to you get not choose three things, but the minus one, one and the minus two, two were kind of equidistant, so you don't have a way of differentiating the two. Okay. So, besides kind of centering what you want to choose, right, here you have to know that you have to choose three consecutive groups. Different curves will have different number of inverse groups. Is that controlled? Yes, this is. So, this is close enough. You can do degree of L to 1 minus the degree of the polarization in Y is less than the Than the number of external nodes of y over 2. So it's controlled by the number of nodes. And then this has to work for every subcurve of C. Yes. Subcurve that is not empty and not empty. So the thing is, you can do either class or you can do class or equal. Less or equal. If you do less, you guarantee the limits are unique. If you do less or equal, you guarantee that there is always limits. But there are special cases when these two things are different, which is kind of this case. Then you cannot choose one of these two. Okay. So is this on the nose that stability always going to be a stability condition for some VIT problem? Yes. All of this? I think so. I think so. Yes. So this is this is a jazz rather than I fix something. Okay. And then, so we have these kind of stability schemes. Which, so the degree of i should be an integer, otherwise this thing has to have the same degree of the recrovement that we have. So once you selected the A1 to AM, the case. The A1 to AM, the case fixes. So you have some stability space BGND, which kind of all the possible stability conditions that you can. And what happens is you have these not-so-good ones, and the good ones, you have the And the good ones, you have the generous one and then the degenerate ones. And the degenerate ones are always given by some hyperplanes. So you have a lot of hyperplanes which are given by phi. So in each of these polytopes that you get here, you get some compact phytochography. Compact hydropobium, but these compact hydropobians are different when you do different quadruples. So phi 1, then we have some phi 2. So what is it that we want to do? So we have this compact phi program phi 1 bar over mgn bar. And here we can do the same thing. You can look at the cycle of sheaves that has a section. That has a section, you have this universal family, and you can consider what is the cycle W D cycle. So, here we can actually do a lot of things. So we can take the closure of W D. We can consider the locus of sheafs with sections. Or you can just define the cycle. Of the topological sheet, that also needs to be. Yes. So you're focusing on r equals zero, and I'm just wondering if that's just your simplicity, or are there any extra complications if you make it really very hard? There are some extra complications. So, again, because even Again, because even in the smooth case you have to do some the things may not be of expected dimensions. So actually I I have this question which every so Isabel said that the W had components of non of different dimensions, of greater dimensions, even if it's positive. But all the examples that I looked at when you look at the image in the decoder, When you look at the image in the recording, you kind of have the actual dimensions always come when you look at the GRT. So, I don't know. That's a question that I will ask someone later. But okay, so the question is to find an example where the image actually is wrong. Yes. In the universal case, but not for a specific case. In the universal case. Yeah. Yeah, in the universal case, all the examples that we looked at without the bar. So the question is whether WRT without the bar has the expected dimension. If whole is greater than zero. Doesn't Ravi prove universality for this case? That would be great. He definitely proves universality for the universal WRD over there. Good luck. What is that meaning? Okay, maybe I'll say later. Maybe I'll select. But this WRD has lots of components. Surely some of them have the wrong dimension. But maybe the next time there are some questions whether the you take something like a multiple centric curves. We tried that, but we didn't. I mean, gave an ex I don't know, yeah, let's talk about that later. Sorry. Okay, and then, yeah, so if you consider just the cycle, and you can define the cycle, you can suppose the case, then you have to do the determinants of some check classes of derivative forms. You can do that. And for simplicity, we will do just the bit by position. Just to make sure I have the chosen step. So in your example, if you chose a stability condition, then you have those three possible limits. We have those three possible limits. They would all give you distinct points, and this can have divide. Like, would you a different point for each of the possible limits? It's not like keeping track of the data. No, the limit is unique. So if you have a different. So these are all the possible limits. You have to change the. So I guess my question was. You're going to get to this. But if you think about the closure, that's really keeping track of the data that you have a section for all possible limits, as opposed to the one permit that was picked out while you're selling machine. Yeah, it's somewhat hard to describe a disclosure either. And this is the. Okay, so we do that, but we hope that I mean, this is not. I mean, this in a way is kind of some generalization for the lambda class for the Jacobian. So if you change L to the canonical here, you have gm, you get the lambda classes. Jacobians have the topological shift. So you can consider these classes with some chances. The analog of the lambda classes. But yeah, to do the thing of the closure, you have to understand what the closure is. And it's And it's still harder. Okay, so then that's why we do we focus on this, but we actually at the moment can compute this. Okay, so then what is it that we want to do? We want to compare. So let's say WDP1 and WD2. And W. So we want to compare the cycles to two different compact fire coordinates. So the compact fire coordinates, we have kind of a lot of them, and we're going to see how these two sites compare when we change the data covered. And how we do that? So we have Do that? So we have a rational map from J51 to J52 detect CI to CI. So for a smooth curve Curve, the stability condition gives nothing. So, on this move local, everything of degree is stable. So, you can consider this map. And this map is a rational map because if a sheaf is phi1 stable, it may not be phi 2 stable. And then, what is it that we do? We want to check So we want to compute. So Wd1 minus, let's call it slap alpha alpha pullback of Wd phase. And how it is that we do that? We resolve the map. And do WDP1 minus you want to push forward with two pullback of WD phi two and okay. Okay, and now the question is how we compute this. Okay, so so was the basal locus of alpha. So in order to resolve the map, you have to find its base focus. Its base workers. Random alpha is not defined. So, which is equivalent of saying if when L is phi 1 stable, but not phi 2 is stable. And the thing that happens here is that We can look at this condition, so the stability condition is just a numerical condition. And let's say we have some curve and then we have the sheaf L, and you choose a supercurve Y. L and you choose a subcurve Y, such that this condition is not true. Such that the degree of L restricted to I minus the degree of phi2 restricted to I is greater than delta Y. Okay? So that means that missing this out is not phi two stable. Quite soon stable. What we can do is move some nodes. So if we smooth this node, and so we can smooth all the nodes here, we can smooth all the nodes in the complementary thing. And what we get is always a curve with two components, y and x, such that the degree of L restricted to y minus the degree of L. L Restricted to i minus the degree of phi2 in y is greater than delta y over 2. So then we can describe the basal locus of alpha. So the basal locus of alpha is simply the locus of curves with two components together with L, such that L is not a phi tuester. Okay, so the failure of stability is always witnessed by curves two components. And then what you have to do to so okay, and then and this can also kind of be Also, kind of be if the two polarizations are very far apart. Basilope is essentially the whole boundary, except compact type. But if you choose adjacent things, so let's choose phi 1 and phi 2 on opposite sides of Of the wall. So if you choose phi 1 and 5, 2 that are really close together and on opposite sides of wall, then that means that you cannot have too many things in this way logos. Okay? What is the wall? A wall is a wall. What is a wall? A wall is where the thing is degenerate. So I draw a picture here. So we said that for some things, if you choose a stability condition that's right in the middle, then you don't get a proper decoding because you have. So this thing will give So, this thing will give some polarization that is not good. So, we can either do a little bit more or a little bit less. So, the space in here, the space of the polarizations that are not good, it's kind of a lot of hyperbolic. So, every time the polarization is not good, it will give a hyperplane, and in this hyperplane, you cannot make a finder cognitive. But outside, you can, but at the time you cross one of these hyperplanes, you change the jacob. Hyperbanks, you change which are code. You got a different change. And what I'm asking is: okay, so every time you cross one of these walls, how do you compare the two decodes? And how do you compare the brilliant detector? Okay. So and here there are two There are two So let's remember that the polarization was something like this with distinct rational and there are two type there are two types of of walls that we can cross. Of walls everything across. That means follow both the good walls and the bad walls. So we have good walls and we have some bad walls. So in the good walls, what happens is you can kind of describe what are the vine curves that the curves of two components, which we call vine curves. We call fine curves. So you can scrap the fine curves in the base locus. So the base locus would be something like this. You have something of genus I and genus J, and then you have to increase the number of nodes in two, and then you have to decrease the genus in each component in one. So here I'm doing the logarithm. And you can continue to do that. And you can see why that's the case because when you look at the degree of phi in each of these things, it doesn't change. So, I'm sorry, I forgot the market points. So, I ask that the market point on each component is also the same. So when you look at the degree of fine in each of these things, the thing doesn't change because the sections are the same, the market points are the same. And the canonical, you decrease the genus of one, where you increase the number of nodes in two. So the restriction, the degree of the canonical on these components will remain the same. So that means you have all of this. To have all these things. Okay, and then on the other side, there is the bed walls, and the bed walls are just everything where all of the sections are on the same. And in this case, you have a lot more of possible finding curves in the visible curves. So, just to make sure I'm understanding here, you can, given the value. Given the values of k and a1 through a m, this is giving you your choice for your washing wall. And then okay, yeah. So there is a way to describe all the walls. It's kind of not easy, but what I'm saying is so this value is given by some linear conditions on. Some linear conditions on A1AN. And what I'm saying is: okay, when you're crossing A wall, the only thing that cannot remain stable are happens in curved relatives. And so, right, I mean, my question is just the thing I wanted to ask is just, so given the values that they want to, you can tell whether you're in a very bad situation based on what you're doing. Yeah, okay. So the wall is not given by values, it's given by some CIA sample. Yeah, okay. So given the values of CI is a good idea. And then it's something about the I can tell you right now which are the good characters of the good and which are the bad. And the bads are always these ones, which are some of AI. And that's because if the sum of the i is the same thing, then it kind of doesn't matter. It's essentially the canonical polarization when you have all the things on the same side. And depending on the degree, that could be a good thing. The sum of the AI is the dead ones where the sum is done all from one to air. Yeah, from from one to eight. I'm not sure how I'm going to. I'm not sure how schematic your picture is. Like, if I want to walk, if I want to fly to, can I always choose just to cross group walls, or will I have to cross some bad or something? So the bad walls are these ones. So if you are between two of them, you... Okay, sorry, I wasn't sure how accurate, but the picture is accurate. The picture is accurate. Yes. Thank you. So if you are between two values. If you are between two bad walls, and then you can just cross the good ones. Okay, and why is this the good ones? So in the good bones, these the the basal opus The basal opus is at the shiny so you can do this. So these graphs don't have common specializations. So what you have to do, these things are disjoint, and then it's it's a lot easier to to kind of resolve them up. To kind of resolve the map, what do you do? You just blow up all of these binders. Okay, so with a design union. And since the walls are close, what happens? And also the stable degrees differ from the state differ. And only one case. So let's say we have some curvatures of the components, decide we have phi 1, and let's say the stable degrees on phi 1 are minus 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, minus 1. In phi 2, what happens is you get an x1. Oh, and then that's always the case. So you have one thing here that does not exist here, and vice versa. So you're doing one thing. So, J five one, five, two. J phi1 phi2 is the roll-up of J phi1 at the base closest. And this is not enough. I mean, if the things... So, okay, so this equality here is kind of a set theoretic equality. If the phi 1 and phi 2 are very far apart, the schematic. The schematic structure is a lot complicated. So, I mean, you can always blow up the base locus to resolve the map, but then it's really hard to understand what it is. But in the case that phi1 and phi2 are very close together, then you can do you can just blow up once, each of these things, and then you're good to go. In the bad case, you always can blow up once, but You have to kind of do that in some neat ordering. So you have to choose an ordering. You have a lot of fine curves here, and they are not disjoint. And you have to order them in a way that will work out. Okay, is there a way to interpret that choice of operating in terms of trouble? Choice of ordering in terms of trouble variants. The choice of ordering, I can tell you the choice of ordering. You make some graph like this, and you choose whatever genus you like. And then you have two possible contractions. You can choose this thing, you can contract all of these things. Or you can contract all of these things. And the ordering is you always pull out this one before you pull up the other one. We've seen these pictures in other contexts. Maybe we've talked about it already. Okay, that's all very nice. Yeah, that's very nice. Thank you. Okay, so. Okay, so then we resolve the map, and now it's time to compare the cycles. So we have J phi1 phi2 with its universal family and over here we have so let's have let's assume that we are always in the good case now, so the picture is not more complicated. So we have JFI152. It has a family. And here it has two line bundles, L1 and L2, which are the pullbacks of the line bundles from Phi 1 and Phi 2. Over here you have an exceptional divisor. Okay, I will also to make things simpler, I will assume there is just one of these things that are disjoint. Of these things, they are disjoint, so you can just do one at a time. And over E, the picture you have is something like this: you have Y, which is component, and you have X, which is the other component. Okay, and I have a lot of notes in between. And what you have to do, so if I want to go from this degree to this degree, To this degree, what I have to do, I just have to subtract the appropriate component here. So if I subtract this, then I will go precisely from this degree to this degree. So L1 and L2, so L2 is L1 minus Y. Okay. That's how you compare the two. And that's because when you go from this degree to this degree, so this thing becomes trivial stable, and then it must be the universal shift, because these things are universal. Okay, and now the question becomes. I'm not sure I quite understand. So the pictures you drew in the So the pictures you drew in the good column, is each of these pictures a wall? Or is the opinion of the wall? You fix the wall, you fix a wall, and these things are all the curves that will appear in the Bayes locus when you consider the map from J phi one to J phi two. So it fits a wall. Fix a wall and two polarizations, phi 1, π 2, one on each side, very close to the wall. And then what I'm saying is when you look at the map, the locus where this map is not defined is precisely on these curves. These curves together with the degrees beyond this. Precisely this kind of curves. But when you're saying that this is disjoint, then you mean that there is no graph that contracts to more than one graph. Contracts to more than one of them? Yes. Correct understanding that fixing a wall is sort of fixing. The important thing is to normal vector this wall. It determines the specific markets. And once you fix the split of the market, then you have this problem that different banana types with the same speed of size in order for the mix. Yes. So the wall fixes. The wall fixes which markings are on each side. Intersection is actually in the tacopian. Yes, intersection is actually in MGF. So you have to take the degrees into account. Okay, so now it becomes a matter of computing C G minus D So, yeah, so then that's what we're trying to do. We have to compare the term classes of these two line bundles. And by the way, they are, there is, at least for me, there is one exact sequence that jumps to mind, which is you can Just consider the following exact sequence. So we do a one minus y to a one to a one restricted y. So y is this thing over the exception of y. Okay, and then now I have to not make a mess of. To not make a mess of this. And then you can take push forward. So the push forward will describe that derived push forward of this thing, will be the derived push forward of this thing, will the direct push forward of this thing. And then you can actually write a formula for the things we're trying to compute. So then you can actually do the compute the difference of the turn classes, of the total trend classes of L2 and L1. And, okay. Okay, and now what I want to do, I want to write the right-hand side as something that lives on the exceptional divisor. Because that's where the difference should be. The difference should be available. And, okay. So what is this push forward? So we have L1 and we restrict L1 to Y and then we push forward to J. So we can push forward here, we can push forward yon. We can push forward here, we can push forward in the other direction. So let me pull this pipe, let me pull this pipe right. So I will not make a distinction between a one restricted to y here or here. So I can write this as C of I push forward of R pi prime push forward of a one minus equals Okay, and then since I have ten minutes, we can try and compute this so we know how to how to do the trend class forward. We just use return cream and rock. Of course, I have green appearance. But in this case, since this thing is an immersion, Is an immersion, it has a much nicer formula. So the GRI in this case means that the turn class of the push forward of E is 1 plus the push forward of the turn class of Ensworg the white product of the normal. White product of the normal minus one over the top channel class of the normal. So this works whenever we have a irregular invalid. Okay, and then what we do, let me call this star, so we can write star. So we can write star as so it's very nice, we have one, we have minus one. So it's I push forward of so here the normal is just a rank one thing. So we can write C of RFI push forward of LI times. times C of minus r by two fourth of L C that's why tensor with the normal minus one so I'm writing this division okay so this is kind of formal it's a theorem that's in Putin's book that when you compute the numerator you should do it formally You should do it formally. You have something that is multiple of the top turn plus of the law. So I'm writing this way, but you actually have to do the you have to do this this informally for it to make sense. So here I'm missing the one and then we do one last We do one last trick here. So I can put the pullback, I can do production formula, I do minus I pullback of the thing. And then, so what are we doing? We're doing push forward, pullback. We can do pullback, push forward. So I can do this as minus r pi prime push forward. R by prime push forward of L1 restricted to the union. And finally, we do one last adapt sequence. We do that a one restricted to X. L1 restricted to x minus x under y to L1 restricted to x unit y. And what we end up with is that the difference in the two return classes So what's that saying? That's saying that this in, which is the one restricted to the union of the two curves can be split in L1 restricted to y. In L1 restricted to y and L1 restricted to X minus the note. And these L1 restricted to Y will kind of cancel with this thing here. So what we get is I push forward of the total shared class of minus R pi prime push forward of a one restricted flat. times something you want to restrict it y minus so I guess I have the normal here minus C one minus C1 And okay, so what do I mean by that? That means that we can kind of compare the two Brillianter cycles, the two churn classes of the derived push forward in terms of what? In terms of kind of saying things, but restricted to the boundary divisor. So we can expand this thing, but you have a way to compute the Due to the current class of potential products. So, in the end, what is the formula? So, the formula is you do C. So, you have i pi plus forwards of a sum. And then I will not write indices, but you will be some binomial coefficients. Of C1 of the normal to some power Ci of the thing in the boundary times C of other thing in the boundary that corresponds to the other components. Okay, and that's so in a way So, in a way, that's what we're doing. We're comparing these two kinds of lambda classes and the difference they are in terms of more lambda classes that live in the boundary and some normals, which in general are upside classes. So, that's how we compare these two things. Okay, and that's And that's that's the good case. So that's kind of doable. So now I have two minutes to talk about the bad case. The bad case things are bad. So the first thing is that these things are no longer disjoint. So when you look at the Gerton Equidmorak, this thing is no longer a regular immersion. I think Randzo. I think ransom. So you can have that your divisors look like this. And then when you do growth and the numerator, you don't get just a push forward from classes that live on E, but push forward the classes that live on every self-intersection of E at L. So this thing will become a lot bigger. And more than that, when we do this white thing here, that here that don't make much fuzz about is that these y's are also disjoint in the good case. So in the bad case they will not. So you can have something like this. We have a y that lives on one component, then a y that lives on the other component. And then this thing will not work out much better because you have the Much better because you have the DC, you have some intersection. So, what is the trick that we have to do in this case? So, in this case, we have to change this L1 restricted to i by kind of some sum of L1 restricted to each stratum that this thing will give, some alternate sum. And then what that means is that this thing, instead of becoming one thing, will become like a whole product. A whole product is a product of a class. So for each stratum you have a class, like a sum of things, and you have a type of product of the whole stratum. And some 30 pages of magnetologies later, you can get a formula for this thing. So and you have to kind of yeah, so you have to kind of be smart about how you blow up and how you About how you blow up and how you do these things, so you can get some sense of answer in the end. Okay, thank you. So what about So what about non-so this is all of a MGM bar for various stable maps and it's nice to be able to work with curves that are not stable. I mean I like I feel about this a bit and I think like some stuff it's kind of playable to me with other things that I don't know what to do. Yes, so Yes, so yeah, if things are not stable, then I will have at first in the good case we don't have I think we don't have this that is good anymore. I think everything will be bad. But yeah, I don't know. I have to look at it to see how the intersections go. But as as long as we have some nice way of writing, so Some nice way of writing it. So I think I have drawn this picture. So as long as these things keep making sense, I think you can do something. I think the place where I got stuck thinking about this was just the stability conditions for the Jacobians. Like for stable codes, that is better to push by you guys and then push by Get C and they classify it. So everything is very nice. But for pre-stable codes, like Fully stable curves, like writing understanding what all the stability conditions are or easy is B was not stability. Okay, quick. Market knows a lot. Okay, wonderful, well, I will. So another kind of wall processing thing that seems closely related is so David and Related is that so David and Sam have this log VR, and friends have this log VR paper where they get some formula, but subject to choice of theta, subject to a choice of stability condition. And there's some wall crossing study there. Have you do you guys know so much about this problem? Do you expect that these give those formulas or something? So what happens there aren't anything? So, okay, so in that case you have some j phi, so the degree of phi is zero, and you ask that the zero moon degree is phi stable. So you have that the trivial section, the trigger one Louise stable, so you have a section. But they also determine the average COVID beta state. Jacobi is data stable. What? They also request that the Abel Jacobi is data stable. No, then you have to kind of do a... That would be bad. That would be bad. You're a twisting state, it's also. Okay, but what happens in this case, there is a choice of stability condition because you have a lot of stability conditions where this image is stable. But in that case, so here if I change, okay, everything is the wrong order, but when the image But when the image exists, then we have that W0. We can't describe the closure, it's very easy, it's just a trivial bundle because it's something of degree zero and had a section, it's a trivial bundle. So the thing is written here, so it has the expected coordination that it is given by this thing. So you can do our crossing. And if you change to another phi2, To where this thing is also stable, then you can do something geometrically. You can look at the cycle. So the cycle is transversal to our strata because it is a section. So when you pull back to phi 1, phi 2, you get the brain image. So when you push forward, you get kind of the closure here. So the whole problem will be zero in this case. This is so you get the you always get the same thing. So I see so one has to blow up really to get the interesting wall crossing terms in there, etc. Yes, so what you can do is you have mgn, j phi1, and then but you have to choose a j phi2 far away, what in which the aboutuct of the section exists, and then you have to. Paper actually also gives formulae when this zero is not quite stable. I mean, we hide it at the end, but it's Table. And we hide it to the end because then we don't know what it means geometrically, but we do have formulae for every chamber that are related by your all-crossing stuff. But they're a very different shape toward the building. So it's not, I mean, I guess logically they must be related for geometrical reasons, but from the formulas is uncommon. So it seems fun to think about. But yeah, I don't. There's a. Right, so if you choose the stability conditions such as the The stability conditions such that the arbitrary perfect section is stable, then the vote TR will call back a TR and so we're computed. So yeah, the idea will walk from back to your computer. But if you do that, grow out of the camera as the wrong part. It is not the problem that you have. Yeah, that's right. Thanks. So am I correct? It seems to me that we're kind of handing off a field. Handing off a field to a group of people, where you're saying, okay, now we have this tautological ring of this whole parameter space of code being able to generate it by this graph decorated in some new way, with some new kind of lambda classes, with some multi-degrees, and so on and so forth. And we're even pending you off sort of wall-crossing formula how these classes in transition one to the other go off throughout the intersection. Am I right? Is this ready to be handed off? Or is there still something to be figured out? I think there's a lot of things to be figured out. Yes, mostly because, so I say the topological shift, but this thing when you are reaching the file is not for me. So yeah, so essentially you can only do CG minus D. So the other classes would kind of depend on the classes that what, sir? I just didn't do what you said. It would depend on the choice of the totalized question. So it's a lot, it's still something missing on what are the kind of the nice topological classes that you can put very bad. In each chamber, there's not a well defined topological shift, say? It is well defined from the pullback. Questions? That's kind of the question. So we resume that
