Yeah, so we'll get started again. It's my pleasure to present Lauren Williams, who will tell us about polyhedral and tropical geometry of flag positroids. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry I can't be there in person to see everyone and wish Bernard happy birthday in person. But anyway, I'm going to be speaking about joint work with John Borrow. About joint work with John Borecki and Chris Yere. And what I have here is a kind of pictorial overview of my talk. I'm going to be describing connections between tropical geometry and positive flag matroids and also subdivisions of flag positroid polytopes. And the picture I've drawn at the bottom is actually a picture from Philippe Nadeau and Vasude Tawari's paper, where these kinds of subdivisions. Where these kinds of subdivisions came up as well. Okay, so I'll start by telling you a bit about the positive flag variety, and then I'll tell you about their matroidal analogues, flag positroids, and their moment polytopes. Then I'll say a little bit about the positive tropical flag variety. This came up in Laura Bossinger's talk, I believe. I believe, and then I'll mention a theorem connecting the above objects. There are some applications to realizability questions for matroids and Bruha interval polytopes. And then finally, at the very end, I'll say a little bit about the connection to cluster algebras by giving a very concrete example, which will again be related to things that Laura spoke about earlier. Okay, so let me just get started by defining the positive flag variety. And I'm going to be restricting to type A, but I'll be talking about partial flag varieties. So let's let R be a list of positive numbers, R1 through Rk. And they are numbers from one through. From 1 through n. Then I'll define the partial flag variety F L R N. This is going to be the variety of partial flags of subspaces. This will be my subspace. This will be my subspaces will be called V1 through VK. They will be included in each other like this. And we require that the dimension of V sub I is R sub I or all I. And this can be identified with GLN modulo parabolic subgroup. And we can also represent elements of the flag variety. Elements of the flag variety by matrices. So let me explain how that goes. What are my conventions? So we can represent an element of F L Rn by an Rk by N matrix such that the span of the span of the top R sub I rows gives B sub I and then special cases which which I like to keep in mind are first of all if capital R is the set one through n then we get the complete flat variety F L N F L M And if capital R is a single number, little R then we get the Grasmonian of R planes in n space. And we always have a projection from the complete flag variety to such a To such a partial flag variety, just obtained by forgetting all the subspaces VI of dimensions that you don't care about. So, just as a small example, if I write down the following three by three matrix. Three by three matrix, then this represents an element of the complete flag variety ethyl3, where Vi is the span of the top i rows. And then I also want to I also want to introduce Plüker coordinates. And for i, a subset of the numbers one through n, the plüker coordinate p sub i of a is going to be the determinant of the sub matrix in the columns that I've chosen. And in the top rows, so rows one, two, up to size of A, size of I. Okay, well, maybe I should slowly scroll. Okay, so now I want to explain two notions of positivity for flag varieties of type A. And a first notion is the sort of Is the sort of naive notion of fluker positivity? So we say that, and I'm going to sort of abuse notation sometimes going back and forth between matrices and the flags they represent. So we say that a matrix representing an element. An element of this partial flag variety is pluker positive or pluker non-negative if and only if all the pluker All the Pluker coordinates P sub I for I having the right cardinality, namely little R sub I from our list or positive, respectively, non-negative. Okay, so basically I say that an element of the part Of the partial flat variety is Pluker positive if all of the relevant Pluker coordinates are strictly positive, and then the same definition for non-negative. And this notion for Grasmonians goes back to the work of Posnikov. Now there's another notion of positivity that we can call. We can call lustig positivity. So, in this setting, first of all, the positive part of GLN is the monoid consisting of n by n matrices in GLN such that all square submatrices have positive determinants. Have positive determinant. So this is just the same as the set of totally positive matrices. Then when we want to talk about the complete flag variety, we can define its positive part as the image of the positive part of GLN inside. GLN mod B. So B is the ORL subgroup, say, of upper triangular matrices. And GLN mod B can be identified with the complete flag variety. So we're defining the totally positive part of the complete flag variety to be the image of totally positive matrices in GLN mod B. And then And then, if we want to define the totally non-negative part of the complete flat variety, then we can just look at the closure of the positive part. So that's for, this is for complete flag varieties. And then if we want to talk about partial flag varieties, so for flag varieties, so for capital R as above, then we can just use the projection map applied to the complete flag ready. Okay. Okay, so a priori, these notions of positivity are different, but there's a nice recent theorem. This is of Tony Block and Stephen Karp. And what they showed is that the two notions of positivity. Of positivity for a partial flag variety coincide if and only if r is a set of consecutive integers. So this statement had been So, this statement had been known already for Grasmonians. Honey Reach had written down a proof that was not published. With Kelly Talaska, we subsequently wrote down a proof. Several more proofs were given. And the complete flag variety case was also independently proved by Beretzki. I'll write that down. So complete flag case independent. Case independently proved by John Boretzky. But anyway, so this is a very nice theorem of block and carp that tells us precisely when the two notions coincide. And because of that, in the rest of my talk, we're now going to restrict attention to the case where Where R is a set of consecutive integers. So sometimes I'll just denote that set of consecutive integers by a, a plus one, dot, dot, dot, up through b. Okay, so yeah, please interrupt if there's any questions. I'm not great at monitoring the chat, but maybe someone will tell me. Okay, so now I want to say a little bit about matroids, flag matroids, and flag positroids. And so let me give the definitions I want to work with. So given a subset S of numbers from one through n, I'll let E. I'll let E sub S be the 0, 1 vector, which is the indicator vector for this set S. So this will be a 0, 1 vector in R to the n. And now, given a collection B of D element subsets of one through N. Subsets of one through n, I'll let P of B be the convex hull of all of the indicator vectors for elements of my collection script B. So this will be a polytope in Rn. And now if every edge Every edge of the polytope P of B is parallel to EI minus EJ for some I not J. Then we'll say that B is the set of bases of a matroid M of B. M of B and that P of B is a matroid polytope. So this is not the usual definition of matroid, but we can take it as a definition because of work of Gelfand, Goresky. Koresky, McPherson, and Serganova. Okay, and then I want to say what I mean by realizability of matroids. So if there is a D by N matrix A such that my Pluker coordinate P sub i is non-zero if and only Is non-zero if and only if I lies in the collection, then we say that A realizes M. Okay, so now I want to explain what's the analog for flag matroids, or what or what will mean for by flag matrix. So now, So now, as usual, R will be this subset of numbers representing the dimensions of my flags. And then we will define lagmatroid as follows. So lagnatroid of ranks R on one through n. On one through n is a sequence M1 through MK of matroids of the appropriate ranks R such that every edge Of the Minkowski sum. So I'm taking the Minkowski sum of all of my individual matrix polytopes is parallel to EI minus EJ for some i not equal to j. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is parallel to the definition that I gave above, except now we're looking at the Minkowski sum of the individual matrix polytopes. And then in this case, this Minkowski sum is called a flag matroid polytope. Okay. Okay. Excuse me. But this condition is always hold because the class of base polytops is closed at the summation. Let's see. Um See. Um so it would be a some based polyto. So then um okay maybe maybe we can talk about that about that afterwards. I thought that there was something okay yeah um thanks. Okay, so so if M one through Mk has a realization by a real RK by n matrix A such that For I between one and k the top Ri by N submatrix of A has its maximal minors positive, then we'll say that Say that M1 through MK is a flag positroid and P of M a flag positroid polytope. Okay, so I want to make a small remark that I'm Remark that I'm defining flag positroid in such a way that it's automatically realizable. So my definition, we're defining flag positroid such that it's automatically. It's automatically realizable. And this is a generalization of Postnikov's definition of positrude. Okay, so now about the moment map. So we have an action. We have an action of C star to the n on the Grassmannian. And you can think of this as scaling the columns of the matrix. And if a matroid M Is realizable by a matrix A. So this is viewed as a point in the Grassmannian. Then the matroid polytope P of M is the moment map image of the closure of the torus orbit. Of the torus orbit. A bay. And there's similar statements for flag matrix polytopes as well. Okay, so now let me just mention a few special cases of flag positorid polytopes just to convince you that they are very nice. So if R is the set one through n, so we're in the complete flag case, then the flag positroid polytopes are polytopes called Bruha interval polytopes. This is a class of polytopes that we first started studying in a paper. Studying in a paper of with Kodama. And these polytopes have the following form. So if you give me any two comparable permutations, u and v, u less than or equal to v in strong brucho order in sn then we define the brucho interval polytope to Bruh interval polytope to be the convex hull of all of the permutation vectors x of one dot dot dot x of n where x lies in the interval between u and v. And this is strong Bruha order. A special case of a Bruha interval polytope is the permutahedron, which The permutahedron, which you get when V is the longest element. And to show, so the permutahedron when N is 3 looks like this. But I can show you a couple more Berhai interval polytopes. So if I add So, if I add if I add this line here, then I've cut my permutahedron into two Bruha interval polytopes, one on either side. Okay, so that's the special case when R is the full set one through N. And another special case is if R is a single element, little R. Element, little R. So this is the Grassmonian case. Then lag positroid polytopes are just what are known as positroid polytopes. And these have a very nice combinatorial structure. They have a very simple facet structure. And they have. And they have a very pretty connection to non-crossing partitions and the comet networks of these polytropes we studied a while back in a paper with Federico Ardela, Felipe and Felipe Rincom. And a special case of a positroid polytope is the hypersimplex. The hypersimplex. So I'll just draw it when d is little r is two and n is four. So one, two. So I'll just draw the indicator. I'll just draw the two element subsets labeling vertices. So this entire hypersimplex. Hypersimplex is a positroid polytope, but I can also cut it in half along this square, and then I have also a positroid polytope on either side. Okay, so now a natural question is when Is when and how can we subdivide a matroid polytope into smaller matroid polytopes. And we could ask the same question for flag matroid polytopes. Polytopes and their positive analogs. So these questions are very closely connected to tropical geometry. And in the case of subdivisions of usual metroid polytopes, Kopranov was one of the first people to study this. Also, LaFourg and David Speyer. David Speyer, and they talked about matrix subdivisions and the connection to the tropical Grasmonian. Okay, so yeah, so that's um so that's a kind of motivating question, and now I'm going to And now I'm going to state, I'm going to state two theorems in special cases to give some intuition, and then I'll state their common generalization. So the first theorem is a theorem in the Rasmonian case, and this comes out of a paper. A paper with Lukowski and Parisi, a separate paper with Speyer, and very similar statements also appeared at the same time in a paper of Herconi-Helmed, Lamb, and Spradlin. Okay, so what's the statement? So, this is going to be a connection between tropical geometry and matroid subdivision. Geometry and matroid subdivisions. So let's let μ be a vector of real numbers. So the components will be indexed by all the r-element subsets of one through n. Now, the statement is that the following are equivalent. So the first statement is that μ lies in the positive tropical Grassmonnian. And I believe you saw positive tropical cluster varieties in Laura's talk earlier. Studies in Laura's talk earlier today. So I'll be a little bit brief, but the idea of what is the positive tropical Grasmonian is that you can take, it's defined by looking at the Grasmonian, specifically the positive Grasmonian, over the field of Puissot series. And then you can take the coordinate-wise valuation and then take the closure. And that gives you the positive tropical Grasmonian. Tropical Brassmonian. So we'll just write closure of coordinate-wise evaluation of the positive Grasmonian over Risot series. Okay, and one can also define this in terms of looking at the vanishing of an ideal over a positive Puiset. ideal over a positive Puissot series. Okay, so that's the first bullet point. Now there's another simpler way to describe the positive tropical Grassmonnian just in terms of tropical Pluka relations. So the equivalent condition is that mu obeys the positive tropical three term Term Pluka relations. So, what do this say? It says that for i, j, k, and l and s disjoint from them, where s has size r minus two, mu sub s i k plus mu sub s j l SJ L is the minimum of mu Sij plus mu S K L comma mu S I L plus mu S J K. Okay, so this should look like very similar to the usual three-term fluke relation, but I've tropicalized it and I'm requiring the term on the left to be equal to the minimum of the term on the right. The minimum of the term on the right, and this is the um yeah, this is the positive tropical three-term sub relation. So, the first equivalence is that you lie in the positive tropical Brismonian if and only if you satisfy just these very simple three-term positive tropical flu correlations. Now, the third statement connects this to subdivisions, and the third statement. And the third statement says that every face in the coherent, this is sometimes called regular subdivision of the hypersimplex delta r, n. Ah, I maybe didn't define this notation. This means convex hull of E sub pi. Of E sub i, where I is an R element subset of one through n. So every face in the coherent subdivision of the hypersimplex induced by mu is a positroid polytope. And just to say a little bit about what I mean by coherent subdivision. By a coherent subdivision. A coherent or regular subdivision. So this is a definition that we can attach to any polytope. And what we do is we lift each vertex. In my situation, the vertices are e sub i. are P sub i of delta Rn to height mu sub i. So this gives a polytope in dimension one larger and then we project the lower facets of this lifted polytope back to Back to the original space. This gives a polytopal subdivision. So, what this third condition is saying is that we're looking at coherent subdivisions of the hypersimplex in which every single face is actually a polytope, is actually a positrid polytope. And that statement is equivalent to mu thought of as our height function. Thought of as our height function as being an element in the positive tropical Brasmonian. Okay, so I'll show a very, very small picture. So if n is 4 and r is 2, then we can consider u sub i. i is a two element subset. two element subset of the numbers one through four such that mu one three plus mu two four equals mu two three plus mu one four less than mu one two plus mu three four and um and so if we lift vertices of our hypersimplex I'll use the same labeling as before. So if we lift our vertices to the heights given by mu and look at the lower facets of this larger polytope, then we will get exactly the splitting of this hypersimplex into two square pyramids along. Pyramids along this blue square. And the top and the bottom are separately positroid polytopes. Okay. Okay, so that's a theorem having to do with the Grasmonian case. Let me now tell you an analogous theorem in the complete flag case. The complete flag case. And this theorem is a combination of work of John Beretski and Joswig Loho Uber Alart. So now we're going to start with a vector mu. But now it's indexed by all proper subsets of one through n. And now, so the statement will be very similar to what we saw before. So the following are equivalent. The first statement is that μ lies in the positive tropical. Positive tropical complete flag variety. And again, you can define this as the closure of the coordinate-wise valuation of the positive complete flag variety defined over Fissot series. So that's the first statement. The second statement is that mu. Statement is that μ obeys the positive tropical three-term pluker and incidence pluker relations. And just to give you a flavor of what the incidence Pluker relations look like, I'll just write one of them down. Let's say mu2. Let's say mu2 plus mu13 is the min of mu1 plus mu23 comma mu3 plus mu12. And if you want to write it down more generally, then I should replace one, two, and three by i less than j less than k and add a disjoint subset s to all of the terms. Terms. So this first equivalence was proved by Beretsky. Now, he actually proved something stronger. He proved an analogous statement for the non-negative part, not just the strictly positive part. And then the equivalence of the second and well, the Well, the second statement here and the statement I'm about to write is due to JLLO. And that third statement is that every face in the coherent subdivision of the permutahedron, which I'll denote by perms of n induce. Induced by mu is a Bruha interval polytope. Okay, so I should just clarify a little bit now how I use mu to lift vertices of the permutahedron to different heights. So Heights. So I'll just explain in an example. So we lift, say, the vertex 3, 1, 2, 5, 4. I'm thinking of this as a vertex of the permutahedron, perm sub 5. We lift it to height mu 4 plus mu 4 5. four five plus mu one four five plus mu one three four five and the way I got this sequence was first I looked for where my number five was it's in position four so I wrote this here then I looked at where positions where where letters five and four appear they're in positions four and five so I put this then I looked at where the letters three four and five are they appear in Four and five are, they appear in positions one, four, and five. So that's where this came from, and so on. Okay, so that's so that's how I'm using these vectors mu, which you can think of as tropical suker coordinates. It's how I'm using these mu's to lift vertices of the permutahedron to different heights in order to get a coherent subdivision. To get a coherent subdivision. And I can show another small example. Say n is 3. So we can consider our vector mu1, mu2, mu3, mu1, 2, u1, 3, u2, 3. And I want to suppose that mu does lie in the positive tropical. Does lie in the positive tropical complete flag variety. So it has to satisfy, has to satisfy this relation. So let's suppose that mu2 plus mu13 equals mu1 plus mu23 is less than mu3 plus mu12. So if we do this and we lift vertices of the prometahedron to the corresponding. To the corresponding heights, then we should get this subdivision into two Bruha interval polytopes. So the first one, the first polytope, say this blue one, contains all vertices in the Bruha interval between 1, 2, 3, and 3, 1, 2. And the second Bruha interval point. And the second Brouhat interval polytope is this one, and it contains all permutations in the interval from 1,32 to 3, 2, 1. Okay. Okay, so I've now shown you two statements, one for the Grassmonnian, one for the complete flag variety. And now I want to state a theorem which generalizes these theorems. These theorems in two ways. And first, we're going to extend the theorem to flat varieties, F L R N, where R is a consecutive set of integers, and second, we're And second, we're going to replace every instance of the word positive by non-negative. And one thing that this does is it allows us to look at subdivisions of more general. General polytopes. So, in the Grassmonnian case, the first theorem I showed you only had to do with subdivisions of the hypersimplex, which is the moment map image of the Grassmonian. And the second theorem has to do with subdivisions of the prometahedron, which is the moment map image of the complete flag variety. But we'd like to look at subdivisions of like smaller polytopes, smaller flag positrid polytopes. So not just those extreme examples. So, not just those extreme examples. Okay, so now I can state the theorem now that hopefully you have some intuition for what it means. So we have to let R be a sequence. Sequence of consecutive integers a plus one up through b and now as before I'm going to fix my vector mu so this is going to be like a a tuple of tropical pluger coordinates and um And the sort of formal way to say it is that this vector will lie in the product of a bunch of projectivizations of vector spaces coming from the tropical hyperfield. So this bold T. T is what's known as the tropical hyperfield, but in less fancy language, we just think of this bold T as R union infinity. And why does infinity come up? Well, if you take the valuation of zero, then you get. Of zero, then you get infinity. Okay, so it's basically what we need to work with if we are tropicalizing varieties which can have coordinates which are zero. Okay, so now the following three statements are equivalent. So the first statement. So the first statement is that μ lies in the non-negative tropicalization of FLRN. And this again can be defined as the closure of the coordinate-wise evaluation of this. Non-negative flag variety over Plissot series. The second statement is that mu satisfies all positive tropical three-term sucre and incidence sucr relations. And then the third. And then the third statement is that every face in a coherent in the coherent subdivision of the flag matroid polytope P of mu A plus P of mu B P of mu B is a flag positroid polytope. And maybe I can say a little bit more concretely, what is this flag matroid polytope? Well, for each mu A, mu A you should think of as kind of tropical Pluker coordinates. Tropical Pluker coordinates, some of them can be zero. So the matroid polytope associated to μA will just be the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the non-zero zuccher coordinates. Okay. Let's see. So maybe I'll just say one statement, one thing about the proof, because you might ask. Because you might ask, is this theorem true for more general subsets of one through n and not just these consecutive ones? So, first, I guess we don't really know precisely what's true and not true for an arbitrary subset R. However, our proof of this theorem very much uses results of Martian Reach on parameterization. Results of Marsh and Reach on parameterizations of positive flag varieties. And their parameterizations of cells use Lustig's notion of positivity. And of course, as you can see from the statement of the theorem, we're using Pluker coordinates everywhere. And so in order to be talking about Pluker coordinates, but also to be using results about Lustig's notion of positivity, that's why for our proof of the theorem, anyway, it's very important that we work. Important that we work in this setting where we know that the two notions of positivity coincide. Okay, so now I'll just say a tiny bit about applications. So one, let's see. Yeah, so one, so one corollary of our theorem is that Is that for a flag matroid of consecutive ranks A, A plus one up through B its flag matroid polytope P of Polytope P of M is a flag positroid polytope if and only if all of its faces of dimension at most two are meaning are flag positrid polytopes. So you can detect whether a flag natrioid polytope comes from Polytope comes from positivity just by looking at its low-dimensional faces. So now I want to give an application to prove interval polytopes, and I'll mention first something that we proved with Emmanuel Suckerman a while back. So we proved that every face of Of a Bruha interval polytope, I'll call it BIP is again a BIP. I don't know why I wrote Z. I seem to be forgetting my initial. So, a corollary that we get is that. That we get is that a complete flag matroid polytope is a Broca interval polytope if and only if all two-dimensional faces are. Okay. A different application has to do with realizability. So there's a natural question. A natural question of when does the sequence of positroids of different ranks have a realization by one matrix, right? Like if you give me a bunch of positroids, say, of, you know. Say of different ranks, can you realize them all at once coming from the same matrix? Or can you realize them all at once as coming from an element of the positive black variety? And so, something that we so we gave an answer to this question. So, suppose this is a sequence of positroids of consecutive ranks. So then, if we consider them, if we consider the sequence as As a sequence of positively oriented matroids, then MA through MB is a flag positroid if and only if it's an oriented flag mutroid. Okay, so um Okay, so yeah, so anyway, you one needs in order to know that your sequence of positroids is realizable coming from one flag positroid, it's enough to check that your sequence of positively oriented matroids is itself an oriented flag matroid. Okay, um, okay, so I guess in my remaining four minutes, I'll say a little bit about About the cluster connection. So let's go to the case of the tropical complete flat variety positive part of FL4 and recall that this can be thought of as a As a set of tropical fluker vectors, you can think of this object as a set of all μ sub i, which obey the cost of tropical three-term fluker relations. So, this is a polyhedral fan, which has several natural fan structures. So, in particular, Lara Bossinger computed The Grobner fan structure. And there's a section in her paper at the end detailing this particular example. And it has 14 maximal cones, nine rays, and it's dual to the three-dimensional association. And so I'm sure. And so I'm sure these numbers look familiar to you. And probably many of you know that FL4 is a cluster variety of finite type A3. So Laura looked at several fan structures, including the Grobner fan structure. We're looking at another fan structure. Another fan structure, which is the secondary fan structure. So, in other words, if you give me a tropical Pluger vector, I can write down a subdivision of the prometahedron into Bruha interval polytopes. And so now let's put a fan structure on the tropical positive flag ready based on which subdivisions we get. So that's Get. So that's the second, that's what I mean when I say the secondary fan structure. And we got the same fan. And so I can show you what this looks like. So this is a little table from our paper. So at the left, we have height functions, or in other words, you can think of these as positive. Words, you can think of these as positive tropical fluker vectors. There are 14 different maximal cones, and in each cone, we chose a point in the interior. So if you look at this vector, and if you check, you'll see that this vector satisfies all of the positive tropical three-term fluke relations. So now you can do this. So now you can do this procedure. I view, I use these tropical pseudo vectors to lift points of the permitahedron to particular heights, and that induces a subdivision of the permutahedron into Bruha interval polytips. So for example, if I use this as my height function, then I get a subdivision of the permutahedron into these six Brouhard interval polytopes. And this subdivision. And this subdivision is shown in this picture here. Combinatorially, we're actually cutting up the permutahedron into cubes. So, anyway, so 12 subdivisions give the same combinatorics, some kind of cutting into cubes, and then two of the subdivisions give this slightly different way of decomposing. So, anyway, so I think it's a pretty example, and this 14 here, these 14. And this 14 here, these 14 maximal cones, are the 14 also, the same 14 cones that Laura saw in the Groebner fan structure of the positive tropical complete flat variety. So that's all I wanted to say. We have a paper on the archive and happy birthday, Bernard. Okay, thank you very much, Lauren, for that lovely talk. Are there any questions from our virtual participants? Just unmute yourself and ask if you have a question. Joel. Oh, hi, Joel. I have a question. So, given one of these, like, um Given one of these like tropical points of the flag variety, these I forgot what you called those vectors, I would associate a polytope where those would be the give me the positions of the hyperplanes of the polytope. The polytope would be like a deformation of the permetahedron. Ah, oh, you're saying that generalized permitohedron, I guess you would call it. Generalized permetahedron, I guess you would call it. Oh, you're saying that associated to this, you would you would associate one polytope? One polytope, a generalized permutahedron where the where the positions of the hyperplanes are given by those numbers. Oh, interesting. Ah, wait, so like P1 would correspond to which hyperplane? The one labeled by the first. First fundamental weight? Like the equation would be x1 less than or equal to 15, I guess. Okay, okay, okay. Like I would, yeah, so I would have x1 less than or equal to 15, x2 less than or equal to negative 1, and so on and so on, something like that. X1 plus X2 less than or equal to 4, I guess, the P12. Is there any relation between that and putting them? Putting them at the different heights, the vertices at different heights? Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea. Is this so? Is this an empty polytope? Yeah. Oh. And they also have like a kind of, I don't know, at least in the rank two example, the two-dimensional example, we also have kind of the decomposent of those two, those two Bruha interval polytopes like you showed me. So it seems like there might be a connection. So it seems like there might be a connection. Oh, so in this small example, there's two ways of composing it, decomposing it into brohinable polytopes. Yeah, and the polytopes, you'll that the the two, there's two kinds of MV polytopes, and one there's a it's naturally like those two vertices that you lie on a line parallel. Line parallel. Oh, interesting. Oh, where can I read about this? I don't know. My old papers about it, but well. Huh, yeah. So I don't know. I mean, that would be really fascinating if there's a relation. Do you look at this also in the Grasmonian case, or is it? No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No, really interesting. But yeah, I don't know. But I think that. Yeah, I don't know. But but I think that MP polytop they are very closely related to hositroids because it's defined uh by the uh Lenstein-Levinsky conditions. So this is and they are exactly Pluker conditions. And therefore it's very close also that they define it by two-dimensional phases. Okay. I think it's almost the same. But maybe the class of ambitious polypatopsy is bigger because they. Bigger because they are not inside the unit cube. Because in general, you can consider more wider class of polytops. Not only in the cube, but you can consider any subset of integers. And then you can consider subdivision. But I think that in this class, this has to be very close to MV polytops, maybe exactly MV polytops. Sorry, you're saying that which should be exactly MV polytops? Be exactly MB polytrops, is it true? So, what you define as it's exactly they satisfy Plutarch relation, so condition which I written. So, I forgot how they called weight conditions. So, there's two inequalities, two types of inequalities. It is in the old drill paper on MV polytops, I think. Okay, okay, all right, thank you. Yeah, so if you just the command, so if you just allow kind of tropical conditions, so it's not peditroid, but you can just in this Pluto relation not want to have I'm less than J K L L and just for three diagonals in your octahedron, then you will get ethereum going back to Muroto on the dress and vency on characterization. Wensel on characterization of valuated matroids. And in this case, in this picture, you will get another subdivision by vertical. Right, right. That is just difference that from positroids to the matroids. In some sense, so you have to construct it from, so if you have this pyramid, then you can only cut it in two pieces, but not in three. But if you allow the third, then you will get more general material. Genital matroids. Right. So, so does the MV polytope, is it more like mutroids or more like positive? No, more like pretitroids. Okay, okay, okay. Because they define it from pre-currentation condition. Okay. I mean, the matroid subdivision story, like without the adjective positive, you can still define things using Plugger relations. But instead of. If I correctly remember, then the condition is two-dimensional. Then the condition is two-dimensional in the polytop. So you have just such a polytop that if you just make, so you have two, like it's like pegism. No, no, it's like what it's called. So it's just, so if you just have triangle and you cut some, then you have let's say like this for the name. Yes, and then the condition is that if you just cut by parallel, so you can just some specific cuts has to be not arbitrary, it's to condition. And this is exactly characterized as spaces. Okay, okay. It's a special trapezoid, so they are special form. Are there any more questions from our virtual audience? What about our real participants? Thank you. Hi, Lauren. It's Lara. Thank you for your very nice talk. Oh, hi, Lara. I have a question about the example in the end. Question about the example in the end. So the flag four. So in the cluster structure, there's one more cluster variable that's not a flicker coordinate. And from the Grupner fan point of view, I guess I really like to also consider this coordinate and slightly work in a slightly bigger space. But now, given that you think of the points in the tropicalization as a height function. Points in the tropicalization as a height function. Is there an interpretation of this additional coordinate and the height it would define also for the secondary fan structure? Is it possible to define it in the slightly bigger space? Oh, that's a good question. I see. So you're saying, should we put in the extra cluster variable as another component of our height function? Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a very good question. I think that would be a very natural thing to do. Yeah. Yeah, that probably, yeah, that probably is probably. Although I guess I don't know, I guess I wouldn't know how that comes into. How that comes into lifting a point to a particular height. Because the sort of recipe we use to lift points of the permitohedron to a particular height only sort of naturally use pluger coordinates. Yeah, so I don't know actually. Yeah, I guess I wouldn't know offhand exactly how to use it, incorporating it into the height vector. Incorporating it into the height vector, but it's a yeah, it's a nice question though. Yeah, well, maybe just like just a small follow-up. I just recognize your F vectors, they are the same for 12 cones and different for twos. And the Gribner fan structure is also the case that 12 cones have a prime initial ideal and two have not. So it really looks like lifting helps to resolve and make all the cones prime. So maybe it would. The cones prime, so maybe it would like. I don't know how, but maybe it could help to get the same f vector for all. Oh, oh, interesting. I see. So you're saying maybe if we incorporated that extra cluster variable, maybe we could fix these? Yeah, that's what's happening with the ideas. I mean, it's a very naive expectation, maybe, but at least that kind of pattern appears with ideas. I see. Interesting. I see. Interesting. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we should look that more. Thank you. Okay, any other questions? All right, so let's thank Lauren again for that lovely talk. Thank you.
