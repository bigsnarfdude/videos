Good morning, everyone. I'm Arya Patel and I am an LSST Discovery Alliance Catalyst Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. And today I'll be telling you about some exciting astrostatistics work I've done on understanding the Milky Way galaxy. This work is done as This work is done as part of my PhD at the University of Toronto with my supervisors Wen Eri, Jobovi, and a special thank you to Sebastian Jamungal at the Statistics Department at the University of Toronto who helped make this project a reality. Now to begin, what is the science that drives my research? It is galaxy formation and evolution over cosmic time. Galaxies are the fundamental building blocks in the structure of the universe. Blocks in the structure of the universe, and how better can we understand these galaxies than by looking at our own Milky Way, a typical galaxy in the universe? Now, we know that the processes underlying the Milky Way are complex, but we can study them by using observations of stars that now have sort of billions in the galaxy. And using these observations, we can estimate ages, chemical compositions, and even orbits of stars. Even orbits of stars. And then essentially, we are posed with the problem of how do we compare our models of galaxy formation and evolution with the data that we have. Now, in principle, that sounds pretty simple, but there's a significant gap between the simulations and data that we have. So, on the one hand, we have what we call cosmological or large-scale simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies that come in a lot of flavors. So, the top In a lot of flavors. So, the top panels essentially show you different types of zoom-in or individual galaxy simulations. The bottom panels tell you about sort of large-volume galaxy simulations where you can look at a lot of galaxies and get their average statistics. On the left-hand side, I'm showing you sort of dark matter only or simulations that only model dark matter and stars as particles. Whereas on the right, you actually include hydrodynamics of the baryons. Include hydrodynamics of the baryons or the gas. And one more limitation here is that we often cannot resolve individual stars in these simulations. It's usually a group of stars. And on the other hand, we have data that's coming from several different telescopes, surveys, in different varieties. Right now, we have observations of about a billion stars with the Gaia satellite. And in the future, this is going to become even more. And in the future, this is going to become even more complex with surveys like the Milky Way coming in, the LSST coming in, which is going to observe about 20 billion stars in our galaxy. And this is going to be over space and also over time. And so we need a way to kind of bridge this gap between the simulations and the data, where, of course, the knowledge data-driven methods come in. This is where me and all of you come in. And all of you come in because we need a way to actually provide some statistical measures from our data to compare to models. So, that was sort of like the overall background. Now I'll dive deeper into the projects I worked on to sort of understand the Milky Way galaxy structure. I won't actually go into the three projects I worked on. Right now, I'll be focusing on the third and final project, but I'll give you sort of a very brief overview. Sort of a very brief overview of the first two projects because a lot of people seem to be interested in the methods that I worked on. So, the first project was actually how do we look at stars across the disk of the Milky Way and improve the sort of accuracy and precision of the chemical composition estimates of stars. Here, I used Sloan Digital Sky Survey for apogee spectroscopic data, which can actually observe the whole. Which can actually observe the whole Milky Way. And for this work, I developed some methods on functional data analysis, or particularly functional PCA, to reduce the dimensionality of the spectroscopic data. And I also worked on sort of likelihood-free inference or simulation-based inference to estimate the chemical compositions of stars given models. So if you're interested in this kind of work, please refer to the QR code there. Refer to the QR code there. And now, switching gears to the second project. This was about sort of improving the accuracy and precision of ages of stars, which are really hard to estimate. This was done using Kepler time series data. And for this, I developed a new sort of power spectrum estimation method called multi-tapering. This was already sort of in place. This was already sort of in place in the statistical literature in the 1990s, but I improved upon this method to actually be able to apply it to sort of the uneven sampling that we have in astronomy. So again, if you're interested in this time series analysis method, you can refer to the paper. Now, I'll finally focus on the third and final project, which I'll spend the rest of my talk on. So, if you were to look at So, if you were to look at the stars across the Milky Way galaxy, or particularly the disk, estimate sort of their precise chemical compositions as well as gauges. And if you plot this diagram, so here I'm plotting on the x-axis what is called metallicity in astronomy, which is essentially just a measure of what's the composition of the star in iron as opposed to hydrogen. And on the y-axis, And on the y-axis, I'm showing you what is called sort of the composition of magnesium in proportion to iron. And these two chemical compositions are very important to actually study the Milky Way galaxy. And if you look at the sort of the ages of these stars as well, which are plotted using some colors, you see that at the very top of this figure, top left. Figure top left. This is where the sort of oldest stars come in. So, your Milky Way is supposed to have started as this sort of central concentration of old stars which had very little iron. Eventually, you've got some supernova of massive stars which provide a lot of magnesium and iron. You go to the right of this diagram, and then eventually a different type of supernova kicks in, which is a type 1a supernova that brings in a lot. That brings in a lot of iron into the picture and not so much magnesium. So, your diagram goes down. So, we can actually explain this first part of the structure, but explaining the second structure is very difficult, and I'll go into a little more detail of that. And so, this bimodal structure is actually a really important sort of question. Why do we get this bimodality in the Milky Way disk? Traditionally, people thought that this was kind of related to the thick and the thin disk of the galaxy. So, some people have already talked about the Milky Way galaxy structure. You have this sort of circular or sorry, spherical halo of stars. Then you have this sort of bulge at the center, and then you have the disk. And the disk is supposed to be separated into a thick component and a thin component. And this is quite related to this sort of biomarker. Quite related to this sort of bimodal structure, but it's not a one-to-one correspondence. And right now, people think that the chemistry is a better way to actually look at the bimodality of the disk. And there's the reason why this second part of the figure is so important is several different scenarios of formation of the Milky Way can explain this same diagram. So you could have like sort of the centrally concentrated. The centrally concentrated high alpha disk, as we call it, forming initially, then you could have had some fresh gas coming in from the outside, either from just gas that's outside or some merger. So you kind of go to the left and then you again go down in the figure with a second star formation burst. And then there's another scenario which is the sort of in situ or completely inside the Milky Way scenario where you have sort of Where you have sort of these tracks of evolution happening at different zones in the Milky Way, and then eventually they all mix up. And so you can get the same diagram through that. And so what I want to highlight here is that it's actually really important to know where the transition between the high and the low alpha disk happens. And most of the times, this is done manually. Actually, all of the times, this is done manually by drawing a line on the figure. A line on the figure. And where you draw the line actually makes a big difference in what statistics you're going to get on the populations. And so here I'm showing you the same diagram, but it's not color-coded by age. I'm just showing you sort of the marginal distributions. And here you can see that you see some bimodality in the magnesium chemical compositions. And so, what we did was that. And so, what we did was that essentially, if you were to take this diagram, take out sort of the marginal distributions, convert them to sort of uniform distributions. So, Radhu already explained sort of the statistical concepts behind this. This actually gives you a popula of the same structure, but here you actually see that there's a better separation between the two sequences. And we think that. We think that essentially the previous figure, we are not really just seeing the dependent structure on its own, but the dependent structure combined with the marginal distribution. And so the copula actually gives us a really good way to look at how these two variables are dependent on each other. And so what we did was we took this figure, we used some algorithm to kind of look at where the hills in this figure are or contours. Or contours in this figure are and split this automatically. And we essentially compare our split with a lot of sort of manual separations that are present in the literature. And this gives you an idea that this is actually something that's not very concrete. People use different splits in different work. And essentially, by using this copula, we were able to split the two. Scopula, we were able to split the two sequences, and the main takeaway of this work, this part of the work, was that we found that the high and the low alpha discs should have formed more or less sequentially, where the sort of high alpha discs formed early in the galaxy and the low alpha later, which suggests that the X situation, the external scenarios, are more likely. Now, the next thing that we did is that if we were to That if we were to combine ages as well within this framework, then take data from Gaia, which actually tells you about distances in the galaxy, and include another statistical method called elicitable maps. You can actually look at as a function of radius in the galaxy, what's the correlation between age and metallicity or the content of iron in your galaxy. Galaxy as a function of R here, as well as if you could look at it at different sort of heights in the Milky Way. So this is shown at z equals 0, but you could do it at different heights as well. And to give you an idea of what I mean by elicitable maps, so the concept is that let's say you have some statistical function t that takes some random variable y, you're going. You're going to some real space, then an elicitable map is essentially a map such that you have some score function s. You can think of this score function as a loss function. And if you minimize the expectation of your score, you should be able to get your statistical function. And to give you an example, if your statistical function was just the expectation of y, then we know that to get the expectation, We know that to get the expectation or the mean value, the score function is actually just the least squares or mean squared error. And so, if you were to minimize the expectation of the mean squared error, where x is this variable that you kind of minimize over, then you get the expectation of y, and this is very easy to derive. And so, this is a very simple example, but you can make this function quite complex. Function quite complex. And then, if you were to derive the score function for that, that would essentially be the same as sort of you have a neural network, you have some input, you have some output, you have some loss function. And if you know that loss function, you can get a statistical map of your input that you like. And this is even more powerful because of this concept of conditional elicitability. Conditional elicitability. The idea is that if you have this statistical function t and you know the score function, then not only can you get t of y, you can also get t of y given x, some conditional variable. All you have to do is instead of just x here, you have some function g of some random variable that's the conditional. And here g can be any flexible function. So you can kind of think of this as like a polynomial expansion. Like a polynomial expansion and just estimating the polynomial coefficients, or a more flexible approach is to use neural networks to kind of estimate this function that you want to get this conditional mapping. And this is exactly what we did. And the powerful approach here is that you can actually include the copula of your age and chemical compositions into the elicitable maps framework, and you can get an estimate. And you can get an estimate of correlation as a function of age, metallicity, conditional on R and C, as I talked about before. And this essentially gives you a continuous function instead of bind estimates that often people look at in astronomy. And here you're getting the correlation of age and metallicity as part of its copula by removing the marginal distribution. And this plot is quite important because it tells. But it is quite important because it tells you that towards the outer parts of the disk, you pretty much have very little correlation between your age and the metallicity or iron composition of your stars. And this means that there's some sort of evolution happening in the outer parts or the thinner disk of your galaxy that's removing that correlation. I won't go into the details of this, but the model that we think works for this sort of age metallicity. Sort of age-metallicity correlation is sort of radial migration or movement of stars across radii in the disk. And if you include that in your Milky Way model, your data seems to compare to the models better than if you didn't have any correlation at all. Sorry, if you didn't have any radial migration at all, as shown in this screen plot. And I quickly want to mention before I close that we've actually started. That we've actually started developing a package for this. There's lots of packages available for copulas, so we're kind of not reinventing the wheel but making it easier for astronomers to use. And so I used it for galactic astronomy, but I believe that copulas have a lot of sort of applications in other fields. And as Raidu talked about, sort of the I only looked at the static copulas, but dynamical copulas are also very But dynamical copulas are also very interesting to look at, where you look at the time evolution of the copula distribution. And similarly, I've developed packages for other work that I've done. So you can go to my GitHub if you want to use the sort of likelihood fee part as well as the time series analysis part. And in the future, I would like to sort of extend this work to different surveys to get sort of a very precise multi-dimensional map of the Milky Way. QA and eventually with LSST, I'll be extending not only to the disk but the bulge, bar, and halo, which the LSST will be even better at. And thank you.
