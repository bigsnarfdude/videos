Categories of the kinds of things that we've been talking about this week and will continue to talk about. All of my research is very interested in multi-scale feedbacks and self-organizing systems. And so today I'd like to put that in the context of humans as ecosystem engineers of the pathogen landscape. And I'll stop short of actually talking about some evolutionary models that respond to this, but it goes all the way from individual behaviors to population. From individual behaviors to behaviors at a population level to full ecologies and ecosystems, then to co-evolutionary systems. And I think all of us have been talking about essentially the mathematics of the same kinds of things. And so maybe what I'll do is suggest some broad categories of how we might think about the feedbacks that we've been discussing together. All right, so also I'd like to flip the acknowledgments up front. All of the work that I'll show you is with some incredibly talented That I'll show you is with some incredibly talented folks and has been funded by some very generous people. And so I'm going to talk to you about a lot of work that's been going on in the specific case study. But then when we get to the actual categories, then you can just blame me. So, okay. Some obvious things that we will all agree with before I get to some things people will nitpick. Humans impact our pathogen landscape in a zillion different ways, and many of them are very. Different ways, and many of them are very straightforward and boring and obvious. So, when we take antibiotics, we're providing selective pressure for antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections. When we develop vaccines, we are, of course, selecting for vaccine escape. When we call animal herds because of disease, we are, of course, selecting for either less virulent or less obvious strains in animal populations. When we have monoculture crop cultivation, we're selecting for things that can move very quickly. We're selecting for things that can move very quickly across the same genotype and survive well. So, we do all sorts of very straightforward things. But then, of course, we impact disease ecology in the capacity for outbreaks to occur in some ways that are just as straightforward, but less frequently discussed in a disease ecology landscape. So, not that they're not, there's some beautiful work on each of these, but it's less obvious and direct and less frequently put forward as the things humans. Put forward as the things humans do that change things. So, obviously, we have anthropogenic change on regional biodiversity, and there's been some lovely work linking diversity itself with the propensity for emergent novel infections. Of course, also, we endanger populations, and as populations get smaller, their ability to both evolve and withstand new pathogens changes. Conservation efforts to preserve smaller and more Smaller and more endangered populations themselves preserve wellsprings for infection, especially as the effective population size genetically gets smaller and they're more susceptible to the transmission of things that would otherwise, pathogens that would otherwise fare badly in a heterogeneous population. And of course, we transport things all over the place. We ourselves are hosts that move. We move animals as hosts. We move animals in incidental things that we're also moving. So transport and things. That we're also moving, so transport and things like ballast water and ships. And of course, we bring vectors with us everywhere just because we don't realize that a mosquito got caught in the cab of our car with us as we drove 300 miles. And then, of course, also we fragment landscape into metapopulations, which both alter the sustainability and dynamics of hosts, but also metapopulation dynamics of disease itself. So we impact all of these things sort of without thinking about it. And for the And for the examples in this talk, I'm going to focus on vector-borne infections. But the important thing, actually, for I think the context of the conversations in this meeting is going to be that this is a particular example of the types of feedbacks and mathematics to capture those feedbacks that humans have on the vector themselves, the disease that the vectors can carry, and then the environment around the success of those. Around the success of those vectors, the disease that they're vectoring, and humans as hosts as part of a natural ecosystem themselves. And so, yes, I will talk to you all about mosquitoes today for a long, long time, but this is not really meant to be just about mosquitoes, even though the details will hopefully be decidedly about mosquitoes. So, when humans alter the vector landscape, we're doing it in all of the same ways. So, climate change is changing habitat ranges. Changing habitat ranges. Accidental transportation is moving potential founders for novel populations and introducing disease in vectors to places where there might be the vector but not the pathogen to transmit yet. Built environment shifts habitats by both creating new habitat and also destroying or preventing existing habitat from being effective for the vector populations. And of course, we directly kill mosquitoes. We spray and kill adults. We spray and kill adults. We drop toxins into standing water to kill larvae. We try releasing sterile males in order to absorb mating opportunities. We try introducing competing bacteria and all sorts of wonderful things to interrupt the transmission cycles. We try and prevent biting either chemically or physically by wearing repellents or long-sleeved clothing. And of course, we try and prevent disease transmission from being bitten. Disease transmission from being bitten either prophylactically, chemically, or immunologically by vaccines. Some of these actually directly affect the mosquito population in intervention type ways, and the others are more incidental. And then, of course, vector control doesn't actually equate to infection control, even though sometimes language in public equates the two. So, I'll tie this very much concretely to an example of Zika virus in 2020. To an example of Zika virus in 2016, whereas this was novelly emerging across the globe, most of the conversation was about the fear of rare, severe results from infection, specifically with microcephalic babies. This is actually, first of all, rare relative to the incidence of infection, and also not necessarily best accomplished in control by controlling the vector population itself. But the public response. But the public response demanding vector-borne disease control was very much focused on vector control. And I'm going to highlight this throughout the talk, and I think it relates back to some things we talked about on Monday and Tuesday specifically about time scales and which things are coupled to which observability. The things that trigger public demand for controlling vectors are very rarely correctly tied to their. Correctly tied to their actual epidemiological risk. So, for example, again in Zika virus, media-driven fear about microcephaly in infants is actually temporally and spatially incorrect. So media was reporting things in other countries, which caused very appropriate consideration of what a good response would be where there weren't yet cases of Zika, but it wasn't yet there. And also, And also, temporarily completely incorrect because, in order to have a microcephalic baby as a result of Zika infection, you are frequently so many months removed from that infection that in temperate climates, at least, the mosquito populations have already crashed. So if you see things like what we saw with Zika, humans getting very upset and demanding that people do things about mosquitoes, when you start seeing the outcomes that they're scared of, they're actually demanding for control be enacted. Uh, control be enacted after there's a lot of risk, where when there really isn't anything that could transmit that risk to them, but they want action taken. Um, and so that's going to be a theme that I revisit, the sort of the when are when are which things observable and with what reliability? And how do people form those perceptions that lead to their demand for action? So, control also is rather complicated in a spatial landscape, and this sort of harkens back to some comments I think Mark made earlier. Comments I think Mark made earlier this week where vector control is frequently locally managed, and locally can be a municipality, it can be a state, it can be a province, it can be a region, and it can be a nation, but it's very unlikely to coordinate at the moment across those regions. And people, both people and mosquitoes move, although at different scales, and control efforts affect one's neighbors, leading to potential tragedy of the commons dynamics, where one place maybe spends a lot of money. Place maybe spends a lot of money on vector control, eliminates most of the infection risks, but then transmission occurs because of migration into or out of the patch. And therefore, that is less effective for them than it would have been had they been a patch in isolation. So there's the potential both to act synergistically and buoy each other's efforts up, but also to have those efforts compromised in ways that if we don't In ways that, if we don't try and understand them as a top-down approach, bottom-up approaches can lead to things like tragedy of the commons. And of course, we know from metapopulation dynamics and also really just from gut common sense, if we have four patches aligned just in a row and they each implement a pulsing control, this pattern will be very different from this. Hopefully, you can see my cursor. This, but hopefully, you can see my cursor. But the pattern on the left will be very different from the pattern on the right in terms of its effective control if migration is happening along that line. And then in these pictures, time is happening downwards. So, of course, also disease risk is not actually the only thing people worry about when it comes to vector control. People also worry about exposure to the pesticides that we use to control those vectors. They worry about human exposure. They worry about human exposure itself, both tratigenic and mutagenic. They worry about poison levels. They worry about unintended environmental consequences generally, writ large, and then very specifically, at least in the United States, there are large numbers of people who are very concerned, as they should be, about pollinators. And then there are some people who just don't like government coming in and doing anything as a broad brush to the places that they live, which means that we have a lot of people who refuse or campaign again. We have a lot of people who refuse or campaign against vector control at the same time, or well, sorry, not at the same time, in parallel to populations that are actively demanding vector control, mostly from public agencies. There is also the opportunity to intervene personally. That's gigantically ineffective as a population level of control for either vectors or disease. Having everybody go out and personally spray their lawn or tip over their bird bath or wear repair. Over their bird bath, or where repellent is not the way to, as a population, control things like Zika virus. So, I'm going to build up to a full complexity scenario where I show you equations that capture both the demand for vector control and also environmental concern pushing back against that control. But along the way, we've done a bunch of studies of subsystems that have some of the concern or some of the environmental pushback. The environmental pushback, or humans are moving but not mosquitoes, or mosquitoes are moving but not humans. So, some flavor of whichever combination of these things you like are potentially in one of these papers. And if not, we've got a couple more in review. And if you have ideas for further things, I am always very, very happy to start a collaboration. So please reach out as you would like. We're going to talk today about a very simple model, mostly because I didn't want to waste time in the conversation. Mostly because I didn't want to waste time in the conversation with such a great group of thinkers in the details of any one set of equations. So, the equations are going to, I will show you the equations for a simple version. We're going to talk about that simple version captures a patch model where there's human movement, but I'll show you the version where mosquitoes stay put. It's going to be an SIR dynamic that's vectored. So, I think Ross McDonald type dynamics. We're going to have two life stages for mosquitoes, larval and adult, so that we can enact different types of control. So, that we can enact different types of control because it turns out that people are very differentially concerned about things that look like fogging versus things that are meant to settle in water. I could not tell you why, but many surveys tell us that totally different populations of people care about those two things. We're going to have demand for vector control driven separately by the number of cases reported, and we're going to be able to look at different scales. So, regionally within the patch, patch and Within the patch, patch and neighbors, or globally throughout the patch, approximating either local public health departments or local reporting, or something like national or international news media providing information about risks that may not reflect local conditions. Anina, you said just quickly, have you looked at all of things where the control is not for things that are vectoring things for humans, but maybe economic impacts? Economic impacts and things like that? Yes, so thank you so much. That's an excellent point. So we have, we're still looking then at vector-borne diseases, but then the outcomes that we care about for that control are purely economic. So I won't show that today, but yes, but in that case, we don't really care so much about numbers of cases, we care about economic impacts from those cases, which Which is just approximated by economic cost-benefit function from numbers of cases in each patch. So, for example, if you can't tolerate losing your entire herd, then that's a different function if you have to call. Does that make sense? Yeah, we can talk more at the end. I would enjoy that. Thank you. Okay, so we've got also control, separate demand. Um, control separate demand for control driven by out uh severe outcomes, which are, of course, temporarily further along in the progression of disease, um, and then reactionary objection to vector control for whatever reason of the two types. And for the case I'm going to, for all of the cases of results I'm going to show you today, we didn't actually set the functional form of that rejection to differentiate between larval control and adulticide, but we have the capacity and the model to do that. But we have the capacity in the model to do so. All right, so here are the equations, and you can ignore them if you prefer, because if because the things I just described are just exactly what these do. These are the simple version. Here are the ones for humans. So it's an SAR dynamic. And here, D does not mean death. We didn't actually allow people to die from this model. This is severe outcomes, including death, I guess. So whatever, like if you're scared of hospitalizations, if you're scared of deformed babies, if you're Of deformed babies, if you're scared of whichever outcome, actually, when we did some surveys for tick-borne illness, most people were really scared of developing an allergy to meat, which some of some tick-borne illnesses cause. So pick your favorite thing that you think of as a severe outcome that only a portion of the population develops from infection, and that's your D category here. This did have births and natural deaths, although the time scale on which we're looking shouldn't have. The time scale on which we're looking shouldn't affect much of this. But we decided since we might want to project into the future, we'd build it in. Other than that, it's just exactly as you might expect with some moving among individuals among the patches. For vectors, everything is also exactly as you'd expect. There's a little bit of trickiness because, of course, for vectors, carrying capacity is driven by larval habitat, not by adult habitat. Theoretically, you could have just clouds of mosquitoes. You could have just clouds of mosquitoes as your breathing area in any environment, and the mosquitoes wouldn't be bothered so long as they could still eat. But of course, there is in fact larval competition and density-dependent feedback for egg oviposition and development. So there's a slight weirdness in how the adult population changes the density of the larval population, which then caps the number of eggs that can be laid by the adult. But and the details are brushed under the rug for the purposes of this talk, other than me telling you that that's happening. But then larva mature at a particular rate, and then we enact larval control-related deaths. We did decide that our maturation, that our egg laying rate and maturation rate was just going to be approximated by how many eventually it closed as adults. So, larvae that had a natural death rate in the pond were never even counted as having been laid as eggs. Then, of course, adult susceptible mosquitoes can bite people and get the infection, and then they're infected mosquitoes. But the adults, of course, can be controlled by adulticide. And then we had our functions for control had both positive terms driven by the number of severe outcomes and the number of infections with separate impact on the demand for control as a scaling factor. And then there was also the pushback, negative. Pushback negative negative demand for control because of environmental concern. Which things trigger these change depending on model scenario. So, I'll walk you through a bunch of possible outcomes, and you'll see just how nuanced this system gets. And I think it's a lot of fun. So, please come play with me. All right, so here are some simulation results. These aren't analytic. Here's in the case where people move, mosquitoes don't move, patches coordinate by grid neighborhood. Patches coordinate by grid neighborhood if they're going to coordinate control at all. And in this, in the scenarios I'm about to show you, control rejection is set to zero. So epsilon is zero. So these are some results from exactly that scenario. Looking at patch-specific host population size for infection and looking at the number of transmission chains, so how many patches will something go through before it's controlled. Before it's controlled, proportion of time with infected vectors, and the time until the first infected vector arrives in the patch if that wasn't where we introduced the disease. And this is across different levels of commuting. Now, for this, this is a grid. Right now, I'm showing you answers from a grid. And the important thing is absolutely not the actual numbers. The important thing is sort of the gestalt behavior, looking at how, for example, when there's not a lot of commuting, this is a very gradual process. This is a very gradual process just because that's the metapopulation dynamic of the disease introduction. But now, if we move to a more real-world setup, so we took that model and instead of it being on a grid, what we did was put it in the commuting patterns of three different major cities. And now what we did was have demand for control triggered for different targeted areas. So there are four different cases. One, whenever disease. One, whenever disease shows up, and right now this is perfect detection. We'll go in a second to some cases that have imperfect detection. So you have to have some critical threshold of cases before any of them are likely to be detected. But right now, an incidence of disease shows up and we know what to do. We go in and do something. You can target just the individual patch itself, IND. You can target the single patch and all of its immediate neighbors in the network. You can target a radius, and that is by geography. And that is by geography rather than commuting connectivity. So, those networks that I showed you were essentially how easy it was to commute among the different neighborhoods in the cities. So, radius is geographic range as opposed to commuting range. And then just collaboratively, everybody, all in, everyone treats everything as soon as we know that there's a need. So, not surprisingly, the number of cases averted in the everyone go in and treat is always best. Always best. But we actually do see that because of the nature of humans moving and mosquitoes not, we do get some nuance in whether or not it's good to target a geographic radiance or a commuting distance depending on the topology of the city. So that's kind of fun. We also see that we get some interesting differences in just the patterns of infection over time across the entire city based on these differences. Across the entire city, based on these different scenarios. And again, these numbers are not meant to be an answer. Like seven is not the answer, in nothing that I do is seven ever the answer. So if I show you a thing that says here is a graph and the answer says seven, that's not the important thing. It will be that seven is less than 10 or that it's always seven and it's never anything but seven. So please also take these. So these are parametrized appropriately for Zika virus on the topology of these cities. And I still don't believe that. And I still don't believe that they are predicting the number seven. All right, now let's switch a little bit. Now, mosquitoes are allowed to move, but all people are everywhere. So instead of thinking of a city, think of this now like a city block or a building where mosquitoes may actually have very narrow ranges. There are some mosquitoes that vector disease that really never travel more than 500 or 600 meters, but people are sort of going to the store and coming home. So this is really your local. So, this is really your local neighborhood. In this case, now we looked at what happens if we trigger control. Now, this is not about coordination yet. This is just what if we have just the patch in act control, but we're triggering it based on different surveillance scales. So either the entire landscape or just my patch. And then also within the entire landscape or just my patch, what if you change what you're looking for in surveillance from an For in surveillance from an infected human to oh, we're going to monitor mosquito populations, and we want there to be an ecological threshold for just here's how many mosquitoes there are, that's bound to be dangerous, let's get rid of some. And then instead, what happens if we see some infected mosquitoes? And then, what just happens if we just enact control on some day or some days in between this range, and we see some really different outcomes. And we see some really different outcomes in the percent reduction of human infections relative to doing nothing. And again, these numbers don't mean anything. The pattern means something. Similarly, we can look at what happens if we add costs to coordination. So this starts getting at some of the things I think Alan might have been asking about. So now it's not just do you control with your nearest neighbors because otherwise tragedy of the commons. Now it's it costs you money to do that or it costs you time to do that. Costs you time to do that. And you have a fixed budget to allocate for control and a fixed window in which to do it because obviously the infection is spreading in your patch. So we can have things like a high sensitivity threshold for triggering control or a low sensitivity threshold. But in both of those cases, we can impose time costs where you have to coordinate with your nearest neighbors in your grid or your network, going, are you about to do this? We should do this. I'm seeing a thing that triggers my control. That triggers my control, and you should control with me. Or you can do it as a resource cost. And then we're looking at no coordination, the patch itself, or nearest neighbor coordination only, or second nearest neighbors. None of these are global. And so I'm not going to linger on any of these results, not because I don't love them dearly, but because the point is the gestalt, not the answers. So here's some. So those were all subclass questions where we All subclass questions where we didn't yet have environmental pushback. Now we have environmentalists pushing back on control. And so this is a heat map of the fraction of recovered. So you can think of this as the final size of the outbreak. How many people ultimately got sick over the course of the outbreak as environmental concerns? So that's the pushback against. That's the epsilon term. How many people didn't like it when you sprayed for mosquitoes? And how many people did want you to spray for mosquitoes because they got scared as more people. Because they got scared as more people got sick. And you can see that this is clearly just a trade-off because, of course, it is. That's the nature of the control function that we had. But if we now look, shift this to peak size instead of total number of cases, if we look at how many people are ever sick at once, we actually get a little bit of a different picture in terms of severity. And if instead we start looking at the duration of the outbreak before it's controlled, again, we get a nice spread, but it's not quite symmetric about the axis. We are about the axis, which makes sense because we biased the demand function by having the double hit from the severe outcomes and the number of cases. But it's an interestingly nice nuanced system to study. Now, of course, also outbreak duration for vector-borne diseases is critically fun to study because in temperate climates, your outbreak may theoretically outlast your mosquito breeding season. And right now, this model. And right now, this model doesn't include that. So, right now, this model can go up to two years, and mosquitoes just keep pumping out more mosquitoes. There's no seasonal pause in oviposition. There's no overwintering. They just keep right on going. One of the things we're doing now is incorporating seasonality and the availability of new mosquitoes that can interrupt those outbreaks. All right, so now I want to, in the last few minutes of the talk, I want to step back away. Few minutes of the talk, I want to step back away from those models themselves. I want to use those as anchors for the conversation, but not really talk about the equations or their results. The moral for the story, the things that are really interesting in my mind about this are that vector control for infectious diseases is, in my mind, a really great example of one of the truly complex ways in which humans interact behaviorally with their environment, shaping the ecology, the environment. The ecology, the environmental viability of other species, the evolutionary potential. I didn't show you any of our evolutionary results because right now we've been building the co-evolutionary system separately without the feedback from the humans yet, but the intention is then to marry them. But truly, the evolutionary, the ecological and evolutionary systems, I think, are both really rich and strangely understudied. There aren't a lot of, there's a lot of things out there. lot of there's a lot of things out there about when people want to spray for disease for vector control in order to control disease there's not a lot building that into the epidemiological systems yet so we've been chipping away at it but we welcome uh hopefully collaboration but if you must competition um so so i think though it's quite a beautiful system for for both directions of human feedback um and then the most important thing from my mind on this is that it From my mind, on this is that it really highlights how misconceptions drive choices as much as rationally coupled behaviors. So, demand from risk from exposure five months ago because now there is a baby. Or I am worried because in Brazil, there is an outbreak going on right now during Brazil's summer, but I am in winter. And so I demand control early in spring because that's when it's most recent in my mind. And early in spring is not when. And early in spring is not when, ecologically, mosquitoes are most risky for an epidemiological transmission. So, I think it's really important to capture these misconceptions. Coupling that operates on these multiple and different spatial and temporal scales vastly complicates these outcomes, especially when the misconceptions are socially derived. So, in the models that I just showed you, all of these things are coupled in the All of these things are coupled in the sense that humans make decisions based on observing the environment, and then the environment reacts. So, in this case, the vector and disease environment, and then humans update what they are, then that affects how humans believe that they should reaffect the environment. But there's actually a third lobe to this in a lot of other work that I do that I'm not going to tell you about at all today, mostly because it's not tied directly to the environment, where humans themselves constantly. Humans themselves constitute part of the environment that then shifts their thinking. So, in the models presented, humans react to the state of reality. But so, here's the framework that I propose might help how we talk about these coupled human and environmental systems. We have just humans react to reality, and reality results from those reactions. And this is somewhere, so if these are me, these are only my paper, there's zillions of papers. These are only my paper. There's zillions of papers on this that I didn't do from brilliant people who are not working with me, and that's sad they should work with me. But the reason I'm putting these citations here is in case anyone would like to come work with me and wants to sanity check that they like how I think about these questions. Here are some recent papers from my lab on how I think about these questions. So, there is humans look at reality and then make choices that affect reality, and those reactions feed back in both directions. But then there's also Directions. But then there's also reality emerges as part of those reactions. I see things, and then together collaboratively, I work with others to figure out what a response should look like. And we only do that because we collaborate on our understanding of that reality. And we create that reality by our decisions. And then, lastly, understanding itself of reality is socially derived, where you stop and you ask your friends, what do you think? And the act of asking your And the act of asking your friends itself changes either perceived social norms, it changes your own behavior. So, Lou will speak about a paper where we did this for climate change actions tomorrow. But also, I've done this in the context of when you default on your mortgage in underwater real estate markets. I've done this in the context of cybersecurity with non-parametric anomaly detection. These are the ones that I think are the most fun, where essentially you look. Where essentially you look to your left and your right of your trusted friends, and you go, Are you scared of this yet? I'm not sure if I'm scared of this. And the act of asking that question changes whether or not people are scared of this. And then the local convergence on whether or not you're scared propagates out to determine your behavior, which then impacts whether or not you should be scared. And so that description is a lot of the things I've been doing on COVID this year. I got a COVID rapid to study exactly that coupling. COVID rapid to study exactly that coupling. And we're so not through all the questions. So if anyone is interested, I would love to talk with all of you more about that. I think I'm exactly at 35 minutes. So I will, this is my current lab. This is a shameless plug. This is a wonderful problem to have. I'm a little overfunded right now. I am in desperate need of at least two more postdocs. If you have a good student finishing who might be interested in any of this, it's 2021. It's 2021. They can telecommute from anywhere. I really need humans. If you've got people who need jobs, I'd love to hire some folks. But also, thank you all very much for your attention. And I'm very happy to have some questions. Thank you, Nina. We have several comments or questions from the chat. Alan, could you explain your first comment? Explain your first comment. So I was thinking of a non-human impact. So something like: so for here's a more or less real example that apple brown moth, which has serious economic impact, when it was first discovered, they could have sprayed insect pheromones and gotten rid of it. But people don't like those, even though they are completely harmless for humans. And it strikes me that a lot of what It strikes me that a lot of what you've done, the whole kind of structure, could be used to look at that kind of question. That would be wonderful. I'm less familiar with those systems, but I would love to hear more if you wouldn't mind taking a little bit more time to point me in some directions, maybe offline. I'd be really interested to do that. Thank you. And then I'll just throw out in terms of is that when he was working with me and then after that, Adam Lampert, we were interested in. After that, Adam Lampert, we were interested in this issue of control versus trying to get people to cooperate in control. Again, we were thinking of non-human issues more like ranchers and cheap grass or something like that. Thank you. Yeah, that all sounds fascinating and also well outside my wheelhouse. So I may just try and rope you into collaborating with me on it if you're interested. But at very least to point out. No, no, no, that sounds good, but let's let somebody else. Thank you. Okay. Okay, Luis, you have the comments or question? Okay, yo. So, Nina, you've probably done this, but I just brought up the issue of the differences in macroparasites compared to this. And I just don't remember whether you've published on that or not. Sorry. So, I actually have. I didn't show their faces because I didn't talk about their work together during this talk. To work together during this talk, but there's a wonderful group that was funded by the Mathematical Biosciences Institute initially and then by NIMBUS after, of just looking at self-organizing animal social systems in the face of macroparasitic infection and what these kinds of feedbacks do. And so we've published now, I think, three or four papers on that, but not as a human system. That is an animal social system. We've started the work on the human, on the We've started the work on the human systems, but we haven't published yet on that. It's coming, but none of these problems are solved. These are all complicated enough that if that's where your heart lies and you want to talk to us, we would like to build this out. Yeah, so do you see any real differences in the challenges with macroparasites where you actually have to account for the fact that rare individuals may have head? The fact that rare individuals may have heavy loads and other ones not, and most not. I mean, is it a really different mathematics too? It actually really is, partially also because reinfection with macroparasites can lead to saturation and collapse, especially if you're looking at macroparasites like soft-bodied ticks. Enough soft-bodied ticks can exanguinate a cow. I didn't know that until I started working on tick diseases, and that's not something anyone wants to see in life. But so I think it's less relevant for humans where we keep trying to groom ourselves of macroparasites and take chemicals that help us combat parasitic. But in animal populations, it's a hugely different dynamic because of that potential for superinfection really altering the susceptibility and propagation. Thanks. Eli, you have that two comments, please. Please, hey, great talk, Nina. Um, so my questions were: I was sort of thinking about the responses that people can engage in, and I couldn't tell if in the model, people sort of have this choice between trying to cooperate in control or leave, right? And so, the margins of decision-making here matter. Um, and so I was curious if you thought about that at all, and it just got me thinking about this notion of exit voice and loyalty. Notion of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is sort of this classic, right? You know, this book. But even more broadly, it's like the margins that people can make choices around can be really how that would play into systems like this. And the other thing is I really like your focus on misconceptions and information, but I think it's like you can be personal, you can have a misconception and still be personally, perfectly rational, right? Oh, yeah. Right. In the sense of it's just you have a bad information set. Oh, yeah. Um, oh, yeah, notice I didn't say anything about rationality the whole time in the talk. I don't know, it said it in the slide, and I was it's it said it in the slide, and that's what I was thinking about that. And um, I think that might be the chester. Yeah, I think, no, because I was thinking about some some work that we had done a few years ago looking at spraying for uh citrus pests and the notion of strategic complementarities and strategic substitutes of when and trying to and how those play out. And trying to and how those play out. And I was curious if you had thought about those sorts of things, formalize them in that your work in that way as well. Yes, so thank you. You're right. On the slide, I did have the misconception versus rational for the context, I think, of that study. But it's not written. So, in those categories of types of nuance, I don't mean to conflate those. But thank you. That's a very important point to make. I appreciate you drawing that out. Answering your question. Answering your first question for a second about sort of exit and loyalty, in the movement for all of the work that I described today, everybody has a home patch. Movement is all about sort of your daily meanderings, but you don't leave in the sense of avoiding disease. You're going home. You're not going, oh my God, there's Zika here. I'm going to move to Chicago. You may just, you may, and I didn't show this, but you may avoid going downtown for a little while. I didn't show those studies. But you won't avoid going, you can't, in these models, you can't avoid going home. So home doesn't shift. But thank you. Yes, that would be a very important part to add in if we were worried about, if we were asking those questions yet, that would be critically important. I agree with you. Basically, just yes, I agree with you. Okay, Mark, you have one question? Sure, yeah. Very much enjoyed the talk. I was thinking that a lot of your human interactions were at the level of individuals making choices. But there's quite a bit of effort on malaria and mosquito control, like Gates Foundation and other very large, and they're really coordinated efforts worldwide. And I don't know, I was just wondering whether. I don't know. I was just wondering whether what you're doing can be used in that context to look at different ways of interacting with communities so as to most effectively make changes. Because I think you've got it from the bottom up, but then there's this top down too. Thank you. Yeah, so we have done some studies on essentially the coordinate, which patterns of coordination on which types of topologies allow for most effective temporal patterns. For most effective temporal patterns and control, but we haven't incorporated the environmental concern and demand pushback in those. So I didn't talk about those in this talk because it didn't seem as relevant to this meeting. But absolutely. So both for vector-borne diseases, but also I've done some work on just pure direct transmission when you've got different patches that are able to enact either different levels of efficacy or different percentage cover. Percentage cover, mostly by economic limitation, but sometimes this year, crazily, just by what portion of your population is willing to do the thing. Looking at those patterns and when you can do strategic rollout to leverage that synergy in the best way. But of course, that is exactly, as you say, top-down. So we haven't built that as this sort of demand versus concern feedback. It really has just been: can we get Really has just been: can we get, can, and we have also, I should say, I very much enjoyed Chris's talk looking at machine learning versus dynamical systems. I think I can really benefit by looking at some of that. We've been very concerned about making real-time decisions as things change. And so not looking at a strict optimization problem on the timing of that rollout, but instead making it a fuzzy feed-forward loop where you evaluate something very cheap, make a good decision across the, like coordinate a good decision. Across the like, coordinate a good decision across everybody, then re-evaluate by looking again at that cheap thing, um, and then do it again. So, I think, I think I need to read some of Chris's work more carefully also and see, I was very excited by that yesterday, whenever that was. Well, time is time is nothing. Yeah, thanks. I think I need to read that too, and some of yours. Thanks. Okay, it's almost close to the end of the discussion time, but if you have one. If you have one, non-chat questions and nothing. In that case, I'll thank you, Nina, for a very nice talk and all discussions. Now, let's have a break of five minutes so that we will start 50, you know, sharp. Jung Ying Ma is a professor.
