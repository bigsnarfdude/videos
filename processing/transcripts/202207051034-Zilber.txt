Geometry through the eyes of model theory? Okay, thank you very much. Thanks for the invitation to speak. And yeah, I don't belong properly to arithmetic community and so I My plan is to give you some ideas about how model theory works interacting with mathematics. And so this part of logic or model theory is often called applied model theory. Model theory. But the matter of fact is that actually from day one, model theory was actually applied model theory. And what it's actually doing is developing a certain formalism, a certain language. A certain language in which to speak about mathematics and to analyze mathematical objects, mathematical structures. And in this capacity, it probably competes with category theory. And many of us believe that. Many of us believe that it has some advantages over category theory in being more flexible and so having more potential. So as you can see from this slide, so what is the project that I'm going to discuss? Going to discuss now. It is so we have been looking into the analytic notions. It's a little bit like this GA program, that you see the algebraic notions are very well formalized in logic languages and even Even usually in first-order language. But how to treat analytics theory is much more subtle matter and until rather recently it wasn't really much of the subject of investigation. And now we do this, and so the this and so the the most obvious object to look at is an analytic cover, say universal cover of complex algebraic variety. And it turned out that this attempt to find the right formalism And the case studies that we have done by now, they show that once you start doing this, you see a deep relation with arithmetic geometry and transcendental number theory. Today I'm only going to speak about the aspects that relate to these arithmetic issues. And just to say two words about the aspects of transcendental number theory, it is, well, in quite a similar way to what I'm going to talk today. I'm going to talk today, it leads to discussions around period conjectures in its really most general form. But I'm not going to talk about this today. Okay, so what picture do I see when talking about a covering space? So what we supposedly start here with we have a complex algebraic variety and then we also explicitly or not very explicitly but in fact we also see say its etal covers and all it And all it is covered by a well, in most cases we speak about universal cover, but it doesn't have to be universal cover, it's just a few properties that is being actually used in the theorem that will follow. Now, in this picture, when In this picture, when I speak about algebraic varieties, if algebraic varieties like here is part of my structure, I always mean that the algebraic variety comes with its Zariski topology. Well, which for me means that every Every Zariski closed subset of Cartesian power of each of the structure defined over the base field is part of my language. So I can actually have names for it and I can refer to each such algebraic curve or surface or whatever. Or surface, or whatever there is. And in particular, so here we have this morphisms. They all are part of the structure. But these guys that come from the top, they, of course, they are analytic maps. And I assume that it is in my In my structure, I have names for the maps and I can talk about them, but there is no, for example, any sort of representation of these maps as whatever power series or anything like this. However, even with this data, we can recover, of course, This sort of groups, well, I guess that would be called DEC groups that act on each algebraic level. And we can then lift it in some natural way. In some natural way to the covering sort. And so, this is actually the picture that the structures that I want to formalize. And my formalism will see it in this way. So, instead of this way so instead of structures over the instead of these varieties over the complex numbers now I have the same varieties but now over some abstract algebraically closed field K. And so my cover, so this K could be and normally And normally, it is what I assumed it to be can be larger than complex numbers. And so I should also think about sort of enlarging this covering space so that it fits with this new field K. And so then I'm So then I'm going to have more or less the same picture, well, hopefully, but with different data, and for example, because the field is an abstract field, I don't have complex topology. And so all the notions, for example, the ones that I needed to start talking about analytic maps, Analytic maps, they disappear. And also, if you of course look at it, to some people it could immediately remind sort of Grotendik ideas of how you could think about the et al. fundamental group and group and the this projective well the projective limit that gives you some sort of universal cover but it is not supposed to be both and and and gamma in fact is going to remain the same gamma so it is going to be So it is going to be a finely generated group acting on the top sort as you see in this picture and going down into this algebraic sorts. Yeah, so this is what we want. And now yeah, we can Yeah, we can say this in slightly different terms. So we have this above structure. So in this short form, I mean so we have this sort of lattice of these algebraic structures and so I want to present such Present such axioms for, or maybe some abstract description in some formal language that still is needed to be chosen. And in such a way that for every isomorphism type of K, we have We have a unique structure of the form that you saw in the picture in the previous slides. And this property of the description of a formal theory, so this description in model theoretic terms, we call it theory. And so we call such a theory categorical. Categorical, where, of course, the term categorical has nothing to do with category theory. And categorical here comes from very old meaning of it, that the description is very categorical in terms that it gives you a unique model. Right, so this is what we wanted, and then It and then we sort of started experimenting. And the first obvious case is when you look at the tower of the multiplicative groups of the complex numbers, this algebraic torsis, and the covering is given by exponentially. Is given by exponentiation. And so everything is very graphical about this. And some years ago, I have proved the theorem in positive that it is indeed can be, we can choose. Choose the language, and there is actually a natural description of this structure in some infinitary language. And it is very clear that we need to use infinitary language. And what I mean by infinitary, it means that a very particular thing, it means that It means that we are allowed to use countable conjunctions and countable disjunctions. Otherwise, it is just the usual... You apply usual quantifiers for each X, and then you say countably many, you list the countably many conditions that this X. Conditions that this X satisfies, and so on. But the natural theory, well, if you start thinking about this, you sort of immediately would suggest what should our theory tell us about the behavior of exponentially. So, for example, that it is a homomorphism and And basically, that's it. But the infinitary language is needed to also say that the kernel of exponentiation is isomorphic to the integers, the additive group of integers. And it is a very simple infinitary statement. Okay. However, the The proof really relied on quite a lot of facts. And anyway, it is not such a trivial thing. And in my model theoretic part, I made it with some gaps. And with my then student margin base, we fixed all the gaps and developed further. Gaps and developed further this technology. So, as you see, what the proof required is that there is a standard piece, although it required the further development of Shellac's classification theory for abstract elementary classes. So, it is next level from sort of Fiostod model theory that Shella fortunate. Shellach fortunately for this case developed. And it was also fortunate for his theory because it got a good support from practical people that did the abstract things that he was doing without any connection to any concrete algebra or analytic theory, that it turned out to be very useful. That it turned out to be very useful. And then there was a need for some Kumar theory and further things about Galois action on torsion points. Okay, right. Then the next thing that we looked at was very similar case, but now you have much more Much more cases inside. So it is the universal cover of an elliptic curve. And this also was done. But now in this case, we needed a bit more of this arithmetic theory. So we needed Kumer-Bashmakov theory on On action, well, yeah, corresponding to elliptic curves. And also, instead of Dedekind theorem, it was a series open image theorem for Galois action on torsion of elliptic curve. So you see, the arithmetic that was needed for it. it was harder for us to learn. Right. And obviously we also started to look at abelian varieties. And so it was proved that for abelian varieties similar things can be done. But now we need a Kuma Ribbit. The Kumar-Ribet-Larsen theory. And the problem remained that in the cases where serious open image theorem could be extended, could be generalized to abelian varieties. It could be the full theorem goes through. Otherwise, Go through. Otherwise, it is sort of partial result, which also makes sense, but again, this connection is quite clear here, that our dependence on these arithmetic facts is quite clear. Now, what is really important, the lesson that we learned from this, so Be learned from this. So, in each of the cases, and that's why I'm saying it is not one theorem, but a theorem that was proved in each of the cases. And so, the authors of this theorem, it's actually the names on the previous slides. Actually, the required arithmetic facts are not only sufficient, but they are also necessary, which means that The assumption that the natural theory is categorical, you can derive from these assumptions these arithmetic facts. So this derivation is not totally obvious. Actually, you have to play with this Schellas theory, which tells you, well, in fact, Well, in fact, by doing this derivation, you sort of visualize certain facts of model theory geometry. So, this the theory of categoricity and Developments, further developments into abstract elementary classes is actually very advanced theory which also has developed its own geometry, its own geometric notions. So it is not quite lines and say surfaces, although all the things they All the things they're present there in some way. But it is more based on the notions of combinatorial geometries, but the classical combinatorial geometries, like so like linear spaces, projective spaces, and geometries. Geometries, there is actually a very important combinatorial geometry that is associated with algebraically closed field. And it is so this sort of facts and the intuition behind this is an important part of the analysis. Okay, so currently, well, actually, we started this back in 2010 and by partial results. So we started looking into hyperbolic cases. And first of all, it is the cases when we The cases when we study Shimura curves. And so this is actually work in progress. And you can see in this slide why it is a difficult thing for us. A difficult thing for us. So, with Chris Doe, who is actually an expert in Shimura varieties, in Shimura theory, really. So I have been working for already two years and what so the work by Adam Harris in the beginning was meaning was it was a rather partial case of this what I mean that he simplified his task was to work under certain simplified data too much was fixed in in the structure and so a lot of gal A lot of Galois action wasn't visible here. And the full picture, it turned out that we need to learn this rich Shimura-Deleane Langland theory. So there is, of course, a monograph. A monograph by James Milne and so introduction to Shumura Varieties, where most of the facts are explained. But so in fact, you need to understand how the Shumura conjecture was proved and Lagland's conjecture on conjugation of Shumura varieties. Of course, in our case, for Of course, in our case, for curse only, we need only for curse it, but it's still quite rich and difficult theory. And on top of it, we also have to use series open image theorem for tuples of elliptic curves without complex multiplication. So it does work, and we have maybe 95%. Have maybe 95% of this written down. Okay, and now you see, I don't know, I'm not a model theorist, but I'm thinking about this categoricity stuff you keep talking about. So I'm wondering if there's, in this infinitary setup, is there some version of the Lippenheim-Skullm theorem that gives you a The Lippenheim-Skolem theorem that gives you a smaller, like you know, elementary substructure of actually smaller cardinality that's not categorical anymore, or something. I'm trying to understand why the categoricity is so important to you and what's going on there. Well, I think that I'm going to discuss this very soon, why categoricity is so important. But I'm afraid that. But I'm afraid that well, the the sound is not very good, so I have missed a good part of your question. The other part of my question is, is there some version of the Lewin-Rheim-Scholeng theorem that gives you a smaller, an elementary substructure that's not so large? I don't know. You know, you're talking about like complex numbers and stuff. I'm wondering, is there like a countable sub-model? I'm wondering, is there like a countable sub-model where you have this theory going on that somehow represents this universal cover? What is not so large? Anything smaller than the complex numbers. Well, you see, the problem here is to lift the notion of the properties of the the properties of uh uh analytic objects involved in this uh uh into into into you know into abstraction uh and it is you know if you look into initial picture you you only see uh some maps going down but in fact uh you know start you start using these maps and you get say projections get say projection you get inverse image of an algebraic variety then projection of it and you get quite complicated analytic and maybe more complicated than analytic subsets and you need to understand what becomes of them in abstract so so that's that's why it leads to That's why it leads to the questions about, yeah, well, I'm not sure that I'm answering your question, but well, I have to continue, sorry. Yeah, well, anyway, here is my question, maybe which partially could show you direction of where it goes. Where it goes. So the natural question here is: you know, why arithmetic geometry is involved in here and whether model theory can have any impact on arithmetic theory. Of course, we can borrow We can borrow whatever fact we learn from arithmetic geometry, but could we move in the opposite direction? That's the most interesting question, of course. And the second question is, you see, if in these examples, in these case studies that I showed in the previous slides, we detected this phenomenon. We detected this phenomenon of more and more involved objects, the covers of algebraic varieties, they have this property of categoricity, then, well, depending on these arithmetic facts, then how general this phenomenon can be. Phenomenon can be. So if we think about cases, well, general cases, then should we expect the same results? And what are the reasons for this? Can we be more precise about this, and so on? So, for example, we can look at Can look at universal cover of projective line minus three points, so classical object, and ask the same questions about categoricity. And so it's interesting what sort of arithmetic geometry will pop up in this setting. And so that's you know, that's. And that's what are good questions here, in my view. Okay, so the first question, right, so this interaction of model theory with arithmetic geometry, so we can start partly answering it with We is again proving this sort of theorem. So like in the previous cases, assumption of categoricity implies some arithmetic facts. But what are the arithmetic facts here? It is a certain amount of arithmetic facts that are okay. Okay, they are part of Langland's conjecture, but also some things outside Langlands conjecture. So, for example, Sarah's open image theorem for the curves, which of course is a known fact. Can you remind us what the language contextual conjugation of the neural currents is? Well, could you use some microphone or something? Could you use some microphone or something? Because there is echo that I cannot really hear your question. Yeah, sorry. I was asking whether you could remind us what the Langnett's conjecture of conjugation of Schmurricurves means. Oh, well, okay. So, in this case, you have In this case, you have not much, but you really need to understand the action of Gala group on special points. And along with it, also, in fact, you have part of it is how Galois Group Galois group acts on what becomes of GL2Q, the positive GL2Q. You see, so there is this Artin reciprocity law. So all these facts that is being used here, they come up and you really have You really have the sufficient and necessary list of this sort of conditions. Boris, so I think we want to know not just how you proved it, but so for instance, I don't know anything about Langland's conjecture. Could you very briefly summarize for me what it says about? What it says. All right. Yeah, well, you see, in fact, it is a long paper that formulates this conjecture. And so you see, I brought up the title of it. And what is interesting in this title. Well, Langlands actually wrote two papers, one published in 1974, which was a preliminary version of this, and one in 1979. One in 1979, and you see he put into the title this Ein Merchen, which of course means a fairy tale. So he sort of saw a big picture in okay, so this is what it is going, what it's about is It's a bound is so you have a Shimura variety, and by Shimura conjecture, it is always defined, there is a canonical model of every number field. Now you apply Galois to your number field and then your algebraic data moves somewhere, right? Moves somewhere, right? Your varieties, Shimora varieties, they move to a new position. But then what's happening to the cover? And he explains it in quite precise terms. And this formulation, yeah, this is really. Yeah, this is really tough stuff, and that's what causes our problems. So, for example, Baravoy and Milne and she, they have approved this conjecture in 83, actually four years after it was after 79, right? But but even But even in their proof, they spent several pages in explaining: okay, here is a simplified form of this conjecture, we have proved this, and the simplified form to explain it also takes quite a lot of time. So it is right. So some other people explain that the thinking behind this Behind this Languan's conjecture on conjugation of Shomura varieties, it is related to his main Languanes conjecture. So people always think about Shimura varieties as being a test case. As being a test case for the things that happen in the main Langons conjecture. And he suggested a very concrete form of this. Well, unfortunately, I cannot be more precise here because it is a long list of assumptions. But mainly it is about understanding what happens with understanding what happens with what happens with special points under Galois action. And it is over Bayes field. It is not over this the it is not a billion theory here. I mean not abelian groups, not a billion Gala groups, but slightly bigger groups. Bigger groups. Okay, sorry, I have to continue. And let us just, well, this is what I was intended to the level of exactness that I intended here. Yeah, because I just want to bring your spirit of the things that is happening. Now, I repeat again that you see here we actually the connection with this stuff is when you have a well-formulated natural theory. But to formulate this natural theory, there is some ideas, some ideas about model theoretic geometry. And so this idea sort of tells you there is a classification theory. This in general terms it's called geometric stability theory or classification theory more generally. And this classification suggests you certain forms that should be there and some others which shouldn't be. And also shouldn't be. And also, it is also kind of always if you prove categoricity, you well categoricity also implies in some sense large Galois orbits. In some sense. Well there is a notion of large Galois orbits in Pila-Wilki Zanyer's project. Will Kizanier program, which I'm going to say a few words at the end. But that's also somehow related to categoricity assumptions. So the natural theory should be visible if you have a right model theoretic vision. That's the idea. That's the idea. So now, okay, maybe I should maybe I should say more here. I think that, yeah. So actually, actually, what I'm supposed to finish the slides with. The slides with is that now you see if we if we are at the stage where we can speak about a very general form of whatever general form of categoricity conjecture. So, for example, the one that includes universal covers of projective curve minus. Of projective curve minus three points and whatever other examples you want to consider, then this sort of connection would tell you that certain arithmetic facts should be expected. So in this sense, the model theory thinking making Making conjectures in model theoretic setting, they in fact generate arithmetic conjectures of say of this level, of the level that I sort of wanted to give you some idea. Right, so now So now we are coming, I'm coming to the second question. And the second question was whether we should expect that there is a very general phenomena of categoricity that should be true for all smooth curves and all smooth complex algebraic varieties. Complex algebraic varieties. And yeah, and it's a rather recent result that the answer is yes, but yes, okay, I have to explain that it is not as powerful as answer really taxes. Answer really tough arithmetic questions. So, this theorem, but it tells us something. Okay, so what does it tell us? Is that so? If we start with a complex algebraic variety, and so we have again a picture like this, then we can always come to this formal picture. Formal picture like we wanted. And this formalism would be unique for each isomorphism type of K, there is a unique isomorphism type of this structure. So in terms of abstract elementary classes, so when we go So when we go through all the possible K, we get the class of all such covers and at each level of in each cardinality of this class, we have a unique model. And that's what we call categorical A categorical abstract elementary class. So we do indeed get a categoricity statement for an abstract elementary class. But so the first thing is that technically I can only prove this for curves and for the case of For the general case, it is working only for abstract K. Indeed, I can switch to abstract K, but this abstract K should be of this technical cardinality out of one. Well, this means really quite a lot, but the The reason why I cannot, it works for curves for one-dimensional case and doesn't work for high-dimensional cases, is completely model theory technology. So, this part of Shella's theory, as we developed it, Fuser, it works well in one-dimensional case. case and by some rather powerful new theorems, recent theorems. And this multi-dimensional case is still open. So it is just purely abstract model theoretic question. So how to prove it for general case. But in fact, In fact, you know, the theorem anyway says that we can work here with an abstract k of cardinality ale of one. Right, so the second yeah the second point here is that that That what we use here is the theory developed by Petr Zolstarchenka in an O-minimal setting. And maybe some of you have been aware that this O-minimal setting, so people who work in say So, this method of Pilo Wilkie is based, so it is all involved in this progress that Petersl Starchenka started with this analytic theory. And so, it is all development of o-minimality. And then there is a piece of this A piece of this technique that I developed with collaborators about generalizing the notion of analytic towards so-called analytic Zariski. So instead of doing Zariski topology, it is kind of topology that is based on certain nicely behaved analytic subsets. Right, so this is. Right, so this is the technique here. And right, yeah, so the important thing is that, yeah, maybe I more or less said this already, but so what is what what is the downside of this, I mean the this uh i mean the uh what what this theorem does not claim is that we do know the natural axiomatization of this categorical class. Okay, so we so the theorem proves that we always in such cases we always have a categorical class. But this theorem says almost nothing about Says almost nothing about the way that the class can be axiomatized. And we really want to have certain more or less explicit set of axions. And if we can guess this set of axions and if we can prove that these axioms, they exactly axiomatize this class, then a huge arithmetic consequence. Consequences will follow, which of course indicate that this is a very difficult task. And of course, I'm not claiming nothing like this. But the nice thing about the Ethereum is that it brings this categoricity framework close to this Pila-Wilki-Sanyer method, which is also Which is also important a part as far as underward conjecture and similar conjectures are concerned. And okay, this is what I said, have prepared in this slide. Right, and so the problem, as is clear, is that try and determine Try and determine the natural axiomatization of consecutive cover theories. Yeah, that's all. Thank you. Questions? And you might want to step toward the microphones. Yeah, if you start with a broken, is it? I can't say there is items. If you start with something defined over Q bar, say, like a variety over a countable field, can you define a model of what you're talking about that's countable? Or is there some apriori uncountability that's doing field? Well, for example, yeah, most of the well, all the examples, the base field is. The base field is, I mean, the field of definition of the main varieties is a number field. But the points, of course, they are points over algebraically closed field. And if your question is whether we can go down to Q bar, is that you? Yeah, my question roughly is: I think I haven't understood what the language is you're using or what the structure is. If there's something about The structure is if there's something about the actual complex numbers or uncountability that's built into what you're doing, or if it has a countable model somewhere hiding. I think I just thought part of this is my own extreme ignorance of what you're talking about. Yeah, it is important here that by Stani's theorem, you see when algebraically closed field of fixed characteristic Of fixed characteristic of large cardinalities, the isomorphism type completely depends on what its cardinality is, because it is the same as transcendence degree over Q bar. So for this matter, when you go down to small fields, Small fields, you still have quite a lot of information about what is happening there, but it is less geometric. And so, for example, in particular, the last theorem, this very general This very general statement doesn't have any meaning for Q bar. May I ask something relating to the last question? Yes. Can you hear me, Boris? You want to see it? No, no, I just want to ask something. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. I would also like to see you, but so. Like to see you, but so oh, yeah, that's a problem that I cannot show my face. But we can talk some other time when I learn what to do with my screen. So, I just wanted to ask the following. So, the point is concerning the last theorem you mentioned, yes? Yeah, I suppose that there is not a single model which is defined over a field of so maybe there. So, maybe there is nothing defined over Q bar, and not even anything defined over a finite transcendence degree of Q bar. Yeah, well, well, okay, so for curves, it actually it works quite well for maybe even for the next one. Maybe even uh uh f well uh for yeah well actually it is uh uh it I maybe I was too negative and for curves it probably uh a it probably works for q bar and uh even uh and and uh for finite transcendent degree uh yes so it you get uh You get some classification theories here. It is for curves. But it is because we know this abstract model theory, this abstract elementary classes are well understood in this one-dimensional case. But in general, the method of proof doesn't tell you anything. Uh-huh. Yeah. But concern, so maybe a related question. So, is there any functor reality in this? If you start with the morphins of varieties and you perform the construction, even maybe over uncountable and so on, fields, yes. If you perform the construction for you the morphism goes from x to y now yes, yes, yes, such a such a factoriality works, yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. That means, but that yeah, it is it works for the simple reason that you see if you if you have a Cartesian product of two varieties, that you can embed universal covers of each of them into the product of universal covers, and so you will get the similar picture. But it is you're right that there are some problems with it. Okay, so you see when, for example, we take upper half plane and we take the square We take the square of the upper half plane. So the square of upper half plane could be some covering space of something quite interesting, not just the product of two curves. And we cannot recover what this is. What the square, well, what H square is in this more general framework from understanding about the product of two curves. I hope that I explained myself, but yeah, so there are some interesting serious issues here. A last question, really, really the last not. Really, really the last. Not even for curves, you cannot say what is the axiomatic, you do not have any axiomatic? No, no, no, it is well, it is, you know, in model theory terms, it is projective, it is like projective elementary class. So, in fact, you define it in this way. So, you define some Some object is sitting inside or minimal expansion of reals. So, for example, you have reals with exponenti and partial trigonometric functions. And so, in this structure, you have the cover of the exponenti cover defined. So, your theory would So your theory would say that, okay, my object is sitting inside this o-minimal structure. And then I forget about this o-minimal structure. And what remains of my object is what is of interest to me. So you cannot define your object. When you explain your object in this way, you cannot You cannot define your object in its own terms. You define it using the reals. So it is just too much information to have any arithmetic meaning because reals, they are not stable and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. They don't have Galois automorphisms and so on. Okay, thank you. But we should discuss more about this in this audience. Yeah. Yeah, it would be a pleasure. Okay, thank you. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. Thank you.
