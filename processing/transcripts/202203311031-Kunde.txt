For the introduction and in general, for the invitation, for this great event. It's great to be at this place and this very nice workshop. And yeah, so my talk will actually consist of two parts. In the first part, I want to kind of try to give an explanation how to extend this anti-classification result that we have seen in abstract ergodic theory. So, for isomorphism as well as for Caputani equivalence, how one can extend. How one can extend that to the setting of C infinity diffeomorphisms and real analytic diffeomorphisms. So that will be the first part of the talk and in the second part of the talk I want to outline a recent application of the approximation by conjugation method in the setting of anti-classification results for circle diffeomorphisms up to diffeomorphisms up to smooth conjugates. So yeah, the common theme of both parts will be the approximation by a conjugation method, also known as a nozzov-Katok method. And I will also present that method in some detail and mention some other applications of it. Okay, so let's start with that first part on anti-classification results in Anti-classification results in smooth ergodic theory. And we have already seen this kind of slide here, or this kind of picture from Neumann's foundational paper of ergodic theory with Matt Storr. And so within that paper, he introduces ergodic theory to the medical community, and he also mentions another Another important question here, or he actually states it as a conjecture, which here so that presumably you can find to every general measure-preserving transformation an isomorphic one which is continuous or even continuously differentiable or even a mechanic. Or even a mechanical one, so coming from a physical system. And then there is this footnote that the author hopes to give a proof of this fact very soon. But in fact, the problem is still open, at least in the formulation that we use nowadays. So now von Neumann was famous for his ability to memorize fashions. Ability to memorize facts and things. So, there was the legend has it that he was even able to memorize the telephone book of New York City and entertain guests at his house, but they asked a random page of the telephone book and he would tell them the names and telephone numbers. So, it's unlikely that he forgot about this comment here. So, it seems to be a very serious or tough problem. And according to Okay, maybe I'll go with this one here. Well, it's not working at all. Um so according to Anatoly Katok, it's one of the five most resistant problems in dynamics, namely the so-called smooth reduction. maybe the so-called smooth realization problem. So are there smooth versions to the objects and concepts of abstract ergodic theory? So where a smooth version we understand a C infinity diffeomorphism of a compact manifold that preserves a smooth measure, which is equivalent to the volume element on the manifold. And this diffeomorphism should be measure isomorphic to a given To a given measure-preserving transformation. So that is the kind of smooth version of your abstract measure-preserving transformation. And kind of to the smooth realization problem, there are two main sub-questions that, okay, in general, you can ask about the existence of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms with specific agodic. Egodic topological spectral properties. And the second question is: okay, are there ergodic properties that are imposed upon the dynamical system by the fact that the system is smooth? So these are kind of the two main subcreations of this very general smooth realization problem. And to that smooth realization problem, there is a very Is a very short list of known restrictions. So, by Kushni-Renkel, you know that the measure of periodic entropy has to be finite, of a smooth diffeomorphism on a compact manifold. And then there are restrictions in lower dimensions. So, if you are on a circle, then any diffeomorphism with an Any diffeomorphism with an invariant smooth measure has to be conjugate to the rotation. The conjugation comes from the density of your smooth measure. And in dimension two, you have that weakly mixing diffeomorphisms of positive measure entropy are actually Bernoulli. So this part here is kind of, so in the spirit of this second question here. Of this second question here, namely, are there ergodic properties that are imposed upon a dynamical system by the fact that the system should be smooth? And here you get that out of a weak mixing property, you actually get something stronger, namely Benoulli, that it is really isomorphic to your Benoulli shift. So, out of a weak mixing property, you get a strongest one, let's say. And so, this by the fact. Let's say, and so this by the fact that the system is smooth. So, apart from these very few restrictions here, there are no other restrictions on the smooth realization problem. But on the other hand, there is no general realization result. Instead of that, it's kind of that we try to realize agonic properties on a case by case. On a case-by-case method. And the most powerful and most successful method in this direction is the method developed by Anosov and Katok that they used to construct actually the very first example of an ergodic C-infinity diffeomorphism of the disk. And we'll see later that this method has a lot of applications. And yeah, as I said, it's one of the. Yeah, as I said, it's one of the most powerful tools to construct diffeomorphisms with specific ergodic properties. So now we learned about these anti-classification results for measure-preserving transformations up to isomorphism, and now there would be a kind of a way to would have been a way to disprove the smooth realization problem, namely if it turns out that. Namely, if it turns out that isomorphism on diffeomorphisms is maybe Borel or yeah, so then you would have, then you would know that the collection of smooth ergodic diffeomorphism is really smaller than the collection of abstract ergodic measure transformations. But when you heard this morning, one can extend these anti-classification results to the setting of smooth Setting of smooth ifiomorphisms, and so we are in the setting of a compact finite-dimensional manifold, and the measure should be defined by a smooth volume element. Then, Forman and Weiss have extended the result from the measure-preserving transformation case to the setting of C-infinity diffeomorphisms of the manifold. So So that if you consider the measure isomorphism relation among pairs of area preserving smooth hybrid diffeomorphisms of the manifold, that that is a complete analytic set and hence not programmed. So for Neumann's classification problem for the isomorphism simulation is impossible even when restricting to smooth diffeomorphisms. Different models or something like that. And yeah, so we have seen that kind of the constructions for the isomorphism case as well as for Caputani equivalence, they were done by either symbolic systems or with this cutting and stacking mechanism. And obviously, cutting and stacking is not a smooth operation, so you have to work now to We have to work now to see how we can realize those things in the smooth category. So, and the systems that were constructed in Forman Rudolf-Weis' paper for the isomorphism relation or in the joint work with Mali's on Kakutani equivalence, those systems were so-called automator-based systems. Automator-based systems. So, where we still have the picture here, where you were either stacking here the towers on each other, or if you consider it from the viewpoint of symbolic systems, you were concatenating words. But you were not using any spaces in that sense. It was really just you concatenated the actual previous towers. That picture here, and in the symbolic system, you in the symbolic system you constructed your n plus 1 words by concatenating n words. So there were no additional symbols in between. Yes. Yes, good question. So uniquely readable just means that you kind of can't identify your n words within the n plus one. So you have a way to kind of divide your words into the words of the The words of the earlier stage. So it's unique way to read off the n words within the n plus 1 words. And yeah, so if you have such a symbolic system that is built by concatenating the Androids without any additional spacer symbols, then such a symbolic system will be called an automator-based system. Meta-based system, and in that picture with the cutting and stacking, that corresponds to cutting and stacking without any additional space and levels in between. So, and these automated base transformations are called that way because they have an automator transformation as a factor. So, you, okay, here is a picture of such an automator in the older cars, and this kind of automator allows you to Of automator allows you to read off your position within the levels of the words. So you kind of, okay, if we the different digits tell you, okay, what is the position of your n word within the n plus one word and then the position of the n plus one word within the n plus two word. So this is kind of the automator factor and it's kind of general, that a measure together. Kind of general that a measured preserving transformation has an automator factor if and only if it is isomorphic to such an automator-based symbolic system. So now that's actually an issue for perspective of smooth realization because it's still unknown if one can find the smooth realization of any system that has an automator factor. Factor. So, this is one of the open problems in this very nice survey paper by San Fayata and Anatoly Kator. And yeah, I have to say that more or less all the open problems in that survey paper are still open. So, and in particular, this one of finding a smoothization of the automator or adding machine that is still open. So everything now is a kind of problem. We cannot then take these transformations that we built within either the former Weiss paper or in the paper with Mali's. We cannot just take them and realize them smoothly and we are done. So that's not a direct way because we don't know how to realize any system with the automated effect. So okay, instead of that let's take a look at that method that At that method, that is a way how to construct C infinity diffeomorphisms with particular ergodic properties. And that is this approximation by congregation method, also short ADC method, and that works on any smooth, compact, connected manifold that has a circle action. This circle action should preserve a volume that I Should preserve a volume that I denote by. So for the talk, you can just think of the torus or the disk with the standard circle action that consists of the rotations in the one coordinate here, which is then kind of our as one direction within the manifold. And then the approximation by conjugation method works this way that you construct the C. That you construct a sequence of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms, and in each step of the construction, you update this number, this rational number I forn, that picks the kind of diffeomorphism within your circle action. And you update your conjugation map here, this is Hn, where the Hn are kind of built concerns. Yeah, consecutively by adding step N a new measure-preserving diffeomorphism, little H down here. And yeah, so if you then you want to do this construction and at the end you want to produce a limited homomorphism T that has some desired property. So kind of you pick an ergodic property that you want to construct, let's say. That you want to construct, let's say hypodicity itself or maybe weakly mixing, and then you express this property on a partition of your manifold, and then you try to approximate that property on these partitions with these maps Tn. And then at the end, you want to guarantee that the sequence of Tn's converges and that the limit. And that it's limited diffeomorphism as the property that you wanted to construct. And so, kind of a way to think of this is, okay, you really look at your manifold here and I represented it as the annulus as one times the unit interval. So we have here our S1 direction of the circle action, and then you And then you choose a partition of your space into rectangles. And maybe you think about first a combinatorial picture by permuting these rectangles. And afterwards, you say, okay, of course, if I permute these rectangles, this won't be smooth, but then, okay, I have some area that I use for smoothing this map. So I then realize this permutation of rectangles. This permutation of rectangles as an area preserving diffeomorphism, and that should give me my new conutation. And so we can kind of keep this kind of partition in mind. And depending on the property that you want to construct, you have to think of, okay, what is the combinatorial picture for my conjugation map that I need here? So if you want to get ergodicity, then you have to know. Then you have to make sure that things here within one row that they get distributed all over the manifold so that you kind of, okay, you should equidistribute it in height so that you meet each of the, let's say, 1 over Sn domains here, that you meet them with the same frequency. Okay, so this is the general scheme of So the general scheme of this method works that way, that okay, at the beginning you can just choose an arbitrary rational number and then pick the corresponding diffeomorphism from the circle action. And then we describe the step n plus 1 of the construction. Then we update, so we have to update our alpha n and we have to define or construct. define or construct the new conjugation map little hm plus 1. So these are our tasks for step m plus 1 of the inductive construction of our ADC diffirm models. So then this kind of updated alpha m plus 1 will be a small deviation of this previous number alpha. We have here two parameters ln and k. Two parameters, ln and kn that we will later use. So, on the one hand, approximate the property that we construct in a certain position, and the other parameter we will use to guarantee convergence of the sequence of diffeomorphisms to a limit diffeomorphism. So, you construct a new conjugation map with a parameter kn in such a way that our way that our map dm plus one imitates a property that you want to construct with a certain precision. And at the same point of time you want to make sure you require that the new conjugation that Hm plus 1 commutes with the old S alpha n, so the circle action to the previous number alpha n. So like in this picture. So like in this picture here, we have kind of this fundamental domain of size 1 over qn, and we have the rectangles here of with 1 over kn qn. So we will permute these small rectangles by the complementary picture that you need to produce whatever property you want to get. And now this kind of commutation relation requires Relation requires you to basically do the same thing in all the other 1 over Qn domains. Okay, so you use parameter Kn to kind of fulfill the combinatorial nature with a specific required precision. And then you choose a second parameter, ln, large enough to guarantee closeness of your map tm plus 1 to the previous map. One to the previous map Tn, such that kind of the sequence of Tn's will be a Cauchy sequence and hence will converge to a limit diffeomorphism T. And at this stage, one exploits this commutation relation. Namely, if we write down, okay, what is our Tm plus 1? Okay, that was defined that way, where our conjugation map Hm plus 1 of the Of the old conjugation map and the new conjugation map, little hm plus 1. We have just done the same thing here for the inverse on the right hand side. And here we decomposed our alpha m plus 1 into the old alpha n and it's the small deviation. So now here we exploit that hm plus 1 and s alpha n that they commute. They commute. So, this is the step from here to here. And now we have this part colored in red, where you still have this parameter ln to kind of make this red part close to the identity. So, if I choose the ln large enough, then this red part will be close to the identity. So, my expression here will be close to this map here, and this was exactly Tm. This was exactly Tn. So by choosing the LN to grow sufficiently fast, I can guarantee that the sequence of diffeomorphisms Tn will be a Cauchy sequence and hence will converge to a limit diffeomorphism. If you have done everything in the correct way, you found a good partition in nice criterion for the property, then you should get the limit diffeomorphism with the property that you wanted to. Property that you wanted to construct. Of course, these things are hard work, very technical, so it's not for free. And as you see, I mean there are a lot of parameters involved, and so it's always, yeah, it's hard work to realize then these agodic properties within C infinity diffeomorphisms. And yeah, so I listed a couple of results coming from Results coming from different areas of applications of this, of the approximation by conjugation method, but I mean, this is very just a very short selection, because I recently checked, and there are more than 100 citations on mass skylights. So, I mean, it's a very method that is used in very different directions of ergodic theory to realize things smoothly. Yeah, but so here, kind of. Yeah, but so here I chose a couple of things to show the different areas of application. So on the one hand you can really realize transformations, and I call it here as non-standard smooth relations. So you look at a circle action and you can realize it on any other manifold. So you can find arbitrary compact manifold of dimension. Compact manifold of dimension at least two admitting a circle action, you can find an ergodic diffeomorphism that is measure theoretically isomorphic to the circle action. That's now it's kind of non-standard smooth realization because you found its realization on a different space, let's say. It's not a standard space. You would expect a circular rotation to live on. That's why it's non-standard rotation. Then you can use it to Then you can use it to find these kind of more exotic examples of, let's say, minimal diffeomorphisms that are not uniquely ergodic kind of thing. And similarly, you can construct further ergodic topics like weekly mixing. So that was already, weekly mixing itself was already done in the original Andros of Katorg paper, but in this paper by Fayat and Sabritina. So, you could even then control the rotation number on the boundary. So, you could show that, okay, for any different Neo-Wheel rotation number, you can find a weakly mixing diffeomorphism of the disk that has that New Veil rotation number on the boundary. That is kind of a striking dichotomy because you know that for diorphantine rotation number, there cannot be a dichotic diffimorphism of statistics. So, this method really explains. Exploits the whole realm of possibilities here. And we will actually, in the later application, we will use this so-called quantitative version of the ABC method that Fayat and Sablikina developed in that work. And yeah, so then this last bullet point here, it's kind of to show that you can even realize things then with exotic behavior for the differential. Behavior for the differential. So it's not just that the diffeomorphism itself is ergodic, but also its differential can be made to have ergodic properties. Okay, so now we want to emphasize kind of applications of this approximation by conjugation method in the setting or setup of anti-classification results. And for that, we start by symbolic. By symbolic representation of those approximation by conjugation diffeomorphisms. And we form an advice that I developed. And that is for so-called untwisted ABC diffeomorphism variables. Untwisted refers to that, okay, this combinatorial picture that I showed you, just to show you again here, that Show you again here that your kind of comedaturics just happens really within these 1 over Qn fundamental domain. So if you're sending rectangles of this fundamental domains to rectangles within this domain, then you call the construction untwisted. While if you want to construct something like weak mixing, you also have to make sure that things that live here are sent around in the horizontal tube. In the horizontal direction. So those would be twisted approximation by congregation constructions. But here for the anti-classification results, we can use the untwisted constructions. So and our kind of so-called circular coefficients will be exactly these parameters kn and ln that I introduced when presenting. Introduced when presenting the approximation by conjugation method. So these are your two parameters where we use the Kn to fulfill the property with a desired precision and we use the parameter ln to guarantee convergence of the map to a limit difficult. And then, yeah, now it's gonna be sh shocking slide, uh shocking formula that shoots. Well it's very hard to digest at the first glance, maybe also at the second glance, but at the third glance it might be not so surprising anymore. So what is going on here? So we want to find a symbolic representation of these Anosov-Katok diffeomorphisms. And when we look at this picture here, so what would we do? We keep in mind that, okay, we have some kind of symbolic system that is given to us. Symbolic system that is given to us by the common Rudolfweis work or by the work with Malis. So you kind of would put your combinatorial data within a row. So you say, okay, this is concatenation of words. So this is W0, W1, up to Wk and minus 1. So these are the concatenation of your N words that I put here in my row. In my role. Okay, then we think, okay, that is just this concatenation. But when we look at the these are lots of catoctive homomorphisms, I mean here you have this alpha n plus 1, which is very, very close to alpha n. So when I look at these rotations here in the center, for a very long time I basically just rotate by alpha n. I mean it takes a long time until I see some. Time until I see some kind of impact coming from this small deviation. So for a long time, I will basically follow the alpha n rotation until I kind of ln bounce. Then I see here a deviation of 1 over kn qn. So this is this, and I then kind of get myself. And I then kind of get my second word for the first time. And this kind of explains here why we have this repetition of this n-word here raised to approximately LN times. And now this kind of spacer symbols B and E here, they come from the fact that, okay, if you kind of, okay, you follow this combinatorics here, and now you kind of Here and now you kind of hit here the end of your 1 over qn domain. So now by our equivariance we know that the next one here will be again our word w0, so first n-word, but it is now at a different position. Looking at it here at its second entry. So now you have to make up for that and use this kind of spacer symbols to adjust. Space asymbols to adjust for the position within your image. So, this is a very kind of rough idea about how this kind of so-called circular operator shows up in the symbolic representation of the approximation by conjugation method. But no worries, it won't be on the x-ray at the end. So, you don't have to memorize this expression operator, but it's just a way to. Operator, but it's just a way to to code this um ABC diffeomorphism, the untwisted ABC diffeomorphisms. And then the symbolic systems that you get via this circular operator, they are called circular systems. And yeah, since these are the symbolic representations of your ABC diffeomorphisms, they are realizable as smooth As smooth diffeomorphism. So if we look at this nice picture that is from the former Weiss papers, kind of to give an overview, kind of, okay, we have this space of trees and the reduction from the forman Rudolph-Weis paper or from the paper with Marley's to automator-based systems. And on the other hand, here we have these circular systems. These circular systems that you can realize smoothly as diffeomorphisms. And now you have to make the connection between these automator-based systems to the circular systems. And there is a kind of functor between these two categories of the automator-based shifts and the circular systems. And it's basically really telling you that, okay, you do. Really, telling you that, okay, you take the combinatorics from the automated-based systems and plug it in into your circular operator, and that gives you then the circular system. And this functor then maps from the automator-based system to the circular system. And formatting why I showed, I mean this functor preserves. I mean this functor preserves a lot of dynamical properties. In particular, it preserves certain types of isomorphisms. So one can kind of use it to kind of extend the or map the isomorphisms between the automator-based systems to the isomorphisms between circular systems, which is certainly important for our anti-classification program. program. So where do you say certain types? Yeah, so it kind of so they are called synchronous or anti-synchronous isomorphism. So they should be too far off. So you kind of should be able to still see the automator factor in this isomorphism. So I mean it's phrased in the language of joining so that you have this the automatic The automator factor, that one is still visible for the isomorphisms. And correspondingly, in the circular system, you have this circular factor that comes from the circle rotation. Yeah, but as a kind of warning related to the Kakutani equivalent, as we heard before, this functor does not preserve Kakutani. So there will be. Kakutani. So there will be additional challenges in transferring the result for abstract measure-preserving transformations for Carcutan equivalents Tor to the smooth setting. But that's okay, let's look at this overview. So, okay, we have this automator-based systems that were, let's say, constructed in form and Rudolph-wise. Then you use a functor. Then you use a functor to get to the circular systems and since this functor preserves the types of isomorphisms that are used here, you kind of can extend this reduction to the circular systems. And yeah, those circular systems, these are the ones that can be realized as smooth diffeomorphisms. So at the end, you get a reduction from the trees to the C infinity diffeomorphism. And for tax. And for Kakutani equivalence, yeah, you cannot, I mean, you still use the same picture here, so you get automatic-based systems, you look at the corresponding circular systems, you realize them smoothly, but to make sure that this just get in Caputanic rule, if there is an infinite branch, you have to spend additional work. I mean, it's not for free or it does not come from the properties of the function. Come from the properties of the franker itself. But for the specific systems that we constructed here, logically the frankwork does preserve computer and show that there is no additional equivalence if you don't want to have one. Because that is typically the harder part, to exclude any kind of equivalence or isomorphisms if you don't want to have them. Only want to have them if the tree had an infinite branch. Tree had an infinite branch, so it's very challenging to exclude the existence of isomorphism or tan equivalents. And so for here, tan equivalents, we had to do that by hand again. So it didn't follow from the properties of the Feunker itself. Okay, and then another occasion, because it was also mentioned that in joint work with Schipper Panel G. In joint work with Schipper Panel G, we could extend that to real analytic diffeomorphisms of the torus. But in that setting, we just had to work here on this map R here, on this realization map. So could keep the rest of the picture, but then you had to show that all the circular systems could be realized as realitic deteomorphisms of the choice. And yeah, maybe I just maybe mention that so we kind of okay, how much time? Half an hour left. Okay, okay. Maybe I just say quickly that, okay, so we have a real analytic topology here, which kind of actually you go until 11.50. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Thank you. So you kind of, what we do is actually a bit more, because what we construct is a holomorphic map on a stripe around the real domain. So we look at these spaces where you, okay, for a different row, you look at these stripes, the complex domain where the imaginary part domain where the imaginary part has absolute value less than uh rule. And on this, yeah, you can define Gremlin norm and then look at the set of functions and I've fined a norm on this strip in the complex domain. And then the set of space here of reanalytic diffeomorphisms on this complex domain rows. Complex domain rows, so on this domain they will be holomorphic. This is a set of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, homotopic to the identity, where the lift satisfy that these coordinate functions here are in this space here. So, this is a realtic topology that we use and work with. And then the mad one we could show that the measure isomorphism relation is a complete analytic set. It's a complete analytic set and hence not more. So, for Neumann's classification problem, it's impossible even when restricting to real analytic diffeomorphisms of the torus. But let me emphasize that this is just working for the torus. So, our realization of this circular systems, we were only able to get it for the torus while in the C infinity category, Forman and Weiss got it for. Format NY has got it for the disk, the anvils, while real analytic category, it's not. We don't know how to realize, let's say, a reality, ergonomic, area-preserving, zero-entropy diffeomorphism of the disk. The methods don't work in that setting. They work in the setting of the torus, and now there also some reason works how to get realistic constructions on optimal. Constructions on odd dimensional spheres by Seyatin Kemtok and Sari. But for other spaces, we don't know how to extend the approximation by conjugation method to those spaces. And kind of, it's also you see it here that we actually will prove more, but that is because we don't know enough, let's say. So we have to construct things that. So we have to construct things that are actually holomorphic on this extended domain and complex plane to make sure that at the end our limit diffeomorphisms do not converge to something which is just C infinity. So we want to have real analytic and to guarantee that we actually construct one. Okay, so maybe this Okay, so maybe this is a good point for question to this first part on anti-classifications are the exclusive method identity. Yeah, you still can ask. Okay, so you want to get any classification within a set of trigonometry? Yeah, I would not, yeah, because there's a way how we get these kind of our real analytic maps that we construct. These are actually kind of called a block slide type of maps, which are kind of take step functions and approximate them. Go ahead. The answer is not. Go ahead. No, no. So it is a finite union of finite dimensional spaces. A couple union of finite dimensional spaces. But we have an influence relation on some of the influence. Yeah, but you can determine them by the invariant saying exactly which polynomial it is. Is that uh is that exist uh the system? This is still a little bit the function. I'm just possible to have finite dimensional factors with elements of this. Yeah, okay, so I am so I don't know how far this method can be extended together, but yeah, maybe to discuss that. Yeah, what's a setting? I don't know. I think that's for the list. The setting makes sense, but Other question on this first part? I mean, of course, we can also discuss that afterwards, but maybe let's move on to this anti-classification results for circle maps. So we do have a discussion set. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. So you can ask the question again, and you can give it a more basic answer. It's perfect for what the discussion session is supposed to be. So, yeah, let me go to the second part on anti-testification results for circuit maps. So, okay, we look at the unit circle, so the length 1, so we look at R mod Z, so we identify the endpoints 0 and 1. And as a map pi, we take the projection that maps x to its positive fractional part. And then we look at the collection of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle, or then here at the CK diffeomorphisms, still orientation-preserving. But we think for each number or for C infinity or for real analytic. And if we have some kind of non-integer value here, then that refers to the. Value here, then that refers to that the largest derivative has a beta Herder continuing property. Okay, and then we also use the notion of a lift of such an orientation preserving circle homeomorphism, which is just increasing function from the wheels to the wheels, such that under this projection map, that gives you the given circle home. The given circle homeomorphisms of all the circle by this circle. Okay, and then yeah, we want to consider the orientation-preserving circular methods. Ah, so that was the notion of the lift. Okay, yes, cool. Okay, and then we look at our the equivalence relation that we look at here is the orientation preserving topological. Preserving topological conjugacy, so where we conjugate by an orientation-preserving circle homeomorphism, and we denote this equivalence that way. And as we heard in other talks, it's kind of a smells program to classify the systems after topological conjugates. And one of the success stories of this program is actually the classification of Actually, the classification of circle homeomorphisms up to this topological conjugacy because there is a complete numerical invariant for irrational rotation numbers. Let me introduce these. So this is kind of was already indicated and mentioned in Antrim's talk. So there is the rotation number, so that, okay, for a circle homo first, homo. circle homeomorphism, you look at it at the lift of it and then you define this quantity here. And then you can show that this limit exists and is independent of your point x. And then if you look at its fractional part, then this is called the rotation number of our circle homeomorphism. Homeomorphism. So the next thing you have to check is that, okay, this value here does not depend on the choice of the list. You can check these properties and then you have this well-defined rotation number for circle homeomorphisms. And you can get the fractional part only. Just for convenience. And so you want it to be kind of independent of the. Kind of independent of the lift. And now, kind of if you take a different lift, then you had an integer value. Okay, then you can check that it is an invariant under topological conjugacy. So if you conjugate your circle homeomorphism, then you will get the same rotation number. So it is an invariant of topological contribution and Contribution and it's a question if it is a complete numerical in gap. And a very classical result by Concarré shows that: okay, if the circle diffeomorphism have an irrational rotation number and a dense orbit, then the circular homeomorphism is topologically conjugate to the rotation by its rotation number. So in this setting of error. So in this setting of irrational rotation number and a dense orbit, the rotation number is a complete numerical invariant. Okay, maybe it's not so nice to check for a dense orbit. So if you go to higher regularity, so if you let's look at a C2 orientation preserving diffeomorphism with an irrational rotation number, then F has a dense orbit and hence Orbit and hence, by Poincaré's result, it is topologically conjugate to the rotation. So a rotation number is a complete numerical invariant for, let's say, C2 diffingomorphisms up to topologically, topological conjugacy. Okay, that's nice. Now you can ask: okay, are there complete numerical invariants for orientation? For orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle up to conjugation by orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. So, we want to conjugate by things of higher regularity. And yeah, there are some positive results which depend on the number theoretical properties of your rotation number. So, that's also a good opportunity to recall or review. Recall or review these notions of Nierville and Nielfantine that I was mentioning earlier. So, a number alpha is called Dielfantine of a specific type here, a specific class, if the precision of approximation is kind of bounded from below by this expression. So you cannot approximate your number alpha extremely well by rational. Extremely well by rational numbers, but it's kind of bounded from below. And a number alpha is called Diophantine if it is in one of these classes for some new at least here. And the complement of the there are often time numbers within the irrational numbers. These are the Liouville numbers. So an irrational number is called Liouville. I'm Russian number is called Liobil if it is not Alphonte. And translate that into a condition here. This is kind of saying that for every constant in every n, there are infinitely many pairs P and Q, such that you can approximate the alpha with a rational number in a very good way. So the Liouville numbers are those that can be approximated by rational numbers uh everyone. Okay, and then it's a design by Hermann showing that: okay, if we have a C infinity orientation preserving circle homeomorphism, the diffeomorphism, that has a diophantine rotation number, then F is C infinity conjugate to that uh rotation with this rotation number alpha. And the same holds true if you look at it reanalytic. True, if you look at a realytic diffeomorphism, then it is realitic conjugate to the rotation by its rotation number. So for this setting here, the rotation number is a complete numerical invariant for C-infinity conjugacy or real analytic conjugacy. And we look at the If you look at the CK diffeomorphisms, then it really depends on the alphantine type. It's kind of the optimal side here, it's kind of dependent on the regularity of the circuit diffeomorphism and the Offentee type, then you still get a smooth conjugacy. So, this condition here that k is at least mu plus 2 guarantees that this expression here Guarantees that this expression here can be made positive, so you still get a smooth conjugacy to your rotation by the rotation number. And yeah, but then there are of course also negative results. So that's what's by Arnold that kind of who produced the first example of even a real analytic circle homeomorphism. Circle homeomorphism such that it is conjugate to its rotation number by a non-differentiable home homomorphism. So, okay, here we see, okay, there is no hope, let's say, for that the rotation number is a complete numerical invariant for smooth conjugacy. And there are finer results of kind of you can produce conjugacies of an intermediate. Conjugacies of an intermediate regularity mentioned in that book by Hasselblad and Kartorkor present these examples where you find C infinity circular diffeomorphisms that are conjugate to a rational notation where the conjugacy is only singular. Or there are examples of a circular diffeomorphism F where this conjugacy is absolutely continuous but not Lipschitz. Be continuous, but not Lipschitz continuous. Or it is an example of a different morphism F where the conjugacy is CK but not CK plus 1. So you can find counterexamples in kind of on heavy levels of intermediate regularity. And yeah, an extension of this work where you can produce these examples kind of with a prescribed neo-will. Neo-Wevel rotation number. So, although you are prescribed Niobier rotation number, you can still find these examples of diffeomorphisms that only get conjugacy with one with kind of intermediate level. So I have a question now. Is P determined by S? Yes, yes, so this conjugacy is unique. Yes. Need, yes. Right, thanks. So, in the setting of if we have an irrational rotation number, then the conjugacy is unique. Okay. No, one has to check it, but it's a calculation, but no, no, it's maybe not obvious. No, no, from the definition, it's not clear at all, but do the calculation. But if you do the calculation, then you can show the uniqueness of this. Okay, so we see that the rotation number cannot be a complete numerical invariant for the smooth conjugacy or for any kind of smooth conjugacy here. But yeah, maybe there are other complete numerical invariants that we just haven't found yet. Found yet? But no, so the result is kind of that, okay, look at the collection of circle homeomorphisms with a kind of regularity d, where d could be any degree of regularity from Earler to C infinity. Then the statement is that there is no complete numerical invariant for C conjugacy of oriented controversy of orientation preserving C infinity diffeomorphisms of the silk. So whatever degree of regularity you like, maybe you're interested in Höder or in C1 or C2 or C infinity, then there cannot be a complete numerical invariant for this type of conjugacy, of orientation preserving C infinity differ morphism. Film offices. And the strategy of proof, or the idea of proof, is very well introduced in this conference and at this workup, is the idea of the reduction. So we look at the reduction for equivalence relations. So that here we have two equivalence relations E and F here. E and F here, and then the function F reduces the equivalence relation E to F if and only if you can decide on equivalence by looking at the image under this function f. So x1 and x2 are equivalent up to our equivalence relation E on x if and only if f of x1 is equivalent to f of x2. is equivalent to f of x2 under the equivalence relation f. And yeah, so then on the one hand we use this equality equivalence relation and on the other hand we have finally seen the equivalence relation E0 that defined on this sequences of zeros at once and yeah two such sequences are defined Sequences are defined equivalent if and only if there is an n such that after this n the entries of the sequence coincide. So that's what our equivalence relation you know. And the significance for theorem here is this fact that okay if E0 reduces to your equivalence relation. The your equivalence relation E, then E cannot have a complete numerical invariance. But yeah, talks and lectures. Okay, so now the goal is to kind of reduce E0 to our equivalent simulation of smooth conjugacy of the circle diffeomorphisms and kind of And kind of statement of that is this proposition here. So we look at the orientation preserving C infinity diffeomorphisms with a rotation number, alpha, let's say. This alpha should be a Liouville number. Then there is a continuous one-to-one map psi from our sequence space to this orientation preserved. To this orientation preserving C-infinity diffeomorphisms, such that for two sequences A and B, we have the following properties. So if there is an N such that A n and B n agree after this index N, then the two C infinity diffeomorphisms will be C infinity conjugate. But if there are infinitely many Entries of the sequences that do not agree with each other, then the two diffeomorphisms will not be hold conjugate. So, in other words, what we get is kind of, if we use our notion from descriptive set theory, that okay, if we look at the collection of circle homeomorphisms with a regularity d, where again d could be any degree of regularity. Could be any degree of variety from Höder to C infinity, then there is a continuous reduction from E0 to C conjugacy of our C infinity circuit differ models. Because I mean clearly this first condition here said that the two sequences A and B are equivalent with respect to zero, and then we get the best possible contribution that we are considering, namely a C infinity contraducy. Namely, a C-infinity contradicting. While if the two sequences are not equivalent up to E0, then we guarantee that they are not conjugate with respect to the lowest degree of regularity. So yeah, that way we can exclude the existence of complete numerical invariants for C conjugacy of orientation preserving C infinity. Preserving C infinity differ. Okay, let me. So now I have to tell you how to build this map psi from our sequences to the smooth circle diffeomorphisms. And yeah, it's already indicated. It will be done by this approximation by conjugation method. Let me use that one to construct our Construct our circle differ morphisms. So, okay, for sequence A, we want to construct this circle differomorphism T A via the ABC method. So here this A stands for the specific sequence that we are looking at in our counter space sequences from 0 and 1. And then it's a scheme of the analysis. Then it's a scheme of the Androsov-Katok method where we define the congregation maps and these congregation maps have to satisfy that they commute with the earlier rotation. And since we kind of, at the end, wanted to get stronger property that we have a prescribed new wheel rotation number, we will kind of be more careful in choosing the sequence. Choosing the sequence alpha n, so to get in the end that they converge to that prescribed Liouville rotation map. Okay, so the general idea for how to get these conjugation maps is: okay, we look at a map Hn here, which has a very large slope on this small part here. So, in this, you would use So, in this, you use this large slope in the end to exclude Holler continuity for your conjugation map. And so this map here is defined on the unit interval to unit interval. And then I take the Qn for Q lift, so that at the end, I mean, I get And so on. So that's always on this one over Qn domain here. So that is my Qn fold lift of this map here. And now how I choose my actual conjugation map in the Anossov-Kartog scheme is that depends on. Scheme is that depends on the entry of my sequence A at position n. So if this entry is 0, then I pick it like this, so this way. But if the entry is 1, then I take the inputs. And now, on the one hand, we know that, okay, the way how I built this conjugation map here, and the largest parameter involved would be that number Qn. number Qn, I can make an estimate on the norm of that conjugation map HAN here. And since this sequence of Qns will be freezing in a very fast way, this kind of will also then determine the norm of the whole congregation map large HAM. And then we can use that to kind of guarantee again the Of guarantee again the closeness of our map TAN to the previous one. So, okay, just edit this for completeness again. So, we write down the definition of this conjugation map and then here we add the identity, exploit the commutation relation of the New conjugation map with the previous rotation I for n. And okay, then notice that this is again our capital, our large HAN and now we use the chain rule, like an upper estimate on the norm of this integration here, and see that this will depend on Qn raised to some power. And at the same point, And at the same point of time, if we estimate the norm of the rotation, this is given by the distance of our two rotation numbers, alpha n plus 1 and alpha n. And now we also estimate this distance from above by the distance of alpha n to the given number alpha. And now exploiting that, alpha is a Liouville number. alpha is a viewable number, you can guarantee or you can make this expression here as small as you want it to get by choosing the Qn appropriate. So this is kind of what I call the quantitative version of the approximation by conjugation method that was introduced by Fayat and Sagritina and kind of allows us here to guarantee convergence of the sequence. Convergence of the sequence of circle diffeomorphisms within the space of diffeomorphism with prescribed given rotation number alpha. Okay, so now if we look at two such diffeomorphisms that we have constructed, so one of course belongs to the sequence A and one belongs to the sequence B. So on the one hand we have to check or Check or can guarantee that these conjugation maps here converge as homeomorphisms. Basically, because what's happening here is that the things that you introduce, they are kind of of that order 1 over qn. And if you choose the sequence of 1 over qn to grow sufficiently fast, which we have to do anyway to guarantee infinity convergence of the diffuse. Of the diffeomorphisms, then kind of okay, this will also guarantee you that these conjugation maps here will converge as homeomorphisms. But kind of now the question is if they converge as something with higher regularity. And now if the two sequences A and B are zero equivalent, then okay, by definition there is an N such that Definition: there is an n such that after that entry n, the two sequent entries always agree with each other. So, if I now look at my conjugation map, okay, so I basically write it down here again, so this is at that index capital N, and then up to N here, and same here for the inverse. And now, yeah, but if my two Yeah, but if my two sequence entries here agree all the time, then okay, the HBN is the same as HAN. So these two cancel. Similarly, the next one will cancel, the next pair will cancel, and so on. So at the end, you just keep this one here, and this is a C infinity different market. So if the two sequences A and B are zero equivalent, then the then the conjugation map will be C infinity diffeomorphism. While in the other case where these two sequences are not zero equivalent, then my kind of, of course we have to check that, have to do the calculations, but kind of the way how we chose this conjugation maps, the new conjugation maps here, they were exactly designed to destroy Holder destroy Holder continuity. So by our construction of the conjugation map we can avoid any convergence in any Holder space. So then we guarantee that if the two sequences A and B are not zero equivalent, then our conjugation map here won't be of hydro regularity and so they they won't be holder conjugate to each other. holder contributed to each other. And yeah, that's the outline of the ideas of proof for this idea. Thank you very much for your thank you. We have time for more discussion. Questions? I didn't get it. Are they dependent on the Yeah, so the slopes will be three to the power n or something like that. So they clearly depend on n, but not on the sequences besides. But of course, then within that picture here, where now, of course, when you kind of get maybe this one over current here, no, no, for the slopes it should be. No, no, for the slopes that should be this one. Since you have done, maybe you could talk more about the question why these conjugacies have to be removed. Yes, yes, yes. Or if not. Maybe it's not. The private conversation. Okay. Or we have a discussion this afternoon and tomorrow morning. Maybe say something about that would be useful. Yeah, but uniqueness is trivial because most maps have dense orbits must map to orbits. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. If you conjugate two maps that have dense orbits, you need to map an orbit to an orbit, and then there is only one distinction. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay, but you asked the question. So she just answered it. So oh. Yeah, so the question is, you have this equivalent relation in consideration. So you fix a regularity class and then you make two homework fixes the equivalent if they are conjugated using a homeo from this regularity class. As you said, this conjugation, this is a regular relation from signal, right? Yes, sir. Yeah, so in the theory. Let's go back to that slide more. Yeah, so exactly. You fix your degree of regularity between Herder and C infinity. And this is a collection that you use to conjugate exactly. And that is my kind of equivalence relation. It's a conjugacy by homeomorphism. Homeomorphisms with that specific regularity d here. So, since this conjugation function is unique, this suggests that the equivalence relation is Borel. And do you know what are the Borel classes of these equivalence relations? No, that is a very good question. So, I don't know. Yeah, so exactly. You want to go beyond the numeric invariance, so maybe kind of look at if you could use maybe the notion of turbulence here or the X. Yeah, but I'm not sure if it is. It doesn't suggest, right? It is Borel because it says section has one section. Well, it depends if It it depends it depends if these classes are published spaces, they are how because you have to say there exists a unique function in D. So this D has to be Borel or Polish. I guess they are in a topology, so it's it should be fine. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, so yeah, Yeah, I don't know enough about that I have to admit. No, I think that actually it's very complicated. So these are very non-close subspaces. It doesn't mean that they are not polished, but as a standard subspace, they are very non-close the classes. If you have a projection of a Borel set, and each section has only one element, it's using the same thing. Okay, but you still need Borelness of Borel here, Borel. Maybe not even polished, but at least you will need to show Borel of the class. But also this proof would it has no obvious just coming from uniqueness, like no, just a unique conjugating element. This does not give any estimates on the class. It's kind of I'll use questions to ask things. Oh, yeah, no, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It doesn't give you any clues. It doesn't any clue. So part of the game, there is always an invariant measure, it's unique, and the consumance with the precise rotation and the variant measure are in one-to-one correspondence. Now, there is a result by Salovskaya that says that this embedded measure is for generically of zero house of dimension. Meaning that this is essentially the same as saying that the conjuancy with the precedent rotation cannot be better than C0, so it cannot be Herder. Any rate of Herder will give you some half-life in the mission. But now you are trying to compare two different Two different guys, and the typical way of doing it is you go to the rotation and then you come back to the other guy. Now, the only thing you see you know is that it senses measure of zero house of dimension to a measure of zero house of dimension. You lose complete information. It's very hard to recover any information. Actually, still very. You just need to check as a real relation, I'm not saying. Yeah, so this C point we see on the whole maybe homomorphism space or whatever C is on the whole. So, okay. Is C a Polish or Polish or Board? You put C1, because for Helder, then it's not even Polish. C1 is polished, in fact, with a finer polish. Okay, so, and then the Yeah. Okay, so and then the equivalence relation according to C, uh ha being conjugate is like a closed relation, no? No, it took on pairs, on pairs. So like I No, no, because you go to the limit and the limit can stop being C1 consumate. That's exactly his construction, in a sense. So it's the consumers explode while the guys are convergent. Okay, okay, I see, I see. So the equivalence relation is. I see. So the equivalence relation is not necessarily closed. But I mean, it's not clear that it's not Borel, right? It's not clear, but it's neither clear that it is Borel. If you have a polished group action, go from X to Y in the same order as you need to fairly common situation, even okay. Yeah, so I guess a unique witness to being saying that the action is free, even though it's not an action. But the action is free. Okay, yeah, sorry about that. Or maybe you had the same confusion? I cannot hear most of the so this uniqueness is basically just saying if this were a group action, the uniqueness is saying that this group action is free, but that doesn't mean the only But that doesn't mean that the already constellation is in Pora or anything. Okay, yes, sorry. Thanks. Actually, I had a question about that. There seems to be a distinction. Are we saying that the conjugacy is always unique or only the examples produced by this APC construction again? It's always unique. So for a rational model of patients, but that's for the unique unique. Okay. Okay. Is this viewer act now? Is it I hope to do so soon. Yes, yes. But no, no, I should emphasize that fortunately there was a lot of work on this ABC for circuit different morphisms like what I mentioned, Hazelblad Katok and then Matsumoto, and so I And then Matsumoto, and so I could really build on those constructions here. And then it was a nice coincidence that Matt had this survey with an open problem on the smooth conjugacy for circle diffeomorphisms. And I was lucky to read it at the same good point of time and could make that connection. But so that the hard work for the two models. No, no, but the the hard work of the construction is uh or has already been done by Or has already been done by Matsumoto, let's say, or has a broadcast. So yeah, one could build on that. Thank you again. Well, is the strategy the the indeed is a very, very strong surprise, is that the centralizer amongst other measure labs measuring maps for the rotations is just the numbers.
