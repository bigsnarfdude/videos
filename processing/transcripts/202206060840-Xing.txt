I come from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. So my lab is interested in gene regulation at the level of RNA. And we combine computational tools and genomic methods to study RNA processing and modifications. And for my presentation today, I'm going to tell you about our work over the last few years of developing and utilizing deep learning models to study RNA spicing. Let me see if I can move this over. Oops. Now I'm going to. So, before I start, I would like to thank two talented graduate students, Zhu Jing Chen and Zhu Chenpeng from my group, who led this body of work over the last few years. So, my lab is interested in processing specifically this process called alternative spicing. So, spicing is the essential process in your character gene expression. And in this diagram, we're showing a very simple three-exon. Showing a very simple three-exon cartoon structure in which the second axon is alternatively spliced. So, through alternatively including and skipping this axon during RNA splicing, you can generate two different mRNA isoforms, which could code for two different proteins with divergent structure and functions. So we now know that this process is extremely prevalent in eukaryote cells. Almost all multilex on human genes are alternatively spliced, and this process plays a very important role. This process plays a very important role in gene regulation in both normal and also pathological conditions. And there's also many types of alternative spicing patterns, with the predominant pattern in human cells being this exonscaping types of alternative spicing, which in which you just alternatively include escape an exon from the final mRNA product. But there's also many other individual patterns, which if you have a large multi-exon gene, the combinatorial pattern. The combinatorial patterns of those individual spicing events could really diversify the transcriptome. So, one important mechanistic note about alternative spicing is that this process is controlled by complex regulations between cis elements on the precursor messenger RNA and also transacting protein and RNA factors that recognize those cis elements. So, on this diagram, if you look at this middle alternative axon, you can see that on the axon and See that on the axon and also in the surrounding intronic regions, there are a variety of cis elements that could be important for spicing regulation. With the most important element being the this GOAG dinucleotide, which is located just right at the boundaries of exons and introns. But then there's also many other intenser and silence elements within the exons surrounding introns, which could be recognized by transacting protein factors that recognize such elements. Recognize such elements. So, if you think about a single exon having different splicing patterns across different cell types, this is often driven by differential activity or expression of those protein factors that recognize those elements. So, I think this also is important for us to think about machine learning models for predating spicing, because if you think about the final spicing output of a particular gene, it reflects what you have in the precursor messenger RNA, as well as the availability of. As well as the availability of the protein factors that recognize those elements within a given tissue or cell type. So we now know that RNA sequencing has been a primary approach for studying alternative splicing. And so this is a very simple diagram in which you have RNA-seq data, you map them to the genome, you map them to the spice junctions that connects adjacent axons, the one with the middle intron spliced out. So with this kind of RNA-seq data, we can quantify isoform composition. Quantify isoform composition, we can also detect differential isoform usage between different cell states. So, this is one such example of using RNA sequencing to identify cell-specific transcript isoforms. And so, in this picture, I'm showing you two human prostate cancer cell lines with very different structure and morphology and functional properties. And if you compare these two cell lines, one is an epicelial cell line, one is a mesimal cell line. If you look at the genes on top, you can see that you have one exon. You can see that you have one exon, exon 13 of this gene, which is very highly expressed in epicilial cell lines, but is completely absent from a simple cell lines. So, this is a classical example of a cell type-specific switch in spicing. And a lot of times, when we conduct RNA sequencing experiments, we're interested in finding exons that switch across different biological conditions. One of the other things about using RNA sequencing to study splicing is that you are using the Spicing is that you're using the sequence accounts to estimate the ratio between different isoforms. So, in fact, when it comes to metrics for RNA splicing, the widely used metric in the community is called percent splicing or PSI. So, this represents, you know, for a given alternative exon, what percentage of the transcripts include this exon over all transcripts of this gene. So, this is a fractional number that goes from zero to 100%. And if I look 0 to 100%. And if I look at this very simple diagram, I have our 20 vaccine in the middle, and you have the same number of reads, one read matching to the axon inclusion and escaping junctions. So this gives me an estimate of 50%. So this sounds really simple. But at the same time, I need to point out that we're using count data to estimate ratio. So the confidence interval you have on that ratio estimate is very much dependent on how many reads you have. If you have just one count, you have a If you have just one count, you have 50%, but it's really unreliable. But the more reason you have on a particular event, the more reliable and certain you have about this sign estimate. And this is actually also a primary reason when people are thinking about how to design RNA sequencing experiments for RNA spicing studies. The typical recommendation is that you need to go much deeper than the traditional experiment for looking at gene expression, because if you don't go deep, you do not have enough. If you don't go deep, you do not have enough information to quantify isoform ratio. And in fact, this is just directly taken from a review article written by Arun Chinaya, you know, on Nature Reviews Genetics a number of years ago, in which the authors noted that if you want to do splicing analysis, you need much higher sequencing coverage, over 100 million pair-down reads per sample. And we know that a lot of those RNA sequencing studies do not have this kind of large coverage. Kind of large coverage. So, this, you know, and this is actually one of the reasons why, you know, over the last 10 years or so, there is a strong interest in the community of developing machine learning models for analyzing RNA spicing. I will say that starting with these two landmark papers from Brandon Free and Yusuf Barash, you know, on nature and science over the past decade. And so they came up with deep learning models, machine learning and deep learning models to predict. Learning models to predict exon spicing profiles and also exon inclusion levels or psi values in human tissues. And then this is actually a very active field. You know, Julian Geckner, you know, who is in person attending this workshop also did beautiful work with using machine learning models to study RNA spicing. And I would just say that in general, the typical setup of those studies is that you collect your exon set, you collect your measurement of exon spicing patterns. Measurement of exon splicing patterns, you derive features, you build a computational model to predict the splicing patterns, and then you use certain experimental approaches to validate your predictions. But at the beginning, I would say that most of those machine learning models were developed or trained on small data sets with a small number of tissues, a small number of biological conditions. But if you look at the availability of large-scale RNA sequencing data sets in the public domain, RNA sequencing data set in the public domain, we now really have massive RNA sequencing data that could give us the spicing profiles of human genes under a wide range of cell types, conditions, and perturbation situations. So here I'm just listing some of the larger data sets. So for example, ENCODE did a systematic knockdown of 250 RNA-binding proteins in two different human cell lines. So this gives you information about when you knock down regulators, how spicing programs. Lockdown regulators, how spicing profile changes. And also, you know, if you look at the genotype tissue expression genex project, we now have RNA sequencing measurements on almost over close to 20,000 personal transcriptomes. So those large data sets actually provides a lot of unique information for us to learn regulatory rules of spicing. And this was actually the initial motivation a few years ago for us to develop this framework called DARTS, which, you know, the full name is Deep Learning Arts. Know the full name is Deep Learning Augmented RNA-seq Analysis of Transcript Spicing. So, this work was already published, so I'm just going to go very quickly about the basic intuitions of this work before I talk about unpublished results. But what DARS tries to address is this common issue that people face that you have two conditions. You want to identify the ex-ons that switch between those two conditions. So, this is the diagram on the top right. And oftentimes, you generate Right. And oftentimes you generate RNA-sequent data that does not give you enough coverage. Or you have lowly expressed genes, you don't have enough information to actually confirm the splicing profiles. So what we wanted to do is to ask is, can we use a large amount of publicly available data from ENCODE Roadmap epigenomics to actually derive a knowledge base of spicing represented in the form of a deep learning model, which could be used to augment the spicing analysis? Be used to augment the splitting analysis of any user-specified data set. So, to address this issue, we actually came up with a framework that incorporates two components. One is a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework that allows you to test the differential splicing on any user-specified data set, either with an uninformative prior in which you're just using your RNA-seq data, or you can use an informative prior, which comes from your deep learning prediction. And the other component. And the other component, which I'm going to just expand on a little bit, is a deep neural network model, which essentially considers the sequence information and also the concentrations of RNA-binding proteins in your samples of interest and simply predict, given the concentrations of your regulator, as well as the sequence information of the particular exon, will this exon switch in this biological condition? And then essentially, we can treat that prediction as an informative priority. A informative prior to boost the analysis of any user-specified data set. And this is the DARS deep neural network. So we actually incorporated two types of features. The first type of features, basically the cis features for an alternative axon and its surrounding intronic sequences that considers conservation, sequence motifs, the strengths of spike size, but those are just the common features of RNA that would dictate RNA splicing patterns. Would dictate RNA splicing patterns. And another set of features that we incorporate into Darts is actually incorporated those trans-RBP features, which essentially tells us what are the abundance of important RNA-binding proteins that control splicing between two biological conditions. And in this case, since we are interested in doing a differential analysis, we essentially have 1500 RNA-binding proteins, each with measurement of overall abundance. You know, overall abundance in two different conditions. So we have about 3,000 features for those trans-RPP features. And we can just feed that into a fairly straightforward, you know, deep neural network architecture. There's nothing fancy about this. And so we can basically take in those features and make a prediction for whether any particular exon would change or not change, you know, given the concentrations of RNA-binding proteins in two different biological conditions. And to train this model, we actually use a variety of data sets to train this model. But initially, we used the ENCODE data set for RNA-binding protein perturbation. So, with ENCODE, the ENCODE investigators did RBP knockdown for about 200 RBPs in both cell lines, the K562 and HAPG2. And there's another set of about 58 RBPs, which are just only knocked down in one cell line. So, we took RBPs that are knocked down in both cell lines as our Knocked down in both cell lines as our training RBPs. And then we just entirely leave out those RBPs that are only knocked down in one cell line as the leave-out validation. So we did those training validation testing on the training RBPs, and then we also assessed the performance on those leave out RBPs. So this is just one snapshot of the training process. So you can say that we can achieve very good performance both on the testing, on the validation. On the testing on the validation and testing data set. And also, once we apply the trend model to those 58 RBPs that have never been seen during training, you can still see that the DARSG achieves a very good performance in comparison to a variety of baseline models that we train on those data sets. Some are just on small data sets. So overall, this shows that this kind of model that considers both these features and also the concentrations of Features and also the concentrations of RNA-binding proteins would allow us to predict differential spacing between two biological conditions. So, again, this is just a summary of what Darcy is doing. So, what we envision is that DARC is basically converting the big data in public domain about spicing regulation into a knowledge base in the form of deep learning model. And you can use that deep learning model to generate informative prior to boost your analysis. Prior to boost your analysis of SPICE in low-coverage analystic data sets, as well as for low-level express genes. And there is actually a wide range of experimental validation in this paper that demonstrate that this is a good approach. But for the rest of my talk, I'm just going to talk about what else can we do with this kind of idea or models. The one thing I want to just note is that here, Darcy is just doing this differential analysis. At the end of the day, it's just a prediction. At the end of the day, it's just predicting a two-class label of whether certain exons have changed or not changed between two biological conditions. This is useful, but this is not everything that we want for splicing analysis. So Ji Cheng Pen decided to take this step, you know, framework a step further. So in this unpublished work, he came up with this model called IDARTS with I indicating for individualized. So what this is doing is actually we're using a very similar model. Is that we're using a very similar model with both cis features and trans RBP features, but instead of training this on ENCODE and roadmap epigenomics data, now we're training this on massive amounts of GTAX data with personal genomes and also personal translators. So in fact, we trend, I think this is a trend on the GTAX V7 data with about 8,000 individuals. So we have about 1,000 cis features for exon skaping. These features for exonscaping again, about 1500 trans features for concentrations of RNA-binding proteins. And we have a deep neural network, one neural network with three hidden layers. And at the end of the day, the model makes a prediction for percent splicing. So now this becomes a quantitative prediction of exon splicing levels. And with this kind of framework, it also becomes very easy to actually take this one step. To take this one step further and predict a variant effects on splicing. All we need to do is to essentially plug in the cis sequence feature of any exon, and then we can mutate that from a reference allele to an alternative allele. And we can just predict the psi value before and after we introduce that mutation, the delta psi becomes a measurement for the variant effect on splicing. So, in the next few slides, I'm just going to show you the two different. Slides, I'm just going to show you the two different aspects of IDARS. The first thing I want to show you is that IDARS can accurately predict RNA spicing levels across diverse tissues and cell types. So on the left side, you have like, you know, a gradient. Well, this is kind of a density heat map that shows you all the data points in a five-fold cross-validation. So you can see that the x-axis is the RNA-seq measurements of psi-value, y-axis is the eye dot. Value y-axis is the I dot predicted psi values. So you can see that they line up very nicely on the diagonal. On the right, we are actually dissecting this into predictions for each individual tissue types and generating the R-square measurement for the predictions. So you can see that for the vast majority of tissues, we have, you know, actually for all tissues, we have good predictions. But for two brain tissues, like a cerebellum and cerebellum hemisphere, you know, you can see that the prediction accuracy is a little bit lower. Prediction accuracy is a little bit lower than the other tissues. And I think this is probably because they have, you know, those two tissues are very enriched for neuronal cell types. Maybe what we are doing is that we're not learning enough about the spatial regulation in those tissues. But in general, you can see very good prediction performance. The other thing we want to do is to just see how important is this cis transacting RBP features. Because in this case, remember that our prediction, we consider the exon sequence, we also. The exon sequence, we also plug in the concentrations of RNA binding proteins in a given tissue or cell type. So, then what we want to do is to figure out how important this trans-RBP feature is. So, what we did was that we basically made, you know, we use blood cells as the baseline. For all the other tissues, we basically made two different types of predictions. One is to plug in the RBP feature for the tissue of interest, another is to plug in the RBP feature for whole blood. RPP feature for whole blood. And then we can just check the difference in R-square. So you can see that almost for all those tissues plugging in, especially for neuronal cell types or for brain tissues, plugging in the relevant RBP concentration for that tissue of interest would improve your prediction accuracy. So this shows that those transacting RBP features is useful. This is just an example. On the left side is that you plug in the RBP features for brain tissues. Right side is the whole blood. Right side is the whole blood. And here we're just looking at only tissue-specific exons, exons whose spicing levels are known to be different between brain and also whole blood. So you can see that plugging in those trans-RBP features would improve prediction accuracy. So the last thing we want to do is to check how well this could be used to actually validate variance effects on RNA spicing. So to do that, we basically just need to introduce one classical experiment. Introduce one classical experiment called mini-gene splicing report assays. So, this is the classical experimental approach to test the variant effects on RNA splicing. So, if you for any exon of interest, you can clone this exon and the flank intronic sequence into a minigene, and then you can make mutations. And then you can measure the level of spicing of this minigene before after you make the mutation. This allows you to measure variant effects on spicing. So, this is an experimental framework. So, this experimental framework is not perfect, but it's a widely used technique and it's very useful. So, the first thing we did is that we just decided to compare IDARS with two other state-of-the-art tools. One is the Spanner from Brandon Frees group, and another is MT SPLICE, which was recently published by Julian Gagner's group. And also, we made IDARS predictions. And we did this on the large list of variants that were introduced into Exxon 7 of To SN7 of SMN1, SMN2, this is the causal gene associated with a very devastating genetic condition called spinal muscular atrophy. And you can see that in this case, if we look at the predicted delta side on the axis and also the RTPCR measured the delta psi on those mini genes on the y-axis, you can see that all three tools actually generate a good concordance with. Generate a good concordance with the experimental measurement. And I will say the one thing which is interesting is that almost all three tools under predict the data side value. And at this point, it's not entirely clear whether it's the deep learning tool under predicting things or if it's because the mini-gene experiment overestimating the data size because mini-gene only clones a small piece of exonic regions, intronic regions. So I think it could be a combination of both. But the take-home message is that those deep learning models. Is that those deep learning models could actually generate good predictions for variant effects on spicing? I'm running out of time, so I'm going to skip this slide, but this is just to show that one useful application of IDARS is that it can be used to actually prioritize a causal variant under genetically regulated spicing quantitative trait loci in the human transcriptome. Because oftentimes, you know, you do those genotype spicing association in larger populations, you identify genetic associations. You identify genetically associated spicing events. But because of the LD structure, you may have multiple SNPs that are in high association with your exon event of interest. And it's often very difficult to figure out which SNP is the causal variant. What we have shown here using both computational analysis and also experimental analysis is that IDARS has the ability to prioritize the causal variant responsible for those splicing pointing trait loci. But the last piece of it. Sign. The last piece of data I'm going to show you is that you can also use this approach for clinical variant interpretation. So, here we are, you know, taking a large list of variants that are annotated in this ClinVar database. Specifically, we started with those high-confidence benign pathogenic variants in ClinVar, and we group them into different categories based on where they are located at with respect to the spy site. And what we can show on this picture is that IDARS is. On this picture, is that IDARS is able to distinguish those pathogenic versus benign variants. So you can see that for pathogenic variants, IDARS tends to predict a much higher delta size compared to their benign variants counterpart located in the same genomic region. And then we can also take this approach a step further to make predictions on variants of almost significance. So those are the clinical variants that are identified in clinical sequencing projects, but clinicians do not have enough information. Clinicians do not have enough information about their functional importance. And this tends to be one of the biggest challenges in clinical genetics workflow. And what you can see is that about 40% of the pathogenic variants are predicted by IDARS as splicing disrupting, and the percentage is much lower for benign variants, which is only 2%. But for variants of certain significance, this is about 5% in between. So this shows that a significant fraction of those Those variants are unknown significance are probably spicing disrupting. So, I'm just going to last data slide. I'm going to show you that we actually took about 10 predicted spicing disrupting variants, and we just went back to the lab and did those minigene spicing reporter assays. In eight out of the 10 cases, we were able to confirm the variance effects of spicing using mini-gene spicing reporters. So, just to summarize, so I talked about spicing as an important. Spicing as an important alternative spicing as a prevalent mechanism for diversifying gene products. I talked about DARTS, which is a computational framework that we developed for predicting differential autonomous micing between biological conditions using both exon-specific sequence features and also sample-specific trans-RBP features. And then in unpublished work, we have developed IDARS, a computational framework to predict splicing levels as well as variance effects on splicing across human tissues. On spicing across human tissues, and we show that IDARS can prioritize genomic variants that causally impact spicing and also help interpret the variants of uncertain significance in clinical genetic studies. So, I just want to end my talk with some of the questions. So I think obviously, you know, I think work from many labs in this field have shown that you can use deep learning model to make good predictions on RNA patterns and also RNA spicing levels. But I think this is. But I think this is still a, you know, I think there are a lot of unsolved problems. One question, so I'm just posing a few questions. One is that are there additional features such as DNA and RNA modifications that could be incorporated to improve the accuracy of splicing predictions? And the second, which I think is a really hard one, which is how do we really translate predictions for splicing events to predictions on functional events? Because not every exon is equally important and not every gene is equally important. Just because a variant of Just because a variant affects spatial does not mean much in terms of whether the variant is doing something to gene function or cellular phenotypes. And I think the last point also is related, which is also a hard one. You just heard this great talk from Andrew about looking at the variant effects on transcriptional regulation and chromatin states. So everybody working on specific forms of gene regulation, if you have a set of variants, I'm going to make my predictions on certain aspects. Make my predictions on certain aspects of gene regulation. But you know, how what's the best strategy to incorporate those predictions at one layer of gene regulation into a multivariate variant interpretation and also clinical diagnostic workflow? I think this is also an unsolved issue that I think will be interesting to think about. So I'm just going to end my talk here and see if there are any time.
