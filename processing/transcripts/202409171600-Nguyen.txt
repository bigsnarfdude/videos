So, today we talk about Kafari Connolly inequality with the Coulomb terms. So, here the inequality I want to talk about in the tour, so I want to control the norm of T in L gamma by the power of the semi-normal T in WSP times the Coulomb term even here for some power of beta 2. So, under the very general condition. So, under the very general condition for the parameter here, I assume that gamma between 1 and infinity, p and q between 1 and infinity, s between 0 and 1, 0 and 1 are included, and alpha between 0 and d. You see that with the condition here. And I also discussed some variant, just some Gafari inequality for this type of inequality in which we put some way. Which we put some way in the norm G here and some way in the norm G there. And so here, just the notation, it's very standard notation. I just consider here, so somehow the semi-norm G WSP is given here for between 0 and 1. As equal to 1, I take the norm, the valid. And as equal to 0, I take the norm G. Okay, standard thing. And if you can see this inequality, I mean, the inequality that means the the so here the here the here the balance law so if you want to prove that we need to assume the balance law is assumed as b1 beta one b plus two beta p 2 beta 2q equal to 1 and d minus sp beta 1 plus d plus alpha beta 2 equal to d over gamma here that's the the the Bessel law and and what and so so the standard And what, and so the standard question is: what are the additional conditions? So, here they outline my talk. So, I want to talk about the motivation, what happened in the related context, and then I discussed the interpolation inequality with the Coulomb term. And I also discussed the same inequality for radio function in which we can extend the scope of the parameters. So, here's a motivation and related. So, here's a motivation and related context. So, I mean, you see that we consider the Kafari connier by inequality or Gabriel Boniraba inequality. So, one of the motivation come from the roots come from the Hartley inequality. Here, here they form the Hartley inequality, very standard one. Here, we need to assume that P between P greater than or equal to one and less than D, the dimension, and we have the inequality for any U in C1C. Okay, that's. ID u in C1C. Okay, that means a smooth function with compassible. And in fact, in the Kb rather than D, you still have same inequality, but sorry, you still have the same inequality, but that time you need to assume that U equal to zero near zero. And we also know that we have some variant for the Kp equal to D, I mean, the limiting case, and the standard proof, we have a lot of proof. We have a lot of proof for this carbon equality, but the standard proof are based on the integration by parts. And so, an extension for this curve equality is the famous one-cafer-cornier bus inequality. It's saying that we have this orange inequality. I mean, you can estimate the norm of x to the gamma u in l tau by the norm x gamma s to the unfinished random u in lp, some power a and some power a and x to the beta u in lq for some power one or minus a for any smooth function u is compassible under here here the the the the balance law condition and the other condition given here the red and the the valid one and and and and you can see that the value one is not really necessary as i mentioned for the for the happy inequality okay and and some no reason for this direction i mean uh we have the reason of misa and We have the resender Maisa and Sapos Nikova and refined by Frank and Scheringer and the work of Bentifru and his co-author and foresaw some special cases. And the general case were obtained by in the joint work with Marcus Kwasina. We proved that we assume that we had the balance law here and And instead, the recognition I mentioned previously for the ks equal to one, you have similar one, just this one, means with greater s by equal to one, you obtain the previous one. And instead of the, and in the, in the, in the, in the case one over tau plus gamma over d greater than zero is equivalent to the case p between one and d for the happy inequality. If you want to have a feeling for about this inequality, then you obtain the Gafari connectable. Then you obtain the Gafari cone integral t in the fractional solar space, that means for s between 0 and 1. And in the k 1 over tau plus gamma over d is less than equal to 0, I mean it's corresponding to the k being greater than d in the in the in the half d k, you obtain the same inequality under the assumption that u equal to zero near zero. zero near near zero and in fact we can also prove that the the limiting case and but i mean the the form is more involved it depends on the support of the function and and the idea that maybe here we use the the idea is motivated i mean inspired by by the theory harmonic analysis or i mean we use the idea decomposition for the real variable to to to understand this one in in a kind of discrete setting and uh Of discrete setting and a summation check. I mean, so integration by by is not required. In fact, you see that it takes a lot of time to obtain the full version for caparico neighbor inequality for fashion-solst base. And we also obtained the full version for this carbon inequality for radical case, and this is based on the work with APCA Malice. And now the condition unfair minus sigma greater than equal to zero related. sigma greater than equal to zero you relay by by the condition and five minus sigma greater than equal to minus n minus one time s okay and the other the other condition are the same and use you you obtain similar inequality for radial functions that the data that the related concept i want to i want to mention i mean you have uh you we understand very well now i mean the what happened for carpary carnivore inequality in in the in the fetch fashional superlapse setting Fashional superfic setting. And now we want to do a similar thing for the inequality with the Coulomb term. And first, I want to mention the reason obtained by B.L. Leon in 80 in his study of R34 equation. So Leon put that in R3, the norm gene R3 is controlled by C time, the norm greater than G N L2 to the one-third time the, I mean, the double intro. I mean the diploma integral of tx square ty square over x minus y dx dy to the one over six and and and the this general I mean the general version of the inequality was was already considered for the kb equal to two here i mean we have t square here tx square here t y square here and and obtained by by by a number of authors as just mentioned here and mainly for the mean for the k people to check Mainly for the mean for the K P equal to T, touch for the K P equal to 2, and F between 0 and 1. And here, I want to recall the balance law for this inequality for the general version. You will see the general version in a moment again. And I just want to mention what are the conditions in this case. The condition in this case, I mean, in the literature is quite complicated. For the Kp equal to 2, I mean, we assume that. I mean, we assume that either this one is not equal to zero, and you assume the condition 2.1 given here, or you assume this one equal to zero, and you can see that the condition given here. So you see that the case b equal to two is completely 30, but the condition is not easy to remember, at least. And here, here, the mean reason I want to. To give you in this general case. So it is based on the joint work with Carmali. We prove that we assume the standard assumption for the parameter and we assume the condition 2.3, the mean kind of convexity condition. And you will see that in a moment. Under the condition, we obtain the, you can say the kappa equal inequality with the Coulomb term. Okay, very general condition. Yeah, and and here first I want to mention some I want to make some comment on the condition. So the condition is optimal. I mean you you will see that it a kind of convexity condition you will see in a moment, but it's optimal. I mean you cannot do it whether and and the no assumption I mentioned previously for the Kb equal to two in fact can be written in this form. You can see that in the K equal to two you see that it's interesting to to remain to It's interesting to know that the pre-built condition can be written under this form. And you can see that the Ks equal to one, I mean, you can consider the local version somehow. I mean, you consider the standard gradient case. I mean, the reason is new already for P equal to not equal to 2. Here, P not equal to 2 here. And the K as equal to zero are not preverse. Are not reversely considered in the literature. And you will see that I don't consider the k anphi equal to d or a gamma equal to equal to one because it's just corresponding to the usual Gaudier low nearby inequality. So now I want to mention, I want to make some comment on the proof. So the strategy, so we use a strategy in my previous work where in 2011 when I proved in 2011 when I put some uh some inequality some so-called inequality um for for the uh for some non-local um quantity so the idea can can be uh can be described as follows I mean we first establish a kind of a point carry inequality you will see in a moment and then we use Poincar√© inequality to prove that we have a uh we have estimate in in gamma weak okay instead of Gamma weight. Okay, instead of gamma, we have gamma width. And then we have a use truncation argument and the theory of sharp maximum function to obtain the version of L gamma. So it's inspired by the work of Maisa. And let me give some more detail for the approach. So we assume that here I can see that here at the balance law. Balance law. And now we can see and be here just a ball or a cub. Okay. And now we have the Bondari inequality I mentioned here. So you can control the oscillation of U by some factor on the volume of B by the norm U in W S B to the power B1B times the potential to the beta two. Okay? Two okay, and and I want to decide you the quantity here, it makes the constant C here independent of u and and the sign the bond B and the bond B. And in fact, the proof this one is very easy. Let me convene this fact. So here you have this inequality. I mean the oscillation of U can be controlled by this one, it's quite standard. And now you just use the definition of, I consider the The definition of I consider the ks between zero and one. You can use the definition of the semi-norm UWSP, you obtain immediately the inequality. You control the norm of x minus y by the side, by the volume of b to the one over d the dimension, and you obtain immediately this one, inequality. So and for the for the coulomb term, I mean it's also simple, you just consider the oscillation. Consider the oscillation is controlled by two times the average, and the average you because PV greater than or equal to one, you use the Jensen inequality, you obtain this, you obtain this inequality, and here you just estimate the norm of x minus y by the volume of b to the one over d, and you obtain immaterial disinequality. And now you now you And now you use the fact that B beta1 and B2 are greater than equal to 0, and the sum equal to 1, you rewrite the oscillation by the oscillation to the P beta 1 and the oscillation to the 2q beta 2, because the sum equal to 1 here. And the first part you use this inequality. And the second part, you use an estimate for the oscillation using the column term. Using the column term, and you put them together, you obtain the lambda. Okay, so you see that the Poincar√© inequality is somehow almost free from this aspect. Now, how we can use the Poincar√© inequality, this Poincar√© inequality to derive an estimate for the L gamma width. And this one we need to use the Vitaly covering lemma. Let's see how we can do that. Let's see how we can do that. So, here I rely this form detecting this formula. I mean, you assume that you have two functions, h1 and h2, and you have another function, f, all of them are measurable, and greater than equal to zero, you want, and you assume that you have conversion condition, okay? Meta one gamma plus beta two gamma greater than equal to one. I mean, the characteristic. To one, I mean, the current conversity condition. You can see that why I call it conversity condition. And you assume that you have the estimate for this. And then at that time, you obtain an estimate for the F in L gamma width. More precisely, we have this inequality for any t greater than or equal to t greater than zero. So if we want to re to want to apply this lemma to the This lemma to the inequality with the Coulomb term, we just need to apply for H1 equal to this quantity and H2 equal to that quantity. Okay. And why we need to use the condition? In fact, in the proof of this lamb, we use the following symbol inequality saying that if you take the sum of Ai to the tau Bi to the eta. tau bi to the eta for i between one and infinity and you can estimate this sum by the sum of ai to the tau times the sum of e i to the eta if tau plus eta greater than equal to one okay and so that that that kind of condition here we see we apply in this kind of thing and that kind of complexity condition very simple one and now how to do that so so now you take So now you take you take by the definition. So you have sub here. So if you find a Y in this set, you can find BY so that you have this inequality by the division by the property of F I mentioned here, okay, by the property of F. And now, I mean, you just, and from the inequality, you can estimate the size of EY easily, okay? Y easily. Okay, you obtain the ethyman psi BY. And now you just do vitally colouring lemon to the set F greater than T. And you can see that you can say that the set F greater than T control on the union of 5 BI, I mean 5 BI to the ball with the same center BI, but 5 time radius. And you use the information BI here. You take this. BI here, and you take this, and now the estimate variance symbol you apply the previous inequality with tau equal to beta 1 gamma, eta equal to beta 2, gamma. And here the capacity condition, we assume that we put here by 2.5, we have the measure of the set operator then tau you control by c time, the sum of bi, and each bi with you information in 2.6 to control this one, and now you use. Sit you control this one, and now you use the uh the inequality of the sum I mentioned previously where we do the condition beta one gamma plus beta two gamma greater than equal to one, you obtain immaterly this one and that that gives you an estimate for for L gamma weak for the inequality with the Coulomb term and and and that's that's all and now now you need to Now you need to obtain the L gamma and for this one you need to use the truncation technique and the theory of mass move function. Okay and I don't present this in this talk. Okay and now and now we want to say that what happened if we put the way as in the Kafari connectable inequality I should give you here a version for Actually, give you here a version for that. So, here we have the here you define a very generous assumption for the parameter. You define sigma and gamma in the Cafariton inequality, sigma given by this one, and gamma given by this one. And here you assume kind of Bessel law. And under the condition, very standard condition, but here we need to introduce the parameter gamma prime. And then at that time, you have. And then at that time, you obtain the inequality with the way here. I mean, the inequality with the way in the spirit of Kafari Don Nielberg. And now I want to say what happened for the radio case. Usually you see that in the radio case, you can extend the scroll, the parameter, and you want to do it in this case. And here there is an And here the reason I obtained with Akamali recently, so for the radio curve we need to assume that the dimension Li greater than equal to two, so we assume standard assumption. But here now we assume that before we can see the for the inequality with the Coulomb term, we assume that unfar between zero and d. Now in this reason, I assume that unfar between one and d. And you will see in a moment what happened for unfar between zero and one. Between zero and one. And we assume that the valence loss, of course, I mean, onwards. And we assume that the condition, suppose that we know B time E plus amphi minus 2 Q D minus S P not zero equal to zero. And before we assume the conversity condition saying that beta one gamma plus beta two gamma greater than equal to one, now we replay the previous conversity condition. the previous conversity condition by by this one roughly speaking beta one gamma plus d plus anfa minus two d minus one beta two greater beta two gamma greater than one you see that the constant d plus alpha minus two over d minus one greater than one scene alpha between one and d anpha greater than one at that time so you we extend the the the range of the parameters so in in Parameters. So in you can have this one equal to one, and you have a wide spanial condition here. At that time, for radio function, smooth radio function we compass for, you obtain the inequality, the interpolation inequality with the column term even here. Okay, so then you can ask what happened if we have the if alpha between zero and one, and what happened if we don't have 3.1. 3.1 and or 3.2. And the first one, what happened if we don't have the 3.1 and 3.2, we assume that either the converse, I mean, the opposition, you assume that this one is less than 1, or this one equal to 1, and this one is not equal to B, then the preverse inequality doesn't hold. You see that we assume this one is less than 1, and this one equal to 1. Let them one, and this one is equal to one, but this one is not equal to three. Then this inequality does not hold. You see that? So it gives you the optimal optimality in the K and ph between one and B. And now for the K and phara between zero and one, we prove that even if you take instead of the complexity condition, we assume that this only led to one. So the interpolation inequality with the Coulomb term does. With the Coulomb term, does not hold even for the radio condition, radio function. So, the mean in the k ampha between zero and one, the mean the condensing condition is optimal for function and also for radio function. Okay, that makes it I want to say and and and the problem is one is based on the what we have obtained for the kafari connector in the code t, but we have to you can see. to you can see the the the K2 3.1 and 3.2 quite separately and and finally I want I want you to say that the very special K I know in the literature here I just mentioned very properly speaking and the the the K as equal to one and B equal not equal to two he on he already knew in um for our reasons and uh I think And I think I finished my talk. And thank you for your attention.
