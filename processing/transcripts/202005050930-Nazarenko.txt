And he'll be telling us about non-stationary wave turbulence. Okay. So, hi again, guys. So, glad to participate in this interesting new format. So, I I guess my original title was uh no session evolution kinetic equation, but I decided to to broaden it up a little bit. And it's actually not even And it's actually not even only about wave turbulence, but also a little bit broader turbulence. Okay, so it's not a particular work, but it's based on a number of things I've done with my collaborators in the past. So, okay, so the classical turbulence, right, like Kalmagorov turbulence, right? So the usual cascade cartoon and the famous Kalmagorovov. And the famous Kalmagorov spectrum that is derived based on a universality hypothesis that everything is determined, the energy spectrum is only determined by the rate of the energy flux, in this case. So now, how, so this is a steady state spectrum, right? So the question is then, okay. The question is, then, okay, um well, how does this steady state form, right? And here's the cartoon of for a reasonable in quote-unquote because it's false, a picture that you would think if I start forcing at some wave numbers, K, in some limited range, right, of wave numbers, then I would have a spectrum spread in. Have a spectrum spreading and propagating toward high wave numbers carrying the flux, and would be some front propagating, leaving Kalmagorov scaling, Kalmagorov spectrum behind the front, right? And it turns out to be that this kind of picture is wrong for a lot of a big number of very well-known systems, including the Navier-Stokes turbulence itself. So these systems are called infinite capacity. Are called infinite capacity systems. Sorry, finite capacities, finite capacities. What finite capacity means is that if I extend the spectrum up to an infinite wave number, right, then and then I would ask myself what would be the energy mean energy density in the physical space. Density in the physical space, that would be, that would density would be finite, even though the spectrum extends to all the infinite wave numbers. So the energy is finite in physical space. So that explains the term finite capacity. What does it mean? It means that in Fourier space, this spectrum is integrable, integrable Taylor five wave numbers. Obviously, k to minus five-thirds is integrable at infinity, right? So, and for these systems, this kind of evolution picture is wrong. And what is actually correct picture is shown on this cartoon. Okay, so there will be indeed a front of the spectrum propagating to high wave numbers, and it will actually have a scaling power law behind the front. But this power law will But this power law will actually be steeper than the Kalmagorov 5F. Okay? And the front will propagate in finite time. It will reach no matter how high the dissipation range wave number is. So it will self-accelerate and then finite time it will reach it. And then the reflection wave will start propagating from high wave. Propagating from high wave numbers toward low wave numbers, and that reflection wave will have scaling five-thirds on it. So, Kamagorov spectrum is not getting established behind the front of initial spectrum, but as a reflection wave bouncing back from infinite wave number. And in fact, okay, so similar, this is kind of This is kind of an interesting scenario that was also could be observed in Burgess turbulence in the paper of Suleim et al. 83. It's actually quite simple. So if you start classical burgers problem with say inviscid burgers or viscous burgers, okay. Burgess, okay. So you started with a sine wave, one period of a sine wave. You know that burgers will lead to wave stiffening. At some point, the derivative will reach infinity. At one point, it's called cubic root singularity. And then that would follow immediately by formation of a shock. Okay, so if you go to Fourier space, cubic root singularity has spectrum k. Has spectrum k to minus 8/3, which is steeper than the spectrum caused by shock waves, which is minus 2. And this is precisely how in Fourier space, if you look at the evolution, what happens that corresponds to this wave breaking will be precisely this picture, okay, that was shown here. Okay, and there are many other systems where this kind of Where this kind of behavior was observed. Like, for example, closure, phenomenological closure in turbulence integrable differential called PDQMM. Okay, so was observed to have this behavior numerically. Now, very importantly, BC, so both sensor and condensation, right? So in this case, in the latter case, we're talking about not to forward propagating. Not to forward propagating spectrum, but backward propagation. So propagation of spectrum toward low wave number and hitting k equal to zero mode in finite time, and that will be the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation in this case that we'll be talking about a bit later. So just a bit more about. So just a bit more about the hydrodynamic turbulence. In Mavioskokes turbulence, well actually I shouldn't say Mavioskokes because it was earlier equation. So all simulation by Brachet et al. 92 exhibited similar kind of behavior where the spectrum propagates and progressively in time the spectral exponent behind the front was measured. Behind the front was measured, and it was shown that it's actually saturating to the values, not minus five-thirds, but something on the range of minus four, much steeper. And only after this spectrum reaches the maximum wave number, then the Kamagorov spectrum minus faster start forming in the system. And in fact, in that paper, In that paper, Mark Erki, so they were speculating that these kinds of scalings could be related to coherent structures such as collapsing pancakes of articity that eventually, at some moment on time, become infinitely thin and then they break up into filaments. And so, again, like in Burgess, we see two consecutive singularities in Burgess, it was pretty. Singularity scenario. In Burgess, it was pre-shock, square root cubic root singularity, followed by shock. And here we have pancake followed by filament. So recently, so Georgio Krusovich did a repeated simulation at higher resolution and And indeed, what was observed the exponent just like a Mark simulation was settling at the steeper values, like minus four. Okay, and this was, by the way, hyper-viscous equations with hyper-viscosity. So instead of usual viscosity, Laplacian. Instead of usual viscosity, Laplacian of velocity, it was Laplacian squared so that to increase the non-dispatch fringe. And so here's the pictures he observed in terms of the abacticity structures. You see intense pancakes form here, okay, but at some point we see them breaking into the filaments. And if you can observe And if you can absolutely follow further, you see this what we call vortex ribs. So it's this vortex pancake structures, they become unstable. It's called Kellen-Helengold's instability, and that leads to kind of like this kind of array of vortices that further. wrap like rubber bands wrap into around each other and become this kind of more complicated structures like cables and and only at that point when this complicated structure arises spectrum five-thirds sets in the system but initially it's much more regular okay now this Okay, now the simplest models that one could use can be actually differential based on differential equations in Fourier energy spectrum in Fourier space. And to construct such a model, we will require that such an equation will have two fundamental solutions: okay, Kamagorov spectrum as a fundamental equilibrium, the stationary solution, but also the Spatiency solution, but also the thermodynamic energy equipartition spectrum called Rayleigh gene spectrum. So energy equipartition in 3D space would mean 1D energy spectrum behaves as k squared. So that, you know, because the geometrical factor of sphere of radius k has area 4π. Is it k squared or k to the minus 2? That's k squared. That's k squared. That's k squared. So this means that in 3G k space, energy is distributed equally among the k moles. Okay? So the and if you integrate out the solid angle, it becomes 4 pi k squared times, well yes, that's why it becomes k squared. It's a geometric factor. Okay, so So these things were actually if you compute the Euler equation and you ignore the fact that okay, so let's say it was Fourier method and you ignore the fact that actually you should dissipate your system at higher wave numbers because if you have truncation you don't let the flux of energy go through and you have this thermalization happening. This thermalization happening. So, indeed, so you what you see successively in time, you form some spectrum, presumably minus five-thirds, but then if there is no dissipation here, you observe k-squared, thermalized agent. Okay, and so again, so that was Marquetien Brachet with his PhD student, Sich Lovas, and Um and uh so they uh also observe that ah okay the transition is actually has also intermediate deepen it that they make a emphasize that that's important called the secondary dissipation range and now but before that study we came up with well not we came up with okay so Leith came up with the following model okay so Following model. Okay, so this is the differential equation that I told you about. So this is a non-linear singular diffusion equation for the energy spectrum in Fourier space. So it's designed in such a way that if I ignore force and dissipation, so I have two steady-state solutions: the Kamagoro 5 thirds and the energy partition k squared. Of course, you can see K squared right here, right? So the Right here, right? So the e equal to k squared, we will make this internal bracket constant, and so it will be zero. And what's inside these brackets, side brackets, so this is the energy flux with minus sign. Okay, so this is a continuity equation. So this equation actually you see it's a this kind of equations It's like a non-linear diffusion equation and of a kind that not too far from what people study in filtration, in the problem of filtration. So like in porous media. Okay, so but now we're in Fourier space. So easy to see actually that one can so if I have no force and dissipation, yeah, I can get general steady state solution. Steady state solution. Okay, because if I say steady state, so immediately I convert this equation into a first core differential equation, which I can obviously easily integrate. And that will become this. And so that's what we call warm cascade solution. That's a solution that has low K asymptotic as Kalmaguro five thirds and high K asymptotic. K-asymptotic thermalized spectrum, right? But remember, I just said one minute ago about the work of numerical work of Sheik Lovas and Brashet, that they said, okay, so they noticed that solution that we found. They said, ah, but this model doesn't have secondary. Model does not have secondary dissipation arrangement, so it's not as realistic as, let's say, GPNM. But it turns out that if you study not a steady state for Leith model, but you study self-similar evolution, you get your secondary dissipation arrangement. Well, and it also means that it's not a not this it's not the it has nothing to do with dissipation it's just the um uh it's just the some shape that is not formed because something is dissipated because there's no dissipation there okay so anyway now the type of behavior that I described for finite capacity spectrum is attributed to To self-similarity of the second kind. So if I start with some initial data in finite ratio wave numbers, the statement is asymptotically we go to self-similar solution that blows up in finite time, the front self-accelerates, and it's in Zeldovich Barringblood terminology, it's the self-similarity of the second kind. similarity of the second kind. So these kind of solutions were studied in the context of the context of the porous media. So why is it of the second kind? It's to distinguish from the first kind that where self-similarity coefficients or the self-similarity scalings can be found based only on a conservation law. Like for example if I If I blow something up, there is strong explosion in air, so I can find my shock wave and my solution just from conservation of energy. So this is a solution that was famously found by Taylor and used later for when they were calculating nuclear explosions. Okay. Explosions. Okay. But if you are concerned with the opposite problem, suppose you have a vacuum void, a sphere, you take out a bubble, a vacuum, and then the air, the gas, will start filling in this void. Okay, that was also going to be so similar solution, but it's not going to be of the first kind. So I can't use consideration of energy because energy is infinite. Because energy is infinite. Energy of only outside air is infinite. So, a similar part will only be close to the bubble, but not outside. So, this kind of problems are called a non-linear eigenvalue problem for the reason that I will tell you right now. Okay, so let's do self-similar substitution. Self-similar substitution, right, of this kind into the differential equation, lead differential equation, right? Okay, t star is some blow-up time, A and B are similarity coefficient, eta is a similarity variable, right? Okay, so now immediately I will find one relation between A and B. That is just to make a problem self-consistent and the And the resulting equation for the similarity function f would contain only eta and not other variables, right? So, this would get immediately this kind of relation from dimensionality consideration. Now, if it was first order cell similarity, then we would use conservation of energy and find a second condition. Okay, but now we can't do that because. We can't do that because self-similar behavior happens only at the wave numbers that are much greater than the initial wave number and also at the time which is very close to T star, very close to T star, only in small vicinity of the blow-up time. Okay, and the problem is like this. So I said to you, the To you, there is a power law exponent behind the front, right? So, this function then f will have a power law asymptotic for eta tends to zero, right? And then it will have a finite front at eta tends to one. In fact, for this type of non-linear PGEs, so the front has to be sharp, so it has to. Has to be sharp, so it has to be finite support on one side. Okay, so this is a front-sharp solution. And also it has to be such that the flux, there is no flux at the sharp front. So there is no dissipation, right? So because we have freely propagating non-dissipation. Propagating non-dissipative system, freely propagating spectrum. And so, and it turns out that these two boundary conditions, okay, so that sharp front and power law asymptotic on the right and left ends respectively, can be simultaneously satisfied only for a single value of x. So, this single value of x, this is kind of Of x, this is this is kind of like eigenvalue of the problem, right? So we have to find such x that both the boundary conditions are satisfied. Okay, so now we can actually make change of variables and transform this second-order equation for the similarity function into the autonomous to. Autonomous 2D system. You see, it becomes quite simple. Also, I have to desingularize time. Okay, so that to okay, so I have this autonomous non-linear system, but we know everything about 2D systems, dynamical systems. Okay, so that's why this problem is nice and easy to study. It has three fixed points. Has three fixed points onto the plane. So one point at zero, it corresponds to the power law asymptotic at the left boundary for small eta. So another point also at the vertical axis that corresponds to the sharp front. And there is also another point that changes in nature depending on X. Depending on x. Okay, so typical trajectories look like that. So if I take arbitrary x, which is not the solution of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, then I start on slow manifold of the from fixed point at zero, and I'm going to miss the correct boundary condition at the other end. If I start from the other end backwards, If I start from the other end backwards in time, so I am going to get attracted in a focus and also I'm going to miss the fixed point P1. And it's only for a single value of x that I will reach from one fixed point to another. And you, of course, will recognize that we are talking about a global bifurcation here. We have here Heaven, we have here tetraclinic deformation that presents a solution of our eigenvalue problem. You can also go from the other side of x, you know, so let's say x now greater than the true value. And then this point, this focus of P3 becomes from stable focus to unstable focus. And we have Focus. And we have a birth of hope bifurcation, birth of unstable limit cycle, birth of stable limit cycle. And now if I move my X, okay, so then I can grow this limit cycle until it will collide with two other points. So again, I have So again, I have global bifurcation approach from the other side. Okay, and there are some simple theorems that can be proven here. Just based on Bendixson theorem, we can prove for existence of a solution. We can prove that its exponent is strictly greater than Kalmagorov and strictly less than the value that occurs where hope bifurcation occurs, which is, I can't remember, something like two or something. Country member, something like two or something. Okay, so now I told you that at t equal to t star, you hit infinity, right? In wave number space. And then the number of spectrum goes as a reflection wave, you know, innovating from high wave number toward low wave number. And this also can be found as a self-similar. Also, it can be found as a self-similar solution, but of a different type. We call it self-similarity of the third kind. So, not only that, so it's not first kind because we can't find cell similar coefficients based on conservation of energy. On the other hand, the cell similar coefficients already predetermined by the previous stage, by the previous previous. Stage by the previous pre-evolution before T star. Okay, so it will fix A and B for us. And so we don't have any freedom. And we have this reflected wave propagation. And here at the self-similar shape, and you can see that indeed this is a dip that corresponds to this secondary dissipation range. So now, in fact, Now, in fact, as I announced before title my talk, I was going to talk about society in non-stationary evolution within the kinetic equations, right? And that's a harder problem. So here's a kinetic equation that corresponds to a three-wave process. It arises in the theory of MHD turbulence. MHD turbulence. So you see the collision integral on the right-hand side is quadratic with respect to M, not cubic as you are probably more familiar from NLS. So this kind of kinetic equation was indeed computed in this kind of centers I told you about. So starting with So, starting with initial energy spectrum in the finite range of k and observing what's going to happen. And you see, so here is a compensated spectrum, spectrum compensated to the value exponent seven-thirds. So, in this case, equivalent of the Kalmagorov spectrum would be spectrum with exponent minus two. Okay, and you see, so initially we have plus. Initially, we have plateau here propagating. This means that the initial exponent is seven-thirds, which is steeper than two. And only later we have as a reflection wave spectrum propagating back. So this is a numerical solution. Now we could also state a similar kind of self-similar formulation with a similar as an Similar as in differential model conditions. Okay, a second kind of self-similarity. So the self-singular function must have power law symptoms and it has to decay fast at tends to infinity. You see, when we're talking about integral differential equations, we don't have sharp fronts anymore. But there must be. But there must be some sort of very strong decay. So the way we postulated this problem, formulate this problem, is that we have to find such f such x for which at the high eta we have the fastest possible decay, fastest possible decay. Fast as possible decay, but f remains positive. Because you see, if I have x slightly missed, right, then my decay is going to be too fast, and I'm going to go through zero, and f will be negative. And that's unphysical because f, and also, you know, mathematically, if I start with initially positive f, then it cannot become negative. Okay, so it's a spectrum, it cannot be negative. Of negative. Okay, that property is conserved by the kinetic equation. And so if we formulate it this way, it turns out that actually the decay at infinity is not one would one could think, you know, kind of intuitively that, okay, it's a fast decay, it must be something something like exponential. But turns out it's not exponential, it's a power law with some very high power. With some very high power. Okay, so the actually, I'm not going to go in detail how we found that, but that thing we can rigorously deduce the relation between the decay of F at high wave numbers with the parallel symptotics at the low wave numbers. Okay, so the two are. Low wave numbers. Okay, so the two asymptotics are related. So if asymptotic at low wave numbers it has index Paulo index Xr, so at high wave numbers it must have this one, this expression. Okay, so finally, okay, so but I have to say the these asymptotics Symptotics is the only thing that we can find analytically. It's a notoriously hard problem to deal or even prove that solution exists. It's not been done. So even numerically, to solve an equation for self-similar shape, it's much It's much harder than to solve the original evolution equation. So if I do self-similar substitution, I have only one self-similar variable, eta. But it's still integral differential equation, and I must have do some sort of iterations, contract my, you know, kind of do some sort of a contraction technique, but it's non-linear. But it's non-linear and it's complicated, it's singular, and we don't have any sort of contracted maps theorem analogues here at all, because the contraction norm of the operator is itself dependent on the spectrum. So, this is an interesting and completely open mathematically A field of stylia. And numerically, it's very hard to find. One has to use a lot of tricks to tame this contraction, this separation procedure. And as I said, it's actually much easier to compute the original equation. But somehow, solving the original equation evolution, we don't prove much. Don't prove much. We don't prove that even solution exists. So we see numerically that it kind of tends to sell similar shape, but as I told you, it only tends to sell similar shape only for time very close to the blow-up time and only at high wave numbers that are much higher than the initial one. Okay, you wanted to ask questions? You wanted to ask a question. Yes, there was a question that asks whether k to the minus seven-thirds is not a stationary solution of the. Do you mean that k to the minus seven-thirds is not a stationary solution of the kinetic equation? Oh, not at all, not at all. It's not. So the stationary solution is k to power minus two. That's one, and the second one, n equal to constant. This is equal partition. So the equivalent of Kalmagorov exponent would be minus two. Okay, and seven thirds, it's actually a feed. We don't have a proof that seven thirds. It just looks like seven thirds, I mean, from numerics. Okay, so now I can. Now I come to the non-equilibrium condensation. That has to do with the inverse cascade of the in-wave turbulent system. So here's the Nollyn-Schröder equation, which is in the whole Bros-Payevsky equation, because actually it was written by Bross and Pitayevsky to describe the evolution of the The condensate wave functions. So, as you know, it has a conservation of particles, a conservation of energy. So, it's a defocus in case. So, actually, it's been studied, noticed a long time ago that via this kind of angle amplitude decomposition, it becomes this. It becomes this becomes can be written in hydrodynamic form. Okay, this equation. If I trans density as a square root of amplitude of psi and velocity as a double gradient of the phase of psi. So I have this, it looks like Euler equation, except for the last term here, which is called quantum pressure, okay, which actually has profound consequences. Actually, it has profound consequences in terms of that vortices cannot be now Helen circulation theorem is not any longer valid. So I can allow reconnections of vortices and also vortices themselves will have quantized values of circulation. So, and you see that the adiabatic index in this case is 2. Okay, so this is the pressure. So, this is the pressure term. Pressure is rho squared. So, this is a reason for which we can do a lot of analogies with hydrodynamics. We have vortices, we have waves, and we have more specific structures like solitons arising because of presence of dispersion, which is because of this above-mentioned quantum pressure. Pressure. Okay, so vortices actually, so you say I have 3D space, vortices are geometrical positions where psi is zero. So it's a defect of phase. But because of this analogy, they do behave like hydrodynamic vortices, like vortex rings will propagate and so on. So this is the realm of quantum turbulence, strong quantum turbulence, consisted of vortex tantrum. Consisted of Warpix pandals. Okay, if we talk, on the other hand, of weak nonlinearities, this is the domain of weak wave turbulence. That's what we all, you know, most of us are concerned with, right? The kinetic equation becomes four wave, and that's a familiar kinetic equation that a lot of us are studying, you know, or are trying to prove that it That you know it mathematically is valid for a certain time, and so on and so forth. Okay, so the two invariants here become in this representation again particles and the energy. And you see the energy corresponds only to the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian because the quadric part becomes much smaller. Smaller. Okay. And in fact, this quadratic, this expression becomes an exact invariant of this equation, not approximate one as for original non-linear Schrodinger equation. But why are we so concerned with this invariance? Because you see, these expressions are very similar to what we have in 2D turbulence for energy and the entrophy, right? And so, and we know famous. And so, and we know famous Fiotov argument, the contradiction argument, that predicts that in 2D turbulence, the energy must cascade to low wave numbers and entropy must cascade to high wave numbers. There are several versions of this argument, but in fact it is a theorem. Okay, so that if I start with a spectrum that has finite support. Initially, has finite support in Fourier space, then one invariant can cascade only to high wave numbers, another can only cascade to low wave numbers. But of course, it doesn't say that they must cascade. If they cascade, they will cascade only that way. Okay, but they can remain where they are, for example, the steady-state structure. So it's a okay, but now the same argument if we But now the same argument for weak wave turbulence leads to the picture that the energy must cascade to high wave numbers and the particles to low wave numbers. And as you can see, so the role of energy in 2D turbines is played by wave action, and a role of entropy is played by the energy. This is because of this k-squared coefficient here that is for okay. That is for 2D turbulence is present as well, but in the vorticity in the entropy invariant rather than the energy invariant. Okay, so the kind of energy. Okay, now, but in terms of the Bose Einstein condensation, it has a beautiful interpretation. So the Bose Einstein condensation. Both Einstein condensates are actually trapped in magnetic traps, right? Okay, they're confined. And if you make them turbulent, as was recently done by Nirnavon and et al., okay, so they had several papers including in nature. Okay, so they can shake the trap and they can get turbulence going. And they can, okay, so. And they can, okay, so they can realize this setup that we actually proposed a long time ago in my paper with Yuri Wolf and Rob West. So that if trap has finite height, then you can lose energy when it reaches high momenta, the excitations, and that will be as an effective sink. And so they precisely did that realization and experiment. And so they, and you see, then you have. And you see, then you have two cascades. So, the direct energy cascade could be interpreted as evaporation, evaporative cooling, just like hot tea in a cup becomes cooler because it loses hot molecules into evaporation. Same here, I mean, and the cascade of particles toward. Of particles toward lower momenta, towards lower wave numbers, it can be interpreted as a non-equilibrium condensation process. And we will be concerned with this non-equilibrium condensation process. But before, let me tell you that there is also, of course, famously steady-state solutions, okay, Kamagoro-Zakarov solutions or the kinetic equation that has the following exponent for four-week-speak. The following exponent for forward casket and inverse casket, where D is dimension. So they are pretty bad in 2D. I won't dwell on it why, because you know this actually are some bad properties. I mean, some degeneracies and also the contradiction of Fjordov argument. But in 3D, in fact, the situation is much better. In fact, the situation is much better. Okay, so we're still a little bit not so good for forward cascade because it's a logarithmic divergence in the kinetic equation, which called kind of like marginal non-locality, which physicists don't care about. They just fix it with log corrections. But it's not proven that actually rigorously that this is a valid solution. But Endorskaskate is good. Cascade is good, okay. So now, um, okay, uh, for 2D, we studied, you know, Miguel Anarate and myself, we studied the kind of NLS turbulence in both forward and inverse cascade settings. And we did so one of them is forward, another one is inverse. We did have pretty good Pretty good confirmation of what we predicted would be. Actually, what was predicted is not Kalmagorov-Zakharov spectrum, but energy thermodynamic spectrum. This is because of what I said that in 2D, you know, there's some traditional field of argument. So I won't go into details, but I'm going to say also. I'm going to say also that if you compute into the inverse cascade, but you don't dissipate at low wave numbers, right, then the particles that go toward k equal to zero actually start stagnating there, so start accumulating. And this is the condensation. Okay, and what happens after that? So the terminals become the term. The terminals become strong. Okay, so weak non-linear energy assumption breaks down and it is manifested in physical space as appearance of strong hydrodynamic vortices. Okay, so this what's plotted here is a density field, is a modulus of psi squared, mod psi squared in the physical space. And the blue dots are those. Dots are those generic oppositions where ψ turns into zero. So you see, with evolution, as evolution goes on, the number of vortices becomes less and less, but they become stronger and stronger. They behave like hydrodynamic vortices until finally they all disappear, and we have a kind of constant density state and perturbations on set background. Background, which have which is actually also described by wave turbines, but this is acoustic. So this is three wave process of Bagalugov sound, because it has dispersion to it. So you see, this scenario is quite interesting. So we start with Wicklino linear system, it's a four-wave process, then it actually kills. then it actually kills the during evolution, the wave turbulence assumption is getting destroyed. We go through the thermodynamic stage with vortices and after that on the other end we emerge as three wave terminals. Okay, so this is okay so all right so we also compare All right, so we also computed the 3D situations and we showed that the situation is quite tricky. So what we want to observe a prediction, theoretical prediction of Kalmagoro-Zakharov wave turbine spectrum in the forward cascade range, but it turns out that whether you observe it or not, a lot depends what you do on the infrared range for low wave numbers. infrared range for low wave numbers, wave numbers lower than the forcing scale. Okay, so this is one has to be careful about. Now finally, okay, so now let's consider the kinetic equation and let's assume the spectrum to be isotropic and so we pass, we integrate out the angles in Fourier space and we pass from wave number to From wave number to the frequency variable. So it becomes kinetic equation becomes like that, and the results of integration over solid angle brings about this kernel, this kind of interesting kernel. And so the numerics for the situation like that was done in this paper, Simekols and Kachov 92, and then Lakase, Pamo, Erika. Erika 2001 and then later Colman Kunaton. And so what they observed, they observed a self-similar evolution of the spectrum. So they started with a spectrum that in frequencies epsilon is frequency. Okay, so this kind of energy, the particle physics notation for the frequency. Okay, so what they found that this consecutive evolution like this, and so the Like this, and so if the measure spectral exponent, it has saturates a certain value. And this value, and Kz, Kamago is a higher value for the reverse cascade, is here in the dotted line. It's clearly much lower. So we see again formation of anomalous spectrum prior to the Prior to hitting the k equal to zero. And that's what's actually interesting. So you see, if you assume that this solution is self-similar, right, then what happens in finite time, the spectrum at k equal to zero blows up to infinity. So we have, we then have a solution for the kinetic equation. We prove a hangout time blow-up in that four-wheel kinetic equation. Equation. Okay, but as I said, analytic, it's a numerical evidence, and analytically, it's notoriously hard to deal with. Same as with three-wave kinetic equation for image detergence I told you about. Okay, so but you can state the self-similar ansatz in a similar way. We say, okay, well, let's consider make self-similar substitution like that. Like that, with some similar variable, like that, where tau is a time measured from the blow-up time. Okay, one relation between B and A we get very cheaply just for computing dimensions. But the second one we can't get because the solution is self-similar, second kind. And so, again, it's non-linear eigenvalue problem. We have to satisfy two. We have to satisfy the boundary conditions for small and high cell similar variable values. And so the boundary conditions again, so we say, okay, so it's powerload asymptotic, but now for high values of cell singular variable, because it's an inverse cascade. And at low values, cell singular variable again, so what do we do? We do? And the answer is here. Actually, you see that numerically, you see that the spectrum must go to constant. So what I'm saying, it's also parallel asymptotic, but with x equal to zero. We can okay, I can't hear you very well. Could you please help? I can't hear the question. Can I ask everyone to move their mic? I don't know if this is the question that I have end of Jongeri, but I think I have to go to the next one. And I have. Maybe we can ask Brent to mute everybody other than Jerge. Okay, you can mute. I think it's one of the somebody, some background notes. You can mute them. Yeah, see. Let me continue. Okay, so please continue. Now, so the boundary conditions you see, so the just from numerical evidence, we see F must tend to constant for To constant for a small eta. Actually, we can prove that. We can prove that based on the following observation. The right-hand side of this equation is an integral, right? If I plug the in-power law function in there, then this integral converges only for a certain range of the power laws, right? It has a window of indices for which it converges, right? And it turns out that when And it turns out that when x equals zero, the integral diverges at a high wave number. What it means is that if I consider some very small value of eta, right, so my collision integral is dominated by the values which are much greater than the one that I'm considering. So they will be dominated by the front. They will be dominated by the front. Okay, so the integral will sit here. So I can do expansions in my, I can take into account that fact, and I can convert my, I can then take into account this fact, and I can ignore some small terms in the kinetic equation and convert it into this form. Okay, and you see. Okay, and you see that here, so now both integrals become omega-independent. So they are functions of time, obviously, because n is time-dependent. Okay, so but they are okay. So the equation becomes like this. So for given A and B, I can easily solve it because it's a first-order equation with respect to time. Respect to time. And so I get the so then equivalently in self-similar form, right? So I have the following equation for F. So where A and B are just constants. And so I solve that equation easily. And I can see that the general solution of it is this. But if I require that the solution actually Actually, stays positive, okay, and also it doesn't blow up at zero. I have to put this coefficient C to zero, and then I can see that F doesn't tend to constant, and I even know this constant in terms of the so I have some sort of integral integral equality. Equality, integral relation, because A and B are the integrals of F, right? I have an integral relation between F and the integral of itself. That it is a prediction. Okay. So finally, okay, so this okay, but as I said before, that's about it. What can be done analytically? The problem is notoriously hard to. The problem is notoriously hard to prove convergence of iterations, etc. etc. So Boris himself is developing, he's going to be Simon's postdoc, he's going to come hopefully 1st of September. And so he's developing a sophisticated technique based on the subdividing the computational domain in subdomains where he has a chebyshev approximate. He has a chebushov approximants in such that non-uniform grades. I won't state the detail. Okay, so now one more thing I want to mention. Just like there is differential approximation I told you about leads model, second order differential equation, one can come up with a differential approximation for this fourth order for four wave equation. Wave equation. And it's a fourth-order equation because there are actually four fundamental solutions here. The two inverse cascades of Kalmagorozo-Harov type and two equipartition solutions. Okay. And now all of the sudden, I can also convert this system into dynamical system, autonomous dynamical system, but that's going to be 4D. But it But uh it but for 4D it it's uh it's not so much we can do as for 2D. For 2D dynamical systems, we know everything. For 4D it's a nightmare. Okay, so we actually don't know how to prove similar things as we did for 2D in for this four-dimensional system. Now, final thing I'm going to tell you is numerics of Of the non-linear Schrödinger equations in the inverse cascade settings. So, suppose I start in Fourier space with something that concentrated in high wave numbers. So, this is a pseudo-spectral method. And then I let it evolve. And initially, I see formation of this scaling, which is k-squared, but the thing is, you know, so. But the thing is, you know, so uh what I the the relation between profiles that I showed you before, uh uh namely uh this one, okay, and the profiles that I show you now is the k squared coefficient. So k squared is again the geometrical factor. So this means consider here 1D spectrum, whereas the other one was 3d spectrum. So k squared So, k squared simply means that that corresponds to constant in the previous graph. And you see, indeed, we have constant forming, okay, and then that will be the left end of the self-ima solution. And then when we evolve, we have another scaling emerging, right? Okay, so this is that anomalous scaling, okay, forming. Okay, so. Forming. Okay, so I'm running out of time, but what I'm going to say: so if well, we check that it is indeed weak turbulent, so you can do that by going to Fourier space in time as well and see that your spectrum is concentrated on the dispersion relation omega of k. So, however, in So, however, in physical space we have something else besides waves. We have actually vortices that are shown here. And I guess finally, what I want to say is that we do see if we try hard enough, you know, the numerical result does seem to agree with prediction based on. With prediction based on the kinetic equation. So, a prediction based on the kinetic equation that of Semikovs at Kachov has exponent 0.46, minus 0.46 in terms of this 1D spectrum. And what we see, we see the spectrum that is pretty close to it. It's well the best fit is 0.55. So, I mean, so it seems that the kinetic equation does predict pretty well what happens dynamically in the NLS turbulence. Okay, so after T star, after, oh, and again, so if that scaling continued, we would hit Continued, we would hit n equal to infinity at k equal to zero. But that, of course, doesn't happen because kinetic equation breaks down when spectrum becomes too strong. And so we have strong condensate and strong non-linearity. And what we see after that, we see a spectrum that is forming like very stiff spectrum, the exponent of which The exponent of which is still yet to be explained, whether it's related to vortices, solitons, some other interesting strong turbulent structures, and energy equipartition at five wave numbers. So, this is a thermal energy equipartition spectrum that forms at five wave numbers. Okay, so I just put the summary slides. So, I wanted to So I wanted to sort of convince you that not only stationary spectra are interested in wave turbulence, right? They are by far been at focus of most studies in wave turbulence, okay, so for predicting or checking predictions, but also similar solutions. And in particular, the ones that The ones that are in NLS. And so they, I mean, these similar solutions allow us to derive the law at which the condensate component grows in time. So k equal to zero component, right? So corresponding to eta tends to zero in self-signal solution, right? So it grows in finite time to infinity. And so we have And so we have prediction of that power law from the kinetic equation. But unfortunately, not analytically. Analytically, neither for four-wave differential equation, non-linear differential equation, nothing even to say about the integral differential kinetic equation. We can't get even Even a result on the existence of the solution to this linear eigenvalue problem that we pause or a balance on the exponents of the irrespective solution. So here, if anybody interested to do some mathematics, I think there's a lot to be said, a lot to be studied. So thank you very much. So I'm Fimers. Much so I'm filming. All right, thank you, Sergei, for the nice talk. Please, if you have any questions, enable your mic and ask them right away to Sergei. Okay, um right, so there's a okay, so there's a message that was written in the chat by Twan. The chat by Twan. So, the first, there are two questions. The first one is: at the self-similar blow-up, what are blow-up rates for the total mass and energy? And are the rates for generic data? So, what are the rates for the blow-up, right? So, the blow-up, okay, so it hap it occurs if if If what numerically is observed is correct. I mean, taking the kinetic equation for granted, right? Forgetting that it will eventually be broken. Okay. So you see the so the blow up will be d determined by how fast this this solution will will grow, right? Solution will grow, right? And it will grow. You see here, this is the law. It's t star minus t to power a. Yes? So it's a blow. Okay, it's this. So A can be determined based on X, X is the Paulo, right, which is numerically found to be 1.2345, okay, some magic number, right? Okay. Number, right? Okay. And then there is a relation between B and A, right? So what I need, I need to calculate A that will give me the scaling of blow-up. So I don't remember it from top of my head, but you can do it yourself in one minute. Okay, you basically plug in D, from this expression, into this X, and solve for A, and you know X. And you know X, and so you find A. Okay, so Tuan had another question. So, by the kinetic equation prediction, I believe this is KE is kinetic equation, do you mean to observe the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum for large K in large times? Okay, so very good question. Okay, so it really depends what we do at Near low wave numbers, right? Okay, so you see, if we make sure we dissipate we dissipate turbulence there, okay, we can hope that the steady-state spectrum will form and it will be a KZ spectrum from a gorgeous curve, right? That we've not checked yet, okay, so we don't we didn't check that. Okay, what kind of dissipation need to be in 3D we we didn't To be in 3D, we did not check that. Okay, so, but what these guys did, okay, so they didn't have dissipation at low wave numbers, right? And what they observed that after you hit infinity at k equal to zero, after that, your spectrum looks like some delta function spike at k equal to zero and thermolecule partition at high wave numbers. At five wave numbers. Okay, so it's like this thermal, like classical spectrum that they talk about in both unstained condensation, like what Einstein introduced. Something at k equal to zero, some finite occupational number, and then the rest thermal component of the topoil. Okay, and that's what we observe. And that's what we observe as well in our 3G numerics of non-linear Schrodinger equation if we don't dissipate near small wave numbers. So far we haven't dissipated small wave numbers and that's precisely the spectrum I showed to you. Oops, what did I do? Okay. It's right here. You see it. So You see, so you see at high wave numbers, it's not KZ, it's actually the thermodynamic relagins energy equal partition. And here it's not delta function and k, obviously, because it's a real non-linear Schrodinger equation and not the kinetic equation. So it's a skip spectrum, but not a delta function. Okay. Okay, there was a remark by Miguel Escovedo, who said that there is a proof of the blow-up for the kinetic equation, and a link to the paper is provided in the chat paper with Velasquez. Okay, so is there any other question? Okay, if not, I will ask Brent, who is from the Is from the Banff Institute.
