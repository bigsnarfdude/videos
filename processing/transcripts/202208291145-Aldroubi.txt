Shall I begin? Yeah, so the next talk is by Ankram Aldrubi. And Ankram, you are welcome. Well, thank you very much. And thank you very much for the organizing committee to invite me. I would have really liked to be in Oaxaca, but somehow scheduling for me did not work this time. And so the talk. So, the talk titled is Dynamical Sampling Source Term Recovery, and I will explain that in a minute. But before I do that, I will just say that some of this work was motivated by work by Martin Betterly, Yulu, John Murray Bruce, and Luigi Ragotti. And they were working on a wireless sensing network, and roughly speaking, they were interested in basically Basically, sampling the phenomena in time and space over a region to try to get information about this phenomena. So, that is roughly what sensor network is about, generally speaking. And some of this work that I will show is in collaboration with Idia Christo, Le Gong, Long Zhou Wang, Kerry Cornelson. Long Shou is my former student now. She, after UCLA, she had a tenure track at Michigan State University. And Lee Gong is a student of mine. Ilya Christel and Kerry Cronelson are my collaborators. So let me try to talk about this problem. talk about this problem. So we have an initial value problem, an abstract initial value problem, u dot equal to a u plus f plus eta, and we have an initial conditions, u at zero is u naught. So the various terms, so A here is simply a generator of C zero semigroup T and eta it will be essentially some sort of background source driving the Driving the system. F is some other source that we're interested in. A is known, although in a lot of the problems that we worked on, A is not known, but for this type of problems, A is known. And we're interested in actually capturing or recovering or knowing this source, which is of a certain form. Which is of a certain form. So it's a source, it's some sort of sum of f sub j phi t minus tj characteristic function here. So f sub j are in some Hilbert space or in some subspace of that Hilbert space or even subset of that Hilbert space H. And phi is some function that will appropriate, and I will talk. And I will talk a little bit more about that. So, this is a setting of a problem. And more generally, so what do we want to do? And basically, we want to recover this function f that I showed before by designing a set of vectors in the Hilbert space H such that by taking Such that I take these convergence, this set of vectors are basically used to measure the solution u. And those are the measurements. So this is an inner product. And of course, every measurement comes with some noise. There is some noise. So we measure u by using these vectors g and at some times and beta. Times and beta. Beta is a fixed interval. So we sample the time uniformly and we essentially use, you can think of u is a function of space and time. So g is a function of space. In any case, we want to construct a set, a subset of the Hilbert space H and a time step data that allow us to recover. That allows us to recover our forcing function here, f from this type of noisy data. Now, what do we know about this other forcing function? Well, not much except that it is Lipschitz, and possibly we know it has some sort of bounded above, and we know something about the noise, and somehow it is somewhat bounded above like some members. Like some member, sigma. So, this is the general problem. We want to recover a function from noisy measurement where we have a background source, an initial condition what we don't know, and our measurement are noisy. And to do that, we want to actually create or find a Find a set, a subset of the Hilbert space H and a time spit that's in order to recover this function or an approximation of it. So is there any question about what the problem is? Okay. So the first thing is I will look at a, in some sense, a very specific problem in which the function f The function f is a train of Dirac, so it's this sum of functions. N is not necessarily known, it doesn't really matter. So Fj basically are unknown, Tj is unknown. So the time of the burst, this is, and the function Fj are unknown. So we want to design a set of vectors in H that will allow us to recover f. will allow us to recover f from measurements. So we're gonna actually, I'm gonna try to describe some algorithm that will do that. And we call them predictive algorithm and I will explain that because that's really the main idea is just somehow we design the set G in a way that That predicts what is going to happen in a short future. And from predictions, from these predictions, we are able to find what this function f is, or at least what are the time tj and what is fjr. And I'll explain that. So this is the main idea. So what do we want to do? The first thing is, so we know these functions fj belong to some subspace of h. To some subspace of H, or maybe it's all of H. So we pick a frame for this for V. Let's think about the frame for all of H. So the idea is that if I know the inner product of all these guys with the vectors here, I should be able to construct these guys in a stable way. That's why we pick a frame. So a frame is like a basis, could be redundant. A frame is like a basis, could be redundant, it's kind of like an autonomous basis, a nice Rhys basis, it's kind of similar to it, but it may have some redundancy. So, this is first we pick a frame for V and then we're going to append to this frame, G tilde, another set of vectors which depend on the On the essentially the semigroup, which comes from the operator A. So for every vector in G, I'm going to add also the vector T star beta G. Beta is a time step that I'll choose eventually. So I have a vector G and a vector T star of beta G. And I'm going to take all these vectors. Take all these vectors, and I'm going to use them as follow. So at every time Tn, Tn is n times beta, I'm going to make a measurement with a vector G tilde and another measurement with a vector, so U T N G tilde, another measurement which is measurement which is with the other t-star energy so why am i doing doing this measurement this measurement right here is predicting what the value of of u will be at tn plus one if there is no burst if there is no burst we can tell at n plus one that u of tn plus one g tilde should be equal to equal to should be equal to equal to u of t n t star beta g tau so here is here is what we can see this is a measurement at time n and this is a measurement at time n with t star b tilde and if we look at our prediction what's going to happen at time tn plus one to the measurement using g tilde measurement using g tilde at time tn plus one this difference should be zero if there is no burst in this time interval in this short time interval of size beta so we sample so this essentially is a sample with g tilde and this is a sample also with g tilde but time t equals four if you like and the difference should be zero unless there is Should be zero unless there is some burst in there. And so it's really, that's a very simple idea. Of course, we have to have some conditions that tell us that two births cannot occur too close to each other. So we have that essentially two births should be at least within three time intervals from each from this beta. From this beta, those are sufficiently far apart, and so this is the condition: bursts should not occur too close to each other as compared to beta. And then I'm going to just modify a little bit this predictions. So let's call gamma n this difference one, where I use the vector g and m at time. And m at time n, where is a vector t star g. So, this is what I showed. I said, well, this difference should be small if there are no bursts in the interval n n plus one. But in fact, what I'm gonna, we have a background and I want to also kind of get rid of somehow or control the background. And I also have noise and I want to see what happen when we have noise and when we have a background. noise and when we have a background. So instead of just looking at the difference mn plus 1j and mn plus 1, I'm going to look at the difference of gamma n plus 1 here and gamma n. When I do this, in some sense, I minimize the effect of the background, the eta source, is something that's going on all the time. And if you compute also And if you compute also from the formulas that you have for these here, if you compute this difference, what you notice is that the difference, if there are no bursts between here and here, is not zero, but it's small. How small? Well, it depends on how, you know, this upper bound on the noise that you pick every time you pick up a measurement. Pick up a measurement. It depends on the Lipschitz constant of this background source and some constant and also the value of this vector g. But for beta small enough, this is small. And of course, this we can't control. It's just sigma. So this is the noise that we have. So that's. So this is then if there are no. So that this is then, if there are no bursts, this is what happens. So then, if there are bursts, if this doesn't happen, then we know that there is a burst. They have to be a burst. And so we have a way now of knowing when a burst occurs. So when, and that gives me an idea of what when TJ occurs, one of these TJ. One of these TJ happens. And also, once I know Tj, and I know that the bursts occur somewhere, then I need to also figure out what is the value that multiply this thing. So once this threshold is passed, then we have to essentially To essentially find the inner product of this fj with all my vectors j and how do I find them? So of course, there are noise, so I'm not going to find them exactly. And also there's a background term, but they are going to be approximately equal to actually this difference. And this is a difference. And this is a difference that essentially we use to get that threshold. And if we use that, we can, in fact, prove and have an estimate of essentially we can always approximate our function f by another function, let's call it f tilde. And the times, of course, we can't get them. Times, of course, we can't get them precisely, but we can get them within our time interval that we choose, the beta, beta over two. And our functions are kind of within our f tilde j that we get from this approximation or from these things that from our frame, if you like. From our frame, if you like, are not far from the real FJ. They are within this thing, they are bounded above by some constant time sigma. Sigma, this is the noise. Beta square is the time sample, how fast we're sampling. L is the Lipschitz constant of the background, and D of beta. And d of beta is something that goes to zero and depends on essentially the semi-group. So this is the idea of trying to find or approximate the source term buried in some background and at the same time where our measurements are noisy. So the question is: okay, so we did it with some Dirac train. Can we do it with something a little bit more difficult or something different? So the first thing is I'm going to essentially try to look at the same problem, but now with functions that Functions that are of this form. So they start somewhere at tj. There is some sort of function here, which is not a Dirac, which is a function which is, I'll tell you exactly what kind of function we allow here, but some sort of function which have some decay at infinity. At infinity, but it doesn't have also infinite energy at equal j. So it's not nothing like a direct phi of zero is one, for example. So I want to, now, this is the kind of forcing term that I want. And it's not as easy. It's not like write the same, it's not solved the exact same way. And it's not solved the exact same way. It's still the idea of prediction is there, but one has to be a little bit more careful to kind of account for the influence. When the fee was at Iraq, then it's a burst and that's it. It vanishes and it doesn't influence the future time. But here, something starts, but it continues. And so it has some influence. Past source have influence on your. Have influence on your sample. And so, this is something that is going to come up, and we'll have to kind of deal with it and figure out if we can actually deal with it. So, this is the difference between this problem and the other problem. And to give you an idea, just how we're going to deal with that, I'm going to first talk about the I'm going to first talk about a very special simple case. So I'm going to take no noise in my measurement, no background source, and my function f is basically sum of some function fj in the Hilbert space of functions time an exponential. The phi is now an exponential that decays. The phi is now an exponential that decays at infinity, is the minus rho, and so this is the kind of term that I'm going to take. So, this is now my initial value problem. No background. My measurement has no noise. And A is known, but U naught or F are not known. So, as Or f are not known. So as before, I'm going to find a frame and add to it another set of vectors, which I'm going to use as predictors for what's going to happen next. If there are no, if TJ is not like there is no burst in the interval, some interval. So this is roughly very similar than before. Very similar than before. It's a kind of prediction. But so let's see what happened. So, this is the measurement at time n plus one. This is a measurement at time n that predict what should happen at n plus one from what I know at n. So I look at this difference, and that is what was called gamma n before, now it's fn. And if there is no source term, Is no source term in the interval n and n plus 2, then this term is just zero. But also, and that's what's really we want because later we want to kind of get rid of all kinds of things. Also, before we used the difference between this, which was at f n plus one. F at f n plus one minus this at f n. Here it's kind of the same, but we have to kind of account for for things that that kind of remain like once something once a forcing term starts, then it continues in time. So we have to account for it. So we multiply this by this term, e to the rho beta. But in any case, But in any case, this difference is zero. We can compute that, we can show. And however, if there is a burst in between, this particular difference is non-zero, and we know something happened in there. And then once we know that something happened in this interval, n plus one beta to n plus two beta, then we want to compute. This should be h3. This should be hj. I sorry, it should be fj uh hj because I decided to write everything in terms of hj from now on. But in any case, if I want to find this term here, fj, which I call h hj here, I have to actually do also something a little bit different. Not only this is what tells me what's the difference, I have to compute this. Compute this on two different intervals, the n plus two intervals and the n minus one interval, and multiply this interval by equals. Why that have something to do with a little technicality, but you cannot get it as before, like when we had it Iraq. So we have to do something also different to try to approximate this term or one of these terms here. Okay. Okay. So again yeah so so for this case for this case again same functions that decay exponentially fast but now let me add noise in the in what I sample with these vector j and background source and we want to know what happens And we want to know what happens. So, of course, things are not perfect, and this is the more realistic situation that we're after. So, again, as before, we can compute certain threshold. And this threshold is here. It depends on the essentially the Lipschitz constant for the background noise. Noise. It depends on M and A, and those come in the upper bound for the T, which is a semi-group. So the semi-group has to be bounded by something like that. So A is this number and M is that number. So this is where A and M come from. Rho is this exponential exponent. Exponent beta is our our time lapse between between samples. So we have a threshold here. And this is our noise. And K is actually here. We not only assume that our background is Lipschitz, which Is is Lipschitz, but we also assume it that it's somewhat bounded above for all time. So, under this condition, these conditions, we have a threshold. We obtain a threshold. And from that threshold, we can compute this difference. Remember, this Fn before was a prediction minus the value, The value minor measurement. This is the prediction minor measurement on a different interval on the next interval. We compute this difference and we compare it to our threshold. If it's bigger than that threshold, something happened. And what happened? Well, something happened. So we're going to estimate the tj to be at in the middle of an interval n plus. n plus uh n to n plus two which is n plus one beta so this is where we estimate things happen we're going to estimate the the inner product uh by this by this value now and if we do that then of course the real uh time minus our estimating farming is no worse than beta but also our inner problem But also, our inner product with this threshold is also bounded above by this term here and all this term here go to zero as beta goes to zero. So we are able to essentially find a good estimate of this as long as beta is sufficiently small. So this is the story when we have and how it differs from when we have a set of Dirac. When we have a set of Dirac, if we have this kind of functions, specific functions, which is a decaying exponential. So that is this particular case that we have solved, but we want a slightly more general case. And it's going to be guided basically by what we have done here. So again, it is, I'm just trying to go over what we do and how we came to do that is really by successive approximation. This is the more general. Approximation. This is the more general case. So the more general case again, so this is our initial value problem. Again, A is known, but U naught, F and A are not known. The measurement using a vector J is corrupted by some noise. The noise before, as before, is somehow is bounded. Is bounded above by some sigma every time we make a measurement, and so but now phi have the following property. It's at zero, it's one or c doesn't matter really, that's not the problem, but it has some exponential decay. That's the most important part, and so it is kind of like what we had done before, except now things are a little. Done before, except now things are a little bit more complicated because you'll see the complication. Somehow, if I go back to when we had no noise and no background, then for this situation, when we have an exponential, we could completely eliminate, kind of say that this difference is zero. This difference is zero if there are no bursts. Here, for this case, this general case, this is not going to happen. So, and because of that, we have to assume slightly extra conditions. And what we do is going to be slightly more involved, a little bit more technical. Involved, a little bit more technical. First of all, the time between two TJ's, TJ plus one minus TJ, should be sufficiently large compared to our time step. And also, so it's four beta plus some d where d is any positive numbers. So that should be, should be, that's a requirement, that's an assumption. And then, if we can do the same type of computation that we did before, we have a threshold now, which is kind of very similar like the threshold that we had before for the exponential decay function phi, but we have this extra this extra term, which depends on this d. And of course, the larger d, the better. The larger d, the better this constant is. This constant will go to zero if d goes to infinity. But this is the constant that we are just stuck with. However, we can make, you know, if this is large enough, this can be smaller than the noise, for example, so it wouldn't matter. If we know that the time between Between two bursts is large enough. So, anyway, this is our now threshold. And again, we compute, as before, some sort of estimate of what things should be. And if things are less than the threshold, then we say no burst occurred there, no TJ. Of course, some T. No tj. Of course, some tj could have happened, but we can estimate what happened then. But if that is larger than this q1, so it should be one, then something happened. And then we say that a burst happened at exactly time n plus one beta. And the value that we want to compute, the inner product, we can approximate it by this quantity here: e to the three row. This quantity here, e to the three rho beta fn plus two minus f plus one. And now that is also kind of different from before. Somehow we have to take two intervals that are far away from each other that don't contain the burst. And once we do that, we're able to estimate this. We cannot estimate it. We have to be careful how to do that. So this is again something new that have to do with specifically this issue here. And if we do that, then we're estimating this inner product. Estimating this inner product reasonably well. It is less than this quantity. And therefore, if we are able to have enough vectors or all the vector frame, we should have a good estimate of Fj itself. And so, this is really all I want to present today. Maybe I have been a little fast, I don't know. A little fast, I don't know, but um, so some of this work has already been finished, and we have it on the archive. This is uh right here, this is work with Ilya, Chris Chow, Kerry Colonelson, and my former student, uh, Long Show Wong. And they are the new result that I showed you actually are we just finished with my student. My student Gonglei. She's really fast because this is only her first year. And then what inspired a lot of this work, of course, there are many more of these things, is some work by Mary Bruce and Bragoti. And here are some two references and also really mostly that, but also there are these. That, but also, there are these papers that influence this one and others by Vitterbli, Shibira, and Ranieri. And so I will finish here and thank you very much. Thanks a lot, Akram. Are there any questions or comments? I sent a question to Akram during the. I sent a question to Akram during his talk. Akram, what kind of norm do you use to measure the differences? So whatever Hilbert space norm, so I think your question, let me go back and put... Yes, upon your first theorem. Yes, so my first, this is the Hilbert space norm. Remember, we have, this is an abstract. Let me try to find it again. Thank you. Thank you. To find it again. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, this is a good question. Let me try to put things back again. Where is it? Is that it? Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's it. So let me go back. Okay, so this is just an abstract initial value problem. Initial value problem. So, whatever your Hilbert space is, is what the norm we're using, right, for the theorem. Okay. I think you're talking about the theorem right here. Yeah, this is the Hilbert space node, the Hilbert space node. Thank you. You're welcome. Other questions? If it is not the case, let's thank Akram again. Thank you very much.
