This uh sort of generic I am actually going to speak about indexes of varieties, certain varieties attached to quadratic points. So let me start by briefly recalling the notion of the index of a variety. So we take an algebraic variety x over some field and so And so sometimes we are interested in finite extensions of the base field over which the variety acquires the point and so then it makes sense to look at the GCD of three subs. And this is what the index of the variety x is. You can also get it just looking at the close point of the variety. And so take. And so taking GCD of their degrees, which are degrees of the residual fields. Okay, here is the first interesting example. We take an affine algebraic group G. And we take a G-torsor, maybe not necessarily over the base field, but over an extension of the base field. Then the index of this E will be a divisor. will be a divisor of the index of the generic G torsor. So this one obtained as the generic fiber which you get when you embed G into G L N for some n and then take the quotient morphism. So, generic finer of that. It will be a G-torso leaving over the function field here. We'll give you this. So, the number on the right-hand side doesn't depend on the choice of the embedding into GLN. And this index of the generic. This index of the generic torso is actually known to be the torsion index of the loop gene. So it's a way to define index function. Okay, so end of the example, but now let's look at the situation where the variety x in question here is complete. is complete projector then we can then we have the degree homomorphism of starting in the child group of x, the total child group of x and going by push forward to the child group of the base point, which is just z. Which was just Z and the formula we get for the index of X is just sign degree to the show group and this will be an ideal L G generated by An index of the variety. So, this is the function with which you sort of determine the index of the variety. You know enough about the child group of x. Of course, only zero cycles are relevant here. The degree homomorphism is three or vanishes from higher components of the child group or in. But for me, it's more. But for me, it's more convenient to keep it this way. So, the very first observation is that the degree doesn't change under field extensions in the sense that if you extend the brace field to some larger field where maybe your variety looks simpler, so in my case, this can be taken to be the algebraic closure of the field. But whatever the example. But whatever the extension is, you have a commutative diagram like that. And therefore, you can replace the Chow group and the formula by the image here. So let me write Chow bar, sort of reduced Chow group for the image. So, in my case, this will be usually the original child with the torsion field. And so I can replace um with my child bar. This gives me already a more accessible formula uh to compute the index. To compute the index. Okay, so far for generalities on the index. So now let's uh take a quadratic form. Let's q over f be some non-degenerate quadratic form and by need notation for its dimension. Dimension of q would be d so now I can consider the n squared. I can consider the M-Grassmanian M-Grassman for it of Q. So this is the variety of total isotropic subspaces of dimension M plus a variety of usual gas menu. So M here. So m here is at this zero. I'm using define numbering for Garrismanian. So x0 is just a point, it's convenient to include it. And hex1 is a portray, so on. And it doesn't make sense to go over G over two. D over 2, because then the variety will be empty. So for the highest value of n, like that, you get the highest gross median. So what does it mean that a variety like that has a rational point, has a point? This means that the weak index of the quadratic form Of the quadratic form is at least n, so you can split off at least n hyperbolic planes. And so the index I am going to talk about fxm, let me repeat, is the GCT L over L, the degree, where the condition is that the bit index of Q over L is at this time. L is at this time. And so it's easy to see that this integer, the index, is a power of two. So it's more convenient to switch to the exponents. I write I n for the corresponding exponent. Alright, and this way I get a sequence of invariants attached to the quadratic. Invariants attached to the quadratic form which start with 0, which is I 0 and I 1 and so on up to I integral part of T over T. I I 0 uh i is is related to just the point, so so it's it's something non-interesting, but for the formula I'm going to correct. But for the formula I'm going to write, it's convenient to have it. And I1 is responsible for the quadratic. So it can be zero if the quadratic form is isotropic. It is. If it is not, then it is equal to one. And so not only this sequence grows, but it doesn't grow too quickly. So each next is either equal to the previous one or equal to the previous one plus one. The pair is one plus one. Since you can split the additional hyperbolic plane out of the quadratic form by a quadratic extension, you usually get this relation. So, first example. I start with an algebraic group, so I take for G the orthogonal group, the split one. The split one of a d-dimensional of split d-dimensional quadratic form of t. And so I take a generic g torsor and as any other g-torsor, it will give me a quadratic form of exactly of this dimension. The form of dimension d. Of dimension D. And so, what one checks here is that child of XM, this child group, is generated by the churn classes of the tautological bundle on XM. So there is the evidence rank Mikhail, excuse me, characteristic to is included? Yes, I don't exclude. Yes, I don't exclude characteristic, sorry. No characteristic to any of this. Okay, so chow XM generated, well it's a computation, it shows that it is generated by char classes of tautological. Let me write tau So let me write uh tautological vector bundle connection. So you sort of know know the child group. Actually this is very rigid subring here, subgroup. So it doesn't change when you extend scalar. So in this case you won't get any simplification when putting the part over child. So still chow, for example. Still child, for example. And so the computation goes through, and you can see this way that for any m, im is the index i m, it is just equal to m. And actually, if you want to prove this, it's enough to prove this for the highest value of m which is yeah. Yeah Which is res uh where the corresponding integer is responsible for the torsion index of the group. So it's actually enough to know the torsion index of of G which is uh two to the end. Is two to the integral part of D over two here. Okay, so now example number two, I slightly modify the group, so I take the special orthodox mode and then my generic torsor gives me Quadratic form, which is, well, this one was just generic quadratic form of dimension D. Here, what I get is generic quadratic form of dimension D and of trivial discriminant. And since condition having trivial discriminant doesn't change much in odd dimension, so for So for d equals 2n plus 1, we get precisely the same answer as with s in 1 and this Im equals m or any m and well actually the chow group will also be generated by chair classes. But if you look at even dimension which I like to Given dimension, which I like to write in this way, 2n plus 2. Then the situation is slightly more complicated. If you try to go this way, the child group is not generated by child classes anymore. But what you see is that, well, I mean the condition of discrement being trivial tells you that i n plus 1. That I n plus 1 will be equal to I n. And so this will still be the torsion index. And it's easy to see that the torsion index is the same there and there. So it will still be n and after that you immediately see that I n equals m for in m up to n because this value is so high that the condition of growing slowly Uh of growing slowly, so the sequence tells you immediately that you have uh the general formula as simple as that. Yeah, here I should probably already mention some names. So concerning the torsion index, torsion index of SO it's Mercury In 1996, using computation of the index of the Glypher convariant for the generic quadratic form, then there was another proof due to Reichstein and Hussen, this one from 2001, and finally, more or less. Finally, more or less the proof I described is written in Takara's paper, which I am going to cite a lot, which is actually devoted to the stim group. But this one is also switched there. They're using algebraic cycles. Okay, and so here I come to my basic example, which I will treat for the rest of the talk. Now I take Of the talk. Now I take for G the spin group, split spin group, spin of G. So excuse me, energy what's up? There's no torsion and the charger. That's right, that's right. So there is no torsion. Well, again, it's simpler and it's written somehow for odd dimension. And for even dimension, as I said, you have some additional generator, but I think it's easy to see. Generator, but I think it's easy to see that there is still no torsion for the generic torso. So now we take generic torsor under this ping group and so the quadratic, the generic quadratic form we get has a trivial discriminant and Clifford invariant. Discriminant cube and Clifford invariant of cube Of Q are to your and so the situation becomes much more difficult. I start with the result on the torsion index, which is from the paper of Potara I mentioned already. Yeah, maybe I first fix my notation. So my dimension D will always be 2n plus 1 or 2n plus 2. And so the indexes, the exponents of the indexes, I want to determine. Of the indexes I want to determine are actually I1 and it goes up to In. There is also In plus 1 in even dimension, but it is equal to In. So stick with those. Okay, and as usual, the highest index we have here is the torsion index, like the IT for it. Index the IT for it, the torsion index of the group, and it has been determined by Totaro in 2005. And here is the answer. So you take maximum integer r such that 2 to the r minus 1, this number doesn't exceed the dimension of Exceed the dimension of the highest Gauss magnet attached to the quadratic form, and this dimension is mn plus 1 over 2. So you take this r and then you know that t is equal to just to n minus r. So you remember in the orthogonal case we had n and so now the And so now the torsion index goes down by r, depending on this condition. Well, it's almost always like that, but in some rare cases, it's n minus r plus 1. So those rare cases were determined precisely by Tutaro. These are the cases where n is the power of 2 or slightly larger. But in the end, you see that in the 100% of cases You get the first formula. Well, I mean, asymptotically. Because the situation where you get the second answer occurs very rarely. Okay, but to describe precisely when you have which situation, well it's it's it's quite tricky, so it's formulated in Totara's paper, but I won't be able to reproduce it here right now. Consider here right now. Okay, so let's look what happens with small t. Well, if t is less or equal to 6, then the torsion index is 0, meaning that I n, the last index, is 0, and so all other indexes are 0 too. I think Nothing to worry about here. Now for D equals 7 up to 12, the torsion index is 1. And so then the question is: what is the first exponent which is equal to 1? So our series of exponents. So our series of exponents starts with 0 and we end with 1. So we only need to see where it is that we get 1 for the first time. And it actually almost always I1, which is 1. So if t is different from 10, then already I1 is equal to 1. Then we are done. So the dimension 10 is special because of fisters result on 10-dimensional forces in IQ, that they are all isotropic. So T10, and we know by the twister that I uh I1 is still 0, the form is isotropic, but then it's easy to see that I2 is 1. So this way we get everything patient 2. Okay, next case is when looking at dimensions. So we went up to 12 here. So the next case is 13, 14. So this dimension always come in pairs like that. Come in pairs like that, 2n plus 1, 20 plus 2. Those pairs have common torsion limits, right? Torsion exponent that other indexes are the same as well, aside from this special case of d equals ten. But well, this is sort of conjecture. In any case, what is known that In any case, what is known is that those indexes are very close for dimension 20 plus 1 and 20 plus 2. Some relations. Yeah. In the case of T for sound as well for a different intent, is that obviously? Well, you just need to know that there is a quadratic, an isotropic quadratic form, not necessarily the generic one, just take a form you like, which has trivial discriminant, trivial Clifford invariant, and that the Trigger Cliffant invariant and the dimension you want. So you start with Tim Fister form and sub form for dimension one. Case by case basis. Yeah, you can do case by case. But since we have general well, I'm going to present sort of a general approach to all of this, but of course in small-dimensional cases, you don't really need it. It. Okay, so for 13 and 14, the torsion exponent T is 2. The last exponent I n is 2 here. And again, it's easy to see that already I one is one, but then you still need some work because Then you still need some work because you need to see where you switch to to the value two, right? Is it already I two that is equal to two or not? And this was a theorem due to four people, actually two pairs of people. So the first pair was Hoffmann Timori, and the second pair And the second pair was Yves Bolden and myself. And well, the result was obtained at the same time, but our journey was slower, so that one is zero, and that one is ninety-eight. And well uh it wasn't formulated that way, but equivalent uh statement But the equivalent statement is that phi 2 equals well that was actually about the existence of sub form of dimension 4 and of the real discriminant inside of my generic quadratic form. And the question was raised after the talk of Marcus Rost at the Lumini conference in 1994. At the Lumini conference in 1994, where he showed the proof giving classification, parameterization of 14-dimensional quadratic forms in IQ, 14-dimensional quadratic forms with trivial discriminant and quifact invariant. And then I guess it was Bruno-Kahn who noticed that there is a mistake in the proof. So the proof is still real, but it proves a Wicker statement, actually. So instead of saying that every 14 Instead of saying that every 14-dimensional quadratic form is similar to a difference of two three-fisted forms, you get that it is similar to a Charlotte transfer from a quadratic extension of just one, of just one seven-dimensional Fister neighbor of a three-fifter form. So, whatever, in the case where the quadratic explanation. Quadratic extension you use for the child transfer is split. You get the older description, and well, there was no proof for that. But it was still unclear if the older description holds or not. And so these were counterexamples to the original statement of Marcus, so constructed here and there. And I think in our paper, we already use. In our paper we already use uh play it with algebraic cycles to get this uh the proof here uh was uh entirely different okay and I want to rewrite uh this statement uh as follows so 2 is t 2 2 is the torsion exponent here right so what it says is that i t equals t and torsion actually we have this formula before all the time as well well. Up here, this formula is the same as I t equals t because t is 1 and even there the formula i t equals t false because t equals 0 here. And so then I proved in 2017 That this formula also calls for the next pair of dimensions, for d equals 15 and 16. And so at that point it was natural to think that it will continue like that. So the only exclusion we had uh with dimension ten here. I mentioned 10 here. You see, I1 equals 0. It's the formula saying that I t equals T minus 1, not T. But it really looked like some low-dimensional extension, the exception, sorry. The expectation was that it will... The expectation was that it will continue like that. And so, what happened next? So, I probably first cite a result of Kerpur with me abrie. This is just 22, published in 22. That in general, I t can only take two values, either it's t or t minus one. T of T minus one. And this is for energy. So at least the formulas we have seen before cover everything. And then there is a preprint of mine already from this year where I show that for the next pair after this one. Pair after this one. So therefore D equals seventeen, eighteen, I t is t minus one, not t. And it really looks like we have some, well, well, it's quite surprising because it's sort of positive result on uh our quadratic forms, which still dispigment and invariant, in that high dimension. Yea. High dimension, yeah, and so normally you have negative results, and the more dimension grows, you have more negative results. For instance, I was talking somewhere here about the property having a sub form of trivial discriminant in dimension, like here. This property was studied. This property was studied in full generality by Chernamusev and Mirkuriev the paper of 2017 14 even 14 and so they show that in higher dimensions higher than that so starting from 15 Higher than that, so starting from 15, you never have sub-form of trivial discriminant inside of your form. Well, there is one exclusion where they were not able to get any result. It's about 18-dimensional subform for t equals 15 and 16. But otherwise, for higher-dimensional four-dimensions like that, for instance, there are no proper subforms of trivial even dimensions. Forms of trivial even-dimensional subforms of trivial discriminant here. Well, existence of such sub forms could be an explanation for this result, but there are unknown of them. So quite surprising, this result. It was actually obtained a little bit earlier by some computer comput involving some proof, involved some computer computations, but so now there is mathematical proof. There is mathematical proof for this. So this case is closed as well. So I zero percent utero formula. Does it apply to any of these small dimensions and use n length? Well, I think it first appears when n equals eight. So exactly. So exactly here the torsion index takes the second value, the value which virtually never takes if you look asymptotically. Right. And then it's 16 and then it's 32 and 33. So yeah, I probably need to say first why I'm paying so much attention. Paying so much attention to this IT. So if I t would be t, then you immediately get the formula for all other exponents. So Im will be equal to m for m up to t and im will be equal to t for the remaining angle, for m. The remaining n for m starting from t. Okay, so because of this, I will call it critical exponent. Critical. So it's sort of most important among all others. And so the critical exponent in principle can take only two values. So either it is high, the value is t, or is high, the value is t, or if it's low, the value is t minus one. And before I go further, I must say that the current approach to computation of all these indexes was founded in in a paper by basics were developed in a paper by Diratov. So one more name to put. So one more name to put Mirkuriff and myself published in 21 and there were several other papers following this one. Okay, and here is one final statement which is based on this one and for the followers. And which gives you a sort of general recipe of how to determine the arbitrary index in the sequence. So you take n dimension D and you look at the child group of Xn over the algebraic closure and you consider the subring generated just by all charing classes. churn classes. Chern classes of all vector bundles on the variety X and bar. All churn classes. And so the statement, so it's very very difficult statement, so the proof is contained in several papers, says very short thing that it suffices to That it suffices to apply the degree of homomorphism to this suffering, and what you get is what you are looking for. So it's 2 to Im the index of the M square minion times. A couple of remarks. Well, first of all, it's clear that Well, uh first of all it's clear that uh this C C is contained is actually contained actually sits inside of the reduced child wood. So all all it contain all elements it contains come from the base field okay so this one is so you your vector bundles are defined about the base. Oh, this is what I'm going to tell you. So you use that G is simply connected. G is simply connected. Connected. So you see that the K0 of the variety Xm over the base field is the same as K0 over any extension. And so, because of that, all churn classes come from the piece of that. So you have this formula. So you always can take this. You always can take this, this is not too much. But there might be some other elements in the reduced char group you need, right? Well, my second point is that for odd G, what actually follows from our proofs is that the reduced shell group of Xm precisely equals what needs to be Equal is generated by the chart classes of some vector bundles. But for even the inclusion is strict in general, some inclusion, so you don't have equality here for even d. So it's some additional work which will show you that the formula is still true. So you have some additional elements to take. Additional elements to take care of, but they don't bring anything more to the image. So you can already calculate the corresponding exponent just using the chart passes. Do we need some exact vector bundles or just the automatic state? You're right, I don't need all vector bundles and this also follows from the proof and I'm going to say what I need precisely. I need precisely. So, uh what I precisely need is basically the topological vector bundle and then uh vector bundle related to the spin presentation or half spin presentation, depending on and for that one, yeah, I only need the highest chart plus which will make the final formula even more accessible than that one, of course. But well just for for simplicity of the statement, I start with that. I start with that. And well, maybe I should say a couple of words about the way of proving. Well, there is a formula for the reduced child group of Xm, which is given by the image of a classifying space of P. Well, first of all, you write Xm, as bar and as G, the speed group modular appropriate parabolic subgroup. And then you use a classifying space of P. Use the classifying space of P and its child group, and you look at the image of the standard map to the child group we are working with. And this is known to be Chao bar of Xm. Well, the problem here is this guy because well since simple part of P is the certain skin group. Certain spin group, namely spin T minus 2m. So when M is close to the maximal value, then this doesn't make you any problem. So in the case of the highest gas main, for instance, you don't have a problem here. But when M becomes smaller, well, in order to compute anything about P, you certainly need to understand Understand the thing about the spin group first. And this is not known how to compute the charing of the classified space. Yeah. By the way, for my statement here to be precise, I think I need to replace XM by the plug you write sitting inside of the product. So just by some. Inside of the product, so just by some technical reason, it's easier to work with that one. But it has the same index as the original one, but it has a simpler corresponding parabolic subgroup to work with. Then the spin group is just a semi-simple part of P group yeah. Yeah, and so what we do here to overcome this problem, we decompose this arrow. So this goes through the chowing of the split maximal torus inside of P, right, where you put, where you take the while invariance of it. Variance of it. So you can decompose this this way, and the thing here is more accessible. And so you compute it. Well, what you get is not generated by chair classes, but when you look at the images here, everything become chair classes in odd dimension. Okay, in even dimension, you have some additional elements here, and first you don't know what to do with them, but then But then you use additional restrictions on the image here, namely the steel topiations act here and on the child group of BT as well. And so the image should also be stable under the steener topiation. So for even T uh we also use stability under the steamer operations. Under the steamer operations to get more restraints on the image. And then it turns out that they are enough. What you get is still not generated by chair classes. Even the images here are sometimes not not cherry classes, but additional elements you get do not influence uh the the index in in the formula like that. In the formula like that, and so you can disregard them, and then you get a zero. Okay, so now I can formulate a slightly better version. So, as I said, inside of CC, which is the ring generated by all churn classes, I consider the subring generated by the churn class. By the chair classes of the topological vector bundle only. And besides of that, capital tau. And there will be just one additional element, small tau, sitting in the reduced chau group of in degree two. M of in degree two to the m minus m of xm and this is given by spin or half spin presentation. Namely the reductive part of P is related to the Clifford group. So you rather look at the special Clifford group than to the spin group. then uh to the spin group different group uh of the same den dimension uh as before of the spin group and so you have um half spin you take a spin of half spin uh representation of that group this gives you a representation of p and this will produce you a vector bundle on xm of the rank 2 to the n minus m and so you take M minus m. And so you take the highest term class of this, and this is the element double here. And well, the final statement, which is more suitable for practical use, is that you just need to look at the degree of C with tau adjoint, and this already will give you what you need. So here m is still arbitrary. So I'm going to specialize to m equals t at the end of the code, but as for now, m is still arbitrary. And to understand this formula slightly better, let's recall that if you just take degree of C without adjoining T, then what you get is the corresponding exponent for uh the orthogonal group. The orthogonal derivative, which is 2 to the m. So I m can be smaller than m only due to a contribution of tau. Tau only. Okay, so in the end, you just need to study the contribution of a single element, and completing this, you. Completing this, you will get the answer. Okay, so let's consider an example. Assume that 2 to the n minus m, the degree, well, the codimension that appears here is strictly higher than the dimension of the corresponding. Dimension of the corresponding variety xm. Such thing can happen. Then, of course, there is no contribution coming from tau because, well, tau is just zero by dimensional reason. And so we have I m equals m for such m. And this actually happens for all m smaller. This one falls Holds for all m strictly smaller than t minus one. So for all m below t minus two, you get the answer immediately. And actually it calls for m t equals t minus one as well. So it goes just up to the critical exponent. Up to the critical exponent in the 100% of cases. 100% of cases. So there is a precise statement like in the toparo case. So you consider intervals for the dimension going from one two power to the next one. And on those intervals, you need to throw away some initial points and some. Some initial points and some points in the middle. But in the end, the remaining part is 100% of everything when you go to infinity. And so the critical exponent turns out to be the very first unsolved case in 100% of situations. Okay, so now for Okay, so now for let me specialize to what d so d equals 2m plus 1 now and m equals t. So I'm going to tell more about the critical exponent. And so in this case, higher powers of t vanish so that you Vanish so that you don't need to consider contribution of them. So only contribution of tau itself may occur. And what you also see is that two tau is in C. So each power itself is out cycle. Itself is outside of C, then the critical exponent will be low. So there is some contribution coming from tau. And if tau is in C, then the critical exponent is tau. We have complete understanding of everything once you decide between those two conditions, inclusion or absence of inclusion. Well, it's uh more convenient uh to work entirely inside of C. And then what you need is to see if 2 tau is vanishes modulo 2c. So this is the question which we need to answer. 2 tau, is it divisible by 2 inside of C or not? Side of C or not. And so I just want to write down a precise formula for tau. Well, the thing is that C, the ring driver increases, sits inside a larger ring, which is easier to describe. So I call it R. Then you just take the polynomial rate in n variables, x1 up to xm. You will certainly recognize this ring. You want out then. You want out then the symmetric polynomials in squares of the variables. Symmetric polynomials in squares. So of course I don't model the constant, so I take symmetric polynomials without constant terms, or if you prefer, elementary, just elementary symmetric polynomials in the squares. And I mode this out. This is actually discrete. This is actually a description of the similar literature generated by chair classes of topological vector bundles, but not for the Ms Carsmanian, instead for the full flag variety given by the quadratic form. And this also happens to be the entire child group of symplectic Rasmanian, sorry, of symplectic full-fledged. Of symplectic full-fledged varieties. So, this is why you probably know this have seen such a ring already. Okay, so now what is the element 2 tau sitting inside here? Well, you get it as follows. You consider the sums x1 up to xt and then you continue with variation of the sign. with variation of the sign. Lus minus xt plus one and so on, plus minus xn. So you take the sums of all variables where the last n minus t signs are variated. And you take the product of all such things. Of uh then you get something exactly of uh of degree uh two to the n minus t. Minus t. That's the degree of 2 tau here. Well, by some mysterious reason, this product is divisible by a very high 2 power, namely 2 raised to the power 2 to the n minus t minus 1. Okay? And so you make the division, and what you get is the element 2 tau. And to tau. And the question you want to answer is: is this zero or not considered in during R module two? So originally you need to look at C modulo two, but you can replace C by entire R. So you just can forget everything you've seen before. You just have this formula defining an element in R, and you're asking if this element is the real model of. If this element is terrible model or two or not. So, if someone knows a culture, how to get the general answer, I am very interested on how to approach this. But this will be my last result, just last formulation. What I was able to show using this. So, this is the very last preprint. Where I show using this formula that I t is actually t minus 1, so the critical exponent is low in over 91% of cases. So, again, the precise statement just The precise statement just gives some intervals. So you go from one to power to the next two power, and then you remove something in the beginning and something in the middle. But I needed to remove more. And so in the end, I wasn't able to get higher than 91%. But it's still very possible that you can put 100% here asymptotically, even that you can put 100% here exactly. Well, starting from Exactly. Well, starting from say dimension seventeen, as you've seen. So it's there is still no single so the situation is the the converse now is converse now to contrary now. We don't have any single example where the critical exponent is high in dimensions starting from 17. But we have a lot of examples where it is low. And so, for example, just take some random. Random large number like d equals 2023, and then using this well, the approach used to get this, you immediately see, or using just a precise statement of this theorem, you see that the critical exponent is known in this time. So, this is so far what I was able to do. I think it's a good point to stop. Thank you, Annie. Questions? Next year, come in pairs, right? 24 is just the next you give given number. And if you know that the critical exponent is low for the odd one, then it is also low for for the For the conjecture, they are always the same, but at least I can prove. So, what can happen is that this one is low and that one is high, but not for this number, it's for others. So, you're saying that there are index, but does it mean that you have actually an extension of that? Have actually an extension of that degree over which you will see a hyperbolic plane or an isotropic space of that dimension T? Well, I don't actually get the extension and I also don't actually get the more precise result where you can say that you have extension whose degree is the power of 2 in the index, right? So you can try to do things more precise. Try to do things more precisely just to get some concrete degree of splitting extension. But this will be power of two times some odd integer. And I don't see any possibility to get rid of this integer. So it starts already in the flister case, I guess, where he says he shows. Well, I mean, it starts, the problem starts a lot. The problems start only in very low dimensions, where you can do things by different means, but this approach doesn't. Is there an example where let's say I2 is 2 and we cannot find the four-dimensional extension? As far as I know, there are no such examples. So, to conclude the IN in your theorem, to use this vector model C and R, which are So, my question is: if that extends to some other groups, that only uh can be like that. Well, I only can say that, of course, uh all these. Can say that, of course, all this you can try to apply to different kinds of groups, but in some cases, the dissipation is entirely trivial, so you don't get anything interesting to do. But in some other cases, it's too complicated. So, here it does in the middle, so this is why it is so interesting, and you really have a feeling that you can get to the end. But so I I Yeah, I uh yes. So that's equivariant. So you usually really get concrete vector ones, very few of them which you only need and they're all G2 variant, but a similar question, but in a different direction, if you take what that equation, a higher power of ideals or Well I see also responding to these tolerant questions asked. But this question has been already raised in Plotaro's papers. Well, these methods don't work. Well, you have some there are some other ideas to start with at least, but it's easy. with at least uh but uh it's if it would be if well you you will will be able to get some bounds but uh it it would be difficult to find some methods to to get the precise values because of absence of germanic objects and things like that. By some coincidence, you will get some precise values, but I don't know if they are going to So, is that a general phenomenon that would work for other groups or? Yes, yes, yes, I think so. So it's sort of famous that when you go from G mod P to G mod B, what you get is actually a split injection here. Makes it possible to transfer some questions about elements here to questions about the image. Questions about the images there. But I don't know if this is much of a simplification here. So I use this big R just for simplicity of description. But then you still want to understand what a C. There are C is actually the subring generated by first T variables and then the symmetric polynomials and the squares of the remaining variables. And you're better work with this or even with the smaller one because this is With the smaller one, because this is already some flags here, but the smaller one has a smaller dimension, and already by dimension reason, you are immediately done in certain situations. Forget about the origin of your elements, you are inside of this huge ring. I mean, it looks very elementary, this question, but it it is uh really difficult to attack by elementary means. So I have some plans, so you Well I I have some plans so using motivic decompositions uh to to to to study this. So like that I pronounced like a motivic as well, but this is not so far. You want to prove elementary divisibility that I mentioned here, it's not so so clear how to do it, but somehow it comes out as byproduct from considerations we which From considerations we general considerations we need. Well, this this yeah, this divisibility holds for any M instead of T. That's right. But uh for other M's For other ends you you also need to work with power so it's uh so that's a little bit more more missing. Any other questions? Let's start with Nikita again. We can have the time for the next one. That's important.
