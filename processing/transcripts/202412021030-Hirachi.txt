Thank you for the invitation. So this is a talk on Shiarajuni. You know, not conformal. And 12 years ago, we had a meeting, workshop here with the same title, Conformal and Share Geometry. And in that meeting, Jeffrey Case, In Jeffrey's case, define Q' curvature in three-dimensional shear case. He gave an expressed formula in terms of curvature torsion. And after, soon after that, I realized that that can be easily written in terms algorithmic, can be generated to the higher dimensions. Then that becomes one curvature in this talk. So So this is an introductory talk, so no not big seven. Just just motivate why we have to consider Q prime. Q may not be so interesting in Xi algebra. Okay, so let me start with the conformal case. Conformal. Conformal case so the keynote already defa into this Q curvature. Introduce Q curvature. So start with say P should be gamma ray. This is a conformity invariant Raplacian. So use your Laplacian plus square curve some constants. Then you can consider this gives a heat colour. So, this gives a heat kernel XY on manifold. So, now the manifold is M T over H dimension and compact. Then the trace it has such an expression A jump. As t tends to 0, so this coefficient is a function of x and depends on the metric t. So you have to choose a scale to define this operator and you get some coefficients that's a Niemania invariant. If you integrate this with our n p. So if you integrate this, it's conforming back. So this means if you change scale, so g height then you have a hat. Then you have a hat button of everything, but the integral is the same. So, in that case, this is called conformal button. This is the dom browser. So Branson Muste did much more. So they started with a general choice of conformer invariant differential operator, which is the electricity. You can do this calculation and get many conformer invariants by integrating the coefficients. And maybe the terms of this is equivalent to the power job. Q curvature N. N. So Q curvature is defined only for that even dimension. So this is the beginning of Q curvature and you consider the determinant of P2, the variation gives Q and that that's that new age of conformal geometry. So if we wanna do the same thing in Shia algebra, The same thing in CR geometry. This is CR. There's a CR version of the mother operator. But the difficulty here is that the Panett's operator starts with Sabre version. This is not telepic. This is just Sabre. So in this case, you can define here. In this case, you can define heat operator and heat panel, but coefficients are very difficult to compute. Because there is a pseudo-differential calculus in Xi algebra, but the composition of pseudo-differential operators are not algebraic. You have to consider the convolution, so you have to integrate the computer with mission, and that's almost impossible to do. So you can do the same. So you can do the same thing and you can define CR invariant, but you cannot show it is trivial or not. So so far there's no non-trivial example, it's not. Branson Erst also asked in their paper about CR case, but they will have answered this. So it's another approach to such a construction. Such a construction. Keep first local invariants and integrate this. It may give shear invariant or conformal invariant, even if the integrant is not conformally invariant. For the filters. Too complex. This is a paper BSE advances, about two hundred pages, and it ends with a problem session. About twenty problem and 20 problems, and maybe half of them are solved, but many of them are still up. So, what he Charlie Feferman proposed that following analogy. So, start with Lee Manium manifold. Have a heat kernel and you can consider invariant theory. Invariance, right? So, almost looks like this one, but at this age, there is no conformal as you matrices. This gives index for Ati-Singa index the most general setting. So In complex or CR case, CR can consider very much zigger. I will define zigger kannel soon later. Sum later, plus invariant sorry. So this is for some maybe this is n plus one. Okay, so the dimension counting is n plus one. So the shear manifolds is boundary, it has dimension two n plus one. This is like counting. That's fine. So, so this is the Lorentzian special unit group. It contains some parabolics, which is a structure group for the Shear geometry. And so, parabolic invariance here means the invariance for this parabolic subgroup. This should give something. So, this is a question, but no answer is. But no answer is given so far. So, what's good about this is the gate kernel can be computed algebraically. So, I can write down a mathematical program to compute the TR expansion of this ziggate kernel. So, in that sense, this is better, but there's nothing, no connection with the index. It's difficult to define index initially algebraic. Index in shear algebraic because many of the homological natural homological infinite dimensions. So you cannot define a dimension. So what I can do for the video. So first I want to talk about the colour. I mean from which location CR zone. The same thing is this. So domain is Cn plus 1 and the boundary is C R manifold. Let me assume that omega is stripped convex. If we are not familiar with the shadow convexity, we just go. You just go strictly convex domain. It just goes a ball and that's already general enough. And that's interesting. So in this case, take the final function. So this is smooth. So the final function is assumed to be smooth. On C on and D on undertone. And my choice is positive inside. Usually in complex analysis, this is negative insight, so but I have to change the sign. And later, I want to take a look of low, so I'm going to take this to be called positive inside. And then sigma is the Is the work about me? So apply B minus B by to the defining function. That's give a compact form. Compact form that means the weight is. That waits here. And so you have a once you fix the context phone, you can define the volume measurement. Of course, define eight two to be a There is a hormone function inside of a domain such that H has every two boundary. So this area should come from the volume element. So F square. So I look here the taking variantally valued means just taking limit in normal direction. So if the boundary varieties almost everywhere that is L2, let's see this space and this is Hilbert's space. Hadi Hardy space. Hadi space. So the space itself doesn't depend on choice of theta. This is Sumo's choice of, and I assume that this is compact and relatively compact. Okay, it's a bounded domain. So the boundary is, this is compact. Otherwise, this becomes much deeper. And you can choose a G. Also number basis sort of thing. This is an infinite dimensional space. You have to take infinite number of basis. Then sum up this is the ziggy corner the diagonal. So it really looks like heat corner, but there's no time variable. But there's no time variable, so that's everything is harmonic. So everything has eigenvalue zero, and so there is no exponential to vector theta. This always converges and define a function which is super inside and has singularity at the bottom. And has singularity at the boundary. Ah, one remark. So there are many choice of bases, but the sum is independent of the choice. So if you have a fixed theta, so everything depends on choice of theta. So if you change theta, you have a different L2 space, L two inner products. So also normal basis may be different. So the zigga colour may be different. Very difficult so I'm just and maybe put this has similarity of this form. This form minus one plus psi d law. Okay, so law is positive inside, so you can make a law. And is coefficient phi and sine is smooth up to the boundary. So this is a pole type singular ID and this is a local type single. ID and this is a local type. So everything depends on the choice of compact. So at this table. Now the boundary value. So ZK kind of instead has singularity at the boundary. So you cannot define boundary value. Not defined boundary by, but if you expand over side restrict to the bow. Let's trick to the boundary. So maybe around this year, but the published much later published version is There's some reason why I cannot publish it. So this Shi Riama That means Shi Ri Mariyama means independent of choice of Sita. So Sita is not unique. So defining function is not unique. There are many defining functions. You can multiply by any. function you can multiply by any means positive function let's say it gives another defining function so theta can be scaled so if you scale defining function you have a scale of the contact form so the volume form change and it's a local change so you have another bigger kind of and the transformation not easy to write down but if you integrate this If you integrate this, this is the intro single song. It really looks like the heat curve phase. So this is, this function depends on CD, but the integral is keeps invariant. So in one case, so it means m is three-dimensional. In this case, you can write down Down with expression, as I said, the gate kind of can be computed. I have to define some some so if you have a C ta contact form, the CTA gave a metric. Metric with compact structure. So this J comes from the compact structure of CN plus one. So HR, H is the R plus C. This is a complex form, this is a hyperplane bundle, co-dimension one. So on this space J. So on this space J of Cn plus one acts in Bunting, so it's become a complex vector bundle. And on this bundle, this two, four gives a Hermitian metric. It really looks like a K ratio. Oh, we have a metric. And this metric gives a connection I'll call star. Connection number is the connection. Ah, no. Oh, this is and connection with card alpha beta. Uh and potion. Portion. Not the scalp. This is the portion based like and in this case these indices run through so this alpha, beta, this runs through one, two, n. 1, 2, n. So when n equals 1, you only have 1. So I can only put 1 here, so when n equals 1. So it's already a scalar. In this app means you are taking contraction with respect to this habitology. And Laplace is a usual one. Apply adjoint. So this and this is scarab. So and this is scar. Oh I can put four indices but they said one one one one one. So one one one one. So this is scar so you cannot you don't have to distinguish the curvature and the scar curvature. So in this case this is divergence. This is again divergence. So zeta was d theta because over zero. So you see In three-dimensional, you got nothing, always zero. But interesting here is that if you scale the contact form, if you scale contact form, so see the hat is you should see that then. Then you got the two times sheet the minus negative is fourth order this is the shear invariant differential maybe GJS I will define it soon later. I will define it soon later. So, in this case, from this formula, you can compute the variation when you change the scale. The answer is quite beautiful. Error term is given by the linear differential operator. And that is conformant CR invariance. So, this is 1992, so it's almost the same. It's almost the same here as the Tom Branson defined Q curvature. So this is completely independent. So this comes from a Zigger curve. So later I so I found this and asked my instant what is this, why such a beautiful thing happened and he told me that is known, that's a Q curvature. So then I computed the Q curvature for a reform magic and turns out to be very like the same thing. Turns out to be the exact same thing. In general, for Q karbatar is just simulator, but Q carbature is, in general, the nature is minus n plus 1 h1 q sit plus p 2 n plus 1. So this is a So, this is called critical GJMS. So, for general Q covert this and in general dimension, this is GRQ. So, what's new in this setting is that So that's another viewpoint. So this key so So, the current of this operator campaign So these are called preharmonic functions. So this is the equation inside and has a smooth boundary. In that case, I can write down the equation for the tangential boundary operator to define this, but uh uh it it's easier and and helpful to And unhelp to write in this way. So it has so this P is defined on M on C. So after extension is unique, so you don't have to distinguish boundary value and inside. It's like a Hardy space. The boundary A two, uniquely determined hormone function inside. We determine the hormone function inside. So this is already demonstration. So let me call this the space CH The fact found by is three half function. See how much function hat strong. So long term has such a nice transformation bridge. It looks like a conformal shearing barrier, but not for general smooth functions, just for this pre-harmonic function. Just for this pre-Harmon function. But there are many pre-Harman functions. There are many Hrong functions inside. So you take a real part of Horm function, that's exactly the pre-Hawking function. So this class of scaling is big enough to do some geometry. Then this is when n equals one. An equal one. If suppose that this is a all-color invariant of CRMI policy and that choice of contact form at equal minus n plus one extra For any only then I see that should be the q curve constant. So q coverage satisfy this transformation rule. So if Hipstron is in in in freehamic function In freeham function, so this is zero, so it becomes just a scaling. So this is just a scaling. But this is true only for so for higher dimension you have more more choice and this is not true, but uh in in in three-dimensional shear, this is the characterization of Q curvature. Of Q curvature. Then, for 3 dimensionally well understood, but the problem is that what happens for the higher dimension, the integral, so let me call it because this is independent of θ, so I can just say this is a shear invariant of m. But I am. L M equals zero always or any M N So this is a reason why I cannot publish. So I proved this term, this is in my act. This is invariant. I have to give one non-trivial example. So I started to compute three dimensions and it vanished and start with five dimensions with some total free case and then always vanish. And try many of these and always vanish. Later, Lieutenant Mumbai said that this is some county called non-commutative residing. Non-commutative resonance. And the non-commutative geometry can be applied to prove this triviality. He used contact geometry to prove this. So the proof, I can't afford the proof. It's really sorry about com Fourier integral operators and like Operators and like quite different from the usual shear geometry. It's really contact geometry. So I want to know why Spanish, just in terms of shear geometry or differential geometry, but this is mysterious. So long term, just long term and QCA, which I was. Just log term and Q coverage, also Q coveraged. So here you have a Q coverager. You want to integrate. You see the C O H D C always vanish. Not just for the M A C N. Starter is abstract, compact, straight shooter convex. Compact strict sugar complex shear. Mindful Q curvature banished, so there is no shearing band coming from Q. This is a duty. This process is not difficult, a stock seller, and you have to use the And you have to use the embedding of CI Mineford and complex minefold and do intimation by path inside. One more second. So here I said that if you restrict the scaling function to pre-Harmon function, that's To pre-Harmonic function, that gives some nice property of zero hardened and nice property of Q curvature. So the choice of a contact form is also important. If you want to stay within this good space of scaling, you can restrict the choice of contact form. So one approach is the changing solution. We constructed the Einstein kerometric. It's a defining function of omega. This may not be smooth at the boundary, pointing but plus minus of UC. So they prove the existence and the point is that G plus is unique. So if you have a strict issue, convex domain boundary, then smooth boundary, you can always Has a complete Einstein k-ter metric. So the bihormox geometry becomes a K-R geometry of Einstein metric. So you can always use connection curvature for this metric to do bihormox geometry. Okay? Then U is not unique by trivial reason because you are applying dv bar. So if you scared. So if you scale is pretty harmonic, if you take log, you have log u plus function. Apply dd bar, then this this time helps because it's a prehamma. So So, I used to equation determine the metric but not the potential. Take care of potential. Once has ambiguity premium function, this ambiguity is exactly the scaling we want. So, let me oh my Mark, you may not be. U may not be B in C infinity because some lower class or two lower plus low when I read low, that's a smooth. When I write low, that's a smooth defining function. So you have smooth path and also have low double path. But here is some some power. So it does still have some differentiability at the boundary. So this all smooths up at the boundary. And the boundary value of this all is called obstruction function. Obstruction for the smoothness of the tenure oscillation. And if the the boundary value vanish, then all the singular parts vanish. All the singular parts vanish and u become smooth. So that is called maybe grams blocking grams obstruction function. This is CR invariant. You can write this down in terms of web style culture and talk. Okay, so we have a family of defining functions that you can define. C that Sita defined for you the state. The boundary is called Shido Einstein contact form. Contact form. So it comes from this Einstein condition that this term probably comes from the other thing. So Webster, the niche curvature is proportional to the metric. So it's really anich type on subbato. So this is the amino. So we have a nice family of contact form and it's familiar of the fine function. So this is a C. So M in C2, again three-dimensional CR. C by showing if I'm only QCD equals zero, I get so. Identical. So, which about this? This part is almost clear from the definition, but other direction difficult to prove. Maybe you will talk about this next week. So, this one was for adding dimension. So So if you start with a good choice of a contact one that is show I understand the Q curvature is just zero, so Q curvature say nothing. As a collaring of this theorem, you can say that omega is C2. So the the log term of the is a log of the zero. Or the if and only if this has just a power of defining function. There is no log term. But the There's no log term. But the that's not that characterizable. This is so-called Ramadan of conjecture and generally this is not true, but for this three dimension this proved. I proved this for the case with torsion-free in 1990, that is my master's thesis. My master's thesis at the leader, yet I cannot improve this for general case, so I'm very happy about this. Now move to the question: how to cause a global variant outside pseudo-einstein contact form? So problem. There again is a local invariant of shudder eye stand contact form that's that if you integrate this. So, I shita is some expression in terms of derivative curvature and torsion and contracting so that it becomes a scalar. And with some volume form, you can see that this entity the number is indicated. The number is indicating the choice of Schudo-Einstein conduct. So a Q-capager is such a Q-Coverager tool curve, for example. It's a Q-Coverger just cell. It has non-trivial example. That's a slightly better scheme. So M equals one. So M three such I see C D. I C C L sh should be some constant multiple of scar lines four times torsion squared plus divergence. So divergence of some torch curvature expression doesn't contribute to the integral. So this is trivial. Trivially you can add any indivergence. Really, you can add any indivergence here. But the point is that you have unique linear combinations such that invariant show Einstein that should be in this form. So So and it looks like this one looks new, but not not really the case band upstairs. This is disagree with the bands that Disagree with the Band Zebstein invariant for the three-dimensional CR mine for. So, Bandzebstein approach is the Chan-Simons transgression for the some Cavdan bundle and provoked the speedy measure of CR. So their approach is really differential geometry and more in favor of conformal geometry. But this is just a naive approach. Right down all possible time linear computation integrate is what can be the GR invariant. Then you can recover bounds of the invariant after some constants. Another good thing is this is a What we have to hope is that this can be between times q prime curve. I will define so that this q prime. And q prime is now a divergence term that is very important for the definition of the q prime squared. So, if you start with an attraction applied to the square curvature, you have to take the half of this. Half of R square and minus 2, this is the half of all torsion squares. So, if you put this divergence term, q prime is very nice because if you scale this. Q time feature plus this is a p prime operator, another shear invariance operator, and this is a GJMS, so it shot. So in this case, Q prime is not, so the error term is not linear here squared, but almost the Squared, but almost look like a Q curvature. And these are divergence terms. So if you integrate, this term just goes, and you got the shear invariance. So this nice transform rule is a discovery of K S and D, and they did this by computation. And it looks very mysterious at the beginning, but you can define this quite easy using ambient. For three dimensions, so this XP format is very helpful. If you're gonna higher dimension, it's almost impossible to write down. So you need more. Sorry, can you mind what's the P prime P at the time? P prime P and okay. I already find P prime. Yeah. Every single prime budget. Ambient construction. This is a Performance idea in 1979. In 1979, in Robert Nikolai. So, what he did is we filled up everything in the bundle. So, XP, just a CNN plus one, or so just add one more information. So, this is a it has some esomatic meaning that it It has some zero meaning, but let's keep that part. Then define use hash. So we have one more dimension. This is just a square of C. So in Bandur the C study actually is multiplied by this C naught squared, it's the homogeneous by definition. But this this is U this is changing outside. This is changing our surface. Then define the bar of R. R. Oh god, this is U U hash minus this turns out to be. This hand out B flat to the maybe inside over so this U is defined only on omega. Omega, maybe up to the boundary. So everything makes sense only in this subspace, submanifold. So exterior means the Einstein equation for the so G plus P Einstein. No, I understand this equivalent of each fraud for this lifted version. This is just the same equation in different ways of writing. So we have a metric. This one is much better because it doesn't have singularity at the boundary. So we don't take a lock. If you take a log, Don't take a look. If you take a lock, you is a defined function. It has singularity at the boundary. That sounds good. But this one doesn't have singularity. So it is smooth, not smooth, but has some irregularity up to the boundary. So you have a connection, curvature and And not fashion. This is not version, but this Lorentz is a Libre version on this space accompanyer. This is a basic tool to define variant object. This metric was Uh this method called ambient magic I can define Q under MS construction GGMS operator, this is actually so GGMS operators are inherent operator out on the boundary that that That the construction depends on the extension. So, first, given a boundary variable, a boundary function, extend to the function inside, then apply this time. Okay, so this is Trivially lift up to the bundle. So f is a function of omega closure and trivially lift up to the bundle, so independent of choice, sorry, independent of the node direction. Then apply this location to this other in terms of the distance. out that this is minus 2 times some function. So this is a function on x to the but it is homogeneous and this one is maybe somebody write the issue here. But but that's not important. Uh maybe some find it. Maybe it's a finite. But uh point is that if you the restrict this to the boundary, uh is independent of extension. So you you can define F by this. Yeah by this extension applied differential operator and the restrict back. That scales a boundary to the boundary. This is a GJMS construction and this every single thing here is shear invariant. So by definition this is shear invariant differential operator. In conformance it is exactly the same. You can define ambient space just to denominate After the metric bundle and add one more direction, then you can define leach fat prolifer metric and exactly same formula right to the component. So this is just a sheer version of GGMSO. So this is well defined. Thank you. Cucumber charge is given by embracing its extruder by log D naught square. I have no time to explain why you put log here, but this is not so interesting because this is log Z naught. Z naught plus log Z naught equals zero because this is holomorphic, this is anti-holomorphic. So Laplacian kills these holomorphic functions. So the Q equals zero. Then Q prime is same thing that the Seems that the squares this is the definition of cube prime or theta. So theta comes from So here I have to take u to define theta and then q prime well q this theta is given by this expression, the square what is p prime p prime p prime is f if I F is defined only for F being polyharmonic. So if N is polyharmonic, it has a unique extension to the inside which is polyharmonic. N plus 1 square. This is a truly harmonic data station and my priority noise. So this one doesn't vanish the differential may hit this or this so it may not be this is the differential P prime so the P prime Q prime defined just by my prime D's and you got the The point is that Q prime theta is valid. So we can constantly So many integral shear invariants for each dimension. So one construction. And in three dimensions, this agree with the case here formula for that. Skara curvature appression apply and this car curvature square minus torsion square. Two more minutes. Two more minutes. This culture can be easily generated. So we have the curvature can be considered as I J bar K O E C K C B L. So this is each form, this is a curvature form, then you can define. Chankras Chamcas on the bundle. And you can generalize the definition of Q prime to Q for the child graph is given by first apply D. First, apply D D bar all Z note square square weight chancross So this is a differential form and we can take trace to make this to a To make this a square, the trace. So m plus 1 times, so this is m plus 1, m plus 1, 4. This is the mm form. This is 1 over 4. Apply nice and so So if m equals zero, this recovers the two prime. But for any m, you can define such object. Then you can integrate this. Let's see how we do that. Since maybe essentially due to the KLT, it has different definitions of this. So this is many examples of the invariant. Many examples of CR invariant, that's given by the integral. The integral is not CR invariant. So, look, so the question. So the question, we get everything in each dimension. So dimension 3, we got everything. And dimension 5, this gives everything. This is due to Marugame. And for higher dimension, I don't know. But maybe other possibility to make this one. But but uh it looks there are many two kind in Seattle Germany and the many objects to the study. Sorry for the Sorry, what the hell?
