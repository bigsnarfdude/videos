Maybe a personal perspective about how what we're trying to do. So, this is a nice picture of an ice sheet in the Victorian era when you could sunday on icebergs in the sea. Here's a nice picture of ice flow, which is I usually use to try to illustrate that we think of ice as a fluid. That we think of ice as a fluid, and certainly as an applied mathematician, the way that we tend to think of the ice is as a powerful fluid, which is shear thinning, and that's usually called Glenn's flow law. The Reynolds number for the ice flow is a bit ambiguous because of it being a non-Newtonian fluid, so the viscosity is not well defined. But however, you estimate it, it tends to come out to be much, much less than one. So we're really dealing with a Stokes flow. Dealing with a Stokes flow, a non-linear Stokes flow. And so the forward model, as I see it, is to try and compute how the ice gets into this shape when it is forced by snowfall or by the climate in some way. And we will talk a lot about how that forcing works. And so this is often phrased when Often phrased, was often solved by thinking about a kinematic, a depth-integrated kinematic condition, and that always how it's done. So, we're evolving the ice thickness h with a vertically averaged ice velocity, which is this u-bar, and then we have source terms from the surface and from the bed. The basal melting or accumulation term is usually pretty small, so it's usually neglected. And you have to solve that on a domain where the ice. You have to solve that on a domain where the ice is, which is itself unknown, and you have to determine what that boundary is. So, in this two-dimensional curve, which is the boundary of where the ice is, and part of determining that is going to involve what happens at the edge where it flows into the ocean. In order to calculate, so typically the way that the numerical models are working is that we're going to evolve the ice thickness by calculating the velocity. By calculating the velocity, and because it's a Stokes flow, the velocity can, in principle, at least be instantaneously calculated in terms of the geometry. So, to do that, we're solving incompressible Stokes flow with this power law rheology. It's not clear that this is always going to be the right thing to do. There's lots of cases where ice has been seen seen to behave in a way which is inconsistent with such a simple With such a simple description. So, that may be one of the things that we want to talk about: is how much we attach our methods to Stover's flow. There are three surfaces on the top where we apply stress conditions. So, the normal stress is going to be equal to atmospheric pressure. And if you extend your definition of atmospheric pressure to be hydrostatic in the ocean, then the same condition would apply on the the the boundary in the ocean as well. The boundary in the ocean as well. And then at the bed, which at least initially I will assume is rigid, we have a kinematic condition where if there is any accumulation or melting of the bed, then the normal velocity has to balance that. And then you have a sliding law, which is where a lot of the action happens, which relates the quantity that I call the basal shear stress that's happening. The basal shear stress, the tau b, to the sliding speed, u b. I'll say a bit more about this on the next slide. And there's some functional relationship between those, which lots of people use different functional relationships. We might want to talk about what's the right one to be using. Some of them depend on the quantity n, which is the effective pressure, which is the difference between the normal stress and the water pressure in the In the basal drainage system, which we might also worry about. So, some people are actually solving this problem to calculate the three components of the velocity. But a lot of the models that have been used on larger scales are using some form of approximation based on the fact that the aspect ratio of these ice flows is typically quite small, at least when measured on the large scale. At least when measured on the large scale. And so the two kind of broad classes of approximation are the shallow ice approximation, which assumes that the vertical shear stress is dominant. And that can simplify the calculation of the effective viscosity. And this is, I guess, this was the sort of first model that people wrote down for doing ice sheet modelling because it was relatively easy. Relatively easy, but has some drawbacks, as I'm sure many of you will know about. And the other form of approximation is this shallow shelf approximation, of which there are a number of variety, a variety of slightly different versions of this. But basically, this works when the ice velocity is more or less uniform with depth, so that the depth average ice velocity is very similar to the basal velocity. Similar to the basic velocity, and you have to solve some form of depth-integrated stress balance, which comes from integrating the momentum equations. And so, this is then an easier problem to solve than the full stop problem. So, many of the models that people are going to be talking about, I'm sure, will be using some form of this. The different forms basically amount to how do you calculate the membrane stresses in particular. The membrane stresses, in particular, how do you average, vertically average the viscosity? So, an important part of this is the friction law or the sliding law of the bed. And particularly when you're doing a shallow shelf type model, this is really important. And so, the way that I think of these laws is that they're trying to parametrize stuff that you're not resolving on the large scale of your model. So, you have a large scale. So, you have a large-scale, what I call topography, which is the shape of the bed, and there is smaller-scale roughness, which is not resolved. And the sliding law is trying to describe what's going on on that scale, which you're effectively averaging over, and to arrive at some kind of relationship between this basal shear stress and the sliding speed. Which, in some cases, may simply say that the sliding speed is zero in no slip condition, and particularly if the bed is frozen. Condition, and particularly if the bed is frozen and very cold, then that might be the right condition to be playing. But different laws have been proposed, and I think the most common is to use just a power law, and particularly when you're solving a sort of nice computational problem. I think most people are using a law like this, and particularly even taking n to be 1, and so it's a linear sliding law. And the coefficient c would be. Coefficient C would somehow encode all of this roughness, or perhaps the rheology of the till that's underneath the ice. And you might allow that to vary in space and then use some form of inversion to try and infer what that should be. But there are other sliding laws which have been proposed based upon either measurements or theory of what's going on in this sort of micro scale. And the other extreme is a Coulomb law, where the basal shear strength. Where the basal shear stress is limited by the effective pressure, which is this difference between the weight of the ice and the water pressure. That's troublesome in that we don't really know what the effective pressure is. And so, again, you might try to fit the effective pressure, but that might be something that we expect to change in time. There's good reasons to think it should change in time. Jerome? Well, this is sort of a spectral question. Do you have a sense for the trade-off between knowing exactly where that bed is and what your estimate of the basal traction is doing? Those two things trade off against each other quite a bit. Yeah, I don't have a good feeling for that. No. That's something that we might talk about later on, I hope. Yeah, I mean, so if you, if, I mean, I guess one thing to say is if you actually knew exactly where the bed was, then in principle, you just Was. Then, in principle, you just could throw loads of computing power at this, and we wouldn't need to worry about the sliding or we'd just say that it can have free slip along the interface. And so, we and then we would, at least in principle, know how to do that. But we don't know this. So, this parameter is certainly going to depend upon what's the scale that we're not resolving. So, the more we resolve, so different scales of So, different scales of model should end up with a different style parameter correctly. So, when we end up with different parameters, it doesn't mean that we've necessarily done it wrong. But yeah, there's also the question of maybe we actually don't really have a good idea where this is at all. The ice should be half the thickness. And then I think there's a trade-off which I don't know very much about. So, maybe we'll get to that later. I think it's really nice that you point this out because people sometimes will get this major. Because you know, people sometimes forget this, maybe, that C is really also a function of the grid size. Or when you solve it. Which part of the bag you have in your model, you therefore have the form part associated with that function, which you don't have. So if you were to change your bit size, you would have to change C. Yes, I think we've got to. Anyway, there's also more complicated. Anyway, th there's also more complicated sliding rules, and I don't know to what extent people are using these in large-scale models. We might do a bit more about that later on. There's lots of other things that we need to worry about, and hopefully, some of the talks this week are going to address some of these. In particular, the coupling with the atmosphere and the ocean in terms of how do you decide what the accumulation or melting on the surface is, and how do you decide what the what I call the carving flux, but the rate of which is lost from the. The rate of which ice is lost from the boundaries, the lateral boundaries of the ice sheet. You might worry about isostatic adjustments, so the fact that the bed itself responds to the thickness of the ice. There's a sub-glacial hydrology, which if you're going to use one of these more complicated sliding roles, you certainly might need to worry about. And if you want to know how much and where the water that comes from the melting ice goes out into the ocean, you need to worry about so water hydrology. The rheology of the ice really depends upon the temperature as well as the Depends upon the temperature as well as the stress. So, if you want to include that, then you need to solve a heat equation. And both advection diffusion and viscous heating are typically important in that. And then there's also the fact that the ice in some cases is known to be anisotropic, which is already not described by that simple paradox theology. And so, there's a bit of a question about whether we ought to be including that and where. That and where. So, I'm not going to say anything more about that, but just those are things that we ought to think about. And I just want to end by posing a few sorts of questions that I hope we may discuss. So, I will just leave those up there, but things like what siding law should we be using, how should we be coupling things on what time and spatial scales, how many parameters or variables can we invert? Four people often say, Well, I can only invert for one thing. One thing, and in principle, if we've got enough data, we can invert lots of these things. Then there's more physical questions like what causes surges, so when the ice suddenly speeds up, and is it important for a model to capture those? That obviously depends on what you're trying to do. And if it's not going to capture that kind of thing, should we be using some form of stochastic parameterization to try and get the effect of that into the models? What controls carving rates, obviously, we're not going to answer that. There were lots of different answers. That there were lots of different answers known already. Are there methods that have been used in other areas, particularly in weather forecasting, that we could be making better use of? So I hope we may hear a bit about that. How do we account for uncertainty in the models themselves? So there I mean, how do we account for the fact that we don't actually know how it all works? If you think back ten years ago, people didn't really talk about cliff collapse as a phenomenon, and therefore it was not included in any. Included in any estimates of uncertainty, and so thinking forward 10 years, what are the new things that we're going to be talking about that we have not accounted for at the moment? And how do we account for the fact that we don't know about that? And I'm sure that you've all got lots of students coming to you saying they want to do machine learning. This seems to happen all of the time. So there must be things that we can use machine learning for, probably not everything, but what should we expect to do? But what should we decide to use it for? Okay, so those are the sorts of things that I hope we might be able to talk about. And I'm going to hand over to Steve because I've asked Steve to give a kind of an overview of some of the DOE projects that I think many of you are working on, and that will hopefully lay the groundwork for some of the other talks.
