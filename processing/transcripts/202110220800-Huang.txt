Today, the first speaker is Professor Huang from Georgia Technique. So, his talk title is maximal abandoned surface error for minor concentration. Okay, this will come. Thank you very much, and thank you very much for inviting me to this workshop. So, the talk I will give today is about maximum alpha surface area, and we have done it via measure concentration. And this is joint work with Galadi, Schut and Werner. So, I will start with the basic definition first and then explain what do I mean. What do I mean in these titles? So, first, we have the L P alpha surface area for convex bodies. So, I have a convex body K. So, this is a subset of Rn is convex and compact. And then, if I pick any point X in the boundary. In the boundary of k, I have a normal vector pointing outward. I call it nx. So x lies in the boundary of k and I have nx outer normal vector. And correspondingly, at that point, if I interpret it as a surface, A surface, I have the Gaussian curvature. And then we define the L P alpha surface area in the following ways. It is an integral on the boundary of k with respect to The surface area and what's inside is the ratio of the Gaussian curvature. I think this is P n plus P, and then this is the inner product of X and the point X as a vector in Rn. X as a vector in Rn and the inner product with the outer normals. In other words, this is the support in the direction X. And I have this is M minus 1, M plus P. But the point of defining such an alpha L P version of affine surface area is that they are invariant under volume. Invariant under volume preserving transformation. So means you can shift it and you apply a special linear transformation, then it does not change these values. And this is why it is important. And when p equal to one, this is the classical affine surface areas. And more generally, if you apply any linear transformation t, what is preserved is you give What is preserved is you give a proper normalization where giving a convex body k, I use this representation to mean the volume of the convex body. So by a proper normalization, I will have this value preserved. And another interesting property is the isoparametric inequality. Of parametric inequality for such values. So for NAP, it is known that for every convex body, the LP version of affine surface area is the same as the X-rays. Surface area is always bounded by the same values for a ball, where the ball satisfy that we want to have the same normalization. So, here what we want is the volume of P is the volume of K. Volume of K. And I think this was proved by Rukwa for P greater than one and generalized by Wenner and Year. And on the other hand, one might ask how about the lower bound? Can I get any meaningful lower bound in terms of the LP version of affine surface area? Unfortunately, the answer is not very interesting because affine surface area vanishes on all polytops. And therefore, what you can say here is that this is great equal than zero. And as a consequence of this, I have a question. Maybe. So, here K is a point of how to deal with. Here K is a positive how to define the ASP, ALP of as of basically maybe how to define the Gauss curvature. It vanishes, like not only for polytop, if you have if you have a cylinder, for example. This is just in dimension two. One of the curvature is corresponding to this figure. Curvature is corresponding to this field, like this, but on the other hand, another direction, the curvature is zero. And at that case, your curvature already vanishes. And following from this, the definition becomes zero on the polytops. I'm saying for this ceiling, the ceiling, the affine surface area is also zero in this case. Okay, thank you. Yes, and the consequence. Yes, and the consequence is that it's also, I'll just take the simple case when p equal to one, but this is the same for other p as well. Alpha surface area is not continuous. With respect to household distance. And maybe I should give a definition. The distance of Hausdorff between K and two convex body K and L is equal to epsilon and where epsilon. And where epsilon is the smallest value greater than zero, such that both k plus epsilon of the ball contains L and also the opposite. The reason is that for every complex bodies, regardless, Every complex body, regardless of how it looks like, you can find a polytope that is very close to that body. So it's arbitrarily close. At the same time, the corresponding affine surface area is zero. While, for example, if k is a ball, then the affine surface area should not be zero. But sort of because polytopes are dense in terms of half-torf magic, that makes the affine surface area. The affine surface area is not so nice in the sense that it is not continuous in terms of Hausdorff distance. So we are taking a different approach. So we know it's hopeless just directly try to compute the affine surface area of K. Then what we can do is that maybe we can try to compute the affine surface area of other convex bodies. Of other convex bodies, but definitely related to K in the sense that they are coming from bodies inside K. So we have is considered the following. So we have the following definition. It's the extension sort of a different way we try to define our fine surface area. Alphine surface area. Instead, we are looking at the maximum of the affine surface area for those bodies. So it is a typo lies inside K. For example, if I have a cube, I know that the corresponding alpha surface area. Is zero if k is the cube? But then, for example, I can find an ellipsoid or ball lies inside a k, then I know that, okay, the affine surface area of k prime is strictly greater than zero. Greater than zero, and the definition is nice that ISPK is continuous with respect to house-dove distance. So instead of just looking at the affine surface area of the body itself, we're looking at all possible body lines inside K and take the Lies inside K and take the maximizer. And then now you will get a notion different from R5 service area, but it's now continuous in-house dog distance. And you can also check this is also invariant under volume preserving transformation, linear transformations. Furthermore, you can check that ISPB is equal to ASPB for any ellipsoids, right? Right, because the ball is the maximizer. Elifer is just the alpha invariant class of the balls. And if you take any subbody inside a ball, then due to this alpha isoperimetric inequality, this subbody must have alpha surface area strictly less than the ball. So in part. The ball. So, in particular, you have this equality. Furthermore, if you think how is this related to K, then I know that AS, if K prime is a subbody of K, then I have ASP K prime is less equal to k. is less equal than the ASP B prime, where B prime is a ball such that the volume is same as K prime. But then this is less equal to ASP of B if I take B as a ball whose volume is same as K. And this is equal to ISP of B. Of B and if we take maximization over all k prime from subsets of k convex subset of k then we still have this isoperimetric inequalities so lots of the properties are preserved under these new definitions and Definitions. And maybe to give one more remark about this definition is that it is like finding the maximum volume ellipsoid inside a convex body. And this is John's theorem. Here we are sort of interpreting in the same form. Instead of finding a volume maximizer ellipsoid, we're finding a convex body inside the body which has maximized alpha. Which has maximized affine surface area. And with this definition, now we want to look back from this isoperimetric inequality. There, we know that the lower bound cannot be anything interesting, can only be zero, because includes the case when k is a polytope. K is a polytope. Now, from here, we want to know: is there something interesting we can say from the lower bounds? Because now we know this must be away from zero. We know this is strictly greater than zero. But can it be something nicer sort of corresponding to the value of the upper bound? The upper bound, and the answer is yes. Actually, it's not that bad. We found that the lower bound is proportional to ISPB, where you have a multiplicative factor. First, you have the norm n to the negative 5 over 6, and then there is some constant over the Constant over the isotropic constant. I will explain later what is the isotropic constant rise to certain power. And then we have this inequality halt. So it's relatively nice that they are proportional in this sense. And also it's only by polynomial in n factor. Polynomial in n factor. In particular, maybe one thing I would remark is that this can be improved. And I will show in the proof that how much can this improved and possibly the limitation of this. And so maybe just one remark about what is isotropic constant. K a convex body K is in isotropic position if the if the uniform random vector From K meaning generating a random point uniformly in K satisfies the expected value of Xi XJ is equal to Lk square but But then I would have a value. This is only when i equal to j. So that's what it means by isotropic. And every convex body can be translated into an isotropic position. Sorry, I have one more condition that the volume of k is one. Sort of this is the first moment and then And then taking a uniform random vector in k, then you have this expectation. I and j taking value from 1 to n. So xi and xn is the component of the vectors. And every convex body can be transformed by linear transformations to get into isotropic positions. And there's a conjecture for this. Well, this is the so-called slicing conjecture, where that conjecture that the LK can be upper bounded by an absolute constant. Therefore, it's hopeful that this term can be just becomes a constant. And if your p is relatively small, then this whole terms this whole terms for example if p is a constant then this whole term is the constant okay and so this is the series please let me know if you have any question and the question is about how to choose these uh convex bodies right this Bodies, right? This one difficulty. In general, it is difficult to compute alpha surface area. It's very difficult if I so I guess some concrete examples that have I guess some concrete examples that have been done is like the LP balls. But in general, if I have given you a convex body, it seems it's quite difficult to compute the affine surface area of it. For example, when we choose K prime from the subset of K, we better hope we are able to compute or at least in some way estimate the affine surface area of K prime. Area of K prime. We need a SPK can be easily estimated. And if you think, how should K prime look like? Let's consider the following example. I have my convex body K and then say it contains the origin. And this is my Rn. Maybe I'll scale a little bit, say by a factor of factor of one minus epsilon k so this is one minus epsilon k then immediately when we try to compute the affine surface area of one minus epsilon k and here i'll just do it for uh p equal to one For p equal to one, then I'll get a multiplicative factor like this. Again, B is the same, it's a ball with the volume which equals K. If you scale down a little bit, the Scale down a little bit, the alpha surface area decay exponentially. So this is roughly e to the negative epsilon n. So this is much smaller than this. If you want to achieve a lower bound with a polynomial in n factors, then you can only hope for We need to expect k prime to be lines inside. 1 minus log n some c log n over n of k and contained in k. This is not precise that it definitely needs to be, but in the sense that most of the boundary of k prime should lie outside of this scaled k only by a factor one minus. Only by a factor one minus c times log n over n, because that will give you a loss in terms of polynomial in n factors. And this is what we are aiming. So this body in this perspective is very, should be very close to k. And so this is the constraint for k prime, what we want. But it turns out that one can One can solve this rather easily due to measure concentration. And as we presented in the theorem, it has a nice factor. This is just a polynomial in n. And the body K prime, it is very simple. Let's first explain what is this major concentration phenomenon. What we have is the sin-shell conjecture. So this is a Conjecture. So, this is about isotropic log concave random vectors. In particular, for each convex body, K for every convex set. One K is a low concave measure. This is a simple fact, but Simple fact, but we'll explain what it means is that if you express the density function, taking the log of the density function of this random vector, it's concave functions. And that's what it means by log concave random vectors. So the conjecture is that if a random vector is low-concave and isotropic in Rn. Isotropic in Rn, then I expect the variance is constant. Okay, and this is indeed very small. Maybe what I should write down is that due to the isotropic, I know that the expected values of the norm of this vector is roughly square n. And so what it means is really lies in a very thin shell of Lies in a very thin shell of a shell of distance of square root n to the origin, but the thickness of the shell is just constant. And this can be translated to convex bodies. What it means is that for most for isotropic convex body, Its mass lies in a sin shell at distance Lk square root n, where Lk is the isotropic constant we discussed before and with thickness. Constant with constant signals. Okay, so regardless of the shape of K, I know that most of the masses are. Lies in an annulus like this. As long as it's isotropic, regardless whether this is a simplex, a square, or any other convex bodies. If it's in isotropic position, the majority of mass lies in that regions. Okay. And we'll use this fact to prove To prove to find the convex body k prime. So to illustrate that, k prime is simply so first step for any k we normalize it means that we assume. Means that we assume K is isotropic. Since our result is sort of invariant under volume preserving transformation, and if we normalize properly, then this result has nothing to do with the specific position. So we can assume it's isotropic. And our goal, so I will take B to N. So I will take B to N. This is the unit ball in Rn and our K prime will equal to R of B to n intersecting K. Okay, so this is our bodies. What it means, of course, I will choose a proper R. This is our K. I know this is isotropic. It's volume. Its volume lies in a sin shell of radius n. This is my circle or sphere. And then my k prime will simply repeat this. I will intersect it with a ball, roughly the radius is close to that scene shell. Close to that same shell. So this is our k prime should be roughly equal to L K of square root n. Okay, so let's see why this actually works. And first thing is how do I compute the alpha surface area? The computing the affine surface area is computing the affine surface area of the ball intersecting with my convex body K. And this is strictly great equal than the affine surface area of I would give a notation here. Maybe I'll let L denotes the boundary of this ball intersecting my convex body K. In particular, in my drawing here, it's exactly these lines. I'm giving a two-dimensional. I'm giving a two-dimensional example. So, is this a green curve area region? And then, of course, I can simply restrict my alpha surface area lower bounded from the integral here. And here, I just use the p equal to. Use the p equal to one as example, then I have this. And why this is simple? Because this guy is simply the curvature of the ball rb to it. So I avoid all my difficulty when a face. All my difficulty when facing counting any region of k prime in terms of curvature, and besides, they may be polytop, so I may not lose anything here. And so instead, I'm just computing this boundary part, which is coming from the balls, and I do the integral there. And from there, it's clear what is the curvature. The curvature of a radius r ball is one. R ball is one over r raised to the power n minus one in this case. So I'll have a very simple formula. What I got is L s of R B to N intersected. I have seven minutes left. With K, I can bound it by the surface area of Surface area of those arc or the surface coming from the ball times R and here is m minus 1 over n plus 1. So this is my lower bound. And the question is, what is the value of L? Of course, this will come from This will come from our thin-shell conjecture. We want to show that, okay, L is not too small. And furthermore, we want to compare it with the upper bound, right? Upper bound coming from this is which is IS. Which is IS of the corresponding ball. Here I want to have the same volume as K, but we assume K is in isotropic position, which is one. Also, this is just the alpha surface area of the ball of radius. The radius is roughly square, and we want the ball to have Have it have volume one. So, but with the same calculation we have done before, this is the equal to the surface area of B multiplying by the curvature, which is again Rn to minus one and plus one by the proper normalization. So, Rn, okay, where Rn is Okay, where Rn is radius of B and I know that the top one, this one, I can simplify as sort of the surface area of the ball. You can think of the growing ball and taking the differentiation of the volume, you get the surface area. And from there, you get this is N times the volume of ball. times the volume of ball dividing by R n again n minus 1 n plus 1 okay so from here I can express a s r b intersecting k which is gray equal I want to extract this term okay so what I should normalize is the following should normalize is the following. This is L, and then this is N over Rn. Again, the volume of B is 1, so I can ignore it. And then I get a ratio R over Rn to the power n minus 1 over n plus 1. And here is ASP. Or ISP, maybe just to make it. And then it's estimating the ratio of these two terms, right? And if we can get both term control by a polynomial in n factor, then we complete this proof. So it's indeed a very simple calculations. Now, how can we do this? So, first thing, So, first thing, I guess we will do the simple part. We know that Rn is roughly square of n. For a ball of volume one, the radius is roughly square of n. And at the same shell, and we know that we will choose R roughly equal to L K of square root. equal to L k of square n where this is we know that for a convex body k if it's in isotropic position then its volume is concentrated at log sorry Lk square n where Lk is the isotropic constant and this one gives us where this is one over L K come from in the serum right if you Right, if you go before to look at the same, we have this C over L K pop up here, and the task is that use the fact that this is the shin shell, we can simplify this. Okay, so how do we do this? Know that the math of k Of K is concentrated at a shell of inner radius L k square root n minus epsilon and L k square root plus epsilon. These are independent values. These are independent values, but we just keep it abstract at this moment. That means that if I integrating, maybe more precise, it's like half of the volume of K lies in this shell. And what you get is And what you get is if I integrate in terms of the okay, I think I close to the end. I just add one sentence. If I'm integrating the surface area of K intersecting with this sphere with respect. With respect to R on this region, I will get this to be at least one half, and that means exist R such that this the surface area is at least one half over two epsilon and this is the And this is the part the serum completes with the applications of the concentration results. So the current record is by the new approach of the Chance KLS conjecture, which in short, it means that I can take this value as something not polynomial in n, but Polynomial in n, but strictly less growth slower than polynomial. And from there, if you go back to the theorem, here essentially we get this is roughly square root n, this is n. Essentially, what we get is n to the one-half plus little o of one. Okay, I will stop here. Okay, thank you. Any questions or comments? Han, can you go to the last page here? Right? So, what's the last constant to have and divide the two epsilon? Because I know the integral, just what's this called? You're taking the integral of a function, right? And then you know overall the integral is at least one half. So there must be a point. Is a point. I'm integrating on an interval of length to epsilon. So there must be one point whose value is great equal than the total integral dividing by the integer, the length of the integrals. This is what's called intermediate value theorem. And if epsilon is small enough. So for example, if since you're So, for example, if since your conjecture is true, I can take epsilon to be a constant and then I know there is an intersection with the sphere whose surface area is at least constant. I see, I see. But what I lost in this is that for the unit ball, for the ball of volume one, its surface area is proportional. Surface area is proportional to square root n. That's why I lost a square root n here. So even since your conjecture is true, I'm still losing a square root of n. Okay, I see. Thank you.
