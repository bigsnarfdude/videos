Okay, so thank you for the patience and thank you, Jay, for getting into work. So I welcome our speakers, Richard Bertram from Florida State. So I've known Bertram for a while now and I cannot remember how many years. So at first I knew about his work on the encrypted beta cell activity. Cell activity. But I love the first project. I've always liked it and I really love to hear more about it today. So there you go, Richard. Okay, well, thank you. It's great to be here, my first time at Banff. And it's great to get to meet everyone at this workshop. It's been a real pleasure so far. And I just learned about 20 minutes ago that they found my suitcase. Yes. So I don't care what you ask me. It can be as nasty as you want. I'm going to be in a good mood for the rest of this workshop. We go hike tomorrow. That's right. You've got everything you want. I can't see what you don't get. What the bird actually says try that again. Isn't that lovely? Thank you. That's what the male zebra finch does. All by, you don't have to do anything, you just put it in the cage, make it happy, feed it, whatever, and it will do that. And we know that this is the male because of the orange feathers there that distinguishes the male from the female. And so, guess what the female does? Let's speak closely. It doesn't sing. See, there's no orange. It's a female. It doesn't sing. It doesn't have to because it knows that the male is trying to attract the female. But actually, most songbirds, the song is sung by both the male and the female. So the zebra finch is pretty special in that it's only the male that sings. Listen. And so the story I'm going to tell you today is first about the male, because that's where most of the research has been done. And then later about the female and what's up with the female zebra finch. So why is the difference? Why is it that the female doesn't sing? Is it because the brain is not? The brain is not wired to sing, or is it because the vocal apparatus that the male has is not present or is not developed in the female? That's sort of the question that one could ask. And then another question that one may want to ask is, why should we care whether the female sings or not? Or for that matter, why the male sings? Why do we care about the male zebra finch? And it turns out that. It turns out that a lot of people have cared about the Merozebra finch for since around 1975, mid-1970s is when work was started on the male zebra finch. And so the reason for that, there's several reasons that neuroscientists have investigated. So sort of the broadest, the biggest picture reason is because the male zebra finches will learn. The male zebrafinch, as we'll learn about in this talk, learns to sing by listening to a tutor, which is typically its father. And so it learns the father's song by listening. And then it goes through something called substong when it starts to learn how to use its vocal apparatus, its hearings. And then eventually it can replicate the father's single. And in fact, to a human, unless you're doing this for a long time. Unless you're doing this for a long time, you probably can't tell the difference between the father's song and the son's song. They sound the same. Now, if you analyze it using sophisticated acoustic analysis stuff, you can see there's a difference, but to the human ear, they sound the same. And so this is a way that the lineage is passed from generation to generation is through that song, which is pretty much invariant over time. So So, you know, this sounds a little bit like what? What is this comparable to? This process? What is it? Yeah, I mean, the process that the male is going through, do humans ever do any of that stuff? What do babies do? Don't babies? Don't babies listen to their parents? Yeah, so it's not really, you know, so babies have they're learning a language, a grammar, but they're also learning how to use their vocal codes, right? So they listen to what the parents are doing, and then they go through, I mean, I've never had a baby, but I know this happens. Then they go through a babbling stage, right? And they start to make these random sounds. What are they doing? They're learning, their brain is learning what the mouth can do. What the mouth can do. And so it knows. Eventually, it can start to replicate sounds that it had memorized by listening to its parents. And then eventually you start to get some words coming in. Well, the bird's version of that is called plastic song. It starts to get some of the syllables that the father bird was making. And then eventually it gets it all red. So this is very parallel to human speech. That's the bottom line. That's why people. That's the bottom line. That's why people have cared about this since the 1970s, because you can understand human speech acquisition to a certain extent anyway, by studying the bird. And the experiments that you can do on the bird, you can't do on the human without going to jail. So it's a good model organism to study. And so it's for human speech acquisition to understand that. But also, there are other things. If you'll see on that. Things. If you'll see on that, that song is a very repetitious pattern over and over and over again. And there's lots of things that we learn how to do by learning sequences. If you can ask anybody in this room to go through the alphabet and they'll be through it in 10 seconds, then ask them to do the alphabet starting at Z and going backwards. Probably nobody can do it. It's really hard because we haven't learned how to do it that way. We've learned a sequence and that's what the Sequence. And that's what the bird learns. It learns a sequence of syllables and the replication. It probably couldn't do it backwards. It's like we would have trouble with the alphabet. So there's a lot of things about the human that you can learn by studying the zenith. So that's like big reason number one. And that's why the funding agencies fund them. Big reason, small reason number two is that it's very easy to raise and maintain zebra finches. If you want a zebra finch in Tallahassee, you go to the Finch in Tallahassee, you go to the pet store and you buy a Zebrafinch. They're from Australia originally, but they breed very well in captivity. So it's a very simple animal to take care of and to buy, to purchase. So that's a very practical reason. So let's talk about the male. How does it learn its song? Here we have a tutor, the fatherbird. Uh, tutor, the father bird, and then the baby bird is about to learn the song. Uh, all right, now, this is going to test my technical abilities here because we're supposed to be singing something, but we're not. Okay, uh, I just stopped it. Okay, let's try that again. Come on.  form learns the form. The father bird is doing what human teachers do to their students and they're saying, okay, here's an assignment, you have one day to turn it back in. Well, sorry. Yeah, but that's the way it works. That's the way you get them to learn: you beat them over the head and so that they pay attention and you. Pay attention and you sing to them. And then, if they run away, you beat them over the head again. And that's why, in my opinion, I have, of course, extrapolated this to almost everything in life. That is the reason that online learning does not work. I don't know about you, but whenever I'm listening to a seminar after the introduction, I start checking my email because there's nobody standing behind me telling me you have to keep watching this seminar. You have to keep watching this seminar, right? So it's very easy to get distracted unless you have somebody standing and like I'm doing right now. And if I see that you're not paying attention, I'll just walk up to you and hit you a few times to get you gone. So this is the way animals learn. And the zebra finch is no exception. So let's compare the zebra finch now to some other songbirds that we all know and love. For example, For example, for example, sparrows. So, sparrows have a sensory period, and they do this every year. They have a sensory period where they listen. And their brain is taking in information, forming memories of what they hear, which would be a song. And then they have a sensory motor period that comes a little bit later. They don't overlap. They come a little bit later. They don't overlap. It comes a little bit later when it starts to learn how to produce the song that had just heard. And then at the end of that sensory, notice up here, there's a sub-song stage where it's making random noises, basically figuring out what the vocal apparatus can do. Then the plastic song is starting to learn some syllables. And then it eventually gets crystallized. And that's the song it's going to sing for the rest of the season. But if you look at the zebra finch, the male zebra finch. Zebra finch, the male zebra finch here. First of all, one thing to notice is that it doesn't say spring autumn spring because once it learns its song, it never stops singing. It always sings the same song. It's a very boring word in that sense. But it starts, as soon as it hatches, it starts listening. So it goes through the sensory phase. And then after about 25 days, it starts to vocalize, starts to do subsonic. And there's a big overlap. There's about 30 days or so. There's about 30 days or so of overlap while it's forming the song by listening and it's learning to sing the song. So it's doing two things at once: it's doing sensory learning and it's doing sensory motor learning. That's a different form of learning, right? Because the brain is telling the vocal apparatus to make a sound. It hears that sound and then it does a feedback into the brain and say, okay, I'm not right. So I got to correct. That's a different form of learning. So it's using the template from the sensory learning to do the sensory motor learning. To do the sensory motor learning, and it's doing it simultaneously. And so that's actually one of the difficulties of studying a zebra thing: it's doing two things at once. And so how do you know which part of the brain is doing the sensory learning and which part is doing the sensory motor learning? Because it's doing both. So keep that in mind. That's one of the challenges of the zebra finch, the male zebra finch. But one nice feature of the zebrafinch, here's the zebrafinch brain. And somebody superimposed a beak on it, an eye, so you know where it is. There's a region of the brain called the HVC right here. It's a little bunk that is at the top of the skull, not top of the head. So you can get to it very easily by, in the lab, by just taking off a little piece of the skull, and then you can see the HBC. It's right there. And the HBC. Right there, and the HVC is the primary nucleus of the brain involved in song learning and production. So it's right there for the experimentalist to nest with it. And it's highly developed in the songbird. So if you were to look at a bird that's not a songbird, say a crow, it's not a songbird, it doesn't have an HBC. So this is specialization of the brain to learn how to sing with the HBC. And then there's another thing pointed out here, the RA. thing pointed out here, the RA. This is a nucleus that is a motor nucleus. So it's going to receive input from the HVC and then it's going to project down to the vocal apparatus to make the sounds. All right, here's a schematic of the important parts of the bird brain called the song system. So here's the HVC up at the top, and it projects directly down to the RA, and then the RA projects down. And the RA projects down to the syrinx and some respiratory muscles to make the sounds. That's called the direct pathway. But there's an indirect pathway that comes out of the HVC, and then it goes to something called area X, but then it goes to something called ELM, and then L man, and then L man goes to the RA. So this very convoluted red pathway is the indirect pathway. In humans, we have an In humans, we have an analog also. It's the basoganglia pathway, which integrates a lot of information. So, this pathway kind of is similar and analogous to the basoganglion containers. Okay. And so, the RA is getting input from both pathways in the adult verb. Well, the juvenile, while the juvenile hasn't While the juvenile hasn't crystallized its song yet, it's still learning to sing. This direct pathway is absent because the connections from the HBC to the RA don't exist yet. They come in later on during development. So all you get initially is the red pathway, the indirect pathway. And if you record from the RA the kind of input it's getting from this red pathway, what you'll see is looks like. What you'll see is looks like random noise, random spiking. The bird is making sounds. They're not the right sounds yet, but it's babbling. But there doesn't seem to be any pattern to what you see from the RA, this indirect babbling. So it's thought of as noise, basically. And then you think, okay, well, what could this possibly be used for, right? This is a pathway that just introduces noise. All right, well. All right, well, being somewhat of a mathematician to me is like, okay, if you're trying to optimize a global, do a global optimization, trying to find a global minimum, what do you do? Well, if you just go downhill, you'll get stuck in a local minimum. But if you want to get to the global minimum, what you do is you introduce noise, and that shakes things up so that you can escape the local minimum and eventually get to the global minimum. And that's essentially what the bird is trying to do. And that's essentially what the bird is trying to do. It's trying to match what it's singing to the template that it has in its head and trying to minimize the error. So it's a global minimization problem. And how is it going to achieve that? Well, it needs noise to get to the global minimum. That's what the Red Pathway is. And in fact, initially, that's all that it's got. And then over time, it builds up synaptic connections from the HBC to the RA. And then by the time it's an adult, both pathways. The time it's on the dog, both pathways are intact. So it does sort of simulate annealing, basically. The bird is doing it. And this is what a motif looks like if you do a spectrogram. So this, you can think of this as a power spectrum that is taken over time, over a few seconds. So it's a time-dependent power spectrum. And the first few notes that this bird sang, they labeled pie, these are introductory notes. With I, these are introductory notes, and then it starts going, then it hits the motif, and motif is blown up down here. And so you can see it has things a note A, A. So it just means that the first two syllables and it sings are the same. And then it sings a different syllable. So they call that B, and then it seems another one called C, etc. So this word has a syllable, a motif from A A B C D E F G H. Then there's a little rest, and then maybe there's a couple. There's a little rest, and then maybe there's a couple intro notes, and then it does it all over again. And that's the thing, it will do that over and over and over again as long as it's awake. And even when it's dreaming, it dreams of this. Well, how do we know it dreams of this? Because you can do in vivo experiments where you just stick electrodes into the HVC and you report while the bird is asleep. And you seem the same pattern of activity when it's sleeping as when it's singing. As when it's singing. So, this should not be surprising because I think when we're asleep, we probably think about talking. The bird thinks about singing, right? So, it's not really that surprising. All right, so that's the motif. And this is the pathway that allows us to apply some real quantitative analysis of this thing and see compare songs from one bird to the next, that sort of thing, because it really is breaking down just our standards. And here, here is a Here is another motif, ABC. It's a pretty simple motif. And here's one of the very special things about the HBC. If you look at remotes neurons in the brain, they're almost always spiking in some random way. It's rare for them to just be silent and then to turn on for a while and then to be silent. There's always some kind of random activity happening. But if you look at these HVC neurons, this is. If you look at these HVC neurons, this is in vivo recordings of 10 different HVC neurons while the bird was singing this. And so this green one is neuron number two. And what we see here is like 10 different renditions of the song. And the green, these little green things there represent when spikes are happening, electrical impulses are happening. And so this neuron number two is spiking. Two is spiking only at the very beginning of syllable A. Neuron number three is spiking only in the middle of syllable A. Neuron number eight is only spiking at the end of neuron of syllable B. So you get this very sparse and precise coding. A single neuron will only spike at a certain point of the song, and then it's silent and waits until the next rendition comes again, and then it doesn't. Rendition comes again, and then it doesn't. So, this is what they call a sparse coding of the song. And one of the big questions in the bird song field is: what makes this happen? What kind of snapped network do you have, neural network do you have that would do this? And how can you learn this? How does the bird learn this? So, that's a unique thing. You don't see this farce coding in many other places of the brain. Well, there are three types of neurons, the HVC. There's HVCX that project from HVC down to area over to area X. That was in that indirect pathway. There's HVC RA. This projects down to the RA directly. And this neuron is an interneuron. So these interneurons project just to other neurons within the HVC. They don't project out of the GC. And so all of the circuitry that goes into the song is done by these three. Is done by these three different types of neurons in the HPC. Well, our lab in Florida, Florida State, we do a lot of brain slice studies. So what you do is you take the brain out of the animal and then you slice it. And you do slice electrophysiology. You stick electrodes into the nerve cells and record from them. And we use dyes so that we can see which ones are HCX nerds. Which ones are HVCX neurons, which ones are HVCRA neurons, etc. And so, what you see here is that if you give some input to the HVCX neuron, some positive input, it produces a series of spikes. If you give the same input to an HVCRA neuron, it just produces one or two spikes and then it stops. If you give that same input to an inner neuron, it spikes really, really fast. So, these three types of neurons, this is sort of a Types of neurons. This is sort of a standard type pattern that you'd see across the population of HBCX endoneurons, etc. So these things, these neurons have very different behaviors in response to input. And you can develop mathematical models, which we've done, to describe what kind of ion channels must be there to give these sorts of response. That's one of the things we do is we build models to try to replicate what we're seeing. To replicate what we're seeing from the slice experiments. And then we also build models to try to figure out where the song comes from, you know, in the intact anime. So what about that? That's the males. That's like the bottom line of the male. What about the female? Well, there was a classic study by Nagar Maum and Arnold in 1975. And this classic study showed they were using nissal staining, which is the same. Using niso staining, which is the same people use to see things in the brain. They were using nissel staining, and they showed that the female had an HVC, but it was really small. And the HVC or the RA was totally missing in the female. And if the motor nucleus is totally missing, well, then the burn ain't going to sing, right? A very simple explanation. It just doesn't have the circuitry. That's why it doesn't sing. And so there's no reason to study the female. To study the female bird when you're interested in song production because it doesn't sing, and we know why. There's no doesn't have this circuit. But it turns out that they were wrong. And our lab used more advanced techniques, dyes, to we went back and looked at the female again because it had all these females, right? It's sort of embarrassing. You have a bunch of females in your lap. Have a bunch of females in your lap, you've used the males in your experiments. What do you do with the females? Well, you inject them with dyes and see if Arnold and Notabong were actually right. And it turns out that they were wrong. And actually, with these better dyes, we see that the female actually has the neural circuitry that the male has. But they don't sing. They still don't sing, even though it has the basic circuitry. That circuitry, though, is. That circuitry, though, is smaller, and that might explain why they don't sing. They have, if you look at the volume of these important nuclei in the brain, you see that this is a male HVC, which is probably the most important nucleus for song learning. And the volume of that nucleus is much bigger than it is for the female. The RA, motor nucleus RA, is much bigger in the male than it was in the female. Female and area X, the basal ganglia type thing, is much bigger in the male than the female. And then another nucleus called NIF is much bigger. So the female has all these areas. And it has, it's not enough to have the nuclei, but you also have to have the connections between nuclei, the synaptic axonal pathways, and it has that stuff too. So it looks the same, but it's small. Now, if you go and say, well, what about the individual neurons? And say, Well, what about the individual neurons? If we take some HVCX neurons out of the female, take them out of the male, and compare them, do they look the same? Are there intrinsic plasticity, intrinsic differences in the ionic channel composition in the males in the females? So that was another thing that we did. This shows the male, and this shows the female HVCX nodes in response to input. And you see, the male produces the spikes when you give it some positive current. And the female, well, it does too. And then when you turn off the current, the male stops and the female stops. If you give a current of the opposite polarity, the male, the voltage goes down, and then when you turn it off, you get a rebound spike. While the female does the same thing, it goes down, and then you turn off that negative current, and then you get some rebound spikes. Current and then you get some rebound spins. So, at the level of intrinsic class, intrinsic circuitry, these two types of neurons aren't all that different in the male and the female. Then if you look at the RA, HEC RA neurons in a female, well, it looks a lot like a male. You give it some input, some positive input, it produces a spike. You do it for a male, it produces a spike or two. So they look pretty similar. Pretty similar, and then for the inner neurons, well, there's really a bigger difference in the inner neurons. The male, when you give it input, it spikes really fast. And when you give a similar input to the female, it spikes, but not quite as fast. So there may be some differences there. But of course, you know, this, how representative of this is unclear. I mean, you really have to go through and do some statistics and get big numbers of n to see if this is just individual neuron differences or sex differences. Individual neuron differences or sex differences, maybe the intrinsic profit. But I would say that overall, the female neurons look pretty similar to the male neurons, and the circuitry connecting them looks pretty similar to the male. And they have all the vocal apparatus for producing song. They have the series and everything. So they could sing a song if they wanted. So here's So here's one of the advantages of the female. Again, the male sensory learning stage overlap with the sensory motor learning. So it's hard to distinguish them. The female doesn't do sensory motor learning. It only does sensory learning. It learns the male song. And that's once it gets a mate, it learns that mate song. And that's what keeps it together for the rest of their bird lives. It's listening to that. Is listening to that song, which apparently it likes. And so it learned it. It went through sensory learning, but it was not overlapping with sensory motor. So now, of course, one could study the female bird and learn about sensory learning. So the period has the age difference in any female again and maize provider for that string. It's listening during the first. It's listening during the first 60 days of its life. It's listening and learning some male song. Well, you know, you got it sort of. You gotta go fast. So it's so, yeah. And presumably, you know, it's not listening to this guy because this guy doesn't have a sing yet. To this guy, because this guy doesn't have a scene yet, just listening to an older one, so they always go for the older man. Yeah, well, I guess they get for life with a better, you know, like a bigger cars, bigger houses. I don't know. But it does have the advantage that we can study sensory learning in isolation. And where we can't do that with the male. But what is the disadvantage? But what is the disadvantage of studying sensory learning alone in the female? What do you think would be a disadvantage? The outcome of them having learned it and dancing or like yeah, they don't sing. So how do you know whether they learn the song? It's not nearly as easy, right? With a male, it's super easy. You just put them in a cage, turn on the microphone, and report. And that's their behavior. And that's that's their behavior. The female doesn't sing, so how do you know whether it's learning the song or not? They don't respond to it, they do, but so you have to study behavioral changes. You have to study, you know, is it now more attractive to this male that sang that song that it had learned versus this male that's singing a different song? And so instead of just turning on a microphone, now you're doing behavioral studies of do they go to that male more often than they go to that male? You know, it's just a lot harder. You know, it's just a lot harder. Yeah, you can measure electrical activity, but you know, but you don't, but that doesn't tell you, that doesn't tell you about the behavior. It doesn't tell you really whether they're going to saw it. It just tells you whether the neurons are firing in some organized behavior. That's not quite the same. Yeah, and you could do that. And I've, you know, no one has actually done this. So, because our lab doesn't do in vivo recording, he is doing feature. It takes specialized equipment to do the vivo stuff. But we don't know once they learn the song, do they exhibit that sparse coating pattern that the males did when they made that? Pattern that the males did when they made that song? I have no idea. Presumably, that sparse coding is there because it's making the syllables happen. What if you're not making the syllables happen? And what does it look like to be able to distinguish a song from another? We don't even know. We don't know what that pattern of activity would look like. So we don't know whether it's achieved again because we don't know what to look for. Yeah, that was good. Yeah, that's a great question. What do you think the answer is? Well, it's back to do people really learn anything from Zoom, online Zoom lectures. I have my doubts. I mean, I did a whole semester of that. I don't know if my students learn anything from that semester. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the answer is that you mean you can do that. Of course, I did this, play recordings of the song, and the bird does learn the song, but not nearly as quickly and not nearly as good. If you compare using the analysis of PowerSpect, you see that it's a much noisier song, much more variability, because it just is not paying attention. So I'm thinking about sort of this insistent tutor or teacher, if you will, are there any Or teacher, if you will, are there any in the male circumstances where you know it's not their actual father, but maybe an adult, you know, they have some other male figure who's training them, or is it always their actual father that's doing the training? In the wild, it would be the father, but in the lab, it could be any male. Okay, they'll learn any song. Are there ways that you could somehow disguise the female where her plumage looks more like Her plumage looked more like the or her family's, so that she could have that tutor, an adoptive tutor because it should not be taught. I mean, right? We could say, um, someone is stupid because they can't read, but if they never have a teacher, it's not because they're stupid, it's because they have the appreciation. So, in the women, the female mice, it doesn't experience sensory motor because it hasn't had that super. So, are there waves that you? So, are there ways that you could alter the behavioral circumstances where maybe there could be a terrorist? Yeah. Yeah, right. That's a great question. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. You know, because really, until we started to do this work a few years ago with the female, they were pretty much forgotten. No one since 1975 had really looked at the female. And, you know, so we've done a few studies on the female so far, but not that much. So, all these questions, I mean, why would anybody even think about doing that? Because they didn't think that the female had the circuitry to make the song. So, now that they know that there is that circuitry, well, maybe, yeah, let's paint them up, put them in the room with the male father, and maybe the male father will be stupid enough to think that it's a boy. I don't know. Think that it's a boy. I don't know what they're looking for, but or you could play them tapes, you know, and see whether they learn the male. So there's lots of things you could do to see whether the female could actually start to sing, but it hasn't been done. Yes. How many eggs do they actually were? Is there a female around whilst the dogs teaching the young male? Yes, definitely the female words are around. They're not being paid attention to. So maybe. So, maybe, but they are hearing the song, so you know, they could potentially learn. I mean, they could potentially learn how to sing if they were going to sing. Right, but there's so that you can, you know, one can envision doing lots of things to see what the bird can actually, the female bird can actually do, or one of the things. But, but definitely from a point of view of studying it, the fact that it doesn't seem means that studying it. Doesn't sing means that studying its behavior, which is recognizing a song, is a lot harder than analyzing singing the song. And that takes a whole other type of lab that does behavioral studies of the bird behavior. Okay, so final exposing thoughts about the Z-defined female. The fact that it recognizes the song and not learned it is a great advantage because it separates out sensory from sensory. It separates out sensory from sensory motor learning. That's the positive side. The negative side is: well, they don't seem to have learning anything or the rate that they're learning anything. And what is that circuitry doing in the female? If it's not learning to sing, apparently it's not. What is that circuitry? It's there. It's got all the same nuclei as the male. Is it using that to? To identify songs or not. We don't know. We don't know whether he's using that circuitry for anything. It just could be some part of the brain that's left over from evolution and it's not really doing anything. But usually things go away if they're not being used. So I suspect that it is being used as part of the sensory circuitry and disease effect, but one has to study that. Study that. So that's my story on the bird, on the zebra finch. And this was done. Our work is done with Frank Johnson, he's the one that started our group. He's the one that studied birds, that was zebra finches for a long time. Rick Heist is like a physiologist. There's a statistician, Wei Wu, who's been on board. And then some students who have been participating in this, including one, Danny Galvas, who is now a colleague of Eders at the University of Birmingham. At the University of Birmingham.
