I think was quite a surprise for me because I wasn't aware of having been done any contribution to geometric tomography, but perhaps. Well, anyway, so here is Did I put something wrong? Yes, that's what I did. Yeah. Okay, thank you. So my main goal is to present this theorem. It says that if there is a distribution, a function or distribution in the plane whose Raman transform Ramo transform is supported in the very thin set consisting of all the lines that are tangent to this domain. Then the boundary must be elliptic. So when I found this theorem, it was actually a disappointment for me because I had the other button. The upper button. No, the other button. Yeah. No, it's okay. Yes. Because it nothing happens. Nothing happens if I press the press again. I should press here. I don't know what I do wrong. Okay, okay, I'll try to write. I I this theorem This theorem, for me, it showed definitely that a certain idea that I had to solve another problem could not work. But anyway, I found the result perhaps had some interest, so I presented it in a talk in a conference, and Mark Agronovsky was in the audience, and he told me about the Arnold's conjecture, and that my result could have some had implication in that direction, and which was quite unexpected for me. I hadn't heard of all conjecture. So, therefore, I will try to explain to you very briefly these three questions involved, the problem that I had intended to solve and then how it is related. Then, how it is related to Arnold's conjecture. And if I try to say a couple of words about the theorem. So, I need to explain the terminology and notation I use. We are going to actually my result is valid in arbitrary dimension, but in the beginning of the talk, we have to stay in two dimensions. I use this notation. I use this notation of the Drauben transform, the geometric notation, the value of the Drauben transform at line L is that it's integral. But occasionally we need to use the nothing happens if I press I press and nothing happens. Yeah, I pressed three times. I did two. I don't know. Anyway, this familiar notation where Ormega is the unit normal vector and the equation of the line as given there. As given there, we need some times, and of course, we are not interested in the orientation of the line, so the Daughter transform has this symmetry there. Now, of course, the doctors would have preferred to radiate just the organ they are interested in. But very quickly, it was understood that the so-called That the so-called interior transform is not injective. Namely, there exists, if you have two concentric disks like this, there are a lot of functed in the bigger disk, such that integral over all lines intersecting the smaller disk are zero. And to see this, it's enough to consider radial functions. Radial functions. In fact, I can prescribe the Radon transform depending just on P arbitrarily, for instance, as described there, and get functions F and in most cases, almost all cases, the F will be different Different support of F will be the entire disk. Now, what if we replace the disk three times? Is that too tricky? Yes, but that was too much. Yeah, okay. Excuse me, but when you say absolute value effects, you mean you want to subtract something appropriate depending on the radius of the. It's a non-negative function. How can it integrate to zero? Of course, my functions are the difference. Of course, in practice, the functions are positive. But what is interesting is that there is the difference between two positive functions. Difference between two positive factors can be in this, it can be mapped to zero. So therefore the problem is not injected. Now let's see if I can make this work. So, for instance, if we have this situation, actually, it has everybody believes that there are similar counterexamples as described here in this situation, but it was never proved. Situation, but it was never proved. So a couple of years ago, I started to try to find similar examples in this case where you cannot use the same argument as exist. So I suspect, since the situation is not rotation invariant. Nothing happens at the moment. Terribly sort of completely random. Maybe you need to stay a bit closer to the computer. It should be closer to the computer. Maybe the battery is accepted or something. You can use the arrows on the computer. You can use the arrows on the computer as well. Yes. Yes. Did I skip something here? No. This is a new situation. This is a new situation. Yes. This is the left and the right. This is the right. You can just start to keep copying and shape software. Sorry about it. Maybe. But I I still can use this one. Yes, it's perfectly fine. Now we change this one. Yeah. Uh when preparing this talk I found a geometric description, which is perhaps suitable for geometric models. So can according to my theorem again the support The support of the Radon transform of a distribution cannot be contained in a set of tandems. Can it be contained in a small neighborhood of the tandems, to the non-convex, to an arbitrary convex domain. This is very much related to the problem I mentioned. And if slightly more Slightly more general question is one I wrote that how can which subsets of lines can be the support of a Rotten transform? One can illustrate this in figures. These are what the doctors call What the doctors call cynograms, the set of in the case of disks, the set of lines. That was the support of the example I described. This is the gap in the left figure. And for an ellipse, we get the right figure. Figure. But more generally, if we have a situation between two squares, the question becomes whether the support of the Laurent transform can be in such sets. And these shapes are really the graph of the Of the supporting function for a square. Now I come to my idea to solve that problem. The starting point is an example of a distribution whose Reynolds transform is Transform is set of channels. Let's start with this function. It's really a function. And you can see that it is big near the support in the disk and it's big near the boundary of the disk. An easy calculation gives this result. So the graph of the Rauno transpose for all omega as a function of p is like that. So So we take the distribution sets, the Laplace operator of that function and use this well-known relation that the Roden transform entwines the Laplace operator and the second derivative with respect to P. We see that the og distribution F must have the robot Must have the Radon transform that is the second derivative with respect to p of that function there, which will be zero everywhere except at two points. So that would be the Roden transform. And if you view the Roden transform as a function on the manifold of lines, which I prefer, geometrical thinking, the support is a set of lines like that. I wrote just two lines. Just two lines. Now, what is the relationship with the problem? Yeah, here is a definition well known, of course, by duality. So the value, the action of the distribution Rf on a test function phi is like this, where R star is the well-known R star is the well-known joint operator which takes, which integrates whose value over x at the point x is the integral over all planes in this case or lines that contain x. And yeah, this is just another notation where mu is this measure here. Of course, since I find transformation. Since I find transformations, map lines into lines, you can easily get a similar example by using ellipse. Now, I wanted to solve the problem. I thought, you know, just as the earlier, when we constructed examples for radon functions, we used the rotational symmetry to simplify the problem. Symmetry to simplify the problem here. The idea is to I actually need to construct a function g of lines in a whole two-dimensional region. I thought it would be simpler to construct instead a distribution supported on the set of tangents to that curve would be a way to reduce my problem. A way to reduce my problem to one-dimensional problem. Just as we saw. So therefore I tried this, but I failed. So instead I found this theorem, which is, as written here, is valid in n dimensions also. Which was quite surprising. Yeah, of course. I talk about supporting planes since the Supporting planes since the deep doesn't necessarily have a smooth boundary. So, what I have to say a couple of words about Arnold's conjecture and then explain how this is related to my theory. But Arnold's conjecture, interestingly, goes. But Honor's conjecture, interestingly, goes back to Newton. So in Newton's Principia, this famous dilemma occurs, which has been much debated because it was not formulated according to modern standards, so it was not agreement that it was correct, but finally some sort of agreement. Why was Newton interested in this? Interested in this theorem? Well, obviously because he wanted to have explicit formulas for the movement of the planet. And by a very, very clever argument, he proved this. Nema, I don't have time to explain the proof, but just let me say that, of course, the area of segment was what interested Newton because of Kepler's second law. And the difference between a sector which appears in a lemma and a segment and a sector. The segment and the sector is a triangle, and the area of the triangle depends largely on the corners of the corners. So I have to skip Newton's argument, which is very beautiful. Anyway, now in all dimensions, this volume function is trivially not even algebraic, but also polynomial. An algebraic, also polynomial. And then now Arnold formulated this conjecture or ellipsoid in odd-dimensional space. It's the only This is the only cases where this volume function can be algebraic. And the even case was settled by Vasilev, and he wrote a very interesting book later about it. And on the case of all dimensions, well... all dimensions where the remain is not an idiot sweet remain unsolved. And therefore people maybe beginning with Mark tried to prove the consider a special case when to prove that if if the assumption is stronger than indeed it And indeed this area function is polynomial, not only ampupi, but polynomial. Just the following that domain is ellipse in two dimensions. And finally, the problem was solved rather recently. I called Ovsky Mankuri and Jaskin uh Here is the theorem. Now, maybe you have already understood, but let me to be sure to say a couple of words: why does this fall from my theorem? Well, but it's pretty easy just consider the characteristic function of the domain and use this formula that I used earlier. Formula that I used earlier and applied infrared. Since the Rawlin phase form is the p derivative of the volume function, if the volume function is polynomial, the Rawdon, the high enough derivative with respect to t of the Rawlin transform will vanish everywhere. everywhere inside and obviously outside and everywhere except at the two points corresponding to tangent planes. So such a derivative will be that derivative will be a such a distitution that it cannot exist. That it cannot exist, according to my theory, unless the domain is extreme. Just two remarks. The corollary of my theorem is appear, as far as I understand, slightly stronger in these two respects. I don't need the smooth this assumption. You just move this assumption. And yeah, there can exist as you no function that you can have polynomial Doppler transform. Now, it remains a couple of words about the proof. The proof. The idea, yeah, I we need the description of the rate for the Rawler transform compact supported functions. Because as already indicated many times, the idea was to construct the The idea was to construct the Radon transform, the G supported in the Morgue set. And check that construct a function which is reported in the desired set and is in the range, namely satisfies this range condition, which is that for every k that That case moment as a function of omega has to be polynomial, homogeneous polynomial of k. This is very well known. Let me just remark that these homogeneous polynomials are the homogeneous parts of the Taylor series of the Fourier transform, two-dimensional Fourier transform of F. Transform of F. So, yeah, this is a parenthetical remark, which gives a new proof of what we saw earlier, namely that radial functions always belong to the range. Because constant functions are restrictions of homogeneous polynomials. Homogeneous polynomials of even degree. Now I have to assume for simplicity that the region is symmetric like that. Yeah, so a distribution of degree zero Which is supported on the set of tangents of a domain with supporting function rho can be written like that with some arbitrary function density function q here. Now there is similar expression for higher order distribution. For odd order we have to have A A. we have to have a to make the function the the distribution even in the path omega p, which is always has to be, we have to have this factor for odd j. So my strategy is to write down the conditions that such a distribution is in the range. In the range, and see what I can conclude about the supporting function rho from that. And in fact, I can prove that, well, rho is by definition homogeneous of degree 1. So if it's square is a polynomial, it's a homogeneous secondary polynomial. In a second degree polynomial, so it is the supporting function of a second degree of a big ellipse, sorry. So what does this involve? A couple of minutes. We have to compute the moments for each term. For each terms in the expression that I here. And it involves just trivial computation like that one. To compute this integral, we have to take first derivative of this function of p and then evaluate it at rho, which gives this. And we have to do this for all terms here. And this gives actually. Here and this gives actually a system like this, an infinite system. So a couple of minutes. The drawback is that everything is unknown. But the good fact is that we have infinitely many equations. Let me just recall what everything is here. I have also an expression. Rho is what we are interested in compared to the rho square, it's a polynomial. square is a polynomial. The q's are finite number of them, in this case three. We will get rid of them in a moment. Everything depends on omega. And the p's are these also unknown polynomials, but they have the degree which is given by the index. So the first step is to combine sets of four equations. Sets of four equations to get rid of the Q's. Thereby I get an infinite system of equations again containing powers of the unknown rho function with coefficients that are those polynomials. And I get infinitely many. So, well, it's time to finish. In one minute, I shall say what happens. If assume that the polynomials have the property that such a oh, I did at least two. I I yes yes I I was confused with this no it doesn't anyway okay so I was anyway I would say then that Anyway, I will say then that I made a mistake with this machine. Yeah, here, okay, I start with this. Considering three of those equations now, as a system linear system of equations, in for instance, rho square. You know, the three unknowns here are rho square square square square. You know, the three unknowns here are row six, row to the fourth, and row to the second. Provided this determinant is different from zero, I can solve rho square and get at least half the way because the conclusion would be that rho squared is a rational function. So doing a little argument which I missed now. A little argument which I missed now because I did it wrong with this machine. I can very simply prove that it's actually polynomial still provided that this determinant is different from zero. So what remains is only to prove, which is actually most of the work, to prove that such matrix of polynomials of size equal to the order of the of the distribution must be non-singular. So that that concludes the proof in the symmetric case. So I feel stop here. Thank you very much. Questions? So you're saying this is the symmetric case. What's the difference? Actually, the non-symmetric case is done also. It took me a little extra time. And it needs an additional argument to prove This step at the determinant is non-management, as the rest of the arguments are the same. It's not yet written, but well, I have some literature my the first part. The first part, treating the symmetric case, is just accepted at general functional analysis. And I called it dot one, so I'm really forced to write down the second part also. Sorry for coding. That's all. Okay. Other questions? If Uh if not, let's thank the speaker again. Here is you 1040. No, no, okay, no table.
