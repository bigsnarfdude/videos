So, so I will be talking about some strange things on one side, but as you can see, we'll see they are not very strange. Physically, it's about quantum systems which have classical background. So, and these things occur in physics all the time. In physics, all the time. If you want to describe the system which has classical components and quantum components at the same time, it's a very natural physical problem. So what I will be talking about is systems that should be called integrable and which have integrable classical background. So So, um oh yeah, okay. So, quantum systems on the classical uh background. So, uh classical integrable classical Hamiltonian system requires a phase space. So, first let's assume that we have a symbiotic manifold. It's the first space of our system. We want to have a quantum system on the top. Quantum system on the top of this classical system. Well, geometrically, it means that we have to fix a vector bundle over our phase space. And let's assume for simplicity that the fibers are finite dimensional. So let's say n-dimensional. And you know, if we really want to have more kind of realistic physical situations, we have to fix humision structure on each fiber and On each fiber, and perhaps in even more illustrious situations, these fibers will be infinite-dimensional Hindu spaces. But let's just leave this aside for the time being. So once we're in the vector bundle, we also have to associate bundle of algebras. In our case of matrix algebras, the Hermitian structure on the fibers of the vector bundle V gives the Banovy gives the star structure on the endomorphisms, so Humitian conjugation. And so, as a result, we have the algebra, which is the algebra of small sections of the associate bundle of algebras. So, these sections will multiply pointwise, just as Wise just as normally we multiply functions. So the star structure is fiberwise. So s of x goes to s of x star, whereas star is just a Humitian conjugation. And in this algebra, there is an infinite-dimensional center, which is simply the following. You can embed functions on M. You can embed functions on M into this space of sections using special sections which assigns to X the identity appended in endomorphisms of X. It's kind of very trivial and natural in B. And of course, because our manifold is sympletic, this center does a natural Poisson state. Natural Poisson structure and A is an algebra and also it's a module over the center and actually by the construction A is finite dimensional over the center. In other words, if we choose a central character quotient by corresponding ideal, it simply means that we fix a point in the M. So then the result will be finite. So then the result will be finite dimensional algebra of m the morphisms of Cm, matrix algebra of size n by n. So now we have a Poisson structure on the center, we have the associative algebra structure everywhere, and what we want to do is we want to lift this Poisson algebra structure on the center to the whole algebra A. But algebra A is not commutative, so it's impossible to leave the Poisson structure. It's impossible to leave the Poisson structure as a Poisson structure. But what's possible is to make A a Poisson module over our Poisson algebra A. In other words, we can make this center to act by derivations of the algebra. So the upper line is action by derivations, and the lower. And the lower line at the top is actually what we can call Poisson module. In other words, what is a Poisson algebra? Poisson algebra is a combination of commutative algebra and Lie algebra. And the Lie algebra structure X by the relations on the commutative algebra structure. So we have the but first of all, Poisson algebra is a new algebra. Son algebra is a Lie algebra. And this second line is just means that our algebra A as a space is a module over Linux algebra. And for some reason, I mean, not for some reasons, but for some good reasons, we wrote this paper with Alexander Vuronov and Alan Weinstein, just a short note clarifying the structure of such things. And in order to have such modules, And in order to have such module, geometrically, that was back in the late 90s, I think. In order to have such module, all you have to do is you have to fix a flat connection on this bundle. So then the bracket between that central element and any section is given by the same formula as the Poisson bracket, except, you know, when you differentiate a section. You differentiate a section, you don't differentiate it just ddx, but you have to use the chamber and derivative. So then you use the chamber and derivative with respect to this connection. And so this defines kind of a double linear system. You have a classical Hamiltonian system, and then you have a sort of finite dimensional analytics quantum algebra that's built on top of it. Built on top of it. And so, this is the definition of a hybrid quantum system. You know, really, the word hybrid means a quantum system on a classical background, but it's impossible to say all these words again and again. So, hybrid is simply the ambient for this. So, it's a Hermitian letter bundle with a Hermitian flag connection on it. In the language of in algebra, the algebras that are finite dimensional over the center, and such that these patterns are simple algebras, they are simple finite dimensional algebras or matrix algebra. They're called Azomaya algebras. So somehow in this this type of algebras, for example, appears in Appears in quantum groups at Rosa Funature. When you take a quantum group at Rosa Funature, there are several options how to get an integral form of the quantum group before you specify it to make a further energy. One way to do it is what Diklichinian Katz did back in the 90s, is just keep all these nth powers of genuine. These nth powers of generators of the quantum group, and then this gives you an example of an algebra that's four-dimensional over the center. It's not simple, but then there's a way how to do simples. Anyway, so as in my algebra, so all I want to say is that this is not some kind of exotic objects. We ensure this second. Yes, yes. At least sufficient. Yes, I think it's equivalent. I just, yeah, I think it's equivalent, but you know, definitely sufficient. I mean in the worst case uh it should be not zero, but some something proportional to the identity set. From something proportional to the identity. But if you are in a Lie algebra setting, then the identity is not in the Lie algebra. So it should work. Okay, so far now integrativity, just we're exploring this idea of having this word systems, quantum on the top of classical. So mostly So, more algebraically, it's this. You want an associative algebra finite-dimensional and simple over center, Poisson algebra structure on the center, with the tail of Poisson center, and then Poisson algebra Z with the it acts by dimensions on A. So this structure allows to This structure allows to lift Hamiltonian dynamics generated by some function on n, by some classical Hamiltonian, to the algebra A, just in a very natural way. So you consider these Hamilton equations, but now A is not an element, is not a function on your manifold, but it's a section of this quantum bundle. Yes, but then you can twist this action. You can choose a Hamiltonian, quantum Hamiltonian. Quantum Hamiltonian is a Hermitian section of the associate group of algebra. So it's just Hermitian at the end. So it's just and Hermitian at every point, it gives you a Hermitian operator. So that's what we can call how did quantum classical dynamics, where you need the classical dynamics on the base, and then you lift it not just trivially using this flat connection, but also you twist it by something, by some kind of inner automotive. By some kind of inner automorphism of fibers. So that's the Heisenberg picture. Because it's some, I mean, one can call it, in general, in order to define the Hamiltonian dynamics, all you need is a derivation of the big algebra. And then you say the time derivative of a section is equal to the derivation. Section is equal to the derivation applied to the section. This derivation is split into the derivation on the base, the lift of the Hamiltonian evolution, and fabulous inner derivation. So we can say that it's a split hybrid quantum dynamics. Schrodinger picture is naturally it's simply then you you And then your wave functions are sections of this Human Rector bundle, and the evolution of the wave function is given by these two terms. See, if there is no second term, that means quantum Hamiltonian is zero. What you do is you're lifting the classical evolution using this flu connection to the bundle. If the classical Hamiltonian is zero, what you do is fiberglass. Of fiberwise quantum mechanics. But this one is mixed, and actually, the Poisson bracket between H and H1 have to be zero. So they interact. Okay, now let's move to integrable systems. So what is a classical integrable system? In the most general geometric way, this is simply Lagrangian vibration. Meaning it's a projection, Poisson projection from our simplitic meaninghood to the n-dimensional base where you have a pre-wheel Poisson structure. And generic fibers of this projection should be a grandchild. As always, there could be singular fibers, but that's natural. If you take harmonic oscillator, even the harmonic oscillator has a singular fiber origin. So, in a little bit more naive way, what we can do is we can fix n some commuting functions, independent functions, and then the projection p will be to the domain in Rn, which is the domain of possible values of these functions. So, in this case, we can consider multiple. We can consider multi-time trajectory, which is, I think, the subject of this conference. So, and that's the classical integrable system. So, a hybrid integrable system is the lift of this classical integrable system into our Hermitian bundle determined by extra sections M1, M. Sections M1, MN, and then the multi-time dynamics, just as any hybrid dynamics should have this form, so it has this form. So the time derivative with respect to jth time is equal to the Poisson bracket of jth integral plus i times the m jth times the section. Jth times the section. So here the sections are of the vector bundle, so they are wave functions. For the compatibility, we need this strange condition. So we should have this condition that M should satisfy. Okay, now suppose that we'd like such M, we will come back to this. So then, if we take this evolution of section S and substitute there X of T, so let's call it psi of T. So then we have this equation and then have that integrable dynamics equivalently can be. Equivalently can be just as this. And I think many people here recognize these equations. So if you have M operators for the Hamiltonian flow, then they satisfy this multi-time compatibility condition. So we kind of, for those who are familiar with M operators, and you know. And you know, you have a Hamiltonian and an integral of Hamiltonian, and to this integral of Hamiltonian in the next humanism, you always have an M operator. You have Lux operator and M operator. So here you didn't see Lux operator, but it wasn't M operators. And, you know, multi-time evolution, so the M operators should commute in this particular way. So one of the Way. So, one of the modules is that if you want to study Hamiltonian quantum systems, all you have to do is you have to study the M operators. So that was surprising to me. I almost forgotten that these things exist because I didn't work with quantum integral systems for classical integral systems for a while. So then let's go back to Let's go back to geometric picture. So, in general, geometically, our integrable system is this Lagrangian vibration. So, then a hybrid integrable system is simply a flat connection on each level surface of this projection. So, locally, it's given by this matrices M1, Mn. Okay, so that's the definition. Okay, so that's the definition. So that's what quantum hybrid systems are. So now there is a relation to deformation quantization. I already mentioned quantum groups. So let me just recall what deformation quantization is. So let's say that A0 is an associative algebra. And now, here at the first line, there is a difference with the usual deformation quantization philosophy. Now we don't require. Now we don't require that A0 is a commutative algebra or cumulative Poisson algebra. So we require that A0 is finite dimensional over the center and the center is and that A0 is a Poisson-Azumaya algebra. It's finite dimensional and simple over the center. And actually, sorry. We just equate that it's it has its center, that's all. So now let's say AH is a flat deformation family of this associative algebra. It's a family of associative algebras. If you just have a family of associative algebras, it's nothing because you cannot identify them as vector spaces. But if you identify them as vector spaces, But if you identify them as vector spaces, that's our deformation quantization. That's our deformation. So I assume that they are all isomorphic as topological vector spaces. You know, the usual setting where many things work is when you consider formal deformations, when each is a formal variable. But let's not specify this yet. So when you have this, I When you have this identification, you choose two elements from A0, take the P images in AH, multiply them in AH, that's the star product, and then in the image of the multiplication, I forgot. Yes, sir. It should be. It should be CH here. So then this whole thing is back in A0, and that's what's written here. It's the multiplication in A0, and then some bilinear condition in M0 plus this. Okay, so a well-known fact is that this first coefficient M1 induces And one induces a Poisson structure on the center. So initially, we didn't fix any Poisson structure on the center. We just fixed the deformation family. If you take the first coefficient, it's a Poisson structure on the center. If you take a first coefficient in the multiplication of Z and S, that's the action by derivations. The action by derivations of the center on A0. And that's a Poisson model structure on A0. So, in other words, every time we put an associative algebra A0, on this algebra, we have the kind of any deformation induces a Poisson structure on this algebra in the sense that the center becomes Poisson algebra, and the whole algebra becomes Poisson model. And the whole algebra becomes Plaza module over the center. See, if we add two conditions that A0 is finite-dimensional over the center, figures are simple, that center is trivial Poisson center, then we need Poisson as a algebra's hybrid quantum system. So, in other words, these structures are very natural from the deformation quantization point of view. I can get carried away and just okay. So I still have 20 minutes. Good. So, okay, so now I assume that we have a quantum integrable system. Our quantum integrable system normally is the following. We have n elements in L0 such that the K. Such that the p images in this quantization family, they commute. And if we have a little more structure on the algebra, then one can say that these elements G need maximal commutative sub-algebra. And if you have an associative algebra, how can you say that? Uh, how can you say that you want to integrate the system there? So, the best way to say is just using the maximum cumulative subalgebra. That's all. That's all you can do. So, let's assume this. So, then let's assume the following. As h goes to zero, these integrals, they behave as some elements of the center of a zero plus a. Plus h times sort of quantum correction, which had a not m k, plus terms of order h squared. And then if you will just write what it means, this commutativity in terms of this deformation composition, you will see that you get exactly this equation. So you get a hybrid quantum system on A zero. Quantum system on A0. So, in other words, the model here is the following. If you take a quantum integrable system on deformation quantization such that semi-classically it has this very special form, the classical Hamiltonian finds the identity plus terms of order H. So then it's included in the global system. Integrable system. Okay, so that's a very nice theory. The question is: whether no examples. So first, just so this is not an example yet, it's just how semi-classical limit works for such Hamiltonians. Suppose that everything is split, our model is trivial. Uh, bundlers trivial. So the phase space is the cotangent bundle to some manifold Q. The deformation quantization is just the algebra of differential, these H differential operators. So the algebraic setup is very simple. Now, suppose that we have a quantum Hamiltonian. We choose a quantum Hamiltonian in this way, in such a way that In such a way that it's equal to H0, differential operators, times the identity in this vector space plus H times M. And here, again, it depends on both on P and Q, but now it's a matrix acting in V. So we want. So we have a non-stationary Schrödinger equation with this semi-classical initial condition. And the question is, what is the semi-classical synthetic of solutions to such non-stationary Schneider equation? And then there is Frankfleck theorem in Theorem in the usual case when m is zero, discarding the asymptotic album of solutions to non-stationary Schrodinger equation. So Fantreck theorem says more or less the following, that if you want this equation without m, then M, then the asymptotic is some over alpha. Let me show what alpha is. So you see, we started with the classic, the corresponding classical evolution is the following. You have a phase space, which is the cotangent bundle. Let's just consider the simplest one-dimensional case. So you have p and q. Initially, you have a Library Magnetic sub-manifold, where P is the derivative of F. Is the derivative of f you remember f is the function over here so so then this Lagrangian evolves and then the evolved Lagrangian intersects the other Lagrangian, which is the cotangent fiber at Q at some points. So there you have your classical trajectories. Trajectories. So these are the two classical trajectories connecting this Lagrangian and this Lagrangian in time t. So typically, if you have two Lagrangians in general position, there would be finitely many of such trajectories, and they are enumerated by alpha. And Q is fixed, but these initial points occur. These initial points q, alpha, zero, they depend on q and t. So they are determined by these trajectories. So then, as alpha is the Hamilton G-Coordi action, with its boundary term, are determined by evaluated on the alpha's trajectory, and psi alpha is equal to. To and you see, here is the answer in the full generality. So, in the usual scalar case, when there is no V, there is no M, this phi alpha is just the initial function phi. But here, things are a little bit more complicated. So, it's a solution to this differential equation, ordinary differential equation. Of the differential equation with the initial condition given by the you substitute instead of p and q the trajectory, the alpha's trajectory, and this is the momentum for the alpha's trajectory given by the Hamilton-Jacobi action. So this is phi alpha. The equation for phi alpha, this is the initial condition for phi alpha. And so this is the definition of psi. And so this is the semi-classical symptom of the non-stationary solution. So I don't know, I couldn't find this in the This is in the literature on semi-classical quantization, on microlocal analysis, on Muslim theory. And then Dublakotov actually pointed me to the pages of Mussel's theory book on semi-classical analysis. And then, when you need it, when you decode it, then you can recover this formula. So, there's nothing new about it, but I think. About it, but I think it's good to have it written in human language, not in the language of micro-local analytics. So, no, but micro-local analysis is a great evening stuff. It's just we have to get used to it. So, okay. So, now suppose that we have commuting Hamiltonians of the same nature, ensure that Hiltonians have the same nature. Each of the Hamiltonians have the same nature. It's the classical Hamiltonian times the immensity was a metric in. Okay, so then of course the semi-classical symptom of multi-ton is the same except now these functions phi alpha satisfy this system of differential equations. So that's the so for example, if you have some well-known integrable system, quantum integrable system, with this behaviour of quantum Hamiltonians, and say the eigenfunctions of this system are well known, the evolution can be solved, then you're passing to the semi-classical limit, and then you can say a lot about the dynamics of. The dynamics of these hybrid systems. So, in particular, suppose that we learn a fixed point of the evolution. In other words, the trajectory stays in the same place. It's like a harmonic oscillator, we are a new origin. So, then you see this operator is commute, and we have a system of commute. The system of commuting matrices in so it looks so it's like a finite dimensional quantum system, quantum integrable system. So there's an example of such thing. So let's take this colloj, spin collagen system, the way Hikanya and Rodaci defined it. There are many versions of spin collateral. There are many versions of spin collateral model system. That's the version that, you know, I think maybe most. I mean, they are connected. The connection says no, but yeah, so that's the beta is the original Hicamier parameter. It's one over H. So the beta goes to infinity, it's h goes to zero. So the first time So, the first Hamiltonian is just the momentum. The second Hamiltonian is given by this formula. So, it acts, sorry, I forgot to write this piece. It acts on the space of functions of Q1, Qn to the power, CK to the power n, and then you symmetrize totally with respect to the symmetric. Totally with respect to the symmetric group acting diagonally on Q's and on spin variables. And these permutations act only on the spin variables. So this is something that you can easily get from bankrupt operators when you require them to act on rectangular functions. So okay, so but I think I I mean I I mean, I think you come in Vardati were the first one to write these things. So now, look at the structure of the separator. So what happened? Let's look at what happened as H goes to zero. So H2. Then the first thing gets the Waplacian. The second thing splits. So you have the one on the sine squared potential that goes to the first Laplace. Goes to the first Laplacian plus H times this correction, this one. So you can see that this spin collusion model system, as H goes to zero, splits into the classical collusion system, mean spin, plus this correction. So this correction should be familiar to anyone who is. Anyone who has studied kind of spin chains, this is so-called how they enjoy the model for long-term connections. It's this spin system. So this is the M2 Hamiltonian, but all these higher operators can be written explicitly here. So the model is that as H goes to zero, we have a hybrid integrable system. So here T1, Tn. So here T1, Tn is a multi-time evolution for the collogen, for the classical non-spin collogen system. And then these are the operators that can be explicitly written. So then this multi-time revolution has fixed points given by this formula. This formula. So Lemers and Serban, they discovered it for, I think they discovered it, maybe it was known before, for the second Hamiltonian flow. So with Andriy Leszek and Ivan Sitchin, we proved that it's a fixed point for the multi-time evolution. So this kind of clarifies kind of Kind of clarifies connection the connection between the Hikami Modati and how to ensure the models. And actually, the spectrum of Hikami Modati model is well known by now. These are some kind of asymmetric Jack polynomials. So then, very initially, one can expect that just by taking semi-classical limit from that polynomials, we will have the description of the spectrum of this model. Spectrum of this model. So I have an impression that it's all done by this French people from Sacle who know everything about this stuff. But it seems like not everything. So we'll see. So then, do I still have time? Five minutes. Okay, then let's go to some familiar territory. So assume that we So, assume that we have a family of operators satisfying the Young-Baxter equation. Consider the Youngen-type algebra generated by terminus of this, say, formal power series in U or something like this, or some analytical functions satisfying these relations. And typically, other relations like quantum determinant is one and things like this. So, assume that this. So, assume that these matrices are semi-classical. So, once h goes to zero, they satisfy the classical Young-Baxter equation. And consider the representations of this Youngian-type algebra corresponding to the spin chain. So, consider this is the quantum monotony matrix. So, there are two parts, the quantum spin part. quantum spin part plus the auxiliary that is auxiliary space v, but then plus this extra spin u. It's yeah, I shouldn't call it auxiliary space because A is auxiliary space, but it's auxiliary spin. So okay, so then we all know that this transfer matrix is commute. And now let's consider semi-classical limit. Semi-classical limit when these spins are semi-classical. In other words, the endomorphisms of corresponding spin spaces, these associative algebras, in this limit, in that particular sense, and it's known what that means, become the algebra functions on the corresponding three spaces. So, for example, for simple algebra, this is the corresponding correspondence between quadrupeds. Correspondence between quadjoint orbits and irreducible representations. So, suppose that we have something like this. So, then in this limit, if we look at these transfer matrices, and actually we studied these transfer matrices, this was one of my first research papers and definitely my first collaboration with Filo Smirnov. So, we studied quantum flock functions. Flacco functions. And it's exactly what we did, but just we didn't realize it. So it was back in 1994, I think. So in this limit, the transformatics becomes the classical transformatics times the ideal enzymatics plus first-order correction. So you can see the hybrid system immediately here. This is the classical spin chain and Chain and these are the classical L operators. And then the production, again, it's well known. It's exactly the M operators. So now we will use lux operators, M operators, and we just realized that the whole collection of M operators should be considered as a hybrid quantum system. So now quantum space is the space. Is the space on which these M operators act. It's a funny conclusion. So this is what it is. So then now the initial goal for experts in classic integral systems is to find critical points in such spin chains. Do they exist? I don't think, I mean, if somebody studied critical points, If somebody studied critical points, you know, fixed points of the multi-time evolution of integral systems, please let me know. I'm very much interested now in this. But I have an impression that nobody really got interested in this because it's an obscure question. I mean, it would seem to me like an obscure question. So, the other thing that I didn't have time to talk about, so in 1995. In 1995, together with Bozhanov and Babenka, we studied a discrete singular model to this affinity, which is also finite dimensional over the center, with the discrete time evolution given by the conjugation of the diagonal transfer matrix. The beauty of this system is that if you consider this classical diagonal solution, which is non-periodic, which is just growth linear after lunar. Is just grows linear after layer alternating like this. Then it's exactly kind of a false model. So back then, I started to wonder, so what happens if, say, the velocities of solitons, if it's not alternating periodic solution, but say it goes after four or after six or after n. So then there must be some kind of convolutions of kind of both models. So, so this is so now it's at least clear that it fits into some kind of general framework. So, then many other similar systems related to quantum groups at rules of humanity, but
