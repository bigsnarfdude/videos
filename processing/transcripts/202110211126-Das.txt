So my lab is interested in understanding the principles of cell polarization. And I'm sure several people here in the audience appreciate the importance of cell polarization, which determines cell shape, which then determines its ability to function. And what really And what really intrigues me is the diversity of shape that we see in nature. And the way I think about this problem is you have more or less now that we know quite a little bit about the fundamentals of how cell shape is organized. The players seem to be well conserved throughout eukaryotes, especially the signaling proteins and some of the major Proteins and some of the major downstream effectors. And using these same tool bags, you can, a set of components, you can come up with different shapes. So I take the example of these big boulders that you can really hammer out and get all kinds of shapes. You can get something really intricate and sophisticated like this, something really cute and funny like this, or you can completely annihilate the whole boulder and get micro, you know. Boulder and get micro, you know, tiny particles. And what's intriguing about the whole thing is that you're using more or less the same set of tools to do this, but still you have different outcomes. So it's not really what tools you're using, but rather how the tools are being used in order to give rise to these different shapes. And that's how I think about cell polarization too. And I have borrowed this video from very, not very recent anymore. Not very recent anymore, but a couple of years back, from this paper that was using optogenetic tools to understand polarization and migration in cells. And here, in this example here, they are activating a signaling protein in different stages, sections of the cell. And depending on what is the zone, depending on the zone of activation, you can see different shapes. So if it activates all over the cell, you have a more depolarized shape. Cell, you have a more depolarized shape, whereas if you activate a certain section of the cell, now you have a more defined polarized cell shape. And so in our lab, we use the fish and yeast model system to address these questions. And Fred just now gave a very nice introduction to Fish and East already. It's a great model system to study cell-shaped changes. To study cell shape changes because it's very visually striking when you see it under the microscope. Like I can detect changes in dimensions of this cell by 0.2 micron. It's really that easy to look at. And so it's a very great tool to understand these properties of polarization. And there are well-known shape mutants that have been identified over the years. You know, the odd mutants where the cells are Mutants where the cells are almost orbital or round in shape. The T mutants that Fred knows very well. Then the lemon-shaped mutants that give rise to this really funny-shaped, you know, with a pointy head, but a fat cell middle, and so on and so forth. And then, of course, the power of yeast. You can pretty much delete anything you want. You can mutate your proteins any way you feel like. You can tag it. You can observe things as they are growing. Can observe things as they are growing inside the cells. So it's really a great model system to study these processes. So for those in the audience who are not very familiar with polarization, I'll just give you a brief introduction here. So what we look at is mainly this protein called CDC42, the signaling protein. It's a small GDPase. It is conserved right from yeast to mammalian systems. East to mammalian systems. You can take the mammalian CDC42, put it into an EAST mutant, and the cell does just fine. So it's very, very tightly conserved, which is just to show how important this protein is, that nature has not tinkered with it too much. And it is involved in several different processes which together give rise to polarization. I'm giving you a small example here of one of the ways in which it helps in polarization. One of the ways in which it helps in polarization through the activation of this formin, which is an actin nucleator, so it'll form these long actin cables, and through which you can have the type 5 myosins, which can carry the cargo and dump it to this region where the CDC42 was active to start with. And so, growth would happen in this region and not just anywhere in the cell. And so, by doing this, the cell can ensure that things are just polarized to one particular spot instead of going. Rise to one particular spot instead of going to random regions within the cell. So CDC42 is a is it acts like a switch inside the cell. You can turn it on and off very easily. The off or inactive CDC42 is bound to GDP and it's active when it is GTP bound. And this GDP to GTP conversion is brought about by these proteins called GEFS, GUN nucleotide exchange patterns. Guan and nucleotide exchange factors. In fission ease, there are just two GAFs for CDC42, GAF1 and SCD1. And then the inactivation of CDC42 is brought about by these proteins called GAPS, the GTPS activating protein, which by binding the GTPS, it helps to fulfill its GDPS catalytic requirement and is able to inactivate or promote the hydrolysis of GDP. Promote the hydrolysis of GDP, GDP to GDP, rather. And there are three gaps: RgA4, RgA6, and RgA3. So in eukaryotes, you have multiple gifs and gaps. I think maybe more than 50, maybe. But here in Bombay, you only have to deal with two GIFs and three gaps. And so it's a much simpler system that allows you to ask more pointed questions. Pointed questions. So, if you look at the activation pattern of CDC42 throughout the cell cycle, we are using a probe here called the CRIBGFP. The CRIB domain is the domain that specifically binds just the active CDC42. And this domain is back to GFP. And so, wherever you see the localization of this probe is where CDC42 is activated. Is activated inside the cell. And so you can see the CDC42 active at the poles and during interphase. And then when the cell starts to divide, you see its activation goes to the division site. And then once the cell has completed division, almost immediately the activation returns to the ends that existed in the previous generation. And so the cells initially start to grow from these ends, which we call the old ends, because they existed from the previous generation. And then once the cell reaches Generation and then once the cell reaches a certain size is when the new end starts to grow. So you see these very specific cell cycle-dependent activation patterns of CDC42 throughout the cell cycle. So when the cell enters division, mitosis, the CDC42 activation stops at the ends and it transitions to the division site where cytokinesis happens. And then once cytokinesis completes, the CDC42 activation. The CDC42 activation then stops at this new end that is generated as a result of cell separation and returns back to these old ends. The cells then reach a certain size before it can activate the new end. And so this is something that my lab is looking at, looking at the relationship between the different cell cycle stages and how CDC42 is activated in these different phases. So for today's talk, I am not going, I debated how I was going to present this talk because I am a biologist. I am not a mathematician at all. And so I decided that what I was going to do is talk about two unpublished stories from our lab, which will demonstrate how I'm thinking about the polarization, no, the principles of polarization. No, the principles of polarization, and hopefully, I'll get some feedback from the audience about how we can take this further. So, long back, this is almost 10 years back when I was a postdoc and it was, you know, I was doing bench work. That was a lot of fun. We had found this in my postdoctoral lab, we had found these oscillatory dynamics of CDC42 activation at the cell ends. So, if you look here, At the cell ends. So if you look here, you see CDC42 activated at one end, and then about in two minutes, you see it activated at the opposite end, and then it comes back again, and so on and so forth. And this work was done in collaboration with Dimitrius Vavilonis, who I know is going to speak later in the day. So what we collaborated with Dimitri's lab to come up with a simple, you know, because we didn't have a lot of information at that time, a coarse-grade model of what this particular What this particular to define this behavior a little bit. And some of the key factors that key take-home points from that work were there was a positive feedback that helped in activating CDC42. And then there was a time delayed negative feedback that allowed these oscillatory behavior. And this is really similar to what Bill Bemont was showing on the first day of this meeting. And then the two ends of CDC42 actually compete with each other for. Actually, compete with each other for active CDC42. Now, and so this is this, we've known this for a while now. This has been, this kind of behavior has been shown in other systems. So it seems to be consistent. The way I think about it is it's probably an intrinsic behavior to these GDPAs. I'm sorry, my light just went off. It does that. Anyway. It does that. Anyway, so, but what I want to really emphasize here is that these oscillations are not really causing anything. It's more of an outcome of the regulation. And it's this regulation that determines how the cell is going to be shaped. So normally you will have oscillations happening, oscillatory behavior happening at one end. And as the cell grows, there's enough material to share between both ends. And so each time it activates at one end, And so each time it activates at one end, then it inactivates enough for the second end to catch up. And this allows bipolar growth. Now you can change this by simply manipulating some of the regulators of CDC42. So what we did here was we removed one of the GEFs, the less important GEF, and by removing that, we reduced the total amount of active CDC42 in the cell. CDC42 in the cell. And what we find here is that now these cells are narrow, so they have a smaller cap of CDC42 activation. And they are also monopolar because there isn't enough for both the ends. Of course, later on, my lab showed that the story is a little bit more interesting than just that, but we'll get to it later. On the other hand, you can overexpress the GEF, and now you have a larger cap of CDC42 activation, and so these cells. Activation. And so these cells are wider. And they are also precociously bipolar because there's just plenty for both ends. It doesn't need to wait for the cell to get to a certain size in order to grow bipolarly. So you can manipulate these regulators just to get different shapes, even with something as simple as a rod-shaped organism like this. Okay, so what do we know about this regulation so far? We know that there is this. So far, we know that there is this positive feedback. And this positive feedback is mediated by the GEF SCD1, which is the main GDP for CDC42, and its scaffold SCD2. So when CDC42 is active, it binds SCD2, which then recruits more SCD1, which then activates CDC4 further. And so this is a self-reinforcing system. A self-reinforcing system. This is how the positive feedback works in this organism. And the negative, the time-delayed negative feedback is brought about by one of the most well-known downstream targets of CDC42, which is the PAC kinase. So the PAC kinase is known to phosphorylate this GEF-SCD1. Actually, this work has been shown more in the budding yeast system rather than by fission yeast, but even in fish and yeast, we see similar behavior where the PAC kinase does. Behavior where the PAC kinase does indeed regulate SCD1 and prevents its interaction or binding to SCD2. And thus, this complex, the SCD1, SCD2 complex can no longer get to the plasma membrane and activate CDC42. And so this is the time-delayed negative feedback that leads to the decrease in the signal or the downward decrease. The drop in the signal in these oscillatory patterns. Okay, so some questions that when I started my lab, I was thinking about several questions about this kind of oscillatory behavior. And first was, what is the cell competing for? So, and as an added, in relation to that, how is the cell, the two ends of the cell? Is the cell, the two ends of the cell? How does it even know that one end is active, so the other end is not active anymore? So there seems to be some sort of a crosstalk between the two ends. And so this competing factor is somehow moving back and forth between these two ends, allowing activation at one spot and then next to the other. And the other things that I was thinking about is how is time-delayed negative feedback by the PAC kinase removed. So once the PAC gets there, something has to get rid of it. Something has to get rid of it so that another round of activation can happen. And the PAC kinase only prevents further activation of CDC42. So the active CDC42 that is already present at the tip also has to be broken down or inactivated. How is that happening? So these were some of the questions that I was thinking about when I started my lab. And what I knew from my work From my work, from my previous work, was that if you treat these cells with this drug latrinque-A, where you get rid of all the actin filaments, you lose anti-correlation. And so you see a lot of changes in CDC42 activation pattern and the ends don't seem to be responding to each other anymore. And so I was intrigued. And so, in a very simplistic way, I was thinking, oh, surely the active cables are going allow. Active cables are going and allow shunting something back and forth between the two ends, and this is how the cell, whatever it is competing for, moves back and forth between these two ends. So, of course, when you think about treating a cell with latin culinary, it's almost like blowing up the cell with a bomb, because you're getting rid of all actin structures. In Pombay, there are two main actin structures: the cables, which are the long-range cables. So, you see these long lines from end to end, and the path. From end to end, and the patches, which are the branched actin filaments that are part of the endocytic machinery. And the way I like to think about this is a wired system where you have the cables going from one end to another, or a wireless system where you have the patches at the two ends of the cell, but really nothing physically connecting these patches between the two ends. So we asked ourselves, how are the two ends communicating with each other? Is it wired or is it wireless? And so we used a very simple approach. We used a very simple approach, a combination of genetics and just chemical perturbation. And we treated our cells with latrinculin A, of course, to make sure that we were getting the original observation. And we used a mutant, the formin that makes these long cables. We deleted that formin. And in these cells, you don't really, if you look, if you try to stain for actin, you don't really see the formin cables anymore. There is some. The form in cables anymore. There is some evidence that there could be very faint cables, but nothing that is substantial. And then we also treated the cells with the drug CK666, which blocks the R23 complex, and hence all branched actin is completely lost. But the actin filaments, the long cables, are still present. And after we did this, we looked at the oscillatory pattern of. Oscillatory pattern of CDC42 and the anti-correlation between ends. And here we have a plot of the level of anti-correlation. So the larger the number, the higher anti-correlation you can see here. And so anything below a value of 1.4 is highly anti-correlated. And with our sample, with our untreated samples, we see there is definitely noise, but we do see some anti-correlation. It we do see some anti-correlation under normal circumstances, but this is highly reduced. So, anti-correlation is significantly reduced when you treat the cells with latte. And when you remove all the long actin cables, you actually don't get rid of anticorrelation. In fact, if anything, when I look at these oscillations, they seem to be extremely robust. And then again, when you treat the cells with Cells with the CK666 drug, you lose anti-correlation and they tend to more or less accumulate at one end with dampened CDC42 activity at that end. And interestingly, if you combine these two, so if you treat a formin deletion cell with CK66, you completely recapitulate the patterns you see with LATA. And so this makes us think that maybe we are thinking about this the right way. And by the way, this work was done by. way this work was done by a very is being done right now by a very talented graduate student Marcus and we are doing this in collaboration with the lab of Tian Hong who is right here at the University of Tennessee and who is helping us build models to better understand this but I will not go into any of the modeling I will just present you with the data from our lab so first we thought okay I'll just go back here and say when we when we saw CDC42 accumulating at one end we thought maybe it's trapping you know this is It's trapping, you know, this is endocytosis. So you are not removing components from the plasma membrane. And so maybe things are getting trapped at this end. And as a result, the second end is unable to activate CDC42. And so we looked at the GEF SCD1 and its scaffold SCD2 to see if their levels were increasing at these ends where CDC42 was being activated. Was being activated. And to our surprise, it was exactly the opposite. Actually, in these cells, the S C D 1 and the S C D 2 levels drop significantly. And so we were quite surprised at first because this was not what we expected. We expected a very simple model where S C D 1 or its scaffold S C D 2 would be pinched off from the plasma membrane through endocytosis and then somehow available for the second end. But that is not. The second end, but that is not what's happening here. So we went back to the drawing board to start thinking about another hypothesis that could explain this. And what we thought of was, what if there is a negative regulator of SCD-1, which is removed through endocytosis? And then once this negative regulator is removed, you can have recruitment of SCD-1 at that end. And while the other opposite end then, At end, then also goes through the same cycle, sorry, periodically, and these oscillations happen. And if you block endocytosis, this negative regulator will tend to accumulate or not be removed in time, and you will not be able to recruit the GEF or SCD-1 at these ends anymore, and hence the levels of SCD-1 would be low. And this seemed like quite a plausible hypothesis, and we also. Hypothesis, and we already knew of a negative regulator of S C D 1, which is the pack kinase. And so we said, okay, so what does the pack kinase look like? And we were very happy when we found out that the levels of pack kinase at the ends don't really drop so much. And so we analyzed this. We said, okay, so there was a slight decrease, but nothing as dramatic as what we saw with SCDY. SCD-1. And so we decided to, so we said, okay, maybe what's happening here is that the PAC kinase is kind of more stable at the ends. And so we looked at some short movies of the PAC localization at the ends. And if you can appreciate this, you see that even though it's not very high levels of PAC, it's always present at the end. There's always some amount. Present at the end. There's always some amount of PAC present at the end. And here is just trajectories of two cells. This is an untreated cell where you can see that the PAC kinase, just like CDC42 and its regulators, is showing this oscillatory movement. So it goes down, goes up, goes down, and so on and so forth. But in this, in the cells treated with CK666, the PAC kinase, there is a slight drop, but it more or less stays constant. It doesn't really go away. And so we are still working on. We are still working on analyzing these dynamics a little bit more carefully to understand how exactly the PAC is being retained at these ends. But then we asked, so could it be that the PAC is the reason why SCD-1 is no longer localizing at these ends? And so, you know, being East, we can easily use genetic manipulations. And so, what we did was we used this hypomorphic PAC mutant, which is a temperature-sensitive mutant, R2-34. 34. And so, when you so, what we and we looked at the SCD1 levels in these mutants with and without CK666 treatment. And what we find is that while in a controlled cell, you treat with CK666, SCD1 levels are really low. You take a PAC mutant and the SCD-1 levels actually go up. This we had reported when we first made these observations in 2012. And then when you treat And then, when you treat the R2 mutants with CK666, we don't see a dramatic drop in SCD1 levels anymore. This suggests that indeed the PAC kinase is the reason why the SCD-1 levels are dropping when you treat with CK666, where you get rid of the PAC, you don't have that inhibition anymore. And in addition to this, we saw another very interesting phenomena where normally the PAC mutants are highly monopolar because everything gets Highly monopolar because everything gets trapped, all the S C D1 gets trapped to one end. And here you're looking at SCD1 in these monopolar cells, and you see how beautifully monopolar they are throughout, as shown with these red asterisks. But in this mutant, where I was treating the cell with CK666, or not me, but rather my student was treating the cells with CK666, we saw at least 40% of the cells showing bipolar behavior. So not only are the levels So, not only are the levels of SCD-1 not significantly reduced in these cells, but they also show some sort of a return to bipolar behavior, suggesting that endocytosis could also have a negative role to play in polarization or CDC42 activation. And so, when you block endocytosis, now you have more bipolar behavior as long as the PAC is absent. So, we are now developing models to understand how exactly this. Models to understand how exactly this works. And so, this, like I said earlier, this is still a work in progress. But this is where we are right now. We think endocytosis helps in the removal of the PAC kinase from the ends, which then allows the second or the next round of CDC42 activation at that same spot. While endocytosis could also somehow negatively regulate CDC42, active CDC42, one of the potential. Active CDC42, one of the potential ways would be to simply pinch off CDC42 from the plasma membrane so that it's not available for activation. But this is something we are looking into further. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit right now and ask and go to the next part of my talk, which is so this question. So I was also intrigued by this question. How is CDC42 inactivated at the ends? Because of course, when you think about the Because, of course, when you think about the pack, it is only blocking further activation. It's not getting rid of all the active CDC42. So, something has to come in and get rid of all the active CDC42. And the simple answer to that, if you think about the regulation of CDC42, would be the gaps, where there are three gaps in fission east, RGA4, RGA3, and RGA6. And the answer is not as simple when you look at the localization of these gaps. The localization of these gaps, and so these gaps localize to the cell sides, as you can see here in the case of RgA4 and RgA6. And if you delete the gaps, the cells are wider, but they're still polarized if you delete just RgA4. And this was something that I had worked on years before. And then when you, but if you do delete all the three gaps, you do end up with round cells. So now in these cells, CDC42 can no longer be polarized. CDC42 can no longer be polarized and it's active all over the cell. So it wasn't clear to me how exactly CDC42 was getting activated at the tip without really having the gap present there. And so we decided to look to cytokinesis to see if we could get some answers there. And so this was the first paper that my lab published when I started here at the University of Tennessee, where we found that CDC42 C42 played a role in cytokinesis in Bombay. And in fact, what we found was there was this very interesting pattern of activation by the different GEFs of CDC42 at different spatial locations within the division site with very specific functions. And so this got me interested in this project. And I am before I even go further, I want to. Even go further, I want to talk a little bit about how CDC42 is, or rather, how cytokinesis is activated functions in Pompeii. And so most of the cytokinetic talks that you would see from a Pombé lab would be focused on this region where they are looking at the formation of the actomyosin ring. But my lab is more interested in the events that happen after the actomyosin ring is Ring is assembled. Where at first, after the actomycin ring is assembled, the cell cannot constrict. And this is really nice work that was first shown by Fred Chan. The ring cannot really constrict unless it starts building a cell wall behind the membrane that is almost pushing the ring in. And this is first, it builds this structure called the primary septum, which is Called the primary septum, which is a kind of a loose cell wall that can be easily digested and helps in separating the cells. And then the second set of enzymes called BGS4 and some other enzymes are recruited that help to build the secondary septum, which is going to be the cell wall of these new cells. And finally, the gluconases are delivered to the division site, which then helps to digest the cell wall, the primary septum. The primary septum, and you get two separate cells. And what is interesting, at least to me, about this process is that there is very precise spatiotemporal regulation of delivery happening at these different spots. So first you have delivery happening just behind the ring, at the ring membrane interface of this primary septum building enzymes. Then you have delivery of the secondary septum building enzymes and the Building enzymes and the membrane material that helps to expand the membrane furrow. And finally, you have where you see this brown circle is the outer rim of the septum is where the gluconases are delivered to help digest the septum. And when you just a heads up, you're at the end of your 30 minutes now. So now you'll start to eat into the questioning time. Oh, okay. Yeah, thanks. I'll okay. So what the CDC42 activation. CC42 activation, CDC42 in my, so what we found was CDC42 was required for activation of required for the delivery of the primary septum building enzyme and also for the delivery of the gluconases, but not for the delivery of this septum membrane furrow delivery or the secondary septum building enzyme. And so how is CDC42 getting active? So, how is CDC42 getting activated here? It is activated by first by the GEF, GEF1, and second, which then recruits the second GEF, SCD1, at this just behind the first GEF. And what we found about this particular form of activation was if you think about the positive feedback, this is a cyclical model. But then, where is the first molecule of active CDC42 coming from so that it can recruit SCD2? And it turns out that. And it turns out that this GEF1 can provide a seed or acts like a spark plug to activate CDC42, which then helps to recruit SCD2. And then the whole model is triggered or the whole system is triggered. And at the ends, this leads to an oscillatory pattern. This is what is responsible for bipolar growth in these cells. But at the division site, we saw a stable or a weak pattern at the division site. And so we asked, why is this? Asked why is this? And the clue was looking at the gaps. So, normally, I said the gaps do not localize to the site of active CDC42 at the ends, but at the division site, they almost rush in to activate, inactivate CDC42 behind the ring, as soon as the cell starts to form the septum. And if you delete the gaps, you will notice that here you see a robust activation of CDC42 very close to this closed ring. Close to this closed ring structure. But if you delete the gaps, now you see the activation pattern is more diffused throughout the septum. So this is just 3D reconstruction. I'm going to quickly walk through. I'm sorry, I'm going over time. So is this physiologically important? Yes, it is, because if you delete these gaps, you see a cell separation delay. And we ruled out some of the obvious factors that could be responsible. Factors that could be responsible for this. And it's only when we did EM we got our first clues. Normally, if you look, the membrane and the septum are tightly coupled at the division site. But in our mutants, we noticed some membrane defects. We saw some vesicles or excessive vesicles floating around. And we also saw membrane trapped within the septum, which typically you would never see in a wild-type cell. And to cut the long story short, To cut the long story short, what we found was that the CDC42 I told you earlier was required for the delivery of the primary septum enzyme. That was delivered in large amounts now, enough to adjust for the big cell size. But the other enzyme, BGS4, was not being delivered sufficiently. We also saw other defects with other exocytosis proteins. And so it And so, in this study, we are looking at the defects of the membrane, but that is not really the point I'm trying to make here. What I'm trying to talk about here is the importance of adjusting the level of active CDC42 at the division site such that you can have different types of cargoes being delivered, the CDC42 dependent cargo and the CDC42 independent cargo. And if you change activation of CDC42, you mess this up. So, one question remains: why is the gaps able? Why is RG the gaps able to localize to the division site in these mutants during cytokinesis, but not to the tips? And we think we have an answer here. We are exploring this further mechanistically. We have recently found that CDC42, sorry, RGA4 localization is cell cycle dependent. So you normally see it as well-defined patches at the cell sites, but during division, it diffuses along the cortex. And so we use coefficient of very. Use a coefficient of variation to see how this homogeneous or heterogeneous the distribution is, and you see much more homogeneous distribution in a dividing cell. And so, we wondered if this could be the reason why the gaps are so are able to localize to the division site better. So, at the end, I will just end with these thoughts. So, if you think about polarization at the poles as opposed to the division side, you see oscillatory dynamics at the poles. Oscillatory dynamics at the poles, you see a more diffuse zone. You don't really see oscillatory dynamics. At the poles, the gaps act as barriers rather than being present at the poles. It's present in very low levels, but at the division site, you see quite a lot of gaps and clearly it is inactivating CDC42. And so one we and so we are wondering how do these gaps, so we would like to fit this somewhere in this picture. To fit this somewhere in this picture, and we don't know where it fits yet. And so, we are wondering how do these gaps regulate CDC42? How does that influence the CDC42 oscillatory dynamics? And so this is how, you know, and this is what we are working on in our lab right now. And with that, I will end with the acknowledgments. Thank my lab members. And sorry, I went over time. I'll thank Patrick for a great talk. And I see a couple of questions in the chat already. So, Alexandra, do you want to ask that? Yes. So we've seen in this conference, you know, examples of deterministic modeling and stochastic modeling. And here you have a beautiful data set showing these oscillations. And I know myself from modeling this and related systems, you obviously get something that looks much more realistic if you use a stochastic model. More realistic if you use a stochastic model where the amplitude may differ. But how important is this really to capture the behavior? Like, as a biologist working on this, do you think it's important to have a stochastic model or is deterministic? I actually favor stochastic models to a more deterministic model. But here's the thing: because I'm a Here's the thing. Because I'm a biologist, I really struggle with how to explain these ideas. So yeah, but if you have a very specific question as to why, I can discuss it further. Quick, and Brad had a question as well. Yes, for endocytosis, when you have oscillations of CC42, do you also see oscillations in the Too, do you also see oscillations in the appearance of the patches? Ah, Fred, that's a great question because it's, I think, yes. And that's actually a project that I'm just riding an R01 on with Julian because we think we see these and we see we have really cool data with showing that CDC42 is both required and not required for endocytosis, or rather, you know, it impacts it in both ways. You know, it impacts it in both ways. And so we're trying to figure out exactly how it seems to be more regulating the precise role of endocytosis. So too much or too little kind of a story, which seems to be a theme with CDC42. You just need it in right amounts, which is why I really like that. And so, yes, I think they do oscillate. Both Julian and I, we feel it oscillates. We haven't done the actual experience. It oscillates. We haven't done the actual experiment yet. So it could be, you know, wishful thinking. And also, we're getting better resolution on actual measuring growth. Do you think growth will also oscillate with this? Oh, absolutely. This is something that I hope I find a student who is brave enough to go and look into. I always tell them about the system that you develop for measuring growth, you know, the whole cell thing. And I am convinced that it oscillates. It's not happening continuously. And also, the way I think about it, you know, in these are cell-walled organisms. So you have to break the cell wall and then build the cell wall. I don't know if the cell can withstand having things delivered at the same time when it's also breaking the cell wall. So I think there has to be some sort of a balance between when you remodel the cell wall and when you Remodel the cell wall, and when you remodel the plasma membrane, and so, but you know, this could be very simplistic thinking on my part. Um, so I'm um, yeah, I'm pretty sure it oscillates. Thanks. Yep. Any questions from the room? No. I'll ask maybe one more before we hop to lunch. I'll ask maybe one more before we hop to lunch. He said that to get an idea what the spatial range of the communication between the poles is, have you done any experiments with like septation mutants or super long cells? I know for things like the min oscillator, you actually get periodic fronts form for sufficiently large cells. That might actually help give you a spatial range on the inhibitor. Have you tried that? Can you do that in your system? Yes. And actually, so you know, that here's the thing: you have a Here's the thing: you have a long cell, but and so obviously, if the cell is long, that's making enough material for the cell. So it has more proteins because it's a much bigger cell. And so we did this experiment early on. And what the zone of activation of CDC42 isn't changing. So the requirement at the pole is more or less the same because it's still the same area of or yeah, area of growth. You're not changing that, it's just a longer situation. You're not changing that, it's just a longer cell because it's whatever the defect is. And so, what you end up seeing is actually it doesn't need to compete with each other. The two ends don't need to compete with each other anymore because there's enough material for the two ends. But you don't see any intermediate, you don't see a sort of mid-plane. No, there is something special. That's very interesting because you know what we did, we used these CDC25 mutants, which are the cell size mutants. 25 newtons, which are the cell size portions. And we used them at different cell sizes to see if we saw some sort of a variation. And there was this very, it was very clear that at a certain, beyond a certain size, it lost competition, but nothing, you know, but we didn't see any sort of trend otherwise. Great. So let's thank our speakers again. Thank you. Release you guys for lunch.
