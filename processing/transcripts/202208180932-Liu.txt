So in this short talk, the main aim is to motivate some open problems that we think might be interesting. Some results in this talk is joint work with Oleg Pioko. We're both from Warwick. Yes. Yes. So to start, let's look at some classical results. Yes. Yes. Let's look at a graph theory. Yes. So in graph, graph theory, you take any graph, say you take a triangle and you forbid this small graph in your big graph. In your bigger graph. So your bigger graph G does not contain triangle. And then you ask what's the maximum number of edges you can have in G. So max number of edges and F free graph. Here F is a triangle. You can take any F you like. In general, high. In general, hypergraph on n vertices. You can think n as large, it goes to infinity. So this kind of question was started like in the 1907, the first results due to Menteo, which is that. Which says okay, if f is a triangle, then the answer is roughly n square over 4. And the tremendous graph, meaning the triangle-free graph with this many number of edges, is a bipartite graph. Okay. So, this is the kind of problem that we are interested in. Okay, so let's give some definitions. First one is the triangle function. So, you take any graph, a hypergraph f, and you forbid this f and you ask. And you ask the maximum number of edges to this one. Yes. So this is the turret function. And in this talk, we only consider graph or three graph. Just for simple. Um so sometimes we only care about the asymptotic value of this trend function. So we normalize this function and take the limit and this is called the turret density And in this target, the trend density is always positive. This kind of graph is called a non-degenerate. Okay. So we have the turret function, turret density, and also the trimmer graph. The trim of graph, which is the collection of graphs that I Graphs that are equivalent G such that G is F3 and the edge density of G is maximum. For example, for triangle, we know the cremograph must be bipartite. Bipartite. So I'm going to use this notation. This graph is the balanced complete bipartisan graph. Yes. Okay, so these are the notations that we are going to use. So we know triangle and in general, turning consider the complete graphs. So I'm going to write this current theorem which is that the trimmed graph for complete graph for complete graph say a complete graph on L plus one vertices is this triangle here that this graph is the balanced L part The balanced L partite complete graph. So if L is two, then it's a bipartite graph. If R is three, it's complete three party graph. And the most general results in this area is this Eldish. This Eldish Sdong Irm Simovich which determines the tremal graph not exactly but asymptotically so for any f is a symptom Is a symptomatically triangular. And here, L is the chromatic number of F minus one. For example, if you take F to be the out cycle, five cycle. Then, this theorem tells you the extremograph is asymptotically bipartite. Okay, so I'll summarize. Every crime graph in graph theory can be approximately. Can be approximated by a triangle. So every trimmed, sorry, I haven't defined what do I mean by a trimmer. Okay, so definition. So we say a graph G is a creme if If you can find some finite family of graphs, if there exists a finite family of graphs or hypergraph such that G is F3 and the edge density is maximum you can have. So we do not care about which family you choose as long as it's finite. For example, if G is completed by partial graph, then you can. Leader by patterned graph, then you can take F to be the triangle. So the extremal, so completed by pathogen graph is extreme. Yes, so now this L D S Done Seminovich theorem can be can be written as every every crime graph. every criminal graph is a every trimograph is approximately some turning graph any questions and a consequence of this uh settlement is uh Settlement is the trend densities for graphs is the following set. So for every family, the trend density for this family can only be containing this nice set, 1 minus 1 over L writing this way. Writing this way uni and uni zero. So this is a consequence of this theorem. Because the edge density of a trend graph must be contained in this set. Okay, so this is about the graph. Now we move to hypergraph and we are still interested in the tremel graph. So let's copy the definition. And now we can forget about the graphs. We know everything about the graphs. Let's look at the hypergraphs. So we say a hypergraph is a trimmel if you can find some finite family such that G is a trimmed construction for this family. Let's look at an example. Maybe the simplest one is this. One is this complete three-partite three graph. This complete three-party three graph, and this graph is the framework because you can forbid this small graph. Small graph, which is called F5. It has five vertices and three edges. If you forget this F5 and solve this hypergraph trend problem, you will see the extremal graph 5 is this complete three-party graph. This is an older result of both bus. Of us in sixties. So this graph, this hypergraph is the tremendous by the definition. And there are other ectremal graphs. Let's see, let's look at some other examples, more interesting examples. This is semi-biparted graph. This semi-biparted graph is also extreme. Meaning, you partition your vertexes into two parts, and you take all triples that contains exactly one vertex from the left. This is a trimmed because you can forbid this graph. It has five vertices and four edges. If you forbid this one, you can do this hypergraph terrain problem and you will see the trimograph for this five vertices. Hypergraph is the semi-bipetted three graph. You can get others. Others and get a bipartite graph by forbidding this final plan. Seven vertices and seven edges bipartite graph and maybe one more. And maybe one more, okay, two more, two more examples. The next one is a conjecture. This famous Cagahedron conjecture. If it's true, then this guy is the antremal graph, hypergraph. So it's a three-partite graph, which has four types of edges. And Turan conjectured that you can forbid the tetrahedron to get this trimmer graph. So for vertices, So, four vertices, four edges. We complete the three graph on four vertices. So, if we forbid this K43, try and conjecture that this three-partite three-graph is a one extreme of construction for K43. And another conjecture. These are not my questions in this talk. Questions in this talk. Just another kind of yeah, I forgot who asked this conjecture, but it's also an older conjecture. So you will forbid a cycle of lens five, a tight cycle of lens five. You have five vertices and five edges. So you take the edges, stick to Cyclically. And people conjecture that the trimmed construction for C5 should be this guy. This semi-biparted construction. But now with the recursion, meaning you do this recursion. You do this recursion inside of the smaller part. Here, you still and you keep doing it inside the red part. If you zoom this, you will see you keep recurs inside the smaller part. So it's a recursive construction. Okay. Yes. So if we look at this data, every trimo construction in these theorems or conjectures have a nice structure. Every trimmel construction has a nicest structure. So you might be wondering if it's true in general. If it is true in general, so does every criminal hypergraph have a simple structure? So, and this was what Oleg approved in 2014. So, before so there's a result. Let me give you a definition to define what do I mean by have a nice structure. So pattern. So pattern, pattern means, so pattern is the structure. So pattern is a triple. So pattern is a triple. It encodes the Triple. It encodes the structure into this triple. So it has a natural number M it has a multiple R set a multi R set meaning has a R every every set in E has R. that in e has our elements but it will allow we allow one one element appear many times and r is a subset of this integer set okay so this is the definition of a pattern and it And let's see one example. You can write a pattern anyway you like. For example, you can write M equals 3 E E as a 1 2 3 1 1 2 R R you can you can you can take empty set. can you can take empty set by definition this is a this is a pattern um okay so what important is the the the next definition we say a graph a hypergraph d is a p construction or in other words the structure of g is p If it is a blow-up of this pattern key, okay, what do I mean? What do I mean by blow-up? For example, let's take this pattern as an example. Here I am. Here M, the information of M meaning the number of parts of G. So for example, if M is three, then it means G has three parts. You can divide the vertex set of G into three parts and you can label it as V1. And you can label it as V1, V2, V3. You know, it has three parts. And E encodes which kind of edges you can have. For example, the first set is one, two, three. That means you can have this kind of edges. It contains all these all triples that intersect V1, V2, and V3. One, V2, and V3. Okay, this is the meaning of E, and this is the meaning of elements in E. So 1, 2, 3 tells you you contains all triples that look like this. And 1, 2, 2 tells you you contains all triples that has that intersect of V1 in two vertices and intersects V2 in V. V2 in one vertics because one appear one appears twice. So you have two vertices from V1 and one vertex from V2. So the second set tells you you have all triples that look like this. So this is one, one, two, and one, two, three. And the R meaning the recursive part. Here, R is empty, so you do not have a recursive part. So this graph is a P construction for this particular P. So any questions? So if we go back to the To the results that we know or we conjecture to be true, we can write these theorems in the language of patterns. For example, this complete three-part three graph, you can encode the structure into a pattern. So it has three parts. So M is three. It has only one type of edges, which is. Edges, which is one, two, three, and it does not have a recursive part, so R is empty. So this encodes the structure of this extremal confliction. And for the second one, for this semi-biparted graph, it has only two parts. So M is two. So M is two. It has only one type of edges, which is one, two, two. And it has no requestive part. So R is empty. So this pattern because I should warn you that you have about five minutes left. Okay, good. Yes. And okay, let's look at the wine recursion. Okay, let's look at one recursive contraction. And for this recursive pattern, you can write it in this way. That has two parts. It has only one type of edges, one, one, two. And your recursion happens in the second part. So R is this set. So this is a path. So, this pattern tells you the structure of your extreme graph. And what Oleg approved was so for every pattern for every Uh, yeah, not for every minimal pattern. I'm not going to define this minimal pattern p so it will tell me a structure, it will give me a structure, I can find a finite family. Um such that every Free Cremal graph is a peak construction. Meaning, if your hypergraph has a simple structure, meaning that it's a P construction, that is a trimmel, according to the definition of a trimmer. Yes. So this was how I approved. And what we did was expand this a bit. A bit further. So, if you look at the survey of Peter K Wash about the hypergraph trend problem, every known hypergraph triangle problem has this nice structure P. So, can you find a triangle problem whose extreme mode construction doesn't? Whose extreme mode construction does not have this nice structure? What we proved is you can do this for every collection of patterns. So t is the I integer. Um there is a finite family such that um let's copy this sorry is a mixed P construction. P construction P12PT construction Okay, so one minute for the for one example Okay, so what do I mean? Say you have two patterns one pattern look like this it's a three-part graph It's a three-partite graph with a recursion inside all three parts. This would be Q1. The other one says this hepatite construction with the recursion inside of the smaller parts. So the older result of OLEG says for each of them, I can find a finite family such that each is a criminal. Here the new result. Here, the new result tells you you can kind of mix these two guys together. What do I mean by mixing? Mixing means in the recursive part, you have the freedom to choose which pattern you put inside. For example, using these two patterns, you can mix the pattern like this. So, inside each party, you can choose whatever. You can choose whatever you like. Inside the recur, the second level, you also have the freedom to choose which one you like to put inside. So for this new hypergraph, this theorem says you can find a finite family such that the trim graph is this guy. So this is what we call a mix. This is what we call a mixed pattern. Yes, so this is our result. And yeah, to end this talk, the question is the title. What kind of hypergraph can be trimmed? Can you find other ways to generate an incremental graph? Okay. Um, okay, so yes. Any any questions? Let's thank personal state other questions. Yeah, go ahead, speak up. I think the microphones are up there, so this is. Yeah, so I have a question about the relative sizes of the blocks and the patterns. Can one make any statement if you specify those? Can one make an analog of, say, the first theorem you stated when the relative sizes of the blocks and the part are unknown? Ah, yes, yes. Ah, yes, yes. Good question. That's yeah. We know the structure of your chromograph, but in order to know the size of each part, we needed to solve some optimization problem. But that kind of can be done by computer theoretically. So we do not care about each part, the size of each part, but they can that can be determined by calculations. And similarly, for this multi. This multiple pattern theorem. Here, I skipped one condition, meaning they have the same Lagrangian, because if you have a pattern with a small Lagrangian, I can just throw away this. So if I have the same Lagrangian, then inside each recursive part, the size that will not depend. The size does not depend on which pattern you choose inside each recursive part. So you can treat it as you can treat it as the first theorem. You just throw the pattern to a computer and tell the computer to calculate the size of which parts to make this graph have the maximum number of edges. What I want more is there a negative result? Is there a negative result? Are there some patterns and relative sizes on which the CRM fails? You mean if there is a pattern inside that is another move? Right. Yes, here we require the pattern to be minimal, meaning you cannot attack a Meaning, you cannot attack a sub-pattern with the same Lagrangian of your original pattern. So if it's not minimal, then yes, it fails. I guess I had a similar question, which I guess maybe you're satisfied. But say you fixed a pattern and M was 2, and I said I want 31% in one side and 69%. One side at 69% of the vertices in the other. Okay. Is that particular balance extremal? No, because yes, the answer is no, because once the pattern is fixed, the ratio of each part is also fixed by solving this optimization problem. Can people hear me? I had a question. I'm on Zoom. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, from Calgary Airport. Right. So it's a kind of like Maria asked, suppose that you have a non-minimal pattern in one of the blobs. Can you, could it then be extremal? So Shisha and I have a paper where we have some non-minimal patterns. Non-minimal patterns which are extremal. But I'm wondering if you can put those inside the recursion. I don't know because our proof uses the minimal a lot. So I'm not sure if you can put the non-minimal inside the one part. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, if there if there are no further questions, um either from the room or from Zoom, let's thank Tishi again. Thank you. Now we're like we'll have a coffee until uh mini. Are you there, Shicho? You left? It looks like he signed off. Oh, he signed off. Okay. Okay, nice to see you, Tom. See you. You didn't say bye, but yeah. Save traps. Okay. Bye. File
