So, the first one is master rigidity and effect geometrization, which is basically for finite volume type of manifolds, the geometry is determined by the topology. And so basically, if I so basically, you should be able to compute from the fundamental group the volume diameter, et cetera. Volume, diameter, et cetera. And today we'll focus on different ways of measuring the complexity of cohomology, some topological and some geometrical, and we study inequalities between them. The second motivation is about this non-compactness and abusing the Scotts-Core theorem. So if I have a finite volume cosmetic, so near infinity, it is foliated by those tori, and you have the Those tori, and you have this compact core, which is homomorphic to a manifold. And then if you have an infinite volume hyperbolic manifold, like the quasi-Foulsian one, you also have this complex core whose boundaries are some like hyperbolic surfaces. And this core is also homeomorphic to a manifold. To your manifold. Then the second motivation is that you could have invariance which depend on the geometry near infinity. So here this metric is expanding exponentially. And like the one of the invariants would be this kind of an infimum of the Laplacian spectrum studied by a Canary around 20 years ago. And so Canary and Canary. And so Canner and Canary Berger show that this invariance can be bounded from above and below by the volume of this core here. And recently, there are other invariants called like this renormalized volume. So it also depends on this volation near infinity, which is some kind of a negative curve surfaces expanding exponentially. But then corner ray. But then Canary, Bridgeman and Canary show that this renormalized volume, although it depends on infinity essentially, it can be bounded from above and below by the volume of the convex core. So basically, the second motivation is that when you have a non-compact manifold, you could define invariance that depend on data ne infinity, but then in the in the In the third-dimensional finitely generic fundamental group case, you have the score, which is very nice. And you could ask for like whether you could use data on the score to give a good estimate on those invariants, which need data near infinity. So, to measure the complexity of a cohomology, we have our Alt-Franfur norm. We have our Alt-Frame third norm, which is basically you take the surface representative of your cohomology class, and then you take the absolute value and then take the minimum among such representative. So the idea is that when it's a closed hyperbolic free manifold, it's a non-degenerate and genuine norm. So this just means that if you have a non-trivial If you have a non-trivial cohomology class, you get a non-zero norm. So let me draw this picture. I think it's well known to the three manual people, but we'll go back to this picture a few times. So imagine this is a unique cube in a three-space with all the faces glued to each other. So you get a three torus in this case. And then if you consider this horizontal two torus, that is incompressible. That is incompressible, then this horizontal torus is non-zero homologically, but its third norm is zero because its Euler characteristic is zero. So that's just a degenerate norm when you have tori. So, okay, so the fifth norm used to measure the topological. Measure the topological complexity, you have other norms which are more geometrical. So the L2 norm is basically you take the cohomology, represent that cohomology by one form, and then you take this integral over here. So I will provide one more motivation when I talk about the work of Berjang, Sengguen, and Venkatesh. So you need out sometimes. And for the cohomology, And for the cohomology, basically, just like the first norm, you take the infimum among such representations, among such integrals. And L1 norm is like even less familiar than L2 norm, but it's basically like the square root version of this guy. So our norm has some very natural geometric interpretations that I'm going to talk about right now. So the least area norm. This error norm, very similar to Thuten norm, it is basically you represent your cohomology by surfaces, and then because it's co-dimensional one, you can represent those cohomology by smooth surfaces, and you can measure the area and then take infinum among such area. So, basically, it is the least amount of area of surfaces that you need to represent the cohomology. So, the idea is that this weird-looking L1 norm is actually equal to the least error norm. So, that's a bit surprising. Okay, so now let me talk about the work. So, basically, in 2015, we have the from Burjan Senka and Venetash. Senga and Renkash, there is actually the following inequalities between outer norm and the third norm. So you have a fixed base manifold, M0, and then consider its cover. Then for its cover, the outer norm is bounded from below and above by the third norm with coefficients depending on data coming from the base manifold. So this is. This is like a tool they introduced in the paper when they try to propose an approach to the torsion growth conjecture. So, this autonomy is used to deal with some like analytic torsion and some of the related things. And this inequality, the left-hand side, generalizes the work of Kromhaiva-Morovka from 1997, because they basically tell you: okay, in your three manifolds, Okay, in your three manifold, um, if you take a cohomology class, uh, so you have a three-manifold, then you can take this cohomology class. Then you can just measure because you can just measure a third norm topologically. But then this third norm is actually equal to some geometric invariant, which is infimum among all metrics on this manifold. This is the This is the integral of scalar curvature and then times the times the L to more. So H is a metric on this manifold. So this is a very surprising result. It is in terms of spirits like on your modular space. For each point, you can define a geometry invariant. And then you take the infinity. Then you take the infimum among all such points, you recover a topological invariant. So, this is a very surprising result. And in 2017, Brock and Downfield journalized the work of Bergen Synchroman in several ways. First, they removed the assumption that those manifolds are covered of a fixed manifold. So, this inequality just works. Inequalities just work for arbitrary hyperbolic manifolds, and then they also obtain an explicit expression for the constants C1 and C2. So here it's given by root of volume, root of injectity radius. They also discuss some sharpness for the left-hand side, right-hand side, using constructions from three manifolds like. From three manifolds, like taking covers and doing dam fieldings. Francis Collin also obtained a version, also obtained the left-hand side in the same year using the method of compile from Morovka. So, I want to make a comment about such an inequality. It is actually quite beautiful because remember, L to norm has a definition very different from First and Norm. L to norm, you take First norm. L to norm, you take an integral all over your manifold, and first norm is really about the topological complexity of the cohomology. And one idea is that such an inequality really reflects the rigidity of hyperbolic geometry, because especially this right-hand side over here. So, if we go back to this picture, you have a three torus and And this tutorial over here. So remember, this guy, its third norm will be zero. So this S has third norm zero. But the alpha norm is not very hard because if you position the x, y, like x, y, z coordinate in the Euclidean 3 space, so a one form transfers to the surface S due to The surface S dual to the surface S just DZ or the quotient of that. So this DZ, because this is like a unit cube, you are just doing integration of one in a unit cube. So you get one. So the outer norm for this surface S is equal to one, but the third norm is equal to zero. So this inequality, if you This inequality, if you put into this inequality of here, you get one less than or equal to zero. That is not true. The takeaway is that you can bound the for the three Taurus when you have the same topology, right? It's the same rank three abelian group. And then this guy, so topology is the same, but you can get very different geometries, right? You can scale out this three axis of the torus in many. Reaxes of the torus in many different ways. So there's no rigidity. You cannot control the outer norm, which is geometry, by the third norm, which is topology. So that's the idea of rigidity. And from 2019, Daniel Stern and Hubert Bray and Daniel Stern, they generalized the left-hand side, not the right-hand side, the left-hand side, to Freeman Ford's boundary. Manifolds boundary and reducible three manifolds. The reducible three manifolds basically cut along those essential spheres, and you get a bunch of three manifolds boundary. And then you study how first norm and electron behave under such cut and paste procedure. So as you can see, there's a growing interest in this kind of inequality coming from different perspectives. Inequality coming from different perspectives, different techniques. Okay, so to look at the non-compact case, we have several issues. The first one is that for the cost manifold, this kind of injectivity radius would be zero. So, because this metric is shrinking exponentially away from the core, and then And then, so we need to look for other geometry invariants in place of the injective radius if you want to bound the third norm by the norm. Another problem is that the previous inequality is useful because third norm is a genuine norm, so you can really measure the complexity. But then if you just use HLO tool, like You just use HLO2, like instead of the relative version, then you have those torus or all those peripheral surfaces with third-norm zero. So even if you have such an inequality, it may not be very useful because it's just degenerative. It just gives you trivial inequalities for every coherent class. And also, due to the non-compactness, you could have surfaces like this kind of surfaces. Would like this kind of surfaces whose least area representative would reach out to reaching infinity. That's one another potential issues. One more issue is that the outer norm may not be finite. So for example, if you have a non-compact properly embedded surfaces like the fire puncture sphere, so this fire puncture sphere, then this guy. Then this guy, you can, by a simple computation, so what you can show is that this non-compact probably embedded surfaces would have L to norm infinity. So it basically blows up. So the solution comes from a different perspective. A different perspective. So basically, if you restrict to the right candidates, which is the space of L to Omni 1 form, then all three aforementioned issues are gone. So basically, this outharmony one form, the space by the work of Mazeum Phillips and Zucker, is isomorphic to this space. Uh, this space. So, basically, the first step is to understand the topology of such space. So, basically, you have the so you have a M3 herbolic non-compact with finite volume. So, we know that this is my. So we know that this is my cross boundary, which is like the torus. So basically, you can think of this harmonic just correspond to it cannot be peripheral. So this is a peripheral surfaces, this is non-peripheral surfaces. Peripheral is just homologous to a boundary component. So basically, harmonic tells you Harmonic tell you harmonic tell you that you're looking for this guy over here. So this guy, its harmonic representative will be trivial. So it will be zero. And also, how do you interpret this L2? So basically, the L2, as I said, if I were properly embedded non-compressed surfaces, this L2 blow up. So L2 rule out those non-compressed surfaces. Those non-compact surfaces, L2 condition only give you compact surfaces, and harmonic give you the peripheral one. So that's the topology. And a trivial color is that the third norm will be a genial norm on this L2 harmonic one form because you rule out those annoying peripheral surfaces. And another natural color is that the least air. The least air norm is controlled by the third norm after you understand the topology. Because there's actually a least air surface theory established by Xinohuan and Beio Wang in 2015, and also Colleen Hoffworth, Maze and Rosenberg. So basically, they tell you this peripheral surfaces are represented by nice surfaces which live inside the compact core. So basically, if I fall So basically, if I thought, if this is my like a maximum volume cost neighborhood, then I can find a constant tau such that when I cut off the manified height tau, this part is denoted by m tau, then this m tau will contain all of my least area non-peripheral surfaces. So all of my surfaces is gonna, this area is gonna leave here, it's gonna This ears, it's gonna leave here, it's not gonna go arbitrary deep inside the cusp. So you have a really nice geometric theory for those non-peripheral surfaces. Moreover, Ullenberg in the 80s have an observation, which is that for closed hyperlink field manifold, evolved. If a least area surfaces S, then its area is controlled by the genus, by the topology. So this is observed by Ullenberg in the 80s and then written down explicitly by Haas in identify. So after we understand the geometric theory for the non-existent, standard geometric theory for the non-peripheral surfaces this estimate is also true for the um for the for the cusk case so basically uh that's also discussed in this paper over here from 2014. so basically your area of the non-peripheral surfaces is also controlled from above and below by the genus if you take the smallest area one again this inequality Does not hold for the three torus because the three torus, this black torus over here would have fifth norm zero, but area one. So this upper bound is again some reflection about the rigidity of the Hubble challenge. Okay, I have four minutes. So my result was that for the right-hand, for the left-hand side, For the right hand, for the left-hand side, it is similar to the broken-downfield case after we understand the topology and geometry of the L2 harmony 1 form. And for the right-hand side, it is more complicated. So, this guy is a system, which is the length of shortest GD sig that's a natural candidate in place of injectivity radius. And this guy over here is some term involving the radius, sorry, the dynamic. In the radius, sorry, the diameter of your maximum volume cusp. So, a natural color is that if you fix a large constant for all buffering many cases manifold, this system term always dominates the diameter term because by the work of calling atoms, you know that those cusp has a lower bound on the weight. Has a lower bound on the waist size, which is shortest translation vector corresponding to the parabolic isometry generating the cusp. If your diameter go to infinity, this volume of the manifold has to go to infinity. And also in general, it is much easier to construct small system because you can just do them filling on a non-diameter cusp. Right. Right. How about okay? So I also studied the sharpness of the broken downfield case, which I don't think I have time to discuss. So basically, let me go back. Okay. So in broad downfield, so basically I So, in Brookdownfield, so basically, I proved that this part is not sharp despite the fact that it is qualitatively sharp. And they have experiment data which show that it can be really close to being sharp. Like if one is equality, then they have data where this is close to 1.0006, something like that, coming from like fiber manifold and some snappy algorithms. And also, this qualitative sharp because if you And also, it's qualitative shock because if you take covers, the third norm would scale linearly by the work of Gaby, and then L to norm and the root of volume both scale like a square root root. So this left-hand side stays stable under finite cover. And that's the sharpness issue. Okay, so I guess I will probably stop here. And thank you very much. Thank you very much. Well, thank you, Shalong. Does anybody, is there any question for any speaker? Well, uh Well, oh, thank you, Joseph. Well, thank you. Well, thanks again, the speaker. And that will be all for this morning. And we'll see you in the afternoon at, I believe, at we will start at three. Yeah, with Pariola. Well, thank you very much. So, thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Hans, actually, before you stop screen sharing, I just wanted to compare the bounds you had. On the left side, it actually looked the same to me. Is that right? Or not? Yes. The left side was the same in all of them. Okay. But the right side is sort of substantially different. So basically, the tempi over root of injected radius. 10 pi over root of injected radius is replaced by 10 pi over root of system. That's a very natural, that's almost like the same. But then you just have extra turn coming from the diameter of the maximum volume cusp. Which yeah, that's currently that that's necessary. I cannot avoid that term for now. But as I said, if you ignore financial. Ignore finitely many, then it is controlled by the system turn, just like the broken downfield case. Okay, I will take a break. There's three talks in the afternoon, and then
