So, we are interested in the problem of morphogenesis, which is how animals obtain their shape. And this is a very complicated process which involves biochemical, mechanical, and electrical processes, which span multiple scales, both in time and in space. And understanding such a complex process is with multi-scale. With multi-scale dynamics is very difficult. And we're taking an effective approach where we're trying to identify mesoscale fields and so coarse-grained variable and develop some effective models for understanding the dynamics. And this approach, which is a very physical approach, complements the more reductionist approach taken by a lot of research and By a lot of research in biology, which aims to identify the molecular building blocks and try to build bottom-up models. The model system we're using in our research are Hydra. These are multicellular animals from the Cnidarian family. So you can see here this family at the base of the animal tree, which is also the family of jellyfish and corals. So Hydra have a very simple body plan. So basically, it's Simple body plan. So basically, it's a unique has one body axis with a foot on one side and the head with the mouth and the tentacle on the other side. It's a predatory multicellular animal about the size of a grain of rice and it contains about 100,000 cells. And the reason it's such a nice model system for morphogenesis are its amazing regeneration capability. So Hydra is one of very few animals that's capable of what's called whole bone. That's capable of what's called whole body regeneration, where you can cut the animal to small pieces of tissue or even dissociate the animal completely into cells and aggregate them. And these will develop within a few days into a holospheroid and then over the course of a few days develop into a fully regenerated animal. And this is basically how Hydra got its name from the mythological Hydra creature. And now this is a very Hydrocreature. And now, this is a very nice system for morphogenesis because you can start with very flexible initial conditions. Growth is actually not required. So you can stop cell division and you will get this regeneration. So it's basically the same cells that reorganize and differentiate. The regeneration happens in solution, and the tissue is fully accessible, and the whole process takes only two, three days. So this is the So, this is the typical process that I'll be talking about today. So, what you're seeing here, this is a piece of tissue. We cut a fragment of the hydra. And what you're seeing here, time here is in hours, is the regeneration of this spheroid into a small animal. So, initially, it starts in a spherical shape, and then you see an axis develop, you see the tentacles starting to form, and the mouth starting to form. So, this is basically Starting to fall. So, this is basically the regeneration experiments that we'll be looking at today. A little bit more about the structure of the hydra. So, hydra are, as I said, they have a single axis. Their body is actually made of two layers of tissue, which surround the internal cavity, so a fluid-filled cavity here in the middle. So, basically, the tissue of the hydra is distributed, two-layered structured around this. Uh, two layers structured around this lumen. Uh, so you have an external uh cell layer, epithelial cell layer called the ectoderm, and an internal layer. And in between, they're sandwiching a very thin matrix of extracellular matrix. And these two inner and outer layer also double as primitive muscles. So, you can see they have these beautiful supracellular muscles. Here you can see them in the outer layer, in the ectoderm. So, what we The outer layer in the ectoderm. So, what you're seeing here is a hydra that is transgenic and it expresses a LIFAC GFP, which binds to the actin filaments and decorates them. So, you can see the actin filaments that are parallel to the body axis in the external layer. And here, you can see the internal layer, and you can see here there are circumferential actin fibers. And I should emphasize these are contractile fibers, so these are not polar. So, while individual actin filaments are polar, these contractile fibers. These contractile fibers are not polar. Okay, so our main focus has been looking at hydra from the point of view of these actomyosin fibers. And if you look at the organization of these fibers, so here we are looking again at the fibers in the outer layer. So we see this beautiful organization of parallel fibers, which is called pneumatic alignment in physics. And this pneumatic alignment is And this nematic alignment is has defects. If you have a sphere, there have to be defects in the nematic alignment. So you can see these defects, which are basically singularities of the alignment field. So you can see here what's called a plus one defect or a scheme of a minus half defect. And what we see is that these defects are actually coinciding with the location of the main morphological features. So if you look at a mature hydra, what we see is that there is a plus one defect at the tip of the head. So this is the mouth. At the tip of the head. So, this is the mouth of the animal. This opens when the animal eats. We have a plus one defect at the tip of the foot. And then each one of these tentacles, which it used for praying, has a plus one defect at the tip and two minus half defects at the foot. And there's a topological statement that if you look at a closed something that is analogous to a spheroid topologically, the total charge has to be plus two. And in this case, the plus two is basically the plus one at the head. The plus one at the head and the foot, and then each of the tentacles doesn't contribute because the defect at the tip is balanced by the two defects at the base of the tentacle. So we have plus two charge of defects in a full animal, and this corresponds to the plus one and plus one defect at the head and the foot. Okay, so this is what we see in a mature hydra. And now we're going back to this process of regeneration. Of regeneration. And in the first part of my talk, I will focus on how this nematic reorganizes as we look at the regeneration from a tissue fragment. So initially, what we do is we cut, we use a scalpel to cut a ring, and then we cut this ring to a few fragments. So what we have here is a square fragment cut from a mature hydra. And here you can see an image of the actin fibers in this piece of tissue. And you can see that this excised piece of tissue inherits the fiber pattern. Of tissue inherits the fiber pattern from the parent animal. Now, the first thing this piece of tissue does, and this takes two or three hours, is to fold into a closed spheroid. So this is an actomyosin-dependent process, and this piece of tissue folds into a closed spheroid. And what we typically see is that this spheroid has a very stereotypical organization of the actin fibers. So basically, this piece of tissue falls so that. Tissue falls so that all the sides basically come together in a purse string-like manner in this what we call closure region. And the fibers in the closure regions are disordered, whereas the fibers in the main, in the central part of this piece of tissue actually remain, are inherited in the closed spheroid and remained intact. And here you can see images of such a spheroid taken from four different directions. So, this is done using light sheet microscopy by Using light sheet microscopy by rotating the sample. So you can see that the you can see here, this is the kind of back part where you're in the central part of the excise tissue, where you can see nicely the ordered fibers inherited from the parent animal. And then here in this region denoted by this red dashed line, you can see the disordered region where the fibers are not ordered. And we can identify two foci in this region, which maybe it's easier to see in this. Which maybe it's easier to see in the scheme here, which is basically within this disordered region. If you look at each of these caps, you see that they're surrounded by radial fibers. And if you would continue these fibers, these fibers would meet in each of these foci. So we have this very stereotypic organization of the actin fibers in the folded spheroid with these two foci within the disordered region. With time, what we see is that this disordered region becomes order. So there's induction of this pneumatic order, and you can see here the same region of the tissue. Initially, you see that the fibers are not ordered, and over time, we get this nice parallel array of fibers, but we have to have defects. So you can see here that the nematic pattern emerges, and we have a defect formed in this disordered region. And what we see is that these folded spheroid develop. These folded spheri develop originating from excised fragments actually develop into a very stereotypical pattern of defect, which you can see here. So, one of these foci develops into a plus one defect, as you can see here. And the other foci typically develops into a pair of plus half defects. So, plus half defects has this horseshoe pattern. And here you can see two plus half defects on the other side of the spheroid. So, we start with this folded spheroid with a big. We start with this folded spheroid with a big disordered region. And over time, this disordered region develops this polar configuration of defects with a plus one defect on one side and two plus half defects on the other side. Okay, and then the animal continues to regenerate and we get a polar animal with a head on one side and a foot on one side. And what we see is that these foci region, which initially develops this asymmetric configuration of defects, now develop into the Defects now develop into the polar animal with a plus one defect forming the head of the animal and two plus half defects joining to form the foot of the regenerated animal. So here you can just see the outcome. So if we identify plus one defect early on, this will typically become the head of the animal. And if we identify two plus half defects, this will typically become the foot of the defect. And here you can see overlaid on the image of the actin fibers. Image of the actin fibers, this green mark which shows you labeled cells. So we used fluorescent dye that we encaged to mark specific cells. And you can see that the same cells that were in the region of the defect site early on are the cells that will become de-haired and similarly for the foot. Okay, so if I summarize this process of the regeneration from the point of view of the nematic, what we see is that we start with With the square piece of tissue. This square piece of tissue folds into a spheroid with this characteristic organization of actin fibers, where we can identify these two foci. These two foci develop into the two defects, the plus one defect on one side and two plus half defects on the other side, which then develop into the head and the foot of the animal. So what's particularly exciting here is that we can identify the cells at the foci that Cells at the fauci that will become the cells at the defect region that will become the cells at the head just from looking at the actin fiber organization in the animal. So, again, here you see a tissue where a spheroid where we marked specific cells. You can see initially they're at the false site, and then they're at the plus one defect site, and eventually this becomes the head of the animal. Okay, so what I've shown you is when we look at the regeneration process from the point of view Regeneration process from the point of view of the actin fibers, we can identify these fossa and we can identify the region that will become the head and the foot of the regenerating animal. Now we wanted to see how these defect patterns and this fiber pattern and defect configuration influence the dynamics of the tissue. And for that, we needed to develop ways to image and analyze our images in a more detailed manner with higher spatial and temporal results. With higher spatial and temporal resolution. And an important part here was to consider not only the fibers, which I showed you earlier, but also the cells. So what you're seeing here is a movie of the same regeneration process where we're looking at the basal and the apical surface of the cells. So basically, we're looking at the outer layer, which is labeled with a probe that allows us to see the actin fibers. And computationally, we're separating the lower surface. Separating the lower surface, which shows us the fibers, with the upper surface where we see the outlines of the cells. And what this allows us is to look at the dynamics of the tissue, and in particular, look at the strain pattern in the tissue as it's regenerating and correlate that with the fiber pattern. So, what I'll show you in the next few slides are movies of regenerating hybra, where we look at the fibers and we look at the tissue strain pattern from the cells. From the cells. And when we do that carefully, we see that these foci actually undergo transient events of localized stretching. So what you're seeing here is a movie of a regenerating hydra. And the head side, what will become the head of the animal, the future head side, is facing us. And the defect, the foci, which becomes a defect, is labeled here with this square. So what you're seeing here on top is the fibers. Here you're seeing the apical surface. Here you're seeing the apical surface showing you the cell outline. And here you can see segmented movies where individual cells have been segmented. They're marked according to their area on the left and according to their shape. So how anisotropic or isotropic the shape is on the right. And on top of that, you can see the nematic organization. So if I start the movie again, if you have sharp eyes, you can notice that occasionally this region undergoes very dramatic. Undergoes very dramatic inflations where the cells in the defect region become red, meaning they become very large. And at the same time, cells away from this region become squished, so become squished in the direction of the fibers. So what we're seeing is that transiently, the cells at this region undergo a dramatic stretching, as you can see here. So this is just a snapshot of one of these stretching events. These stretching events, you see the fibers, you see the focus region. This is in the future head side. Here you can see the two plus half defects at the future foot side. And you can see the cells just before the event and during the event. So you see there's massive stretching here. And here you can see the cells labeled according to their area and anisotropy. You can see that there's massive stretching around the defect site at the future head region. At the same time, we have cells becoming. At the same time, we have cells becoming squished, so becoming anisotropic in the direction of the fibers away from this region. And similarly, at the foot region during these events, we see a much smaller but still some stretching in the foci and cells becoming squished away from the foci. And these events are recurring at the same site. So I showed you before that the cells that are at the defect region actually are maintained. Defect region actually are maintained at the defect region. So the same cells are at the plus one defect site. And what you can see here is the average cell area is a function of time for cells at different distances from these foci. So the red line here depicts cells at the core of the foci. So these are cells that are up to three cell distances, cells, cells from the effect regions. So we measure distance. So we measure distance not by actual distance because the shade deforms a lot, but actually by cell, neighboring cells. So these are cells that are up to three cells away from the defect region. The green line depicts cells that are at intermediate distance, so three to six cells from the defect region. And the blue depicts cells that are further away. And what you can see here, when we look at the average cell area as a function of time, that we see these repeated stretching events. And we see these repeated stretching events where the cell area in the defect region, in the core region, increases by a factor of two or even more. And these recur again and again, roughly every hour, at the defect site. And we see similar events at the future foot region, but of smaller magnitude. Here you can see plots during these events of the area strain. Of the area strain and the cell shape changes as a function of distance from the defect. So, if we look at the upper graph here, what we're seeing is the area strain as a function of distance from the defect, where we're using a logarithmic strain. And you can nicely see that the strain is focused at the defect site and goes down as we go away from the defect. And the average increase in area is about a factor of two. So, the cells are stretching by a dramatic. So the cells are stretching by a dramatic amount at the focus, and this is very at the foci, at actin foci. And this stretching is very localized at the defect region. At the same time, if we look at the cell shape, we see that the cell shape near the core of the defect is isotropic. So there's zero cell anisotropy. And as we go away from the defect, the cells become elongated. So this would be the direction of the fiber. The fibers, so they're elongated in a perpendicular direction. And similarly, if we look at the events near the future foot, we see some stretching at the core of the defect that goes down, much smaller than in the future head region. And again, this pattern of anisotropy where cells near the defect are isotropic and they become anisotropic as you go away from the defect. And here you can just see the amplitude of the events at the future. Of the events at the future head and the future foot. So, as I said earlier, the future head has events that undergo much larger stretching than the future foot. Okay, so if we look now at the future head and the future foot region, we can say that these regions undergo different behavior. So, specifically, if I'm looking here at the number of events as a function of time, and I'm looking at these large stretching events or also Large stretching events, or also the tissue can rupture. What we see is that these events recur at the future head site, do not happen at all at the middle of the animal. So, what's called the future gastric is what will become the mid-part of the animal. And we don't see any big events at the future foot, only small events. So, going back to what I said earlier, we have the same cells in this region that in this defect region, which repetitively undergo. Which repetitively undergo again and again these large deformation sites. And this is specific for the cells that will become the head of the animal. And actually, the intuition for this is quite simple. So I told you that these regions that the future head are a focus of the actin fibers. A plus one defect of contractile fibers. Now, when all these fibers contract, what will happen is that this region will What will happen is that this region will actually become stretched because everything is contracting from all directions. So, if we have activation of the contraction in all these fibers, we'll get this transient strain focusing at the defect site. Okay, so in the first part of my talk, what I did was look at this process of regeneration from the point of view of the pneumatic fibers. And what I showed is we start with this piece of tissue that inherits this organization. That inherits this organization, this beautiful parallel array of fibers from the parent animal. Once this tissue folds, it folds in a stereotypic way and defects develop in the closed spheroid. And eventually, these defect regions will coincide with the location of the head in the foot of the animal. So the obvious question is: what this has to do with the process of Has to do with the process of amorphogenesis. So, do these defects have any functional role in the formation of the head and the foot? What I told you is that we can identify the regions that will become the head and the foot just by looking at the actin fibers, but the question is, what are they doing there? And to understand this, I have to tell you a little bit more about the process of axial patterning in hydromorphogenesis. So, the main So, the main feature that is responsible for patterning the hydra and defining the head region is what's called the head organizer. So, an organizer is well known in many developmental systems as a piece of tissue that actually generates signals that induce the formation of structures in a developing animal in other tissues. And in Hydra, this Hydra, this organizer is present at the tip of the head of the animal. And this was shown in classic experiments over 100 years ago by Ethel Brown. What she did was she took a white hydra and she took the tip of the head of the hydra and grafted it, attached it to the middle of the animal, of a green animal. And what you can see here is the resulting, the result of this experiment. And what she saw is that this white piece of tissue actually induced. White piece of tissue actually induced the formation of a new head, and you can see that it induced the formation of the head from green tissue. So, this head organizer, which is present on the tip of the head, is capable of generating signals for head formation. In a mature animal, it has to be maintained continuously. During these regeneration experiments that we're doing, we have to form a new organizer, de novo. And if we look, so there's Look, so there's been quite a lot of research on the signaling underlying the head organizer. And what was found is that there's a signaling pathway. It's called the wind pathway. It doesn't really matter the name. But what you can see is that this, what you're seeing here is expression of proteins from this signaling pathway. And you can see that they're localized really at the tip of the head of the animal. And there's quite a bit known about their signaling dynamics. That their signal, the signaling dynamics, and some autoregulatory signaling pathway that leads to the formation of a region with high wind. But if I take together what I've shown you in my talk today, this region with a signaling hub also corresponds to a region that has a plus one defect. So the organizer site in all high. The organizer site in all Hydra always connects the signaling center. You can see this here in this label, which labels this protein, this wind protein. So you can see that there is a localized spot at the tip of the hair, and this localized spot coincides exactly with the location of the plus one defect. Now, in the first part of my talk, what I showed you is that we can identify the site that will become the new organizer in the regenerated animal from the onset of the From the onset of the regeneration process. When we looked at the closed ferroid, we can identify these foci, and these foci are the region, mark the cells that will become the organizer. Furthermore, I showed you that these sites actually has a very clear mechanical cue. We see that there's repeated large stretching and rupture events that are localized specifically at this site. So I remind you that if we look at these cells. I remind you that if we look at these cells at this area, we see that they're repeatedly being stretched in a transient manner. And just to remind you, from a signaling point of view, that we are cutting a piece of tissue from a region that initially lacks this organizer. So if you look here, we're cutting the piece of tissue from the middle of the animal, which initially lacks any signal. So the question we want to understand is how the location of the How is the location of the defect related with the location of the signaling center? And does this unique mechanical cue that we observe in this location, does it have any functional role in defining the head organizer? Okay, so now I'll present an idea for a mechanochemical feedback loop that relates the organization of the actin fibers and the signaling. And I should note that this is. Signaling, and I should note that this is still a hypothesis, so it's still not proven. So, we're relating here three fields: we have the nematic field, which is this field that shows us the organization of the actin fibers. We have the strain field, so the deformation of the tissue. And we have a morphogen field, which is a concentration of morphogen in cells, which we currently can't measure, but we Can't measure but reflects the signaling dynamics in the tissue. Now, what I showed you in the first part of my talk is that this nematic field has these foci that develop into defects and that there's recurring strain focusing at these sites. So, what we see is that these defect sites translate to a strain field at the localized at the future Future organizer site. Now, what we're speculating is that this localized tissue stretching induces localized production of amorphogen. So, initially, we start with a piece of tissue that doesn't have any signaling, we don't have any initial signal in the excised tissue. And then, what we're saying is that this strain focusing actually helps produce morphogen specifically at this site. Specifically at this site. So, this is not proven, but it's consistent with recent experiments by Tsials' group, who've shown that if you put tissues in isotropic media, which where they experience less tissue stretching, you can entirely diminish the production of morphogen. So, what we're including in this feedback is that this local strain focusing leads to local morphogen production, and then the And then the last part of this feedback loop is that if we have gradients of morphogen, these tend to align the actin fibers. So, again, the mechanism is unknown, but if we have such a mechanism, this will allow us to relate the concentration of morphogen to the actin organization. And what this generates is a positive feedback loop because once you have a region with strain focusing, it will induce morphogen production. It will induce morphogen production and it will induce alignment of the fibers around this to lead to this radial configuration, which will enhance the strain, giving us a positive feedback loop where an initial foci will generate strain, generate morphogen, and develop into a more concentrated region of strain focusing. Okay, so to so first So, first, if we perturb the signaling, we can see that we can disrupt plus one defect formation. So, we are doing these perturbations by pharmacological inhibitions or by changing the media. So, if we insert a drug that inhibits the wind signaling pathway, what we see is that actually new fibers do not form. So, what we see is in the folded spheroid, we see this disordered region, and this disordered region is essentially maintained. Disordered region is essentially maintained. So, we don't see the formation of these nice pneumatic fibers in the initially disordered region. And so, plus one defects do not develop in the tissue. If we put the system in isotonic media, so this is the same conditions used in this paper I just mentioned. So, hydra is a freshwater animal, so there's continuous influx of water, which leads to hydrostatic pressures and inflation of the tissue. Pressures and inflation of the tissue. If we put the tissue in higher osmolarity, we can get rid of these osmotic inflations. And what we find is that under this configuration, the system actually develops this four plus half defect configuration. So what you're seeing here is the same tissue image from both sides. And you can see that it has this pair of plus half defects on one side and another pair of plus half defects on the other side. And here you can just see the summary of the configuration. The summary of the configuration. So, unlike our normal samples, which typically have a plus-one defect and two plus-half defects on the other side, under these conditions, where among other things, the signaling is also repressed, the morphogen signaling is also repressed, what we find is the tissue develops this four plus half defect configuration. So, this is an indication that, as we would think from our physics intuition, that the system Physics intuition that the system, if it has pneumatic order, it can develop four plus half defects. And actually, to get a plus one defect, you need to do something else to stabilize, which is what we think the morphogen is doing. So we can take this model and test if this idea could work by developing a simulation of this model. And this has been done in collaboration with the group of Marko Popovich at the MPI PKS in Dresden. MPI PKS in Dresden and his student Sugantan. So, the idea here is to first model the tissue mechanics. So, to model the tissue mechanics, we're thinking of an elastic deformable shell. This shell is, as I'll show you, we're describing with a vertex model. And we have an embedded pneumatic field which describes the actin fibers in these tissues. So, in each of these cells, we actually have an Of these cells, we actually have a nematic which is not related to the shape of the cell but is related to the orientation of the actin fibers in that region. Apart from that, we have these nematic fibers. When the muscle is activated, these will contract, so these will generate active stress. And all this is done where the enclosed volume within this shell is uncompressible, so we have a volume constraint. Okay, so this is just a mathematical description of the model we use. So, what we use is a model as a vertex model. So, basically, the degrees of freedom of the model are the vertices of the cells, and the cells are described by polygons. And then, this is a free energy describing the vertex model. So, we have some area, preferred area, and preferred perimeter. And then we also add some bending energy to the Also, add some bending energy to this energy. So, this is the energy of the vertex model. We introduce the volume constraint with the Lagrange multiplier. So, V is the volume enclosed and U is the Lagrange multiplier. We have an active stress. So, this is generated by the actin fibers. So, the actin fibers are described by this pneumatic tensor, two-dimensional tensor in each of the cell. And this generates a stress, which generates a force on the vertices. And then the vertex does. And then the vertex dynamics are driven by this gradient of this energy function and these active forces. In addition to the tissue mechanics, we have a morphogen field and the enematic field. We're running out of time. You need to wrap up, please. Excuse me? You have run out of time. You should wrap up. I will finish. Okay, I will wrap up. Thank you. I will wrap up very quickly. So I won't go into the details, but basically, we have a nomatic model and a line. Basically, we have a nematic model and alignment to the morphogen gradient, and here morphogen dynamics with production that depends on the strain in the tissue. And I just want to show you a simulations of this model, and with that, I will end. So, what you're seeing here, we start with a tissue that has the initial actin alignment that we see in the experiments with no amorphogen production. And over time, what you see is that the strain foci develops an actin foci and. Develops an actin foci, and the system develops into the configuration that we see in the experiments with a plus one defect at one side with a morphogen peak and two plus halves in the other side. So again, didn't go into the details, and I'll skip this part showing that if we have extra defects, if we induce extra defects in the system, we can induce multiaxial animals. So, this is when we take opiate. So, this is when we take open rings that fold. And again, I won't go into the tissue, but this is when we constrain the animal into a channel. And you can get excess defect will lead to multiaxial morphologies, which is nicely predicted by the model. And just to wrap up, so what I've shown you is that the pneumatic fiber orientation provides a coarse grain field whose dynamics give us a description of the hydromorphogenesis. The hydromorphogenesis. We can identify the sites that will become the head and the foot of the animal just by looking at the actin fiber organization in the spheroid early on. And we identify these regions, and we can see that there is a specific mechanical cue there with this mechanical strain focusing at defect sites. And we propose this feedback loop where the organizer formation is actually resulting from this self-organizing process with this mechanical feedback loop. With this mechanical feedback loop, mechanochemical feedback loop that I introduced. And finally, I'd just like to thank my co-workers on this project. So, a lot of this work was done as part of the PhD of Yonit Maurice Zach, who was a graduate student in my lab with contributions from other people in my lab. The initial part was a collaboration with Eris Braun, who's my colleague at the Technion, and all the modeling was done in collaboration with Marko and Popovich's group in Dresden. I'm happy to.
