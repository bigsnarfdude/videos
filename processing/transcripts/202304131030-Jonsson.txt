I guess that's the theme here as well. Like there are complex complex aspects and there are more algebraic aspects and arithmetic aspects. If you look at the review, not the very beginning, but say when complex dynamics and higher dimensions were developed by that first minimum, maybe it's especially Fornes and C Bunin. So you see a lot of things that were done like holomorphically, but in fact maybe was much more Was much more algebraic and practice, and even sometimes there's some hidden arithmetic things there as well. Anyway, so I'll just want to, in dimension one, especially start illustrating just some random samples of these kind of connections here, and then I'll focus on the two-dimensional case. So here's dimension one. All right, so what I want to say. So first is just, right, suppose I studied. Studied just a quadratic family, right? Say over the complex numbers. That's of course very interesting to study. But suppose a particular role is our special parameter values for which you have the critical point, or say zero, maybe I should say, is pre-private for M, M different for. For M, M different from N, right? And of course, just there at this, you see that this is an algebraic equation in C. So this means that C is automatically an algebraic number. And then, well, then you can try to go further. At least there's some, just studying that, of course, means that there's arithmetic considerations underlying, and I'm not going to go in that direction. Another thing is. Another thing is, again, these are the random samplings, but say that there's a very nice theorem of Baker and DeMarco, which later has been generalized and will given rise to a lot of other work. So this, I guess, is really maybe an algebraic problem. So saying that if I have, suppose I study this, maybe I call this Fc here. This Fc here. Suppose I have two such things, and if I'm looking at, suppose I have that the preperiodic points of Fc1 have an intersection of that with the preperiodic points of FC2, if this is an infinite set. Well, this is the case if and only if C1 is equal to plus minus C2. Plus minus C2. So that's a purely algebraic statement, but at least in their proof, and I think in general, for these kinds of things, complex dynamics can be a very useful tool for proving these things. And then maybe one thing which is more in the direction that I want to talk about here is also if you have a complex dynamical system, again. Complex dynamical system again, look. Well, maybe let me say it's not necessarily this form, but suppose I have, say, a polynomial, one variable, but with coefficients that are algebraic numbers. Suppose I have a fixed point for it again. So, one of the first things you learn in complex dynamics is this classification of fixed points. Right, so it can be super attracting, attracting, but not super attracting, I guess, repelling. And then you can be neutral. In the neutral case, you have the linearizable case, and then the non-linearizable case, the case with the Kramer fixed point. And in this case, you can actually rule out that this zero is not a Kramer fixed point. Automatically, just for knowing this, right? And it's just because if I have set lambda to be the multiplier here of the interesting case or the difficult case, if this is of absolute value one, so if you suppose that this is, let's see, I guess, if I'm supposing it's not a root of unity, then Then you can just from the fact that you're, I mean, lambda will be an algebraic number, that this cannot be too small. That is exactly the case when this is somehow very small for certain large values of n, which prevents you from linearizing. Okay, that's what I wanted to say and mention one. One questions? So, there are probably other examples, and certainly there's an enormous amount of work in the second category here, including by a number of people in this room. So, dimension two. So dimension two, I guess for the theme of this conference, I should study head-on maps. And submit, that's not really going to say very much, but so say this is a henon or maybe a polynomial automorphism, depending on the definition of what a henon map is. It's this or it's special. This or it's a special case of this. So, of course, then you can study this, the complex dynamics of this has been studied by many people. But for example, certainly the work of the bed for Lubich Miley and the others, and it's also for Nessie Moni. But then you can ask, okay, so there are a lot of these things, and I guess many of them are not worked for any map like that. But I guess you can ask, let me ask this, I'm not going to give an answer, but I mean, are things kind of better? F this defined over rational numbers. I would imagine that there's something in this third category here, because linearization of fixed points. But okay. So I'm not going to really say anything more there. But I want to take the same one of the things to study here is. Is one of the nice things of the theory is that the ergodic theory is well understood, as has been explained here earlier. So you have the measure of maximal entropy can be constructed. First of all, there is unique measure of maximal entropy, and it can be so there is. It can be constructed as a wedge product of positive closed currents, a 1-1 current. And so this wedge product is something you find analytically in terms of potential theory, pleur potential theory. And this is at least a situation where this is quite nice. These are kind of continuous potentials. So it's not... it works. So it's not, it works very well to intersect them and the measure has good properties. It doesn't charge too small sets and so on. And then a lot of results in this direction. Right, so now I want to study, actually maybe I guess I do have permission to go below this thin blue line here. Thin blue line here. But I think let me still erase this because I'm going to get to the situation I actually want to study. So I want to study instead of one case which is still in dimension two but a little more complicated. So that's for birational maps. Now let me say birational maps. Mass, let me save my rational mass of P2 at this point. So it is an invertible self-map of P2, except that it's not defined everywhere. It's a rational map, and the inverse is birational. And I'm going to assume also that it's as The gradient, let me call this black, breaking equal to 2, just in terms of the homogeneous coordinates, the components there. And then I'm going to assume that this is what was in Jeff's talk, algebraically stable. At least for now. So I'm going to recall what this means. I mean, you could define this in different ways, but I think the advantage of this two-dimensional situation is that I'm kind of explicitly understand that. Kind of explicitly understand that it means that the following situation doesn't happen. You never have that as a curve floating down, contracting to a point, and then this point moves around under F a number of times, then it blows up again to another curve. So this doesn't happen. So that's for certain biractional maps, this is true, for others, it's not true. But for the time being, I'm going to assume this. So I guess you give notation. So this would be a point in the indeterminacy set of F, because F is not defined there. It wants to, it has a lot of images. And then this, on the other hand, would be a point in the indeterminacy set of f inverse. At the inverse, okay. Right. So, in this case, so this was done by, I guess, this is due to Fournes and Sigma E. I guess they did use the term algebraic stable. That was introduced by Sebu Ni later, or go for back, but it's great. It's right. So, among other things, they prove that in this case there are these currents, at least T plus minus. So, I mean, maybe I don't necessarily need the actual definition of them, but basically you take a, say the FUB SUB, one line form of T2, and you pull it back, and then you formalize by lambda to minus n, and you prove that this has a limit. Anyway, these exist. Anyway, these exist and they are not as nice in general as in this case. They don't necessarily have continuous potentials, but they're not too bad. So there are various things known here, but okay, maybe I'll say too singular, but they're somewhat singular, so it's a little bit into detail here, but not, but also not. Here, but not, but also not as nice as a bottom. So various results. There's a result by Charlotte. It is maybe in a stasis or around showing exactly where the long numbers of these things are. It's kind of where you expect it to be, and so on. But there's a question, anyways. The question here is: is this, for example, Here is, is this, for example, a measure of maximal entropy, or can you, for instance, is this well-defined and if it's well defined, does it have kind of good properties? And as far as I know, I don't think this. I don't think this answer to this is known in general. So, there are kind of, so this is what you would want, I mean, a way to think about this. There are many experts in the audience, but not everybody. So, one way to think about a possibility of closed current is something that interpolates between, say, a sub-variety or a curve, in this case, a complex curve, and then something smooth, like a smooth 1-1 form, a K-O form, or something like that. So, one way to think of this is maybe a case which one would essentially like. A case which one would essentially like to have is that the that it's it's like T plus, for example, is essentially some kind of average of curves lining up like that, some kind of laminar structure. And then in the other direction, you have ABT minus, and then the intersection would just be kind of encode the intersection points and The intersection points. And in many cases, this is known to be true. But a priori, it's maybe not clear from the construction here. And there is some kind of, it's not exactly a net, from what I know, there's no negative answer to the question, there's no example of it work, but there are some problems to worry about. So there is, well, I'll give some kind of, I'll give the point of the talk is that it sometimes works very well, but if you Well, that if you want to find bad examples, you can. So, there were some examples given by Shell, and then it was, I guess the worst examples are by Xavier Beav. I forget which year this was, ten years ago or something, I don't know, maybe more. So, there exists these globes to get. So there exists an F such that these currents, T plus minus, are pluripolar. So they don't necessarily live on a hypersurface, but they live in a pluripolar set. And that doesn't mean you can you could still a priori intersect them, but you have to know something much more specific. Know something much more specific about it. So this would be a bad situation, and it's a kind of very clever, nice proof using the Bear category theorem. So maybe I should say that this means it's kind of difficult question mark to define this. Okay, so right so now I want to get to um so there is a on the positive side the various conditions allowing you to actually do this and I guess the one that's relevant here is in work of Bedford and Diller. So there's something called the Bedford-Diller energy condition. I'm not going to explain exactly why it's called the energy condition, but it comes from lunar potential theory. And the condition is the following. So it essentially means that you have some kind of quantitative information which is better than this. So this just says that I take a forward image. That if I take a forward image of any point in IF inverse, it never hits IF. And then you want to say that, well, it doesn't even come too close. So there's some, and it's a pretty generous condition. Anyway, so it means this, that if I take the sum from n equal to 1 to infinity, and then I take lambda to the minus n, and then I just take the distance. And then I just take the distance, as a usual distance in projected projective plane, and in fact, it's a log of the distance from x, but f and x to the indeterminacy set of f that this is, yes, we want this to be bigger than minus infinity. And this is supposed to be true for every x inside my. My neighbors. So let me call this not star, let me call it E. So it's, as I said, if you think about it, it's... La Planda is the degree? Algebraic degree? Well, so here I'm on P2, so yeah, it is the algebraic, the first dynamical degree if you want, but you're it's a here's some algebraically stable state. Alright, so then under this condition, it turns out that things work beautifully. So I'm not going to state exactly all the things here, but it's... Well, so buy bed for Dillard, the work by Duj Nujalin by Diller, Dujardin, Get. Get F E other thing is just meaning that this Bedford-Diller condition, Bedford-Diller energy condition means that the dynamics, like the complex dynamics of F is great. In a very technical sense. So, again, I want to announce that, like, you're really, for instance. I want to go down. But you really, for instance, pictures like this is work. You have a laminar structure of t plus and t minus the intersection. Anyway, yeah, the point of the talk is not to go into exactly all of that. Just to say that this is a very satisfactory situation where you can verify this. Yeah. Is it only fit if it should be the other way? Yes, yes. For example, this in these examples it fits. And also in earlier examples, like Chava. So if you think about it, this kind of looks for this to fail, the image of this indeterminacy point has to come very, very close here to this, if you think about it. But it can still happen. So the examples of Shaw would be, well, essentially you have some bad irrational rotation on some invariant surface or something like that, so invariant P1. So you can certainly arrange it so that this doesn't happen. This doesn't happen. Anyway, so then the theorem which I'll state, so I guess I'll just state it here. So this is what I did a few number of years ago, and I am. So this is true. Yeah, so this is that the first statement is that this for Diller energy condition holes, if F is If f is divided over the number of fields over the algebraic number. And the second, which I won't really talk too much about, so that's hidden over here. So it's also, so this is also true if f If f uh even if f is not algebraically stable. Okay, so what I mean by that is well, so it's known by work of well Diller found a slight improvement quite a bit for Diller is that if you're not hydrogenically stable, let's say that the dynamic will be. But say that the dynamical degree still defines precisely bigger than 1, for example, then you can find lift. So you can lift, you add P2 down here, and find some X, some glow ups, so that up here you have the corresponding energy condition satisfied. But I will focus on, even though in some sense, this may be more satisfactory, because that just means you have. Is it that just means you have, it's going to be true for any birational surface map defined over a number field, as long as the dynamical degree is strictly bigger than one. So number two says it's not algebraically. So you think it's not algebraically stating on P2. Yes, all of it is. Yes, that's right. So in some sense, the number two, the version is more satisfactory, but I will talk about number one here. Any other questions? Other questions? And I should say, okay, so this is squeezing it in here. I'm sorry. That's maybe not so nice to the organizers here. There's a very recent result by Result by Toma and Gerrien, which is basically that this is a version of one, the first case, on higher-dimensional projective space. So I will not say in detail what that means, exactly what that means, or how they do it, but in that case, it's maybe not exactly this condition. It really has to do. This condition, it really has to do more honestly with the energy that features in the name here. I think that's all I'll say here. So now I want to just say a few words about how you prove this question. Yeah, I mean, is it sharp in the sense that you cannot improve in any condition or what you draw? You get, I mean, the range of energies you get. Of energies you get. Yeah, sorry. I'm not a big. I mean, can you get a better energy condition or is it sharp? I think we get. No, I think it shows up naturally. You'll see in the proof, basically. And it doesn't mean that it cannot get anything better, of course, but no. There's any other case at the end of this run. Yeah, maybe. At least it's. Well, anyway, we'll see in the proof by works out. So, this is for Bedford-Dillard's hold, we want to be defined over the bar and to be stabilizable on some model. Like, because the monomial irrational rotation is defined right, but that's not birational, I think, right? The one that's not cannot be made algebraically stable? Yeah, that one is not birational. It's a rational but not invariable. You have to. Variable map, you have to pass the dimension three, and that'd be interesting, but beyond the scope here. So, you don't have to assume algebraically stabilizable or right. So, for number two here, I mean, it was already known, right, in January earlier that any birational self-map of any surface, particularly P2, by making some clever blow-ups, you can arrive in a situation where it is greatly stable. But of course, you don't have the energy. Of course, you don't have the energy. I mean, so this energy condition may not be satisfied then, but the statement is that if you're if you choose this carefully, then the energy will condition will be satisfied if you're over 11. Like 15. Yes, 15. All right, that's interesting. All right, so that's true. So I want to keep, yeah, maybe I'll need to erase, but just Yeah, maybe I'll need to erase, but just kind of keep this picture in mind that you want to make sure somehow the idea is that you don't get too close. The image at this point doesn't get too close to the image. The point, I mean, of course you have to inject the arithmetic information that you work with our number field. I'm going to simplify things quite a bit. Simplify things quite a bit. So just deal with that. Maybe I'll say some word if I have time later. So for simplicity, I'm going to assume I'm going to assume that everything is actually defined over q instead of q bar. Not that it doesn't really matter at all for the arguments, it's just a little bit less. Right, so then I guess that means f and what else? So maybe I guess these indeterminacy points f and if inverse, so this is defined over q. Q and we'll prove a stronger statement. So maybe I don't even need, well, yeah. Oh, I guess I do. It's not much stronger, but it just says that we have this energy condition, but not just for the points in the contracted images of the contracted curves, but in fact for all rational points. Fractional points chose this V D that is hold for all points X in points just with rational coefficients. Well, such that for which the orbit is defined. Of course, you don't want I guess I want fn of x um not to be in the indeterminate system of f So, these points that I have a well-defined forward orbit. So I'm not going to lift it to anything here, but I'll do just the thing if you don't want to work. Don't like non-affine varieties. You can lift this to C3 or maybe A3. C3, or maybe A3. Um, right. Maybe so you have, of course, a map from E2 to itself. Just basically homogeneous coordinates. Let's see if I want to call this maybe this. This is f and this is pi. And strictly speaking, I also have a x apply. Have a bi-rational map here. So, capital F, because it can happen that something is mapped to the origin that has to do exactly with a determinacy set. That's just capital F. So, I'm going to work with this one. And then also going to need, so the arithmetic information comes in through the notion of a height. And here is really this simplest version essentially available here. Essentially available here. So I'm just going to deal with the heights of points on P2, but then also each one. So every point with rational coordinates can associate to height, which essentially just tells you how many digits you need to describe at this point. Describe this point. So you could describe this in a couple of different ways. So you could write, for example, if I write, so if I have x in, if I take such a point, I can write it in homogeneous coordinates using, say, a0, a1, a2. And so I'm making it very simple here. So I even have a kind of a canonical representation like this. Have a kind of a canonical representation like this where the AIs are integers and they don't have a common factor. So if you're over a general number field, maybe you don't want to think about it exactly this way. Anyway, here we have essentially a canonical representation. So just some sign or something. And then in this case, the height is h of x, right? So there, well, one way, the simplest way. So one way, the simplest way to say it is just I'm going to do the log of the max of the size of these integers. So you see, that's greater than or equal to zero. A better way to work with it is, and which indicates how you actually do it more generally, is that you sum over all v equals all. Over all v to all places of q. So, in practice, this means you sum over the archemenia, that's the usual Euclidean norm, that's kind of one point, and then you sum over all the primes, that's the prime numbers. Over general number field, this is like this. And that added you log of, let me write it, this is the V norm of A, where A now is, so this. Where A now is, so this V norm, I've been here, but the V norm of A is now equal to just the max over I of the V norm of the individual AIs. So this would be the chaotic norm or the usual norm. And this is kind of in this representation is trivial because all of these other terms are going to be zero. zero in fact but the advantage of this representation is that I don't need to I don't need to impose this condition of the GCT still true that's fine product far okay so what's going on here so what I'm then I should be in good shape here so I want to introduce something that has to do with this energy condition Energy condition. The height is closely related. Well, there's economical height you can try to work with. I don't directly do that. But it kind of is natural to look at, let's say, phi v of x to be just, say, the log if I take f of a. F of A B minus and then lambda times normal A. So I'm doing this for any point. So this doesn't depend on what lift I take up here. So the energy condition, which I just erased, actually is natural. It's. I actually want to suffice to just show. It suffices to show kind of a principle, a stronger thing. So for every place, and only the energy condition, usual one, is for the infinite place, saying that I have this condition here, so n equal to one, lambda to the n minus n, and then it's just this v of f to the n of x, right? That this is bigger than minus infinity, and this is going to be true for all, well, for all x, such that. X such that yeah, f fun of X does not cube every surface left. So I've rewritten the energy condition in terms of something more maybe manageable here, but I should also say that already the original energy conditions, I guess it was written like this, and it's just more easier to explain. Easier to explain in terms of distance, but something similar to that. Okay, so it suffices to show this because what we if you only need this for the archibedian absolute value, then you can see that get this here. Alright, so what's the idea now? We work with all work with all places V. Work with all places V. And the idea is you want, for each one of them, you want this sum not to be greater than, I guess you want to work with a truncated sum. You want to make sure that sum is not too large negative. But the point is that, yeah, well, you have to implement many terms. If you sum over all the V's, you get the height, and that one is actually non-negative. And then you want to make sure that there's no term that can compensate for. That can compensate for this being very large negative. It's just not so bad to write out, so let me just do it. So, the first statement here is just about the statement about this VV, which these are easier. So there is a constant just depending on the place here, so that V V of X is for every X squared, this is well defined. And for every V, right, so you have something, a uniform bound from above, right? This can be very small if you kind of close, if you close that, if X is essentially, X is close to being in a determinacy point, this can be large negative, but it cannot be arbitrarily large positive. And that just comes from writing out what this F is. In our case, it's written by, in terms of just integer coefficients. So we just have this. So you just have this, and moreover, in fact, this constant Cv is actually zero for almost every all but finitely many V. This is that estimate. Then you have the second estimate, well it's not the estimate, but if I sum all of these over a given point V, this V V O X, this is just a statement about heights. Let's see, I'm mainstream. I think it's I should I mistake my notes for sure but I think it's I want f of h of f of f but h of the height of f of x minus lambda times the height of x. And the point of that thing is, well, so I have that, and the height is always So I have that, and the height is always non-negative. So now, if I did this correctly, if I did, if I look at the sum over all these and I truncate this from 1 to n equal to 1 to capital N, and I look at lambda to the minus n, and then phi v of f to the n of x. So you see that this is equal to Equal to, if I did this right, it's lambda to the minus and yeah, yeah. Well, it could be alpha by something, but it's essentially this probably alpha by something here. But anyway, the point is that this is here, we have something depending on n, but the only thing I care about is the estimate from below. Estimate from below. I know this is not negative, so this is just greater than equal to minus h of x. So then you're essentially done because inside here, just look at each B, we can say about this term, well, for all of them, they're essentially they're bounded, they're all bounded by some constant. Maybe it's not CB, some C prime B. C V some C prime B independent of X and O N. This is for all V. And also, this is a finite constant. This is for L V. And in fact, this C prime V is actually equal to zero for almost every. So then, right, so that to me is exactly it's not really an infinite sum. So I can just find it in many terms. Just define as many terms. I know that the sum is bounded below, and each term is bounded above, and that just means each term is actually bounded below as well. So it's just that. So this implies this star. So it's really quite simple. That really implies what we want. Buyers what we want. Right. So maybe I'll just say, right, are they priceless? Well, yeah, no, maybe if I match, maybe I okay. I'll just uh stop here.
