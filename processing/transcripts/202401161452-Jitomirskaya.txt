Thank you very much and thank you the organizers to putting all this together. It's a very impressive meeting and thank you for organizing such a weather because you know even people who came here to enjoy the scenery they're now stuck. Okay, so yeah, my the title of my talk is Development of Exponents and Robust Is the level of exponents and robust row? So, this is a meeting of random and quasi-periodic. So, to quasi-periodic people, I do not need to introduce almost the interpret because, you know, I just counted ahead of myself here: that first of all, three of the organizers, everybody present. Organizers, everybody present here have done some fundamental work on this operator. And then if you just extend from the organizers to participants, so other participants who have done important work on this operator, here is the list. So it's like almost half the people here have done work on this operator, right? And then uh but But of course, we need to be inclusive to the random people here. So it is this family, very simple looking family, that the name was coined by Barry Simon in the early 80s along with the De Martini problem, which I will explain in a second. And it was kind of, its popularity probably grew because of being featured. Probably grew because of being featured very heavily in Simon's list of important problems. He first, in his famous paper, 15 problems in mathematical physics, he featured three almost muted problems. And then in Mathematical Physics in the 21st century, published in 2000, he listed another, somewhat different three, almost not the problem. And all of them are solved out of the problem. So some other So some other uh famous people except for those who worked on this model here some further names now uh well you forgot your own name no it's john okay so of course another reason Of course, another reason for its popularity is that it comes from physics, where it actually comes from the Harper's model of tight binding two-dimensional electron in a magnetic field. So basically, it's given by this guy. It has fascinating history. And what is the relation to the almost material rate? Do you see that this one is periodic in one variable? So basically, if you do block locket decomposition in this one, If you do block located composition in this one variable, this effectively reduces it to the direct integral integrator that is the parameter of this operator. So in particular, the spectrum of this guy is equal to the union of spectra of this guy in theta. But if alpha is a rational, this is an aquatic family, the spectrum does not depend on theta, so for every theta this guy is just as a spectrum. And just to give you an idea of the particularity of this model in physics, if you do a Google search, you see. Well, okay. This is not entirely good to be. talking about our model but even if you do something like that you still have plenty even though they're not fully genuine but you get you get them very well okay so this is the Harper's model and the 10 Martini problem is questioned about the spectrum of this operator which is the same as the spectrum of the almost mature operator as I just explained. So if alpha is equal to zero, this is just zero this is just a discrete two-dimensional Laplacian so the spectrum is minus four four and the question is what happens for other alpha and the physical meaning of alpha is this magnetic flux it's actually parameter so what happens for other alpha and the famous answer is this this is this Hofdadder butterfly which plots the spectra of this operator is this Operator is this picture was produced in 1976. So it plots the spectra of this operator for 50 different values of flux alpha, rational values of flux alpha. And so on the vertical, rational values of flux, and on the horizontal are the spectra. So if flux is zero, the spectrum is minus four, four. As we discussed, if alpha is p over q, it becomes immediate in this one-dimensional. Immediate in this one-dimensional representation that it's a periodic operator with periodic Q, so the spectrum consists of at most Q bands, like here, Q is for a double one-shirt, and you have these few bands. And it turns out that they are organized in this beautiful self-signal picture. And the 10-martini problem is to prove what is visually obvious in this picture: that if From this picture, is that if alpha actually is a rational node, then this picture shows the rational values of alphas. So the rational alphas are lurking there in between, and they're kind of limits of rational alphas. And it's visually obvious that there should be a technique. And that's what the Tamatini problem states. And also, it's kind of obvious that there should. Of obvious that there should be no exceptions, right? Any irrational alpha, you see here, you get this nice so similar structure converging to it. So basically, that's the formulation of Timartini. The spectrum, the Catro Z for all irrational problems. Interestingly, so a little bit of history. It was predicted actually in 1964 by Mark Asbell, who was who was a Soviet and then Israeli physicist, that this will happen before any computations, before the Hofstadter's picture. But it really became kind of a problem people started thinking about after 1976, after Hofstadter's picture. And Mark Katz in 1982 offered ten martinias. Offered Ten Martinis for proof of Husband's conjecture. And the name Ten Martini problem comes from Barry Simon's paper. It just stacked very gift for names. And there were many partial solutions over the years, basically up to ninety four. And there was a key breakthrough by A key breakthrough by Huich, which I will talk more about later. And complete solution was given in our paper design in 2006. Now, what am I talking about today? How's the quasi-periodic families with Stan Martin? So uh there are there is actually a rich collection of problems with Cantor Spectrum. with uh Cantor spectrum related to Fibonacci operator and other similar operators. But right now I'm in I forgot the word analytic. That's what I meant here. So as analytic was a periodic female is Tan Martini and so Tan Martini is specifically the so we say that an operator satisfies Tan Martini. Satisfies Tan Martine. If the spectrum is a, even though the original problem was specifically for the almost match operator, but it's natural and it has been used this way. If the spectrum is a counterset for all the ratio of. And here we assume that V is a nice function, analytic function. Again, if V is actually like a step function, then it actually often happens. There is a lot of work of David and Columbia. And there is a lot of work of David, a collaborator, about that. We are talking about nice functions, analytical. And so, what are the past results on this for V other than lambda cosine? You've seen lots of results for this very specific case of cosine. And you know, this cosine operator, as I hopefully explained, is relevant to physics. You know, you've seen how many citations. We've seen how many citations, right? So, coming a model coming from physics, it kind of should be a little bit robust with respect to some perturbations, right? Whatever it holds for it should hold in a small neighborhood. So, what are the past results? In this regard, none. So, basically, all these results that I mentioned, all this past work for this was actually high. Was actually highly used the cosine specifics, and I'll explain. In fact, let me talk about past proofs. And the past proofs actually went different ways depending on the arithmetics of alpha. Even though, remember, we say 10 martini that calls for all the rational alpha. And it was eventually solved, but originally, controls back. But originally, Counterspectrum first, so the first really kind of satisfactory proof was by Chey Let Ewing, who developed a purely algebraic argument that allowed the proof for Liouville alphasets. Alphas were developed approximated positions. And so let me jump straight to Piuge. And uh his proof works specifically for Diophantine alpha. Diophantine alpha and so solve the problem there for kind of almost every parameter. And his proof was based on localization. So again, there is also this parameter lambda here for this almost mental this parameter lambda, which is Lambda, which is kind of a little more prominent in the Holmos nature representation. And but I will talk about later that there is certain duality. In fact, it turns out that the spectrum for lambda, for lambda of this operator, is the scale version of the spectrum for one of the lambda. So it's actually enough to prove this for this, where just all mathematics is concerned, it's enough to prove it for lambda bigger. Prove it for lambda bigger or equal than one. And lambda equal to one is a separate story. But for lambda not equal to one, lambda bigger than one, there was a result on localization for specific phases. Actually, the phases for which localization was proved, this was in my 99 paper, they were explicitly described, and in particular it worked for phase 0. Particularly, it worked for phase zero. And you showed, and okay, so basically, this really ties very well with this labeling that I assume Jake talked about today, right? But I don't have time to explain it. But basically, from these kinds of considerations, it follows that follows that eigenvalues of h alpha zero they correspond from gap level consideration they correspond to potential gap edges because potential gap edges can only happen for certain values of integrated density of states and then so we concentrate on that and showed that for diophantine alpha so first of all Alpha. So, first of all, localization requires the effectiveness condition, and then another definite condition also leads to reducibility for the dual model. At each value, there is reducibility for the dual model, specifically to this kind of PC. And then, if C is not equal to zero, then there is more or less classical modern pressure argument that then it corresponds to a nature of an open gap. It corresponds to a nature of an open gap. And Q showed that, and it's a beautiful, very simple argument, that's equal to zero, so reducibility to the identity, is impossible because then a dual operator back in the localization range will have two-dimensional space of eigenfunctions, which is impossible for second difference operator eigenvectors. Trigger as tigen bells are necessarily simple. So that's huge argument in a nutshell. So after this to prove the problem was solved for the almost made to for Liouville and the Alephine cases. And our work with Zabela, where we actually did it for All alpha consisted of on one hand pushing this argument to this limit, to its limit, and on the other hand a different argument from the Diophantine side that used sort of Puges' idea, but also one of key elements was sort of Certain observations that from Cotany's theory, and assuming there is an interval in the spectrum, one can obtain improved regularity of the influx. So this is how the proofs for the almost mature band. And I will just list which parts are cosine-specific. So this part is very, very cosine-specific. I work. Ever tried to do like low degree trigonometric? I tried. I attempted it several times trying with several general collaborators. This is algebraic again. It's extremely algebraic. It's all on really the algebraic structure. On really algebraic structure, which is translated back to the basically to the same thing that the trace has on the cosine. Well, I would just say it's algebra. Avon von Russia is absolutely cosine with symbols. This one is what. This one you can at least try. No, no, I mean, yes, you can try. So you shouldn't try Avon von Russe, but you should try this. Yes, yes, yes, it was a natural idea to try this, at least for the extended carpet model, for example. For the extended Harper's model, for example. It is no locks of okay. But so now, Hugo's argument that I just explained requires cosine actually, at least at the time it was done, in three places, both for this localization, for the fact that the dual operator is second difference, as I will later explain. And here, this Cotani theory argument from Peper Vizavela requires that operator is at second difference. So, basically, this I already said, this part that we did with the other was also required cosine and the Louisville magic also required cosine. Also, required also. So, basically, how can one obtain robust proof? And yeah, this is what I am reporting on today. So, this is a serum joint with Lingron G and Django U. The 1014 actually holds for an open set of analytic. And I'll explain what this open set is. I'll characterize the set for which we can prove, but before doing that, But before doing that, I'll just show some examples. So, in particular, it includes the entire analytic neighborhood of the almost matu, analytic neighborhood of so-called GPS model, analytic neighborhood of the supercritical generalized hardware model. So basically, but I will explain, I will characterize this token set more precisely. Said more precisely, it's very concrete in some sense. But so, before in order to do that, I actually need to go back and describe some other recent, very exciting development. And so you can for a second forget what I said because it's a little different part, but we will later come back. But we will later come back to a description of this set and how the proof goes. So, okay, I'll go a little fast here. So, everyone knows Bergoffer-Godex theorem, of course, and everyone also knows Kinderman's multiplicative ergodic theorem's multiplicative can be viewed as multiplicative version. Alright, so now, so So now, so Miro is complaining that I'm giving a slide talk because, you know, I kind of it's my it's much easier to give a slide talk. And so I've gotten lazy, but you don't even understand the extent to which I have gotten lazy because several of my slides are literally stolen from David. These are the next slides, and I will go very fast over them because I think I don't have enough time. But these are, when you see the beautiful slides, they're still a long. Okay, so basically, so I don't know. Does everyone know linear cocycles here? Yes, good. Okay. And Schrodinger cocycles. Everyone knows Schrodinger cocycles, right? Okay, so just to fix the terminology. And uh so And so, again, going back to Kingland-Lakote's theorem, everyone of course knows the Lapunov exponent. And for the dimensional co-cycles, you of course have the Lapunov exponents, which can be defined this way. We are sigma k as x singular values. They also can come from Kingsman's theorem. There are some such components of the vegetable. So now. So now again let us look at yet another object which is Jensen's form. Everyone knows that, right? This is probably not the most familiar form, but that is it, right? Because if you set up this I epsilon of f for epsilon bigger than zero, which is an integral Than zero, which is an integral logarithmic integral of the circle of radius e to the epsilon. You can rewrite the Jensen's formula about the logarithmic integral in such a way. All right. You probably used a slightly different form, but if you think about it, that's how it goes. And basically, the pictorial representation is this. So i epsilon of f is just a function of 2 pi epsilon. A function of 2π epsilon like that. It's piecewise linear with where it changes slopes at points of the formal logarithm of absolute value of zk, where zk's are zeros of the holomorphic function f in the disk. And the slopes are all integers. The slopes are actually equal to Equal to the multiplicity of zeros of corresponding radius, to the added multiplicity of all zeros up to this radius. The total number of zeros up to this radius. So that's Jensen's form. But of course, you realize that it's a dynamical statement actually because you can think of one frequency. One frequency, one dimensional analytic quasi-periodicycle. Just you map xv, where v is just a real number, into x plus alpha f of xv. So the iteration in the second coordinate gives just the product of the values of f along the trajectory of this rotation by alpha. And then if you set up this logarithm. If you set up this logarithmic integral, like in Jensen's formula, it's immediate from ergodic theorem that it is such a limit, right? So it's actually the Lapunov exponent of this one-dimensional analytic as a periodical cycle. So Jensen's formula is just a formula, if you wish, about Lyapunov complicification. Laponov complicifications of the Laponov exponent of one-dimensional analytical periodicals. Just a reform of wish. And of course, then a natural question is, of course, one-dimensional co-cycles is cheating, it's still commutative, right? It is uh but what if we increase this one, right? So is there a multiplicative conversion? Is there a remotely conversion? And indeed, so this is a theorem that I already many people have already seen it because I presented it in several talks, including it at the ICM 2022. But the same formula holds for quasi-periodic Schrodinger co-cycles. It's exactly the same formula. Looks exactly the same. But what are these guys? What play the role of logarithm overseas value of zeros? And these guys are so-called dual Lyapunov exponents. Title of my talk so already. So I already explained this part of the title and I'm now about to explain this part. I I so far have just said what they are but I did not explain what they are. So I will see. So in general the idea that of complexification of analytic co-cycles has been very fruitful in the business of quasi-periodic operators. Quasi-periodic operator. So it goes back to Hermann, Michel Hermann, who used it to prove for the almost magic operator this bound on the Lyapunov exponent for all energies. So later on it was used by Soret Spencer to prove bound, to show positivity of the Lapunov exponent for an analytic function. Riemann's argument originally. Riemann's argument originally only worked for two polynomials. The extension to analytic function was originally by Soret Spencer, and then there were different proofs given by Burgien-Gaustring and Bourbon. So let me jump straight to Avelo, who so basically his global theory starts with a kind of a systematic study of the cell epsilon as a function of epsilon. Function of epsilon. And so it is a rather simple corollary of a De Mars recircle theorem because you see if you look at epsilon as itself complex, then you see that this function is constant in its imaginary part. Because the imaginary part of epsilon goes right back into x. So it's a function that is constant in its imaginary part. In its imaginary part, so basically it immediately follows that it is convex. That was an observation first made in Navala, and he introduced the acceleration, therefore, which is just already appeared in German's talk this morning. The slope of the Laponov exponent is a function of epsilon at zero from the right, there will talk. From the right, we'll talk about omega plus and omega minus. We'll just put omega looking at the slope from the right. And one of his key discoveries, basic discoveries, it's actually a simple part of his theory, is that this acceleration is a quantized. So it belongs, it's an integer. And today we actually have heard a good reason. Maybe actually have heard a good reason for that because actually it has okay yeah right that it's a it is a biting number so that's also a good reason. But so so basically the Lapunov exponent looks like this. That's what follows also from Argel's Golden theory. Global theory, and this is a familiar picture from Jensen's formula. But again, in his theory, it remained completely unclear what are these turning points and what are the integer slopes. And so we, as I say, uh kind of uncover this with three, identifying them with these dual upon of exponents, which I will now tell you about they are. Of what they are. So the cells are dual Lyapunov exponents, and Ki's are their multiplicities. They are total multiplicities. So to explain dual Lyapunov exponents, I need to quickly introduce a reduality. And so remember that the two-dimensional so when we looked at the almost matthew the Harper's model, you remember two-dimensional model in a magnetic field. Dimensional model in a magnetic field. So the representation I wrote is actually a certain gauge, but there is gauge invariance. And essentially, if you rotate the gauge by 50 degrees, it corresponds, you can work it out, it corresponds to a certain unitary acting like that. So formally, let's introduce this unitary on realm 2 of one control. of one continuous one discrete parameter just sending phi of beta n into its Fourier transform evaluated so u phi of beta n is its Fourier transform evaluated at n beta plus pi alpha n and so the is the important part and in a sense very simplified part In a sense, very simplified part of the almost mature family is that it is self-dual with respect to this unit. That this unitary sends the family H lambda into the family H1. But in general, the family with V here is sent into such a dual family. So this cosine is kind of ubiquitous because it appears as a dual of the discrete Laplacian. But the dual of this V will But the dual of this V will be in general a long-range operator, like that. This is a dual formula. And now, if V is a trick polynomial, we have a finite difference operator, and it leads to a symplectic. And if you look at its transformatrix co-cycle, it will be a symplectic as e to d cos t. And it has Laponov exponents. And those are. And those are the dual level experiments. So we call dual level. So it's a simple acting cycle. It has the negative, the positive, the negative, including exponents. And these are its top D level of exponents. Now you can ask what happens if it is not trick polynomial, but malitic functions. So it turns out that as you That as you approximate analytic function, but it's cut off polynomials. So basically, these objects have a limit counting from here on. So for example, object L1, computed for cutoffs, will have a limit. And these are called the dual-Leblenek experiments. And this actually leads to a funny spectral explanation of the classical Jensen's formula. Jensen's formula, because if you look at simply diagonal operation, so you multiply a function u by v of x plus n alpha, then his dual is just this toplets operator. And so it leads to a constant cocycle for which Lapunov exponent are simply eigenvalues. And you can compute and they are precisely. So basically, this lies the So basically this allies, logarithms are precisely zeros. So AIs are precisely zeros. So this is just a particular case in general. It's a spectral statement. Everything is a spectral state. Okay. So I'll just list one example spectral corollary from the same paper with the team like in particular. So this classical Johnson theorem. So here we have the best expert on that in the last row, Jean Jang. It says, it characterizes the spectrum in one-dimensional case as such a set of energy where the Lapunov exponent is a zero, a transformatic per cycle is non-uniformly hyperbolic. This is a dynamical characterization. This is kind of. This is kind of not very easy to put your hands on. Now, and here, this is a simple algebraic form, right? It's two, just descriptions where it is a set of energies where either the Lyapunov exponent is zero or the first dual Lyapunov exponent is zero. This is actually a characterization of this normal accession. Okay, so. So, yeah, and this has led to a number of very important spectral corollaries. So, one of my favorite ones is the duality proof of the almost reducibility conjecture. So, again, I'll be brief because it's not my main subject, but there was a critical conclusion. There was a crit critical conjecture in all this classic period of business that cycles with acceleration, both acceleration and exponent equal to zero, so both are critical for cycles, are almost reducible. So they can be analytically conjugated as close to a constant as you, which kind of brings them into the lesson which impair sort of Assume regime where sort of everything is known, spectacular. And this was actually the conjecture was first made in our paper with Zavela, but it was sold by Artur in So So the final reviewing actually appeared only recently, but he presented his proof a long time ago back at the Opera Wolfach meeting that we were demanding in 2012. No, there were more. But luckily it appeared. But for a long time actually there was no pre-print available, it was desirable. And so And so Lindru, based on that theorem, found quite ingenious proof for Schrodinger-Dirko cycle. So his proof doesn't go all the way. It doesn't have all the strengths of Avella's proof, which is particularly beautiful, but his proof provides basically what is needed for us spectral theories to Schrödinger cos cycles. Cost cycles and later Hanslag also provided another reality-based tool following his strategy. Okay, so also there are a bunch of almost mature results that are potentially robust. I'm not going to, I'll just latch them here. I have not listed Mira's favorite here because I know she thinks her favorite is. I know she thinks her favorite result is also potentially robust, but this is not something that I think could be related to that business. But so now kind of all these developments give certain hope for all of them. And so here is how I'll present basically the The class of operators for which things can now be done at this stage. And to do that, I want to introduce the slightly different concept called generalized acceleration. And it is the slope of this Lapunov exponent as a function of epsilon at its first turning point. So, for example, So for example, so Rapunov exponent can start like this at zero, and then it will be this slope. Or it can start with a slope, and then it is the slope. So basically, this is only going to the slope at its first turning. So the nice thing. So uh the nice feature uh of this is that unlike the acceleration itself, it is a stable uh quantity. It's locally constant. It's not very difficult to see. So the acceleration itself is certainly not locally constant because, for example, for the almost mature, the picture is like this for lambda less than zero. The picture is like this for The picture is like this for lambda less than one, for lambda equal to one, and like this for lambda bigger than one, on the spectrum. The slopes are always one. So you see that slight change from lambda equal to one uh to lambda less than one changes acceleration from from one to zero. From one to zero. But generalized acceleration, notice that it is always one. Do we have five minutes left? Yeah, one minute. Okay. It is always one. And in general, it is stable. It's locally constant. So this says that operator is of type 1 if it has a generalized acceleration equal to 1 on the spectrum, like the almost accelerated. And as I said, it is locally constant. And as I said, it is locally constant for analytic functions, so it's an open condition. And so here are some of the results obtained so far in this regard. So this one is still, so this aims at this alveolar demonic, but we only have it under the Diaphonic conditions, so it's still not fully satisfactory. But Satisfactory, but this is what does it mean if we are outside of the homospaty, what does it mean non-critical? Non-critical means that cos cycles is never critical in the spectrum. It's never critical. So Avella showed in his global theories that kind of generically Kind of generically and written. No, no. Of course, for critical, it's not true, right? Yeah. So this is the theorem that I am sort of presenting today. And this is another theorem that preprint should appear soon. And once again, when you say supercritical regime, you refer to the quote cycle. I refer to the I refer to the Co cycle. So basically, this theorem is local, and actually, type 1 is also a local statement in some sense. We can say that the certain subset of energies, which would be an open subset of the cocycle, is of type 1. And in fact, our Ten Martini statement is also local, can be made local. So we can say that the subset of the spectrum where generalized acceleration is one. Yeah, a generalized acceleration is one is necessarily a catch of spectrum. Okay, and this is the Sharp spe arithmetic spectral transition as a result that forgot so. Okay, so the key to this development for type 1 operators, what makes them special. So basically, the moral of the story is that the type 1 Is that the type one generalizes almost met you kind of properly and captures its features? And what is the key to this? And the key is that if you take an operator dual of the operator of type 1, remember it could be a long range operator. And so let's assume it's a two-polynomial. So transfer matrix co-cycle is multi-dimensional, maybe very high. Or maybe very high. But it turns out that they are always partially hyperbolic with two-dimensional center. And this is the property that kind of makes them almost natural like the proofs of Tan Martini? Sorry, that's what I'm talking about for that. I mean, is this center actually uniquely determined? Sometimes you have a choice, right? Sometimes you have a choice actually, right? If you have good separation, you can declare something to be the center of something else also, and both sort of the definition partialist. No, two-dimensional center with zero levels. Oh, okay. I should say two-dimensional zero-wood center. I just, it's too many words. Okay, you're right. There's two-dimensional zero-wood center. Zero equivalent. So So and in particular this actually the key to this Dan Martini proof is extending these elements that were used for the Romos method to this kind of system. And they extend actually in a rather general way. So in general if you have a So in general, if you have a minimal dynamical system and such a cos cycle, which is partly a hyperbolic, is two-dimensional zero center. Here he says it explicitly. Then one has L2 reducibility in the center. So this is kind of a statement more or less for experts, but this is something that, so there was an extension of Cotani theory by Cotani-Simon to higher dimensional. Simon to higher-dimensional cross cycles, but they basically could have only dealt with, they could have only produced some kind of results when all the Lepunov exponents are zero. And here, this allows to deal with the situation where only one Lepanov exponent is zero and the other is not zero. And in fact, And in fact, Lingru is finishing his work on massimola theory for arbitrary dimension of the symmetry, which is a lot more complicated to think about. And then another part is this huge argument, which was crucially based on the fact that second difference operators cannot have have have simple eigenfunctions, simple eigenvalues. Functions, it's simple and inverse. And it turns out that this is also shared by this kind of system. So whenever this guy is minimal and we have this situation with two-dimensional, here dimension two is extremely important, zero center, then the point spectrum is necessarily simple. So you can Is necessarily simple, so you can basically run a pure design. Now, this, however, what I just told is sufficient for the Diophantine case, and we still need to do more in order to develop an argument uniform in alpha, because we absolutely don't have, we still have no hope to do anything about this algebraic magic of Joe Elliott and U. And here comes another interesting. Here comes another interesting thing. So basically, Fuges' argument, again, I already explained it, shows that simplicity of localized eigenfunctions for the dual model implies that it's impossible to reduce to the identity, which leads to the contradiction with interval in the spectrum, as we showed with other. So but But this requires the fantas condition in several ways, both to produce localized eigenfunction, both to produce reducibility. And so what we show instead is that simplicity of almost localized eigenfunctions implies that it's impossible to reduce to a rotation the zero rotation number, just like it says here. And so this is an argument that allows to treat all alpha syrupinously. All alpha simultaneously without any arithmetic condition. I should say that there was one predecessor, a recent beautiful work by Avella Yeonju, who proved Dright and Martini for Deophantine non-critical almost mature. Their work is also almost mature-specific and it may be made robust. But what they did is also. Did is also even though they focused on the Development regime because Leo was already known in that case, their key technical argument was also kind of, it could have been done for a lot of basically it's quantitative almost reducibility to identity. So they replaced reducibility to identity in this future argument by almost reducibility. By almost 260. But here we go differently. We build this rather than localized, almost localized, and reducibility, the rotation with zero rotation number. I think I have one more slide, but I probably better stop. Questions? In the quotami theory, I mean, the original version, I don't think you require a minimality. So, why here, like, in this more general version of quotami theory, you actually need a minimality? This is how it currently works, but it's a good question. So, possibly you do not, but uh it's it's actually technically the most involved part of the proof and minimality is required in several places. Well, we say okay, one
