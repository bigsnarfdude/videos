And all of you for showing up after the potential to extend the morning into a much longer and more relaxing day. But I hope you did the whole thing. I guess a lot of the sort of context for this talk was provided by Saman in the first two lectures, where she made quite emphatically, I think, the point. I think to the point that in symplectic or Hamiltonian geometry, it is almost always preferable to be working with an amelior, preferably a compact connective, a the forest of some kind. That doesn't always arise in nature, but you can try to force the issue, as it were. You can try to take some construction that's done in a non-obhelic context. Being in the context. And you can have a quote: is there some way to do the same construction, tweaking the various ingredients in that? But make it one that takes methelium as it. So that, in very, very loose terms, is what I'm going to talk about. And it's joint work with Jonathan Weisman. And I should just say in advance to the syntactic geometers of the audience, a lot of this. Geometers of the audience. A lot of this is going to come across as very, very elementary, but I do want this to be broadly accessible. So I'm going to go fairly lightly. And OBS, should I say this? Okay, I'm going to say it. So while it is highly unlikely that Omicron will appear, I do promise a variant. A variant of Mike Coleman's talk. So, no longer bronze, but a different variant. Okay, that was just okay. So, let me just start with some background. So, I'm going to take G to be a compact connected. And I'm going to do a kind of running over. And I'm going to do a kind of running example throughout this talk. I'm going to emphasize primarily the case where G is the unitary n by n matrix case. So all complex linear automorphisms of C to the N, that preserves the information in your construction. So that's going to amount to all A in general linear that satisfy that this matrix That this matrix times its conjugate transpose is equal to the identity. Not a complex we group, for real. Okay, and this week group is going to have some algebra, so I'll be notified for its own major. And in this running example, what's my LGBT going to be? Oh, it's going to be naturally enough. It's little un. Enough, it's a little un and you can work out that this is going to be exactly well as a vector space. I'll skew the measure of n by n matrices. So that will mean all n by n matrices over the complex numbers, that when I take the conjugate transpose, I get negative of the original numbers. Okay. And the dual of this guy, And the dual of this guy, what's that? Well, of course, it's just going to be, well, I haven't said anything of substance here. But there's a natural pairing between the Hermitian and skew Hermitian matrices. It's non-degenerate. And so I'm going to use that to regard the dual of this V algebra as all Hermitian matrices. So this will all speed like this. Satisfying the condition. Satisfying the condition that when I take the conjugate transpose, I just get an original matrix. Okay. All right. So now, of course, this comes with an action, the adjoint action, and so it's dual is going to come with an induced action, it's a co-adjoint action. So I'm going to denote it like this. That's one kind of regroup morphism from my group gene to, well, automorphisms of the jewels. And in this context, it's extremely easy. It's just implemented by conjugation of matrices. So if I apply an element of my group under this to a Vermetian matrix, well, I just get this constant. I just get this conjugate from each of the matrix. Okay, simple enough. All right, so now what I'd like to do is review a construction that showed up in Sue Coldman's talk. But I'm going to put a slightly different spin on that. And that's the construction of simplector quotients. Okay. So, what kind of inputs do I need for this? Well, I'm going to take my group G, and I'm going to assume that it is acting on a manifold M and I'm going to assume the action is, of course, a smooth action, but we'll start with the in this context. And by means of this action, I can associate to any element of the Lie algebra a vector field on this manifold. But how's that going to work? Let's say I take eta in my Lie algebra. Well, I get a vector field on M associated with this eta. And how's that going to work? How's that going to work? Well, it's going to come from the one-parameter subgroup determined by eta, and then that subgroup acting on my manifold. So making that statement a little bit more precise, what I'm going to do, I want to figure out what this vector field is at a point in my manifold. Well, I'm going to take my one parameter sub. Okay? Okay? And I'm going to act on my point. And then just take the derivative as E, that goes to zero. This will be something in the tangent space of F. Okay, I guess there are a couple of different conventions on why the minus sign. Because I want this as a map for my Lie algebra and vector fields to be a map of Lie algebra. Fields to be a map of the algebras, not an anti-morphism of the algebras. So I'm going to do it like this. Okay, so what is all of this going to look like in the context of the example that I've been doing throughout? Well, what do I want to emphasize? Well, I don't know. Let's take n is equal to 1 and let's take the manifold to be c to the m plus 1. Plus 1. And that's easy enough. Let's just go with scalar multiplication. Okay. So if that's our action, what will be these vector fields, these generating vector fields? Let's see. Well, I need to take a point in my Lie algebra. In this case, this is going to be Lu V1, which, by what I said over there, is going to identify with the purely imaginary numbers, like that. And what will be its vector field, which I'm going to take, data, c to be m plus one. I'm going to evaluate that at some point in c to be m plus one. m plus 1. And, well, I'm going to get the following vector. So it's going to look like negative theta m plus 1 times. So this is a vector in c to the m plus 1, which I'm just thinking of as the tangent space. Okay. So that's how all this machinery works in this specific example. Any questions? All right, so what I'd like to do now is sort of formalize a concept that was detailed a bit in Sue's talk as follows. So definition. So a Hamiltonian G space, it's some data. So it's a triple. So it's a triple, say m omega n mu. And what are the things in that triple? Well, as you might guess, the first two are a symplectic manifold. So the first is that m omega is a symplectic manifold. Okay, that's the first requirement. The second requirement, where does the group come in? Well, it's going to be acting on this manifold. So 2, I have an action of g on m. It's, of course, going to be a smooth action. But because m is symplectic, it's natural to require that it actually respect the symplectic. That it actually respects the symplectic form equivalently with this action V by symplectomorphisms. Okay, and then the third requirement has to do with this gadget U. So, third requirement. So, first of all, this μ is going to go from M, dual definitely algebra. I want this to be smooth. I want it to be equivariant for the actions of the group on my manifold and the coadjoint action on the rule. And then I want it to satisfy an additional property that I'm going to specify later. I'm going to specify later. So this is smooth G equivariant. And then the condition, the extra condition is as follows. So on this symplectic manifold, I have two types of vectors. Two types of vector fields. I have these generating vector fields by virtue of having a g-action on m. But from Zu's talk, I also have Hamiltonian vector fields associated with functions on this manifold. This is going to provide me with some kind of connection between generating vector fields and Hamiltonian vector fields. So the condition is that for every element of my Lie algebra, I can recover the generating vector field as the following Hamiltonian vector field. This, in Zoom's notation, is going to be the Hamiltonian vector field of what? Well, the Hamiltonian vector field of the smooth function I get when I pair the moment map with this eta point-wise. That's a smooth function. Point-wise. That's a smooth function, and as such, it has a Hamiltonian value. So I want this to hold for all beta in my Li algebra. Okay? So just the definition that Sue gave, but phrased a little bit different. Alright, so I know it would be perverse if my running example were not an example of this, and I'm capable of doing something like that. And I'm capable of doing something like that, but just to make sure everyone's awake on the order of writing theorem or theorem and yeah. But that was great, by the way. Okay, but okay, so enough with that. So this is an example. So I can take U1 and as before, we have this action on Cn plus 1. On C to the M plus 1. That's symplectic by virtue of my ability to think of this as r to the 2m plus 2, as Sue explained in the talk. So this is going to be a smooth action by symplectoms. You can just check that. And then what's the moment map going to be? Oh, this is called a moment map. What's the moment map going to be? Well, it's going to be something that goes from Something that goes from C to the N plus 1 to little U1 dual, which, well, before I erase it, you could deduce would just be a copy of the real numbers. And the way this is going to work, there are sign conventions, but whatever, it will take a tuple of complex numbers and send that to To the sum of their moduli squared. Okay. So within one half. So one half modulus said one squared plus modulus z n squared by that. Okay. And these data all together do form an example of a Hamiltonian mean buttons. Okay. Any questions about that? Okay, so I told you I'd have something to say about quotients, and it's in precisely this context, this Hamiltonian G-space context, that you take quotients in symplectic geometry. Geometry. Let me say a little bit more about what I mean about that. So let's just suppose that I fix a Hamiltonian G space. And that as well, I fix a point in the dual of my pedal chart. Okay, what can I do? Okay, what can I do in this situation? Okay, so just a couple of quick observations about this. So one of the consequences of requiring this moment map mu to be G equivary. That mean to be G equivariant, is that the inverse image of any point, well, that's not going to be stable under the entire G action, but it will be stable under the part of the group that actually fixes that point in the dualist of the algebra. So the first thing to observe is then, well, this as a subset of M is set of M is invariant under the action of, well, the stabilizer of this joint under the co-adjoint action. So right that's found. So by this I mean all G in my group that fix this point under the color joint action. Okay. Okay. So, uh second observation. I don't know if this is a manifold or not. I don't really know what it is except, say, some topological space with a nice action of a topological group. But nonetheless, I can draw the following diagram just in the topological category for the moment. So, I can include this level set of the moment map. This level set of the moment f into my manifold n. And then I can just take the naive topological space quotient of this level set by this stabilizer sublime. And I'll adopt a little bit of notation with that. I'm going to write that as m o bar xc g, like that. And what And what can we say about this diagram? Well, of course, it's perfectly reasonable in the category of topological spaces, but if you make a few more assumptions, you can start saying manifold theoretic things about it. So, for example, if I assume that this stabilizer subgroup acts freely on my level set, then it will turn out. Then it will turn out that this XC would be a regular value of this moment map, by virtue of which the level set will be a sub-manifold. Then it will be a sub-manifold together with a free action of a compact equipment. This is posed in a compact thing, so it's compact. And as such, that quotient is also going to be a valid group. So, just summarizing all of that, if I assume That if I assume that my stabilizer acts freely on this level set, then as I said, this level set is going to be a sub-manifold M and the quotient is going to inherit a manifold structure in such a way that Manifold structure in such a way that this map, we call it pi, will be a smooth submersion. This quotient is a manifold. Okay. But of course, all of the sort of construction is geared to the symplectic category, so you might. To the symplectic category, so you might hope or wonder if this is actually a symplectic metaphor. Okay, what could you try to do? You could try to take the symplectic form on M and in this nice case restricted to this submanifold. The problem is, yes, that will stay closed on the submanifold, but it will pick up a kernel. It will cease to be non-degenerate. Non-degenerate. But the good news is that the kernel, tangent space by tangent space, is given by the tangent space to the stabilizer orbit through each point. So if I'm not out by that stabilizer, I'm annihilating the kernel, and I get non-degeneracy back. So this is why this is going to inherit a synthetic expression. That's a major theorem. And it's going to be part of a two-part theorem that I'm going to mention right now. So, theorems. All right, so the first one is due to Marston and Warren Cromeney. 1975. Okay. And it's that under these conditions, this quotient is actually going to be a symplectic manifold. So more precisely, if my stabilizer subgroup acts freely on this level set of the moment now, then there's going to be a unique single. There's going to be a unique symplectic form so that when I pull it back under pi, I just get this restriction of the original symplectic form to m. So if this is true, then is a unique symplectic form. We call it omega bar on this quotient manifold satisfying the condition that I set. Okay, all right. All right, and this now fairly standard fact is giving rise to a plethora of new symplectic manifolds and techniques for constructing. There are many, dare I say, very decided. But there's one sort of minor issue, and it is that requiring the stabilizer to act freely is a fairly stringent requirement. Stringent requirement. Could you get some symplectic type quotient if you dropped this assumption? To answer that, what you would do instead is you would break up this level set into orbit type spread. And on each of those, the stabilizer is going to act. Is going to act in a more uniform way than it would act if you had all different kinds of isotropy groups, the stabilizer acting on this level set. If you break this level set up into orbit-type strata, and you quotient each of those by the stabilizer subgroup instead of trying to do the whole thing, then you're going to get a You're going to get a bunch of subsets of this topological space, and each of them will, in more or less the same way, naturally be a symplectic manifold. And these strata are going to fit together in a particularly nice way. So that's the content of something that was proved about 15 years later. This is by Mashamar. In 1991, which is that if you drop this freemis condition, then what you get instead of a symplectic manifold is what they called, and made it precise, stratified symplectic space. So, regardless of this freedom condition, this thing, for any exceeding the dual of minus Exceeding the dual of Meinwood algebra, this is a strategized integral space. Okay, I'm not going to define that, but based on the prelude that I gave to it, you can imagine what that is. Okay, any questions? Yes? Yes, since there's a number of. Yes. Yes, so here is the notion of a symplectic variety. So that's a normal variety. So that that's a normal variety in such a way that on open data set you have symplicate form and some combustion condition. So is it related to that notion or no? Do you have symplectic form? I mean in your sense do you have symplectic forms on the rest like on smaller subsets that make up the rest of the? Smaller subsets that make up the rest of the space. Okay, well, in this case, because they're Poisson. So, I think it breaks up into finitely many Poisson leaves. Into selected leaves. Poisson varieties. Things like the complex outputs. Okay, if he's talking about Poisson varieties, then you're going to have Poisson, you're going to have symplectic means. But if instead you're talking about something that's just symplectic on an open dense set. Symplectic on an open dense set and elsewhere has no symplectic structure, then well, that would not be an acceptable. Okay. All right. So let's see, well, just get a little bit of a glimpse of how this works in practice. Okay, so let's take that example that no longer appears anywhere, but remember it's new. Anywhere, but remember it's u1 acting on c to the m plus 1 by scalar multiplication. Okay. Well, let's say that I want to take the symplectic quotient of this by u1 at a particular level. Well, if you remember what the moment map was, it was the sum of the moduli of the individual square with a one-half outside. You'll see why I think it would be a good idea. You'll see why I think it would be a good idea to reduce it one half. Because the inverse image of this under the moment that is just going to be a 2m plus one-dimensional sphere. And then, more or less, this group is an abelian group. So the stabilizer of this one-half is going to be everything. And so I'm modding out by all of you one. And for culture, All of u1. And for cultural reasons, I'm going to say u1 is just the same thing as s1 here. This is going to look more familiar. And what is this quotient space? Well, it's going to be, let me see, it's going to be CEM, at least as a manifold, but it's also supposed to come by virtue of being a symplectic quotient, but the symplectic structure. And the symplectic structure you get is the Fubi-Subi structure discussed in the. Structure discussed in the students with is food meeting student structure. Okay. Um this situation is um This situation is especially tractable in large part because it doesn't get much more concrete and simple than this little thing one. Let me just briefly mention a couple of ways in which this might become more subtle. Let's just Let's just note the ball up. Okay. Say that I'm comfortable with Hamiltonian U1 spaces and symplectic quotients by those actions. Well, I might try to up a level of difficulty by replacing that with product CP1 with itself. Okay, so instead of a one torus, I'm now going to be working with a manual. Be working with the mandatories. Another thing I could do, though, is I could say, well, U1 is my first example of the unitary group. So I could work with UN like this for higher N. And what's the fundamental difference between these two situations? Well, of course, this group is actually going to be a Belief. And as you can imagine from what I said at the beginning, and what Syria explained in her talk, is that symplectic quotients by abelian groups are sort of particularly easy to understand. So we're going to say it's abelian. And so it's going to give rise to simpler symplectic quotients. Okay, but this unitary group, Un, is not going to be abelian unless n is equal to 1. So symplectic quotients of Hamiltonian Un spaces are going to be more complicated. So this is non-4 and so what we're going to get is this one. Over what you get is more complicated simplex equations. Okay, but as I said, you might try to take a construction for a non-abelian loop, UN, in this case symplectic quotients. This case, symplectic quotients of Hamiltonian μn spaces. And naively, you might say, well, I might try, if I can, to present those instead as symplectic quotients by u1 to the upper n. That you actually can do with a little bit of effort. So that was done about 20 years ago in work by Gilleman, Jeffrey, and Shamar on symplectic implosion. On symplectic inquotion. I'm going to present a different version of starting, say, with a Hamiltonian U n space and presenting its symplectic quotients as symplectic quotients by an appealing. The different appeal data. Won't just be the maximum torus of the length. Okay, but for that to work Okay, but for that to work out, we need to do a little bit of normal leading theory. Okay, and the exposition is going to seem a little bit perverse at first, but bear with me. So this is going to be a little bit obnoxious, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to say look at the elements. Look at the elements of my Lie algebra and look at their group stabilizers under the color joy action. So there are various possible dimensions those stabilizers can be. So I'm going to have some set of dimensions, and there's going to be a smallest one. I'm going to call that L. I'm going to say L is the minimum of all of the stabilizer dimensions. So minimum, the minimum. Minimum, the dimension of the stabilizer of C as I run through all the C in the beginning of my algebra. Okay, and then I'm going to look at all points that achieve this stabilizer dimension. And I'm going to call that G dual ray. So this is going to be all its key function. C for which the dimension of the group stabilizer is exactly normal. Before I say too much more about that, let's see how this works in the context of some examples. So example. If my group is the unitary group, UN, then that minimal stabilizer dimension is going to be exactly Dimension is going to be exactly n that turns out. So this L is going to be equal to N with my group. It's un, like that. But in that case, what will be the regular elements in the dual? Well, they're going to be some kind of Hermitian matrices. Those are all diagonalizable, real eigenvalues. Real eigenvalues. And the ones that will be regular are exactly the ones for which all those eigenvalues are distinct. N dual, right, will be exactly our unitary end-by-n matrix case so that the matrix has n distinct eigenvalues. So, I'm going to go to the next store. Okay. All right. Any questions about that? Okay. What's another word for L? What do we normally call that? Exactly. This is. Exactly. This is, in other words, the rank of my Lialta. This is why I said it was purpose. No one defines the rank this way. But I thought it would be instructive. Instructive for my part. You wouldn't say this in most contests, but I don't know. This L is the rank of my Lie algebra. Okay, fair enough. Second. Second, in case you were wondering, the regular elements are generic. So they're going to form an open, dense, and yes, also obviously invariant subset. So observation number two is that this inside of the tool is going to be open dense and And G invariant. Okay. And then my third observation. And so my third observation, though, is going to be another characterization of regular elements. So the third point that I'd like to make, let's say that I start with some point in the dual of the Leology problem. How can I tell if it's regular or not? It's going to be regular exactly when its centralizer is available. That's it. So then this guy is going to be regular if If and only if its centralizer is an abelian of the algebra. Like that. Okay. All right. So why is this useful? Well, these observations actually allow me to say something very, very concrete about the geometry of a changeable. Geometry of changeable. But speaking of the geometry, what do I have in mind? Well, it's a kind of Poisson geometry. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to define a bracket on smooth functions, on the rule of the sweet algebra. This okay, and how's this going to work? And how is this going to work? Well, there's essentially only one thing you can do, and it works. So let's say that I start with two functions, f1 and f2, on the rule of my algebra. Well, this new function, I'm going to evaluate it at a point C in the middle. Okay, so what happens? Well, what I can do is I can differentiate both f1 and f2. Both F1 and F2 at this point in the V algebra. That'll be a linear functional on G dual, hence an element of the V algebra. So I can take DCF1 and DCF2, be two elements of my Lie algebra. I can take their bracket. That will be another element of the Lie algebra. Element of the Lie algebra. And I better get a number in the end. So I just take the dual vector and I evaluate it on that. That's it. Okay? Very, very accurate. So this is going to be for all f1 and f2 that are smooth functions. And, let's see, smooth my algebra. Okay. So this bracket operation turns the smooth function. This bracket operation turns the smooth functions on g dual into a Poisson algebra. And that's just a fancy way of saying, okay, well, at the end of the day, this rule of the Lie algebra is a plus on that. Okay, but what can I say? What can I say very, very concretely about this Poisson structure? Well, it's partly symplectic and partly abelian in the transverse direction. Let me just explain very briefly what that means. Let's say that I have a point. Let's say that I have a point in the dual that is regular. Okay, well, around that point, I can describe my Poisson structure as a product of two simpler Poisson structures. So I can say that this will be Poisson isomorphic, near my point, to a product of two things. To a product of two things. One of them was discussed in Zoom's talk. It's the coejoint orbit for my point. I'll denote it just by that, given my point. And the second thing, well, it's this guy. The dual of my stabilizer subalgebra. Okay, but to be a little bit more precise about what these things are, the role they play. Are, the role they play in determining the Poisson structure on which we roll. Well, as Sue explained in her talk, this co-adjoint orbit is symplectic. So that we know. What else do we know about it? Well, the point was assumed to be regular, which meant that its stabilizer was rank-dimensional. That means the orbit is going to be rank-co-dimensional. Going to be rank codimensional. In other words, the dimension of this orbit is equal to the dimension of my group minus the rank. Okay, simple enough. Now, what about this guy? Well, in the same way that the dual of my algebra is Poisson, this stabilizer sub-algebra, its dual is also going to be Poisson. Its dual is also going to be Poisson. But this Poisson structure is going to be simpler. Why? Well, because this is going to be an abelian Lie algebra. And then if you look at how I defined the Poisson structure, if the Lie algebra is abelian, this is just going to be the zero Poisson structure. So this is going to be trivial. Trivial as a Poisson manifold. And its dimension is going to be exactly equal to the rapid, because I assumed that my point was regular. Okay, so near this point, my Poisson structure is going to look like a regular polar joint orbit times a trivial rank-dimensional affine orbit. Rank-dimensional affine plus or random model. What does that mean? Well, I'm not going to be precise about this, but if I want to define a completely integrable system, not just on a symplectic manifold, but on an arbitrary Poisson manifold, what I should do is I should say, well, it's an integrable system on this symplectic manifold together with enough extra. With enough extra functions to give an integrable system when extended over to here. But of course, the Poisson bracket on that is trivial. So if you give as many functions on that as the dimension of the space, and they're independent enough, you're going to get an intuitive business. So the idea that I'm not being precise about deliberately, but I'm trying to just informally motivate. It's just the following. An integral or a completely integral Meilly algebra should have as many functions as I need on the symplectic part together with an x-quarter rank of n. With an extra bracket, then well, let's see. So, as Sue explained, I need one half the dimension of my symplectic part. So, this is one half mg minus L, and then plus another L. And so this is going to give me one half mg plus L. Exactly. Plus L, exactly that number of functions. Okay. I can never remember this number in a useful way, so except to say that if you worked with the complex group, it's just the dimension of the Borel. So that's how I always remember this. Okay, so Okay, so let me just say that an example of a completely integrable system on the dual of this V algebra would be obtained by taking the Gelfand-Sepplin system that Sue explained you would get on a, let's say, a regular collagen orbit, but then you need an extra. But then you need an extra L functions for that. Where are those going to come from? Well, you can just take those to be any basis of g-invariant functions. So in the case of the unitary group, you could just take these to be the eigenvalues of the matrix in question. And of course, you're going to have problems where those eigenvalues collide. They're not going to define smooth functions on that. Can define smooth functions on that kind of focus. But they're going to be continuous and they're going to be smooth generically. Okay, so I won't say any more about that, except to say that it gives context for what I'm going to define next, which is the, which is to be, anyway, the main part of this talk. So, the main part Um this works. This is unionization. Okay, and so I need a definition. That's going to turn out not to be a definition. It's a definition. Okay. So I'm going to define something called a delta and set in theta thing. But a delta in your But I'll find you guys. That means then, on the dual of Miley algebra is two pieces of information. The first is going to be a completely integrable system in the sense you can imagine, but that I haven't made precise. So it consists of. Since we're in eigenvalue mode, let me just write it as random. So we'll go from g dual. And how many functions did I say I needed? Flat number, one half. That number, 1/2 dimension plus L. So it's going to go through R, the 1 half dimension plus L. Okay. But together with a locus for this system in a certain sense. So N, N open, N subset. Oh, I need more than regular. I need more than regularity, so I'm going to call that strong regularity. And the corresponding Wolfgang dense subset, I'm going to denote by dual S-ray contained in the regular part. And then it's got to satisfy a bunch of lead theoretic conditions that I'd really rather not enter. Okay, that's satisfied. Is it possible to easily explain like what they are in a specific example? Yes, so an example, well, I can give you an example of an Gelfand settler data. It would be the Gelfin settling system on the dual of you. system on the dual of u n. So all n plus n times n plus 1 over 2, many functions. What would be the strongly regular locus for that? It would be the locus where all of the standard eigenvalue inequalities are satisfied together with the interlace class. Okay, so all of those. All right, that satisfies certain theoretic conditions. There are like six or seven, and I'd rather not let them go. Okay. Rather not let them go on. Okay. International strict. Yes, I mean, I want all of those inequalities to be strict. And the points that satisfy those are going to be the strongly regular points in the sense. Okay. Where do some examples of these come from in nature? Let's win you ask that question. You can. You can produce examples from the Gelfand settling systems for the unitary loop UN, also for the special orthogonal group. So those are due to Gilliman and Sternberg. And there are generalizations of those two arbitrary L-type, very recent generalizations, and those are due to Jeremy Leyton and Benjamin Hoffman. So all of those give you, give Those give you give rise to examples of Gelpin settling data, but these things are a little bit more general. But that just gives you a flavor for what they are. Okay, so I don't want to go into that in huge detail, but let me just say very, very briefly what one we can do with these. So I'm going to assume right now that I have. Right now, that I have. I will tell me in J space. And I'm going to assume that I also have Gelphin settling or Gelphin settling dates. I'm going to say one thing. Cool. Okay. What can I do in a situation like this? I can define some loci inside of my Hamiltonian G space. So from these two pieces of information, I can define the strongly regular locus of M just as the pre-image of the strongly regular points on the model map. This is going to be the inverse. This is going to be the inverse image of the strong irregular points. Some open subset of M. It could be empty, but in many examples it will not be. And well then I can, what I'm also going to do is I'm going to take lambda, I'm going to compose it with my moment map mu, and then I'm going to restrict it to the strongly regular locus on m. And let me just call that map lambda. Okay, so the lead theoretic conditions that you built into this definition will, among other things, guarantee that this lambda of m, its components, will generate a Will generate a Hamiltonian torus action on the strongly regular part of them. So that is a consequence of how one defines GC data. I'm not going to get into that. But I'm just going to say, note this, that lambda m is a moment underlying. Underlying a Hamiltonian torus space structure on these strongly regular points. So for a Hamiltonian, it will be, well, how big does the torus have to be? Well, if it's going to be a moment map for a torus action, that torus had better have dimension one-half dim gene plus. 1 half dim g plus L. So for a Hamiltonian 1 half dim G plus L structure on MS right. Okay, let me never write this again. That's just one thing. Okay, and so in particular. And so, in particular, now you can take Hamiltonian or you can take symplectic reductions with respect to this g-action, but also with respect to this now big g-action. So you can see this torus actually has dimensions substantially bigger than the rank. So it's a much bigger torus than the maximal torus. Okay, so. Okay, so what do I mean by all this? Well, let's suppose that I have a strongly regular point. Well, there are two things that I can do with this. One thing is, of course, I can take M and I can form its And I can form its symplectic quotient at that level. But then, well, I just said that this MS-ray is going to be a Hamiltonian space for this fairly large torus. So I can reduce that by this large torus. And I can do so at the image of this point under this new moment. By what I said before, both of these are going to be stratified syntactical spaces. Okay. And the point is that they're canonically isomorphic. So this is the theorem that if That if I have a strongly regular point, then these two guys are canonically isomorphic as stratified synthetic spaces. So on it, and stratify some graphic spaces. All right, and that's it. Thank you. Are there questions?
