Okay, so I guess that's yeah, okay, so then let me thank first of all the organizers for inviting me to this beautiful place and this opportunity to give a talk at this interesting meeting and and well so. And well, so there's no silting in the title, but tau reduced irreducible components are a generalization of support tau tilting modules. So we are not so far away from the topic of the conference. And yeah, and as you can see, this is joint work with my colleague Daniel Labardini from UNAM and John Wilson, who was a postdoc at UNAM just before the COVID crisis hit us. Okay, so now let's begin. So, what are our surface we are interested in? So, it's a marked surface and basically in the sense of the work of Fomin Shapiro Thurston. So, with a, but the only kind of restriction is that they have a oops, what's this one? this one no that it is a non-empty boundary and so sigma is a riemann surface and with b boundary components so this oops not sense this is not okay i guess and the operators doesn't work like expected work like expected so anyway so and and we have m mark points in the boundary and we have the set p denotes the set of punctures of the surface but it doesn't point somehow it so something is I still So this is the set of punctures and we are mainly interested in the situation if there are really punctures on the surface, not the unpunctured case. And then we have this rank of this surface. Of this surface with smach points, so this is six times the genus minus one, and well, so you don't have to worry exactly about the formula. But the point of this formula is that if we draw a tag triangulation of this surface, so this means basically that we are connecting the mark points in the boundary or the punctures with tagged arcs, then this is exactly the number of. The number of arcs in the triangulation. And so, just here's an example of what we have in mind. So, if so, this is our surface, so it's just a torus with, in this case, one boundary component and one mark point on this component and one puncture. And then, if you draw, because well, it's a bit tricky to draw triangulations on a surface. A surface. So I draw here two examples, and you see that they identify these two sites and the top and the bottom side. And then if you count the arcs, then you will see that there are seven. And here in this case, also seven is six times one minus one plus three times one plus one. So one boundary component plus one bunch and one and here one point in the Point in the boundary, and these are just two different triangulations. So, this one would be one which would be called of signature zero, because there at the puncture there's one arc with attack, another one without attack, and this other one is a kind of this would be a triangulation of positive. Be a triangulation of positive signature because we have now several arcs connected to the marked point and none of them has a tag. And for example, otherwise, if you had many points connecting to a puncture, then either all of them have to be of positive signature or all of negative or all have to be tat. Okay, so this is all set up. So here we have again say Have again the picture, and then for this, for such a triangulation, we can define a Jacobian algebra with Labardini potential. And I should just, in a moment, I will come back to this picture here, which looks here a bit messy. But just so what is about, so this is a potential for this quiver, which basically means that around each puncture we have a Around each puncture, we have a cycle which is going anticlockwise, and in each triangle, we have a cycle going clockwise. And then we take all cyclic derivatives of this potential. And so, this is a kind of quite simply-minded-looking potential. But it turns out that if So I guess it should go back. Yeah, that if, for example, since we have a non-empty boundary, then this potential is essentially a unique non-degenerate potential up to weak. Potential up to weak right equivalents. And the only case where we could have another non-degenerate potential is, in fact, the dreaded torus. So this is somehow like this torus, but forgetting the puncture. But in general, this potential is really more or less the only thing which you can do if you want a non-degenerate potential. And moreover, this Jacobian algebra is. This Jacobian algebra is always finite-dimensional and tame. And what's the word non-degenerate means? So that you can mutate it and then that you can mutate the equivalence potential as say in all possible directions as often as you want. And that you're still somehow this mutation procedure of equivalence potential, it's a bit tricky, but then. But then, somehow, for example, here it means that you flip your edge, and then you get a new quiver with potential. And then this then the new rule would be somehow obtained from the old one by the rule of Dirksen-Weiman-Seliwinsky of mutation of a quiver with potential. And then you just can keep doing mutating and you never get stuck because of a two-cycle in your quiver. Equiver, but it's here not so important for this purpose. But here's the interesting thing: that these algebras are always tame, but in general, their classification of the indecomposable modules is not known if you have functions. At least, not explicitly. Okay, so now let's. So now let's look again at these two oops. Okay, thanks. So let's look again at these two quivers. So in the first case, you can see I now just kind of extract the quiver with relations from this messy looking pictures. And then you see that it looks almost like a gentle. That it looks almost like a gentle algebra, except that here we have a special loop which is idempotent, and this is somehow which ruins so this algebra will not be gentle but skewed gentle. And this is just for this triangulations of signature zero. This will happen. And if you have a kind of random triangulation like this one, then well, then you get some. Well, then you get something like this, and you have still some zero relations, but we have also kind of complicated commutativity relations, like for example, here we have that going that way is the same as going here around this internal cycle. And well, and then good luck if you want to write down certain decomposable representations of this viver with relations, even if it is tame. What is the argument to show it? What is the argument to show it to stay in? Well, one way is to show that they degenerate into gentle algebras. So this is more or less the argument to show that they are tame. Or in this case, you could argue, and well, so maybe it's a good question. In this case, for example, we can do even better. We know that for these surfaces with non-empty boundary, we always This is a non-empty boundary, we always can find such a signature zero triangulation, and that's a Jacobian algebra skew-gentle. And skew-gentle algebras are known to be tame. And then we also know that tameness is preserved under mutations of pivots with potential. So this would be another way to argue. Or you could say, well, that's the cluster category is in some sense tame, and then if you do apply some cluster tilting. To apply some cluster tilting, then you always get a pain algebra. So there are several ways to see this. Okay, so. Okay, and now we are all prepared to our somehow the main result I want to talk about. So let sigma be such a surface with a much Surface with a marked with non-empty boundary, a triangulation. And then the claim is that there exists an isomorphism of what we will call tame partial char is monoids. So I will explain a moment what this is. And on the one side, we have here this set of laminations of the surface, and these are. Surface, and these are laminations in the sense of Musica Schiffler-Williams some while ago. And on the other side, we have the set of decorated generatically tau-reduced irreducible components for the Jacobian algebra. And this isomorphism on the one hand, we have here the map which sends each lamination to its shear coordinates with respect to the triangulation. With respect to the triangulation, and on the other hand, to each of these components, we can assign its g vector or the pre the projective g vector. And yes, and okay, so these are all the ingredients in very short words. And now somehow the rest of the talk is to give you, to explain a little bit more all the words which appear. more all the words which appearing here and also give you a rough idea how to prove this claim. So excuse me, what was the theory filled point at the bottom of the claim? Okay, so let's go back. If it's if it's inconvenient, we can discuss it. Well let's just somehow this. Some of this this one here? Please don't hesitate to remote point. Yes, this point. So this is just that this set is a decorated channel. that this set is a decorated generic power reduced irreducible components. So yes. Yes. So this is just for people who know and then people who know maybe now can stop listening. Yes, yes. No, this is what I will call this car is monoid, because otherwise it would be kind of pointless to talk about an isomorphism. Pointless to talk about an isomorphism between sets. So, there's really some on both sides an interesting structure which and some, yeah, I will explain. Okay, so okay, so again, as I said, for so this result was maybe not in this language known already. Language known already a while ago for services where there are no punctures. In this case, the Jacobian algebras are always gentle, and then somehow you can work out everything very explicitly because for gentle algebras, somehow everything you want to calculate, you can do more or less by hand and with easy combinatorics. And even for the signature zero triangulations, as I said, these algebras are then skewed, gentle, but they are still there. There have been complications because, first of all, if you look at the paper of Bill Groly-Bovi, it's now maybe 30 years or so ago, or maybe even a bit more, about Kleinish algebras and skew-chantle algebras. And you can tell that the description of the modules is The description of the modules is still in terms of strings and bands, but it is quite complicated. And I started now, maybe also 24 years ago, to describe the homomorphisms between these representations, but the description was incomplete until recently. And so somehow this stopped people from working with these algebras. Okay, so yeah, so now let's continue with this what are partial car S monets. So this is a kind of little new gadget. So it is something very simple minded, but I think it is useful in this context. So this is. So this is a set with symmetric functions from pairs of elements of x to the natural numbers and a partial sum. So this sum is only defined between elements where this function e vanishes. And then we want some distributivity and associativity of the sum whenever it is defined. Whenever it is defined. And moreover, we have a zero element in this. So, where the sum is, where the E inverand is always zero, and so we can sum it, but it doesn't do anything. And then just a little remark that it follows already from this definition that if we change the, if such a sum is defined, then we can change the order and we get the same element. And he gets the same element. So that's it also makes sense because of this zero object to define which objects in this are indecomposable. These are just those where if we can write it to some, then one of the two summons had to be better zero. So it's a really very easy concept. And now And now, so this is a partial monoid, as you can figure out. And then we say this is a car s for Kruhler-Remark Schmidt. If each object in A can be written in a basically in a unique way as a direct sum of indicable ones. So that's also pretty straightforward. So this is really just the Kruller-Remark-Schwitter rule, but here this is really equality and not isomorphic. Quality and not isomorphic because it's just sets. And an important special case is we call such a thing tame if the E-invariant for each object with itself is zero. So this is somehow might remind you of E-tame algebras, for example, where exactly this is happening. And so this E is also not an accident. Accident. Okay. And now here's the first kind of silly example. If we have just a set with such a bilinear function, then where we agree that EAA is zero for all elements in this set, then we can define a car s monoid just on the basis of this. These are just functions. Basis of this. These are just functions from the set to the natural numbers. And whenever if two elements are in the support, so if the value is non-zero, then we want that the E invariant between these two elements is zero. And moreover, we want only support, finite support functions. And then we can extend the E function to this Z car S, C of E. Z car S, C of E, just by the obvious rule, that just we sum over all objects and add up the values of the E-invariant with the corresponding multiplicities. And then we can define just that we can, if we have the E-invariant of two such functions is zero, then we just add them up component-wise. So it's also very simple. So it's also very simple. And so then this is a typical example of a tame partial car-s monoid. And then the indic composite, which you get, if you look at the indic composite, then this is just the original set C. So then it's kind of really simple-minded construction. But well, and one reason is that, for example, say, well, I will show you now of. Now we already, so this was first this car S, and now the next ingredient which we want to understand is what is the set of laminations. So, and here we can say that the set of laminations. Can say that the set of laminations is just such an car s construction of a certain class of curves on the surface. And the E function is a kind of doctored up intersection number. And so now what is so and this is L and C. So this is L stands for loop and C for curves and tau stands here for basically Stands here for basically something like tau rigid. And so, well, I forgot here the tau. So, these are, well, first say L sigma are also loops on the surface, which are not contractible and up to free homotopy. We don't want kinks, so somehow we don't want to enclose a single puncture with such a kind of funny loop. And also, we don't want curves which just enclose, which are just a loop around a single puncture. Then we can define also the inverse of a curve is just going the other way around. Okay, so this is and then curves are just curves which connect go which connect. go which connect points in the in the set and which basically go in the interior of the surface and also we don't want for example curves which are contractible so or which are homotopical to the to a boundary segment and again we don't want this annoying kinks and then moreover there is a decoration There is a decoration, a possible decoration at each endpoint, which is a puncture. Then, again, we can define here this the inverse of a curve is just going into the opposite direction. And now this operation rho of half rotation is just moving the point, for example, if I tear curve, which went between two. Went between two points, then somehow we just rotate it in positive direction, but somehow between just a little bit before it hits the next point on the boundary component. And then we call this, then we just throw these two sets, the loops and the curves together. And now, yeah, I can. And then again, we have to doctor up an intersection number. So, this is basically first for the curves without the decoration. So, we just rotate them. This is half rotation if they are not loops. And then we take just the minimum number of intersections, say, up to homotopy. Up to homotopy. And finally, the kind of this decorated intersection number is this number plus something which comes into game where somehow these decorations come into the game. For example, if you have just two different curves which end at a puncture, and then if one has a tech and the other one not, then this contributes a plus one to our intersection number. intersection number. And also if we have two parallel curves which connect to our puncture, then we get here plus one if they are different on both ends of the puncture. And then finally, this now these are L C tag, these are just loops and curves with tags, and now tau means Tax and now tau means that we look now only at curves where the which have no self-intersection in this sense. And then the laminations, as I said, this is then, so this is now just a set as for this our car s monoid. They are just a set where the e function is now our intersection number, and then we can take just multiplicities of these curves. Of these curves. And this is really somehow a kind of way of thinking about laminations: that you just take curves up to homotopy, and then you have positive, and then in a lamination, you have non-intersecting curves with certain multiplicities. So, this is really the idea of this set of laminations. And a triangulation is then just And triangulation is then just the maximal combination of curves in the set which are not loops and where there is no intersection between them. Okay, so this is the first. Okay. And then maybe now the next thing we want to So, the next thing we want to understand are the shear coordinates. So, this is all kind of non-representation series, it's just basic topology. And so, since this set of eliminations is just this kind of car-s-monate of the kind of simple curves with intersection number, it's enough to define this shear. Define this shear coordinates for each single curve. And there, somehow what we are doing is if it is such a curve. So, for example, if our original curve, for example, that is connecting a point to a puncture without pack, then somehow again we move it halfway to the between the Halfway to the between the next puncture, and we make here anti-clockwise spiral. And for example, if you had another curve which like here where it here, for example, we have a tag and then at the tech, it's just they replace it by a clockwise spiral. And here, since no tech, it's spiraling anti-clockwise. And then once, and for loops, we just don't do anything. And for loops, we just don't do anything. And then we do just this usual thing that for each arc of our triangulation is sitting in a quadrilateral because it's a triangulation. And then if it goes through this quadrilateral in a set shape, like here, then we have a minus, no, no, it's a S shape, sorry. No, it's an S shape, sorry. Then we it gets a negative sign, and somehow it's ideas that then we have here outgoing arrows, and you could think of like that at a module, this would be something in the top of a module. And if we have a set shape, then we get a contribution plus one. So that's a bit fast, but this is really. But this is really a convenient way to parametrize curves. And it was already observed by Thurston that, say in a slightly different setting, that, for example, if you look at the shear coordinates of a marked surface, then this gives really a bijection between the set of laminations. The set of laminations and set to the n. So, really, somehow all shear coordinates are possible shear coordinates are hit by some triangulation and different laminations give also different values of the shear coordinates. So it's really like, tastes like g vectors. And this is really this idea. Okay, so now we understood. Okay, so and now we understood that these laminations have a structure of a very simple-minded char s monoid. And we have here this function to set to the n. And now let's come to the representation theory. So here's this set of decorated irreducible components. And so we don't need for the moment that this is a Jacobian algebra. That this is a Jacobian algebra, so this is just a basic finite-dimensional C algebra, and that the C algebra is just to make sure that our field is algebraically closed. And then we look for each possible dimension vector at the space of representations with this dimension vector. And we have the group G D acting on it by conjugation, so that the orbits are isoclasses of. Are isoclasses of representations. And then for each dimension vector, we can look at the set of irreducible components of this affine variety. And so this is not yet what we really want. And then in the next step, so if we have a point in such an irreducible component, we define Cz. So in C is for codimension. And C is for codimension, so it's the co-dimension of the orbit of this point in the irreducible component. So it's just very basic algebraic geometry. And on the other hand, we define the E invariance. Oh, well, it's a bit unfortunately that this is so this is the dimension of. So this is the dimension of well, it's really unfortunate because this is a crucial definition. Yeah, maybe I should Okay, so this is the E-invariance. So it's just the dimension of the module to its tau translate. And so we all know that this tends to be a little bit bigger than the dimension of self-extensions of the module. And which would be also the relative tangent space of the variety. And now we. And now we say that the component is in this set of tau irreducible generically tau reduced irreducible components if generically the co-dimension of each orbit is equal to this E invariant or this dimension x to tau x. And so this is just a little bit more than saying that it is generically reduced. This is why we call it This is why we call it that it is generically tau-reduced. So maybe back. Okay, so this is a definition. And now we still need to get our counting right another dimension vector as a decoration. And now it's a decorated tau reduced irreducible components for a pair of dimension vectors. So these are a vector for A vector for an irreducible power irreducible component plus a vector which is only non-zero outside of the support of the first one. And then back tau A, so the set of all decorated irreducible tau reduced components is just that you throw all these components for all possible dimension vectors together. And why do you want to look at this set? So there's a cool theorem by Pierguy Blamondon, who states that this set for all finite-dimensional algebras of an algebraically closed field is again in bijection with the Grotendik group via the generic G-vector. So this is really a sensible thing to look at at the set. So it's really not that I'm just doing this because I like complicated. Just doing this because I like complicated definitions. And again, this is kind of closely related to silting theory in many aspects. And now we can define here the symmetrized E-invariant. So we take here the scalar product somehow of the dimension vector with the opposite one. And moreover, we take the minimum of And moreover, we take the minimum of the tau now not of the same module, but one from here plus the tau translate from the other one plus the other way around that we take one from here and take the home dimension with tau from here. So we make really this E invariant now or symmetrized it in the kind of most sim naive way and and now again. And now, again, maybe it's not time enough to mention all the names which are involved in this theorem, but it's a nice way to state it. Now, this set of decorated generically tau-reduced irreducible components is also a partial car-s monoid. So, and here, so now we have to define this direct sum between two components where the Between two components where this kind of big E invariant is zero. And then what we do, we just take direct sum of modules, take their orbit in the, say now in the corresponding dimension vector and take the closure. And then the nice thing is that if we started with two power reduced irreducible components, which were E orthogonal, Components which were E orthogonal, then this direct sum is again a component of this type. So this really behaves nicely. And now what are the indecomposable guys in this set? So these are just those where we have an open set of indecomposable representations in this component. So and now if A is tame and then perhaps. If A is tame, and in particular it is then A tame, then this car S mono A is just the same as if we take this Car S construction of the indecomposible components with the E invariant. So it's a really nice kind of construction. Okay. And so as I said, I there are kind of it There are kind of somehow I think implicitly this was known for quite a while that we have this structure here, but but and the contributions of quite a few people but and I just don't want to tell now all the story because of time okay so let's see again okay so now we we have this this this and now the last pieces And now the last piece is this project, this map here, what is a g vector. So this is now quite easy. So this is the dimension of for each module, we take the homomorphism for each component, we take just basically the I component of the tau translate, the I component of the socket of the tau translate minus the top dimension. And then, if we calculate this vector, then basically this gives you information about the minimal projective presentation of the module. So, it's really, if you have a minimal projective presentation of a module, then just taking this difference in each component gives you this g vector in that way. And now you can guess what if you have such a component. What if you have such a component, then the g vector of such a component is just the generic value of this g vector for the module part and plus the decoration. So again, it's not so complicated. And so in particular, our theorem is saying that for each, say, lamina, so just a simple curve without no self-interception. Simple curve without no self-intersections, we can assign an indecomposable component here. And if we calculate its shear coordinate, then we get the same thing as if we calculate the generic g vector of the component. So this is what we are claiming. And moreover, we are saying that the intersection number, say, between two such guys is just the same as calculating. Just the same as calculating this E invariant, the generic E invariant between the corresponding irreducible components. So, this is already, so this is really the idea of the theorem. And now about the proof. So, first if this, so we recall now that we are in the situation of a surface with non-empty boundary, then there exists a packed triangulation of the surface. Triangulation of the surface with signature zero. And this basically means that we kind of, at each puncture, we connect it to some point in the boundary with just a pair of arcs where one arc has a tag and the other one doesn't have a tag. And it's not so difficult to see that such things exist and also that the corresponding Jacobian algebra then is skewed gentle. And so then this looks already like This looks already like good news because at least skew gentle algebras are tame and there's some way of describing indecomposable modules in terms of strings and bands. And then, roughly speaking, the idea is that we want to relate these strings and bands for our algebra in the sense of Crowdie-Bowie and somehow to curves without kinks on the surface. And this is roughly the same idea as people. The same idea as people have been exploiting now for several years for surfaces without punctures. It's just it's all a bit more messy. And there's really, well, there are several kinds of pain involved. So the homomorphisms between the indecomposable representations, and also, say, on the topological side, somehow that we want homotopy classes of curves without kinks, it's a kind of Without things is a kind of a priori a nasty concept, and but somehow one can really work it out, everything. And so, just here to give you a very quick idea of what we are doing. So, we have say technically we enhance our triangulation by the boundary segments, and then we look at the Jacobian algebra of this kind of. Algebra of this kind of slightly larger triangulation, where we also take into account the boundary components. Then, this is again a skew gentle algebra, and this new algebra can be considered like a fringing, which is already well known for gentle algebras. And this is kind of nice properties. For example, then the Auslander Reiten translate, say, for this new algebra, this is. For this new algebra, this is more or less roughly the same as this half rotation. And, like in the gentle case, if we have, say, two curves coming or two modules which coming from certain words, then this is the same as if we look at the kisses. So, and kisses means now for if we do this kind of translation, out on the right and I was under right and translated for this fringed algebra. And then cases are somehow just morally the nicest homomorphism between strings or bands, where you just have here something where on both sides arrows are going out, then you take the quotient of this and then you can embed it in the other one in the same way, but now with ingoing arrows. So this is kind of the nicest possible s situation. Possible situation. But of course, it's all a little bit more unpleasant for skew gentle algebras than for gentle algebras. And then if you look at intersections, then somehow this is really how intersections work, that then you have some curves, for example, which go somehow more or less parallel until they really move away with respect to the triangulation. And then you can see, for example, here on the For example, here on the purple one, where it kind of becomes different, we have outgoing arrows here and here, and the other one we have these ingoing arrows. So it's kind of morally that intersections are kisses, which is nice. The gentle case is fringing also what people call blossom. Yes. Yeah, so it is, yeah, several people kind of observed. That this is a really convenient way to do this. And while you're here, this kiss is also by, I don't know, maybe it's four or five authors with Sprustle, Musavant, and Iltrim. And, well, sorry, I don't, many names are invisible. And there's also another paper by Plamondeau, Palu and Pilon. And Pilon, yeah, so but anyway, you can do a very similar thing for skew gentle algebras, and this then works very conveniently. Okay, so and then somehow on the other hand, you can now develop in general a theory of this decorated irreducible. Irreducible tau-reduced components for and as a car S-monit for all skew gentle algebras once you have sorted out the homomorphisms in all cases and and then if you put all these things together then you find that the theorem is okay for all triangulations with signature zero over this algebra is Q gentle and then the And then the second step of the proof is now we know that for these tag triangulations of a surface, for example, with non-empty boundary, the exchange graph, if you just start flipping edges, is connected. So somehow you can get from one triangulation to each other with a finite number of flips. And then each flip of the edge in the triangulation corresponds to a mutation. Is corresponds to a mutation of the QP. So if we do here a flip and then compare the two QP, so here we have a QP and here on the other one, on the first one, we apply the procedure of Dirksen, Weimmand, Selwinski of the potential. Then these two are right equivalent. And in particular, they are isomorphic. And now for and moreover, we And moreover, we need one more thing that if now if we come back to the lamination, we recall that or it is kind of known that if we what happens with it's interesting to understand what happens with the shear coordinates if we just flip one edge in our triangulation. And so here is the formula which, well, it's kind of complicated and there are. It's kind of complicated and there are some signs involved and so you don't have to remember it exactly. But it is interesting that this formula was also observed by Formin and, well, not Formin. This was observed by for example by Thurston, but for example, if you know cluster algebras well, then you would recognize this formula also as a transformation rule for G vectors of cluster. Rule for g vectors of cluster monomers if you change the reference cluster. So this is really the same formula. And now again, coming back to quivers with potential, which might not be related to regulations, then we have basically the same formula. So this is the formula how it was written by Formin. Written by Formin and Selivensky in their paper for as a conjecture for the change of the g-vector of cluster monomies under mutation. Okay, and now we are almost done. And now we have a nice theorem with all this heavy notation that if we have such a situation of a quiver with potential. Of a quiver with potential, and one is obtained from the other just by mutation, one-step mutation. Then we have an isomorphism again of this car is monoids of decorated irreducible generic tau-reduced components. And under this isomorphism, the G vector just changes according to this rule. And perhaps well. Well and now sorry so here we are so now we are almost done and moreover somehow this bijection really sends is compatible with the mutation rule of mutations by by Dirksen Weiman-Selibinski. So this is basically all what you have to remember about it. And now it's kind of clear how And now it's kind of clear how we can now conclude our proof of the theorem. So if we know that it is true for one triangulation, so that we have this black situation here, and then we mutate here our algebra, then we get here an isomorphism by our theorem about mutations of QP's and the change, say, of the G. Say of the g vector is controlled by this map gamma k. And on the other hand, if we just look here at the flip of the triangulation, then again the change of the shear coordinates is kind of obtained by the same transformation. And then we have now our new triangle, say, here by composing, and here the new shear coordinates and the new g vector. And now, since everything is connected. Everything is connected, we kind of conclude by induction. Now, last slide, and a nice consequence is that this kind of proof of Thurston that the shear coordinates induce a bijection between lambinations and set to the n, where n is the rank of our surface, also follows from all our kind of complicated. from all our kind of complicated proof if we throw still in Lamonton's theorem that yeah that this con yeah that the g vectors parameterize exactly the generic tau reduced irreducible components yes so that's it Thank you very much. Are there questions or comments?   I was always finding how it's available. Is it also lie in the cases where the exchange value isn't connected? Yeah, in then just if one makes those I well first of all for this would be first of all a conjecture because somehow this really only works for surfaces with non-empty boundary whereas it from where we know that it is connected. So but I would expect that for surfaces for example for surfaces on they have those surfaces only They have those processes only one function. This would be the typical example where the change graph is not connected. And there, somehow I would believe that you will have to say, no, I would believe that because say for the theorem of Lamondon, anyway the director parametrizes all how reduced the redistricting components, then I somehow would think that somehow the Somehow, would think that somehow there on the other side, you also have to take both components. Could you, in fact, say why you need that assumption about the boundary? And also, I think you were assuming that the punctures are not empty? Well, the boundary, well, the punctures were only needed to make it interesting. So, because without punctures, it is already known, the result. And so, I just wanted to focus on And so I just wanted to focus on this case. And the non-empty boundary is once you have punctures, then I need the boundary so that I can find such a signature zero triangulation. I have a point to start with this few gentle algebras. So this is somehow the point, somehow it's a beginning so that our induction can start somehow. Because, well, in general, these algebras are really messy and just. And just this non-anti-boundary guarantees me that I can find such a signature zero framework, and then I know that the corresponding Jacobian algebra is Q-gent, and there it's kind of doable to relay the strings and bands with curves. Yeah, so you mentioned the remote model vision of being decorated of how we use the phone. Decorated of how they use the components and the elements in rotundic group. Yes. And elements in rotundic group, of course, correspond by Z degree with the presentational space. Yes, yes. So my question is that so people there should be some similar story without using reduced or you know how reduced of you can use the presentation space for example. Yes, there is one. Oh, yeah. So this is a simple. So, this is simplified or not is that this is a every statement to become obvious. Well, I'm not sure because somehow for us it would have been probably harder because it's kind of not so nice to write down say the projective presentations of these modules over a still gentle algebra. This is say for gentle algebra, this is kind of pretty straightforward. Straightforward, how to plug them together, but was too gentle. I was happy enough that it could calculate CT vectors and not write down the presentations. And also, I found it at least for me harder to identify which are somehow the relevant band components with trivial end of office theory. So, this is where I kind of at least I feel more comfortable, but say more only one should. So are there more questions in particular from the online participants? And I should sort of remind you it's a hybrid meeting and I hope the online participants were able to follow. And if not, or if there are any technical problems, please let us know. So are there more questions? Yeah, apparently not. So then we think, Christoph, again.
