Okay, got it. So, in fact, you'll see quite some relation with Lucian's talk that we just heard. But, okay, so this is about the positive formalism. What is the positive formalism for those that haven't heard about it? It's an axiomatic framework for formulating physical. Framework for formulating physical theories. Okay, that sounds very generic. And in particular, it's made to accommodate different particular frameworks for different types of theories. In particular, classical statistical mechanics, the standard formulation of quantum theory. Oops, sorry. Okay. Quantum field theory and generalized probabilistic theories, but also in particular a timeless formulation of quantum theory. And some kind of main motivation for doing this is to provide a framework for being able to do quantum gravity. Quantum gravity. Okay, so in the talk today, I don't want to go too deep into all these different versions of the positive formalism and how they accommodate these different classical and quantum frameworks. I really want to focus on to some extent on the second point here, the standard formulation of quantum theory. Formulation of quantum theory, and the last one, a timeless formulation of quantum theory. So, okay, so this is just a view of how these are some ways to name these different versions of the positive formalism. There's the simplest one is, I sometimes call this the abstract version of the positive formalism, and then. The positive formalism, and then these other frameworks arise if you add additional structure or additional axioms. I'll say a little bit more about this in the course of this talk. Okay, wait. Okay. However, the most important thing I really want to tell you about today is why. Today is why is it necessary to go beyond the standard formulation of quantum theory? Why do we need probability rules that are more general than the one that we have in the standard formulation of quantum theory? Okay. So fortunately, Lucien Hardy in his talk introduced quite Introduced quite some of the structure that I'm going to use in my own talk here. So you've already seen diagrams like this on the left in his talk. And the meaning of these diagrams here is essentially the same that he was using. He was using a particular mathematical version of this, which is this operator tensor formulation. Here I'll use a version which is A version which is widely used in categorical quantum theory, quantum information theory. So, what does a diagram like this mean? We start, let me first start with a simpler version of this, the pure state formalism. Okay, so what are we talking about? We are talking about how to formalize measurements in quantum mechanics first. First. So, in this pure state formalism, the simplest type of measurement is depicted here, where you start with some initial state, which is normalized. Then you apply some measurement which can have outcomes, let's say outcomes from one to n. And in this very simplest version, you have projection. You have projection operators, you have n projection operators that sum to the identity. So the letter E here represents the identity in the Hilbert space. And so what you do, you prepare the initial state, you make the measurement with your projectors. Let's say you apply a particular projector PK, and then you forget about your system. You discard the system. I'll say a bit more about this in a moment. About this in a moment. So, what's the probability to find the measurement outcome PK? Well, in this pure state formalism, you can write it in this way, just pk sandwiched between two copies of psi, or we can write this in this form, where we go to a mixed state formalism, where this is a projector onto. Projector onto the one-dimensional space in the Hilbert space spanned by the vector psi, and we project and we take the trace. And what I also did here is I put the projector two times on both sides, which is of course the same because it's a trace. So we can move it and the projector adjoined is the projector again, and the projector with itself is the projector. Projector with itself is the projector again. So that's the same thing. So I put this really up here for those people that are not so familiar with the mixed state formalism, which is the next step. So in the mixed state formalism, again, we have n outcomes. I changed the notation a little bit. Now we have again, we have an initial state. We do our measurement. We discard our system. Now we write. Now we write the measurement. Again, we have n outcomes. So if we express the same measurement that we saw on the previous version of the slide, then these maps, so sigma is now in a mixed state, so it's a self-adjoint operator, and applying Applying a selective selecting the outcome i corresponds to applying this operation. So we sandwich sigma between the projector on both sides here with a dagger. And again, the sum of the projectors is the identity. Here I wrote two copies of the projector. I'll explain this in a moment. And if now we can also express the fact that we're doing a measurement. fact that we're doing a measurement without looking at the outcome and that's the non-selective a non-selective measurement so what Lucien called a deterministic operation okay so that corresponds to you called the this deterministic operation and so the mathematical operation that corresponds to this is similar to to this one but we are summing over all possible outcomes okay and then again Okay, and then again, the initial state now is in a general mixed state, doesn't have to be pure state, so it's a self-adjoint operator that's normalized. Trace is one. Now the probability for outcome k given the initial state again is a trace. So we apply this operation q to the initial state. So it's this one, except we chose the index k here. And this then in zero. Then, inserting this formula here, we get the same, essentially, the same trace formula as on the previous slide. Now, of course, it turns out that these, why did I write these projectors P in this strange way and put the identity in this way? Well, it turns out they don't have to be projectors. Okay, they can be general bounded operators. General bounded operators, they do have to satisfy this condition, and then this is a general measurement in quantum theory. A general measurement is not necessarily expressible in terms of projectors, but is expressible in terms of these bounded operators in this way. And in this context, these are called cross operators. So it's for those people that are not so familiar with the mixed state formalism. And yeah, in the And yeah, and this is the formula for the probability. Okay. Then, yeah, so the way that you want to read these kinds of, oops, sorry, wait, yeah, that you read these types of diagrams is in terms of linear maps. So you have a box. So you have a box like this with an in and an out is just a map from the initial state space to the final state space. So these lines correspond to the state space. If there's no incoming line, then it's a map from the real numbers to the state space. Or in other words, it's an element in the state space. So if you map one to the image of one is an element here, and you can think of this either as a map. Think of this either as a map from the real numbers to the state space or as an element in this phase space, sorry, state space, and that corresponds to preparation. And then an effect is a map which goes from the state space to the real numbers. And there's a special effect, this non-selective effect or discard effect, what Lucien in his talk called the deterministic effect. Deterministic effect, which is simply taking the trace of the state. Oops, no, sorry. Okay, so with these rules, you can easily evaluate any diagram. This is a diagram that's a bit more complicated. I should also add that if you have parallel lines, that corresponds to a tensor product, again, in the same way as that was the case in. As that was the case in Lucian's stock. So, here, for example, you have two preparations. One has a tensor product outcome, and then they go into this operation. And then you apply this operation and discard. And then this corresponds to this composition here. So you have A and B, the tensor product of the two. Then you apply on the left, nothing is happening. You just apply the identity. On the right, you apply the map C, and then you apply. The map C and then you apply the map D, and at the end you apply the discard map. Okay, so for those that are not so familiar with these diagrams. So for example, so the point is that these diagrams, evaluating the diagram, gives us directly the probability of the corresponding measurement. So for So, for example, if we have operations here that we select outcome i here, we select outcome j there. So, the probability of observing these outcomes given that we have preparations A and B is just exactly this composition map that we saw on the previous slide, right? It's this thing here, except that now we have indices. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's how we get probabilities of general measurements in the standard formulation of quantum theory, and in particular of composite measurements. Now, probabilities are not always directly corresponding to the evaluation of a single diagram. Probabilities can also rise as quotients. Rise as quotients. And an example is if we don't have this discard at the end, but we are conditioning on some particular final outcome of our measurement, in addition to asking for a measurement outcome. So what happens then is that the probability for finding outcome K, given that we have the initial state and also conditioning on the final state, is then a quotient. Of course, A quotient, of course, each numerator and the denominator each can be understood individually as a probability. So the denominator is the probability to have, so it's this diagram on the right, to have this given final state, given that we make the measurement, but without selecting an outcome. And the numerator is then this diagram where we both fix the final state and also fix the outcome. And then the form. Also, fix the outcome. And then the formula is this again: this composition of maps where you have I, you apply Q, and then you apply F. Okay. Then now the causality axiom that Lucian Hardy also mentioned in his talk can be expressed in the following way. So if we do a non- So, if we do a non-selective measurement and later discard the state, it's the same as immediately discarding the state. Okay, so non-selective means we're doing a measurement, but we are not looking at what the outcome is. So, basically, we can impose this condition as a requirement for non-selective measurement. Selective measurement. And then a selective measurement is that we have a particular outcome. Since the different possible outcomes add up to the non-selective measurement, we have less than equal here because the sum of the possible outcomes here amounts to this and everything is positive. So this will be, we get a smaller equal here. Now, what is the meaning of this? Is the meaning of this axiom? So, as Lucien also in his talk explained, this is to prevent signaling from the future to the past. So basically, it amounts to saying that if I do an experiment in my laboratory and tomorrow somebody else goes there and does another experiment, and she tells me then. And she tells me then, okay, so I did this other experiment in my lab that doesn't influence the probabilities for the outcomes of my own measurement. Here? Yeah. No, this is the discard effect. Yes. So this symbol is the effect which is the discard. So physically speaking, non-selective means you do some measurement or some operation, but there's no outcome in the sense that you're not taking into account. So either your device doesn't show any outcome or it shows an outcome, but you're not looking at the outcome. You don't know what. Not looking at the outcome, you don't know what the outcome is. Whereas here, you're saying, okay, there was an outcome, and I know the outcome is this outcome, it's a specific outcome. Sorry, maybe I should have used different letters here. So this A is not the same as this A. I mean, A is just meant to be generic. So it's here, the non-selective thing is the Q where I put a star here, which means that I'm not, I don't know. Means that I'm not, I don't know what the outcome is. And here I put a K, which means the outcome is K. Yeah. Robert, just a quick comment. I mean, I don't want to start a discussion here, which will distract, but what it means that I don't look or I don't know. It's the same. Perhaps you don't look, but then perhaps your cat looks. Does that count as selective or non-selective? I mean, no, that's non-selective. No, that's non-selective. It's, I mean, it doesn't, it, it's, uh, you are making the predictions. Okay, if you don't know the outcome, your prediction will be, you will put a non-selective measurement. If your colleague looked at the instrument, but doesn't tell you anything, you don't have that information. Okay, if you don't have it, this is what you what you apply. And this will be the... And this will be your best guess for making your prediction of the measurement. Okay, so what's so this causality axiom on the one hand has the its function is to ensure preventing signaling. Uh, preventing uh signaling from the future to the past, as already as Lucien also explained in his talk, but it also ensures that probability sum to one. So just to briefly see this, so this is again, this is a measurement with some initial state, and I'm having an outcome i here, but now I'm summing over all the outcomes, and then this is the same as the non-selective operation. Non-selective operation. Okay. But if I have the non-selective operation, I apply this axiom here, this sorry, yeah, yeah, the causality axiom. So I can simplify this. So I simplify this, and then I can again apply the causality axiom, which is okay, that's not, it's less clear, but it also means that these initial states have. That these initial states have trace one, and this is the trace, so this is one. So, this is the causality axiom applied two times. And it means that this sum will be one, which means that this behaves exactly as a probability, right? So for a given i, this is the probability that I measure outcome i. And so this ensures that the probability is one. Okay, and this is very important. This is very important to realize. Okay. So because maybe I should emphasize this other point. So here, this axiom, as I as written here, is time asymmetric. Okay, so this only works to the future if you turn the diagram round and If you turn the diagram round and put this at the beginning and then the other one, and turn this round as well, so you flip the arrow, so to speak, the arrow is time here. Then this doesn't apply. And you don't want to require this because it's too restrictive and you will not be able to describe usual things that happen in your laboratory. Okay, so it's very important to realize that this axiom. Realize that this axiom is time asymmetric and requires a fixed direction of time, a fixed notion of time. But real experiments happen in space-time. And in space-time, as also we saw in Lucien Hardy's talk, if we talk about general space-time regions, then of course the boundaries between these regions are not necessarily. These regions are not necessarily space-like. So, if they are space-like, then for example, this one here, then we could okay. Okay. So, if we have like a space-time boundary and an interaction between this earlier and this later measurement, then we can put an arrow to the future here and say, okay, this is earlier, this is later, so there's an arrow that goes. Later, so there's an error that goes here, and maybe here we could also do that. Maybe this is also space-like, but for example, if you look at this boundary, it's time-like, and so you cannot a priori put an arrow here that it goes from here to there or from there to here. But if you cannot put an arrow, then it means that you don't have a fixed time order between your measurements. Uh, between your measurements, and uh, so if you don't have that, then this axiom doesn't make sense anymore. And I'll come back to that in a moment. And so, the situation is even worse if you are in a situation where you don't have a notion of time. Don't have a notion of time at all. So, I mean, the previous picture was applicable in case where you have a fixed space-time background, like Minkowski space, and you know what is time-like, what is space-like. Now, if you're, for example, you want to do quantum gravity, then, of course, there's no way to talk about these hypersurfaces being space-like or time-like. And then it's even worse. Or time-like, and then it's even worse than you can never put any arrow anywhere. Now, in that situation, what happens? So, if you take away this strict forward time order on which this axiom relies, well, what happens with the axiom? Well, you simply cannot impose it anymore. It doesn't make sense anymore. Okay, it would be inconsistent to try to do that. So, you cannot. Try to do that. So you cannot require. So, what do you do then? Because what we have seen was that the probabilities of this diagram summing to one depends on the axiom. Okay, so this is again the same picture that we saw previously that illustrates how this causality axiom ensures that. Causality axiom ensures that the probabilities sum to one. So, again, here it's the probability for the outcome i given that we have this initial state i. And here I wrote again the formula in terms of this diagram where we have i, then we apply qi, and then we apply the discard. And so the sum is one. Now let me. Let me insert this other expression here, okay, which is a fract, which is a fraction where the numerator is exactly the same and the denominator is an expression which is this one, which is simply equal to one. Okay, so I haven't changed anything. Okay, it's still the same. But now the interesting thing is I can. I can take away the causality axiom. So I take away the causality axiom. However, this sum is still equal to one because this equality here still holds. The sum of these is still this, even if this diagram is not one. Okay. So this is the So, this is the, in some sense, is the key point in which sense the positive formalism goes beyond the standard formulation of quantum theory in its probability interpretation. So, this formula is the key formula for probabilities in the positive formulas. I mean, here I've shown you this in this very special setting where we have time order. Even though I erased the arrows, you could try to put them. The arrows, you could try to put them back again. But this formula or its analogs are valid in general and do not require any causality axioms. Okay. So yeah, so in some sense, that was really the main message I wanted to convey in this talk. And the remaining time, I'll tell you a bit. More about the positive formalism and some applications as time permits. Okay, so this is again different versions of the positive formalism. So Pf is the positive formalism. T means that you have a time order, and N means you're imposing the causality axiom. So if you do that, the So if you do that, the framework you obtain is precisely the convex operational framework, which originates around 1970 when people started to understand how classical mechanics and quantum mechanics or classical, more precisely, classical statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics can be expressed in a unified formalism. And later, then Later, then, starting in the 2000s, basically, this really took off in the context of what's called generalized probabilistic theories. Yeah, and if you insist on this being quantum, which basically means that your state spaces are spaces of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces, then this is the standard formulation of quantum theory. If instead your state spaces are Instead, your state spaces are spaces of functions on phase space, then this is classical statistical mechanics. Now, in this context, is where the usual probability rules apply, which rely on the causality axiom. And in general, if you take away the causality axiom, Away the causality axiom, and you then may also take away this time direction. Then they're replaced by more general rules in the positive formalism, which essentially amount to a version of this quotient rule here. Just yeah, let me just mention that it doesn't mean that It doesn't mean that, so it still means that probabilities are linear in these, in these, in the outcomes, right? So, so the linearity is not taken away. And in fact, also from the point of view that in other situations like this one, probabilities. Like this one, probabilities are quotients even in the standard formulation. It's not too surprising that you need these quotients. Okay, so more generally in the positive formalism, the key, if you analyze the picture I showed you previously, the key to talking about probabilities is that to describe an experimental setup, Describe an experimental setup or some kind of measurement or observations, in terms of these diagrams, you always need two diagrams. So you need one which tells you basically what is the setup, what do you know, a priori, what do you prepare, what do you know already about the outcomes, what are the devices, how are they connected. And the other ingredient you need is on top of that, what is That, what is the question I'm asking? What I'm conditioning on, for example, here I have this measurement set up, I have a given temperature in my laboratory, I have set the switch on this instrument to A. And what I want to know, given all that, how probable is it that the light on this instrument is green? So white means, so the light is always green or red, cannot be white. White means that I'm not. White means that I'm not looking at the outcome. I'm just saying also here that there's no pointer here. It doesn't mean there's no pointer. There's a pointer, but I don't know what it shows. And here I'm conditioning on that showing, for example, two, the number two or something. And then the probability is precisely the quotient between the value that gives the diagram on the left gives me with. Diagram on the left gives me with the diagram on the right-hand side here. Okay, so how much time do we have? You have about 15 minutes. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay, so the rest of the talk. 10. Ah, okay. Okay, so the rest of the talk, I want to spend on some examples of applications. Some examples of applications of the positive formalism. So, the first example I'm putting here predates the positive formalism. It's about indefinite causal structure and it's a seminal work of Ognian and Jaslav and other people from 2011 about indefinite causal structure, which is an example where you have with Where you have, it was also referred to in other previous talks of this conference. So I'll be brief. So you have two laboratories with Alice and Bob, and quantum theory, as we know it, and especially all the rules of the standard formulation apply in these laboratories. But then you're not defining how they are related between them. In particular, you could think that one of these is earlier than the other. Of these is earlier than the other one, which would be expressible by connecting these inputs and outputs in a particular way. And then you can ask the question, well, what happens if I don't know which is previous to the other one? Or I want to look for situations where, in fact, I cannot in principle determine which is previous to the other one or why this. One, or where this external situation is such that, in fact, neither Alice is before Bob or Bob is before Alice. And that's to this end, they invented this process matrix formalism to deal with that. And so the main reason I put it here is that this can be seen as a special application of the positive. Application of the positive formalism. So, this embeds directly into the positive formalism, and all of this can be expressed within the positive formalism. And in particular, the probability for the measurement outcomes can be derived directly from this probability rule here. Another context: scattering in quantum. text scattering and quantum future. So the standard setup to describe scattering quantum field theory, the S matrix, is where you think about your measurement as happening at some time, but you're having an initial state and you're looking for a final state, which are, as I'm talking about, state which are at asymptotic time. So the initial state is as at a very early time that you send to minus infinity. The final state is at a late time that you send to plus infinity. And so then interactions happen at intermediate time. And so this is basically the S matrix. You can think of this as a transition amplitude. Where you send the initial time to minus infinity and the final time to plus infinity. Now, the interesting thing I want to tell you about this is that of course here we are again having an external fixed notion of time with an initial and final situation, which is essential for. Which is essential for this to work. But in the positive formalism, what we can do is we can consider a similar type of scattering picture, but where initial and final states are not necessarily separated on different hypersurfaces. So, in particular, think about the following situation. Suppose our experiment is spatially confined, which is Spatially confined, which is a very usual situation. Imagine, for example, particle collider experiment. So you have like a box, which is your detector. You shoot in particles and on the boundary of the box, you're registering them. And then the space-time picture for this looks like this. So you have your experiment. So this is space and this is time. And it's confined, let's say, in a sphere or in some box. Sphere or in some box. But you're continuously injecting particles and continuously measuring, seeing what the detector's output. So this is extended over all of time. So in this case, your states would live on a Hilbert space associated to the boundary of this thing, which is so you just have. Which is so you just have one single Hilbert space, and the particles go in and come out on this on this very same hypersurface. And now, using the positive formalism, you can talk about the probabilities of measuring certain particles coming out, let's say, given that others go in, or some more complicated probabilities. Probabilities. Okay, so here I've used a different notation, but don't worry about this. So the point is that we can condition something that we want to know about the state on this boundary given on something that, sorry, yeah, a question we're having about this state condition on something we know about this state. For example, certain particles. State. For example, certain particles go in, and we want to know what particles come out. And then the probability formula from the positive formalism gives us the result in spite of the fact that we don't have an a priori distinction between an in and out Hilbert space here. In particular, we can then go on and do something similar as we do. Do something similar as we do with a standard S matrix and now send the here initial and final time to infinity. So here we can send now this radius to infinity and get an asymptotic amplitude. And as Daniele Colossi and I have shown in 2007, it turns out that this asymptotic amplitude The asymptotic amplitude is equivalent to the standard S matrix. Okay, so given that, you might ask: well, then if it's just another fancy way of getting the same S matrix, why is it interesting? Well, of course, there are space-times which do not admit a notion of initial and final Hilbert spaces. In particular, if we have space-times. Particular, if we have space-times that are not globally hyperbolic, like ADS space-time. And then this type of scattering matrix with spatially asymptotic states still works perfectly, while the usual S matrix doesn't really work anymore. And it's also interesting to look at this situation in a context where we are at a Where we are at a finite distance from the experiment, because there are new types of molds of the fields appear, which don't appear on space-like hypersurfaces, like in the standard approach. In particular, the so-called evanescent molds appear, which, yeah, I mean, you know, might know in they play an important role in electromagnetism. They are modes that decay. They are moles that decay exponentially if you go away from the source. And of course, at infinity, you cannot detect them, but at finite distance, you can detect them. But they don't exist on space-like hypersurfaces because they are not normalizable there. But here you can see them, and you can ask about the scattering of the corresponding particles, which are evanescent particles. So that's really something new that we are exploring at the moment. We are exploring at the moment. Okay, so I'm not sure if. Yeah, let me just mention a final example, which you might also have seen in another context, which is the black hole bounce model. So you're thinking it's an extremely simple model with just two parameters of a black hole that forms and then it explodes the white hole. So this has a motivation. Hole. So, this has motivations from quantum gravity. So, you could think that if in quantum gravity you have a tunneling process and that there's no singularity forming when a black hole forms, but instead you get a bounce and it comes back to a white hole, which is a time-reverse black hole. And then you can detect as an external observer there's a characteristic. There's a characteristic time that characterizes this process, which is the so-called bounce time, and you can measure this from an external observer. And then the question is, in a quantum theory, how can I express this measurement even in principle? And it's here that the positive formalism can tell you exactly, if you have such a quantum theory, how you can extract predict. A prediction for this bounce time from such a Ponham theory because you don't have, again, you don't have a fixed temporal order. You treat the interior of the black hole and the exterior classical region as two separate regions, but there's no fixed temple order between the two of them. Okay, so let me let me stop here. Thank you. So, are there any questions? Maybe I should take that. Are there any questions from here? Carris? I have some question about the causality condition. The word is not the same use of the word as we use, for example, in QFT in terms of signaling, well, of signals or information transferred inside the light cone or the microcausality assumption, to be Microcausality assumption to be more technical. So it is essential that you don't have a fine, if I understand it right, it's essentially the assumption that you have a probability assignment without a final state, without post-selection. Is it right to say this? Take the microphone. Yeah, okay, so let me first say that, so as you point out, correct. So, as you point out correctly, this is not the same as relativistic causality, the causality condition I talked about. It's the causality condition that's baked into the standard formulation of quantum theory, and that also applies in the non-relativistic setting. Now, so your other question about post-selection. So the reason why you need this more general sense. Need this more general setting is not only because you want to post-select, for example, but in general, you don't even know what not post-selecting means. Okay? So basically, in the causality axiom, not post-selecting Not post-selecting, or in the standard formulation of quantum theory, not post-selecting means that you apply the discard a later time. But if you don't know what is later, then what does it mean to apply the discard a later time? Because you cannot apply it at earlier time, for example. You cannot first start with discard and then do something else. So the discard as with this kind of physical meaning can A kind of physical meaning can only make sense if it's applied later. And if you don't know what later means, then you don't know what it means a priori to apply this card. So I don't know if that explained the issue a bit. So the discard means you have no final state, essentially, no post-selected state that you put in. State that you put in. No. Okay, so I really don't understand in what sense we're talking about causality. If I may switch in to maybe clarify with my own words, because it's my subject I'm quite passionate about. So basically, I think discard means to essentially not condition on variables in that region. And for instance, if you think about it in the future, it so happens that we do not condition on events or measure. On events or measurement outcomes in the future in that way. But now turn it around, think about the past. In fact, the way to not condition would not be this one, to not condition on events that happened in the past. Because if you believe that this is how it would be, then you run into troubles of explaining how we could ever learn anything about the world. I just want to point out in some quantum cosmological models, like for example, well, let's say Hartle-Hawking wave function through the path integral, we essentially condition also in the future. So, because or in the so-called symmetric quantum cosmological models, you also have a final state condition. So, in this, this is non-causal in terms of this, right? From the right robert, okay, thanks. So, yeah, okay. So, the thing is that, so if you talk about quantum cosmological models, in this context, you would first have to explain to me how you're doing measurements in such models. Measurements in such models. And then, yeah, so it's so the main point, okay, I'll try to make it again is that even this apparently simple statement as saying that we are not caring about what happens later with the system, that we're just discarding it, is not an innocent condition. Okay, and it's not something that is Well, let me put it another way. So, to implement this condition, you need. So, this is in the standard formulation, this is by explicitly putting a discard at the end. And because, yeah, so throwing away your system is something that depends on the causality condition in the future. And if you don't have that, then you. And if you don't have that, then you don't even know what it means to throw your system away. You cannot, or in terms of diagrams, you cannot, if you are doing this operation, then I mean your system or universe or whatever continues to be, and you have to say what you're doing with it. So, of course, if you want to say, okay, I'm just throwing it away, I mean, not looking at it anymore, you put the Looking at it anymore, you put the discard, but as I said, this only works if you have a fixed notion of time. If you don't have that, then you don't know what it means to throw away your system. Just probably to continue with this same question, in an earlier In an earlier talk by him, there was this thing about whether quantum probabilities follow a Kolmogorov rule or Kolmogorov action. And in here, I see probabilities adding to one. Can you comment in the relation between this and what was given in a previous talk? Whether there is any losing. No, no, please come. Okay, so there's no difference between probabilities or quantum probabilities. I mean, probabilities are just probabilities. So they if you have exclusive outcomes, then they have to add to one. They have to add to one. So, yeah. Okay. So, Lucien, yes, you can switch in. Hi, thanks for the talk. I think I appreciated emphasizing this point about dropping the causality part in some sense of the one condition. So, then my question is: what if you're in a situation? Question: Is what if you're in a situation where you don't exactly have this definite causal structure that you need, but maybe you have something like it, or it's a bit like that. It seems like you've thrown the baby out with the bathwater and you have no hope of having conditions to sort of somehow constrain your system in accord with that situation. Do you have any idea how to proceed in that case? Yeah, thanks, Lucien, for the question. In fact, The question and in fact, there are a lot of things I could have said also with respect to your talk, which I very much appreciated. Yeah, unfortunately, there's not so much time for that. But permit me to make an explanation first to the audience also about what you were saying in your talk. So basically, okay, let me go back. Let me go back. Okay, so what Lucien was talking about in his talk to some extent was precisely to address the problem that is pointed out on this transparency, where, oh, wait, I should use this. Sorry. So, for example, if you have this situation where you have a time-like hypersurface, and so a priori, we don't And so, a priori, we don't have an error there, and we don't know how to implement the causality condition. But Lucian was talking about a way to try to implement the causality condition anyway in such a situation. Okay, so this is basically a quantum future situation. And by systematically distinguishing between Between what goes to the left and to the right, and then using this distinction to implement a version of this causality condition in this way. So yeah, there's another way. So in the positive formalism or general boundary formulation, also I there's some There's some work in this direction. So, in particular, in the continuous context, you can, so in certain situations, you can split also the Hilbert space for the continuous version of this into an in and out part, which basically corresponds to separating the incoming from the outcoming particles with respect to region, and then use that. To region, and then use that very much in a way that you indicated to then implement a version of this causality axiom. So I very much agree with you that it's desirable to think about ways to be able to do this. And let me just make a And let me just make one more comment. It turns out that in the case of fermionic series, even if you don't have a space-time metric that tells you which piece of the hypersurface is space-like or time-like, there arises a surprisingly economical decomposition of the boundary Hilbert space into an in- and out. Hilbert space into an in and out part, which you can then try to use precisely to implement the causality condition. I talked about this, the parameter in 2018 at the conference that you can look up on the talk on PIRSA. So, I very much agree with you that it would be desirable to try to implement this, but also I don't have a final answer to this. Have a final answer to this at this point. Thanks for the answer, Robert. Well, if there are no other questions, let's thank Robert and all the speakers in the morning sessions.
