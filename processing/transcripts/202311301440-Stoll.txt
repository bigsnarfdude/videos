Spheres. I haven't actually written this down yet, so let me take everything I said with a small grain of salt. Right. So let me first introduce some notation for the things I'm actually going to talk about, which is these products of connected sums of products of spheres, which I'm going to denote by sigma g1 kl. And what is this? It's the default connected sum of the product of SK and SL. SK and SL, and then the one says that I remove an open little open disk somewhere, like so. And throughout this talk, I'm going to impose certain conditions on these dimensions, namely I want that k is at least 3, that it's sort of the smaller of the two dimensions, in particular they're not equal, and L is at most two k minus two. 2k minus 2. And I mean, particular examples are if k and delta both are equal to 1, then these are surfaces, which I'm not going to talk about. If k and delta equal, which is also another case I'm not going to talk about, then these are the manifolds wg, which we probably have seen a couple of times. And if L is equal to k plus 1, then we have like two adjacent dimensions here, and then these are sometimes called dg or dg1. Right, and as the title already says, Right, and as the title already says, sort of the goal, what I want to first part of what I want to say today in this talk is describe the stable homology of their classifying spaces. So the limit is g was infinity of the homology of, well, their blocked classifying spaces. So the classifying space of the blocked diffimult group relative to the boundary of these manifolds. Of these manifolds, and the approach will be sort of rational and homologically rated. So, everything I say is sort of rational coefficients. So that's what I'm going to describe. And sort of maybe the more main application, or why you might be interested in this, is that we have already seen a couple of times during this workshop, that if you know something block about block diffeomorphisms, you can do something about the actual diffeomorphisms, which I'm Which I'm going to say a little bit about at the end. Maybe I should also say I'm here stabilizing here, and stabilizing is sort of the usual thing. So if I have my sigma g like this, then here I act on some kind of automorphisms, and this kind of like proprietomorphisms, and then I can. Like proctomorphisms, and then I can glue on another genus here and act with identity. And I can do this because I'm acting relative to the boundary. So this boundary is fixed. Right. And the first remark I want to make is that sort of stability for this sequence is known by By in the case of equal dimension, this was done by Alexander and Dick Martin. And in the case I wrote here, this is due to Matthias Gray. So in particular, if you compute the stable chromology, you're going to say something about the finite stages as well in a certain range. So sort of the methods I'm like The result I'm going to write down actually directly yields results about the finite stages, and so in particular also implies stability. And using sort of external newer results, the range is actually better than the one that we've already got. Right. And to state the result, I first need to talk a little bit about graph complexes again, because the result is stated in terms of a graph complex. We've seen that. Complex. We've seen that already twice, I guess, in Alexander's talk and Todayuki's talk. But let me sort of give a maybe slightly more elaborate but still not completely precise definition again, from a slightly different viewpoint. This is originally due to Pan Sielbich, though the division I am giving now was worked out in a little bit more detail by Conan and Folkman. Detail by Cornerland Falkland. Right. So, what I want to define is the graph complex, which I'm going to denote GCM of Li and P. And now I have to say what all these things actually are. So, M is going to be some natural number. Li, well, I mean, I'm going to only write, define it in the case. I'm going to only write define it in the case of the Lie operate, but this could be any circlic operate, say, in random vector spaces. In particular, I'm considering Lie here with its circlic structure. So I consider it as an operate where I can also sort of swap the output with one of the inputs. And then P here, this is just some gradient vector space. Yeah, so these are the types of the inputs, and then the type of the output is that it's a chain complex, and it's roughly given as follows. So the underlying graded vector space is given by, I take isomorphism classes of graphs. So G is a graph. So G is a graph. And then for each of these isomorphism classes, I look at labelings of G by the D operat and my graded vector space P. And maybe let me draw a picture to make this clearer. So I have one here. Let's say you have three vertices. Let's say I have three vertices. Let's see. Three big vertices and two small vertices. And then I have some edges between them. Say I have an edge here, two edges here, and then I have a loop here, loop here, and edge here. In particular, my graph does not need to be connected. Yeah, like so. And then I label each of these vertices, namely each of the vertices of valence larger than one, I label by an element of the Lie circuit Lie operand, so up to sort of, which is generated by three Airy trees. Modular IHX relations, but I'm just going to draw some generators here. So, for example, it would look like this. Oops. And over here is one. So each of these vertices is labeled by an element of the cyclic Lie operator. And then these RC1 vertices here are labeled by an element of like so. So these so these. So these come from the D operator and these things come from T. Okay, this is something I can associate to this graph G here and then the automorphism group of G acts by sort of commuting everything and I quotient out this action. And to be sort of precise about this action and the grading I should say that And the grading, I should say that every vertex, I consider a vertex to lie in degree 1 minus m and an edge to lie in degree m. So this is important to say in which homological degree this actually lies and to specify the signs of this action. I mean if I mute two edges, I get a sign according to this and which. According to this, and vertices that you design according to this. Right. Something more. Right. Are there any questions? You assume that every candidate components has a vertex labeled by P? Uh no. Okay, so um ah right so now I have defined the um and then there's no more space, so now I have defined the underlying graded vector space, but I said it's a complex, so I should better define a differential as well. And here I'm going to be even more vague and say that the differential Is given by edge contractions and sort of pictographically, this means I'm taking the sum over all ways of doing the following, namely picking an edge between two vertices. Two vertices, say they're labeled middle by some element of the Lie operator, say like this. And then I can contract this edge and compose the two the two elements in here. So I would get So you guys like that, so I hope that's sort of readable. And if you're careful with signs, you can make this precise and equip this great vector space with a differential defined in such a way. And then this is a sort of very explicit chain complex. Explicit chain complex. Everything is defined as sort of finite objects like graphs and this, well, assuming that P is like finitely generated. This is, in each area is finitely generated. So everything's sort of finite in practice we, so in theory, we could put into the computer, which we could have done. But well, there's lots of graphs, so this is only feasible up to like small degrees. Um does this mean that you don't contrive edges that lead to a yes I should have read those yeah exactly so these are not not trading um right and then the remark is that I mean I think Alexander also already said this in some form that this thing has occurred before and people have studied it in particular one It in particular one property is that has been shown that the cohomology of this thing is sort of, at least when M is even, very closely related to the cohomology of certain groups gamma G S D7, sort of D7 H by sigma S, so the symmetric. Ïƒ s, so the symmetric group on s vectors, and I take tensor product, the s for tensor product of p and so it's a group gamma gs that's multiple automorphisms of a vegetation of g s ones relative to Relative to S points. So in particular, if S is 1, these are just automorphism groups of 3 groups. And if S is 0, these are auto-automorphism groups of 3 groups. And I should give some intribution here. So in this case, M is even and S is 0, so when there's no P here. zero, then there's no p here. This region due to a conceivable then made expanded on by Conant and Folkman. And then if s is larger than zero, this is due to Conan, Kasabov, and Folkman. And there's also a version of this for M odd due to Lazarus and Voronov. At least in the case that S is zero, we're very. Zero, instead of this cohomology here, we have some twisted cohomology, so there's some lower coefficients. But in any case, this graph complex cohomology is related to things people care about in these group cohomologies. So these are, I mean, by this, basically exactly a similar actually started. Yeah, but I mean I would like to know before. You should have 15 minutes at least. So that it's 15 more. Okay, so that's the graph complex. And using this, I can now state all of the main result. And that is the Of the main result, and that is that well, under these conditions I stated in the beginning, which is now the only time I'm going to say them again. So, k is at least 3 smaller than L, which is at most minus 2. Then in homologous degrees up to G minus 2, there's isomorphism. There's isomorphism of homology of this property free morphism, basically pair mode and Russian coefficients to a certain tensor product. The first factor is the cohomology of the general linear group of the integers with rational coefficients. And then this is tensored with And this is tensored with the homology of the graph complex I just wrote down. So there's some shift here, so it's a dimension minus two of some gradient vector space that we're going to define at the moment, which I'm truncating to k minus 1. And then there's other little index here, which I'm also going to explain. But in essence, this says that this cohomology here can be computed as the cohomology of the general linear group here, which is completely known by Virgo Borel, and the cohomology of this slightly modified graph complex. Right, so in the case where k is equal to L, this was proven by Alexander and Jim Manson, and this is a version that applies. Version that applies in sort of this other different range here, which in particular also includes odd-dimensional manifolds. For example, if L is equal to K plus 1. Right, so now I should explain the last terms here. There, as I said, pi is greater directional vector space and in degree p the following. The following. It's a single queue on a generator I call Li if P is congruent to mod 4 and it's 0 otherwise. So it's just a four periodic enter Q in every fourth degree and then here it's truncated to a circle. Right, and these will Right, and these will hopefully get there, but these in a certain sense are doable to principle classes. And then I should say what this little index here is and so graph complex, if I have a little n down there, that's a sub complex of sort of the whole graph complex. Of the whole graph complex, where I don't have this little modification here. And it means that I remove certain graphs, namely the ones I have a single edge connecting to one valent vertices, which are labeled by something of pi, and I want to remove those where The degree of P and the degree of Q are smaller than N. So I throw away certain very explicit simple graphs. And yes, that's sort of the full statement. Using this slight modification of the graph complex with some parameters, this and this cohomology of this infinite general linear group will be p squared. That general linear group for PV scribe, the commodity here, in a certain stable range, which is sort of one. Are there any questions about the statement? Why can't L be arbitrarily large? Why can't what be arbitrarily? So there's a couple points where this shows up. And one one thing is that in this range of degrees, it's completely So, in this range of degrees, it's completely immediate that these manifolds are formal, which is useful. Then it shows up, I erase it, but in the work of Bray, the same range shows up, sort of for, I think, for identifying that this is actually the group that shows up. And then in some computations, so in the course of the proof, which I don't really have time to talk about. Have time to talk about. Different graphs complex shows up first, and then you want to relate them to this one. And in this stage, also, you need the same condition. So, sort of somehow always the same condition shows up, and I don't know exactly why, but I mean. So, it needs to be the last thing, but it shows up also in there. So, in the course of the proof, which I'm not going to talk about because I don't have the time, first, sort of a different graph complex shows up, which you want to relate. Complex shows up, which you want to relate to this one, and to see that that graph complex is actually sort of the commodity of that graph complex is the same as the graph commodity of this graph complex, you need the same condition. Is it difficult to describe the barrier part? No, no, I mean this is just a uh polynomial ring. Yeah, it's it's infinitely many generators in every fourth degree and I think it starts in five? Yes, good. Starts in five? Yes, good. Particular spot polynomial. Second? Particular spot polynomial. Well, I mean, exterior. Any comments? Yeah, so the map to from B diff to BGL, is it just the action on the homology or? Yeah, exactly, yeah. But wait, wait. Now which homology? This is K homology. Okay. Cave really comology. Or I have. Or it doesn't mention. Okay. So that's a statement. Let me make some remarks. I'm sorry. So you don't want the fact that you have a square cup product between us and you pay to inter inter interfigue wheels happening in the reality. Is that what you're saying? I'm not sure what you mean. Okay, let me make some remarks about this. The first is that sort of when in the case that when L is k plus 1, so in this adjacent dimensional situation, against minor beyond the image. Jens Meinho and Jans Ebert computed this as well in a smaller range. So in this case, this extends their result. Their range is roughly half of this one, so it goes up to what do you want to say? Yeah, right, sorry. Yeah, so their range is, sorry. I want to say, so this range only depends on the gene. This range only depends on sort of the genus, so it completes this whole stable chromology, and their range depended on the dimension or more on the dimension, so it sort of cuts off at some point. But this is a complete description of a stable chromology. This extends Hilbert and Einberg. And their degree was their range was up to k minus four. That's the first remark. That's the first remark. But also, they didn't have any graph complexes in their head. Yeah, exactly. I mean, their way was sort of, well, maybe not elementary, but sort of by hand. And sort of the graph complex is a way to sort of encapsulate all of their computations in a sort of nice way. And then the second is that the proof uses a generalization. Generalization, the result Alexander talked about of his and Thomas Lehmann. And this generalization here, that's joint work with Alexander. And this is actually where, so far, most of the work has gone into because it turned out to be a little bit more annoying than expected. Yes, but if you Yes. But if you remember what Alexander talked about, that was some way of like multiple automotives here to write this as cohomology of some arithmetic group with coefficients in some cohomology of a Lie algebra. And that's really what goes into the proof here. And then the generalization is first of all putting in this boundary, so I have it relative to some subspace, and then second of all. subspace and then second of all it also has a form that at least rationally applies to problems. Probably that's all I'm going to say about the proof. I have like five more minutes hopefully I can state before you erase p. Can you explain again what is pi p? How we define pi p. So pi is a great vector space and I'm defining The red vector space, and I'm defining its degree p-point. Red is an equal that k minus one. Yeah, I'm truncating it here. Okay, okay, so you kind of take it. Alright. It's a Q if P is congruent to mod 4. It's just it it's literally just one dimensional. Okay, but what it's g generators or? Uh yeah, I'm pointing the generator L y. Uh yeah, I'm pointing the generator at a line. That's just the name for the generator. Um right and uh as we saw, um sort of calculations for uh locked different. Can yield some kind of information about actual diffeomorphisms of the range. And that's sort of, you can do deduce that from the statement I had before. And then the range is, okay, let me actually say that in the range up to 2k, like dimension, the degree 2k minus 5, the stable thing here can be described. As the following, this now depends on, well, okay, so maybe first I should highlight, now this is not a description of the whole stable thing, but only sort of in a range depending on the dimension. And this depends on whether the dimension is odd or even. Let me write the odd case. Then this is a polynomial or exterior algebra generated. Algebra generated by certain Kappa classes, and namely, we have those Kappa classes where P is a monomial in the L classes where these have degree at least k plus 1. And then I'm excluding some of them. I want to exclude the ones where The monomial is equal to the L class, like just a single L class, and I want to exclude the case where P is a product of two L classes whose degrees are more than equal to L. Um so this is when So this is when k plus l is odd. And then in the even case, you get basically the same thing, except that you also allow the Euler class and so Li and E, and then the whole thing you need to tensor with a polynomial algebra generated by the right classes. So these are the boreal classes. I mean, this is exactly the cohomology of GLZ we had before, which comes from acting on the Kth cohomology. And this is if K plus L is eaten. I think I'm basically out of time, so let me let's say the rest orally. Again, Orally. Again, this is an extension. If L is k plus 1, this extends sort of a result of Eilat-Leinhold. The degree was roughly the same as this one, so up to about K. And in that case, it doubles the range. But apart from that, the result is the same. So this is a relation that was formed by Ebert 15 years ago or something like that. And this relation was found by Ebert. Was found by Hilbert Einhard, and the same reduction shows up here. Like, if you parse through what these frames here exactly mean, you see that it's a very good reduction. That was my Bing. Second iteration of this. Just let me say two more things orally. So the first is that sort of in sort of work in process manual, you're trying to push this. Process with mana, we're trying to push this a little bit further than this range and see what happens there. And then the second is maybe how to go from the previous result I wrote down to this result is that sort of you see that it shows that trivalent graphs are exactly the ones that correspond to these kappa classes, where these little hairs labeled by something. Labeled by something what I call pi, these correspond exactly to these L classes here. And then the last thing I want to say is that sort of in this graph complex I wrote down, there's some interesting classes showing up slightly above this script, like this range, which would be interesting to see what happens in here. That's all. Maybe you'd stop the recording. Help classes? I mean, well. I mean, these are the classes. I mean, let me not commit to writing down the definition, but writing this in this way here is, I think, not so important. I think I could also format it with some. So, could you say what mechanism in the bio complex makes that second kind of relation happen? Yeah, yes, but not fiction. I mean it it has to do with sort of I mean I mentioned before that some graph complex shows up first that one is directed so every edge points in a direction and then it's sort of the combinatorics of that graph complex when you try to pass to something undirected. Some stuff vanishes. Some stuff vanishes. But for the government, does it hold on to be property for it? Uh yeah, I mean, sorry, yeah, I should maybe I can give an answer. So the this relation is exactly this thing I removed from the graph complex. These things were exactly the ones that corresponded. Maybe that's not the answer. What's the relation you're talking about? Say again? What's the relation you're talking about? You're saying something's not there. Yes, I mean, so I'm lying a little bit here. So from what the approach I talked about here, you only see. Talked about here, you only see that it's generated by everything except for that. And you don't know if this is zero equal to something else. But, well, Ebert Reiner would have shown that these things are always zero. So you can use their results. But I mean, that's only up to brain, blah, blah, blah. Oh, yeah, so I should say, yeah, I mean, the format we've written, yeah, right. Okay, so I can only say it's actually. Right, okay, so I can only say it's actually a relation in the range where the result applies. Otherwise, I think, I guess I haven't thought about it yet, but I only know that it does not appear in this description. If I remember correctly, they give an argument that doesn't rely on the range for the vanishing of the plus. I think this should be done. I mean, but I think still it only applies if L is equal to k plus 1. Oh, L C. That's what I mean. And it's very suggestive, but. Yeah, I mean, I would be. Yeah, I mean I would be very surprised if they are just what happens if k equals 2? I don't know. I mean we're still in the high-dimensional range in some sense. Yeah, I don't know. Oh, we can deploy it sort of in any of the So in any of the specifics for cables that should be changed to the change to the it's the same question as sort of why these restrictions occur yeah I mean you don't think you could stay with this other director directly? No, no, I mean th that I I haven't really thought about relaxing these conditions very much, so I don't want to commit to anything too strong, but I don't expect so. And I guess everybody has 50 minutes now to get coffee and think about problems. Yeah, well,   I explained to you. First of all, it's for saying which degree something ends up in. So if something has so many vertices, like this is sort of the co-logic degree of a vertex, so we have two vertices, like at this degree plus whatever how many edges it has. Ah, co-logic degree. So, yeah, I mean, it's like two. And this thing would be one times one minus m plus half times m. That's degree. And the second is, I mean, there's a cost of sign rule involved. So if I swap two edges, then I get a s minus one to the m. If you swap the vertices, I get a minus one to the one minus m of power. Yeah, I mean it depends on the parity of M. If M is even then I mean it depends on the direction then I think it's a graph of X and I can call odd if M is odd then it's a graph of X and you can call in. So it's it's depending on the parity of M, it's really two different graph of X's actually. I suggest you might think that might be a problem. No, no, no, you can't do it. Yeah, I mean mine is a mine. If it's a trivial Something like this corresponds to the copper class and the coppercast. If you don't have a coppercast, then there's this construction. I'm probably going to be talking about how much we just get having a lot of specifics.
