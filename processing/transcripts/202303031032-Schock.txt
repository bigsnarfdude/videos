So, I want to tell you a bit about really the first example of KSB compactification, where we understand, I think, quite a bit more than these different examples that we've seen throughout the week. So, maybe I'll start with really the I should write bigger than this. So I'll start with really the first example of a moduli space, just going back to the one-dimensional case. So this is, of course, the moduli of stable end-pointed rational curves. Of course, we all know as a Of course, we all know is a fantastic space that has all sorts of great properties. So, first of all, so this compactification is this stable pair compactification. I guess you could call it the KSBA compactification, but it's one-dimensional, so probably we would say that. But regardless, it is. So, the point is, you know. So the point is, you know, m0 in just parameterizes n points on p1, and then m0 in m bar sort of degenerates into trees of p1s where the points are distributed, and there's this stability condition, which I won't write down. Okay, so great this compactification has a great modular interpretation. Second, Second, the geometry of this compactification is very nice. So, this is a smooth projective variety. And its boundary is a simple normal crossings divisor. Managed to write this without spelling out an entire single word. out an entire single word. And more than this, so the log canonical divisor, K plus B is ample. So this is, I guess, is a result of Kel and Teblev. But I guess it also sort of goes back to work of Keel and the Kern. So what this says is this compactification. But this compactification is the log canonical compactification of M0. And then the third great fact that I want to focus on about M0 and R is it has a very nice description of its showering. So its showering turns out to be the same as the cohomology ring. Co-homology ring and it has this explicit presentation due to Kiel, which the details of this aren't important for this talk, so I'll just write it like this. So it's a ring which is generated by the boundary divisors of M0 and bar, and the relations are what I'll call the obvious relations. Obvious relations. So they're relations, you know, two of these boundary divisors, their product is zero if the divisors are disjoint. And then we have these sorts of linear relations, which are the fallbacks from the relations on M04 bar, which is just P1. So this is my summary of great facts about M. Summary of great facts about M0N bar. So now let's go to the higher dimensional case. So what is the higher dimensional version of M0? So this is the moduli space of stable hyperplane arrangements. Okay, so this let's let's see what the analogs of these three three three facts are for this for this higher dimensional space. So first, what is this space? So it's the KSBA compactization of the moduli space of arrangements of n lines. in lines and p to the r minus one, which are in general position. This is compactified by the m bar of Rn. This is the KSVA stable pair compactification. So what happens here is again we Is again we start in the interior, maybe with some lines in general position, and then those sort of degenerate, and when they degenerate, we split this up into a sort of reducible union of surfaces along which the lines are distributed. Maybe I'll try to draw an example here. Example here. So you get a sort of picture like this. So here you could think, you know, you contract this bottom component here, then you get two lines which coincide and three more lines like this. So that's that's if you can track this bottom up or if you Bottom up, or if you subtract this top component to a point, then you get these three lines which meet in a point, and two more lines like this. Two degenerate arrangements glued to this stable line arrangement. So, one thing that I want to point out about this, maybe before I point this out, I should say whose work this is. So, this is So this is this construction that's due to Hackenkeel Teboleph. And one thing that I want to point out about this is this is this KSBA stable pair compactification, but it also has a purely combinatorial description. So these sorts of stable hyperplane arrangements here are in bijection with matriarch subdivisions. With mature subdivisions of the hypersymplotx. If you don't know what that means, it doesn't matter. The point is, it's just an entirely sort of combinatorial description. So that's the first aspect. So for M0 and Var, we got the stable pair compactification. Now we've got the same thing in the higher-dimensional case. Case. And we can ask now about the analogs of 2 and 3. So for 2, what does the geometry of this moduli space of stable hyperplane arrangements look like? It's nowhere near as nice as this. It is as bad as it can possibly be. So we all this is a theorem, so one This m bar Rn can have multiple components, so it doesn't need to be irreducible, and I don't think it even needs to be connected. So, this is again part of the work of hacking health and tebla. And two, so it's got multiple components, but maybe for us this is not a surprising feature. But we could restrict to the main component, so just the closure of MRN and MRRN, and ask what the geometry of that looks like, and that's also completely awful. So the strata of this main component. main component are they can be completely arbitrary. So essentially any variety can appear as a stratum of the main irreducible components. So this was again improved by Keel and Tevalev and I should say you know here And I should say, you know, here, since, as I said, this space has a sort of entirely combinatorial description, this is really just the prototypical example of this sort of universality, which is a statement that things can be as bad as possible. Can be as bad as possible. So the geometry of this compactification is not next. I was really hoping that I'd be able to fit everything I wanted to say on one board. That didn't happen. So let's continue with this. So, in general, this is a very complicated space to study, but I do. But I do want to point out, you know, in the first few cases, this compactification is actually a bit nicer. So there's a Ethereum, right like this. So this compactification, maybe I should specify the main component, is this log canonical compactification. Comparifications and only the first few the first few cases. So only when R is two or when R is three and N is six, seven, or eight. And I should say there's maybe a couple other cases too. A couple other cases too, because there's a duality where this space m bar Rn is the same as M bar N minus Rn. So we get a few more cases here. Now, who is this result due to? So this case two is just this M0 and bar. Is just this M0 n bar case that I said before. So this is the moduli space of n points on P1. So this is just N0N1. This again goes back to this work of Keel and Tepinov. Now these next few cases These next few cases, which you would think shouldn't be that much harder, took a lot more work to figure out. So this case, n is equal to 6, was proved by Lexington in 2008. The case where n is 7 was proved by Corey in 2020. And then this final case was proved by Corey just a few months ago. A few months ago. So in these first first few, in these first few cases, this is the law canonical compactification, and notice it's not quite as bad as the general situation. So that's. So that's part two of the geometry of M bar R. So now let me try to discuss part three, which is the intersection theory of this compactification. So since this space is essentially arbitrary, there seems to be no hope to Seems to be no hope to completely describe the Chao Ring in all generality, but in these first few cases, it is in fact more manageable. So this is my first theorem, which is if r is 2, which again is not a new case, this is just the in 0 and 1. Case, this is just the m is there and r. Or if r is 3 and n is 6 or 7, then the showering of n bar rn is the same as the cohomology ring and it has a presentation. And it has a presentation, which, again, I won't write down the details of, because it's a bit complicated, but the point is the presentation is exactly the analog of Kewell's presentation. Okay, so I should point out a couple things about this. So, first of all, I said that this compactification is fairly nice for R is 3 and N is 6, 7, and 8. Here, I only did this for 6 and 7, because it turns out my current techniques do not work for n is equal to 8. So there's a bit of a difficulty there, which I'll explain. Second, my same techniques that Second, my same techniques that I use to prove this can also be used to prove this result here in the cases six and seven. Again, not quite an eight, but maybe a variation of these techniques. Now, again, as I said, since in general the space is so complicated. General, the space is so complicated. We would like to be able to describe the intersection theory of M-bar or Rn in all cases, sort of as the first example of the study of the sorts of intersection theory of KSBA compactifications. But since this is such a bad space, it's sort of It's sort of out of reach to do this in full generality. So, this might lead to some questions about how we could study this for all modules spaces of stable hyperplane arrangements. So I'll pose a couple of open questions here. So, the first is, since this has many components and the geometry can be very complicated, if we want to do intersection theory in general, Section theory in general, then we would probably need some sort of virtual fundamental class. Okay, so this is maybe related to Ginfang's talk on Tuesday, but maybe it's simpler than than than that because this this space is entirely combinatorial, so so you you could hope for an entirely sort of combinatorial construction. Combinatorial construction, at least. So that's the first thing that we would need to do. And then, second, you know, instead of trying to study the full chow ring, we could try to look at certain tautological classes and the tautological ring. And look at the intersections among the special classes. Sections among the special classes. So, here I'll mention a bit of work in the direction of this question, too. So, first of all, there's a natural higher-dimensional version of psi classes. So, you you you can so, you know, I go on that I uh erased my picture, which I shouldn't have erased. I shouldn't have erased. But uh I'll go back here and try to draw this picture again. We have a stable hyperplane arrangement like this. And you know, if you look and you restrict to like the ith line here. Restrict to like the ith line here, then you see in this case that you get a stable end-pointed curve. It turns out to always be true that you can restrict to stable end-pointed curves like this. And then these stable end-pointed curves have these sorts of natural side classes, which are the tangent lines to or the first churn classes of tangent bundles to. Term classes of tangent bundles to points on this curve. So like here I'm restricting to the ith line and maybe I get this jth point here from the intersection with the jth point. I draw the tangent line there. So I can get a psi class on the moduli space of stable hyperplane arrangements by pulling it back from the psi class on the m0 m1. On the M0 M1. So all this is just to say that I have a definition of some topological classes as the pullbacks of topological classes on M0 and what is the index from the left 10 and I ten thousand? Yeah, so let's see. So so here I is some subset of subset of 1 to n and it needs to have a cardinality of r minus 2 to ensure that when you restrict to the intersection of the boundary divisors that are indexed by i that you actually get a stable. And then I guess this little And then I guess this little i is just an uh element of half. So the right concept is psi j is psi hi. Oh yes, yes, that's psi half psi. Are there any other questions? Where am I going with with with with w with this? With with with w with this. So, you know, we have these sorts of top these sorts of topological classes, and we would like to describe the intersection numbers of these psi classes, which are I is a complement of capital I? I I is um let's let's see. So and and imagine you have not yet used. Not yet. Yes, yes. I I guess. Thanks. Okay. So what's the point of these classes? So the point is, you know, these these these psi classes on the moduli space of curves somehow govern the intersection numbers of of all the topological classes on All the topological classes on the modulized space of curves. So this is, you know, sort of the formula for the intersections of these psi classes on the MGN bar is this famous Wittens conjecture, which was proven by Konsevich. So the open question that I want to ask you, which is Ask you, which is sort of a sub-question of this open question, too: is, you know, what are the intersection numbers of these cyclasses? So I want a formula for the intersection numbers of these psychlasses. Psi classes on mbar Rf. Should be easier than written because gen is zero. Yes, it should be easier, right? So for M0 N bar, there's this nice formula, of course. Maybe write this as a fact. So for M0 N bar, look at psi 1 into the K1 up to Psi n to the Kn, and you get And you get this multinomial coefficient here. So you could hope that there's a nice sort of generalization to this, to m bar RLRM. That's all say progress in this direction. I've computed all the intersection numbers. of these psi classes in the first high-dimensional case, which is n-bar 33336. And it looks very random to me. I have not even been able to guess a formula from that. Presumably there there there there is one, but the combinatorics might be very common. The torus might be very colourful. Are there any other questions? Is that R36 irreducible? Yes, it's irreducible. Okay, so I hope. Okay, so I want to now try to explain the techniques for proving these sorts of facts that I've set about m bar Rn. So my claim is that all of these three things can be explained by tropical geometry. So So first of all, this modular interpretation, this is part one, has a sort of tropical interpretation for these moduli spaces. Part two, that in these first few cases, this is the log canonical compactification, also has a purely tropical explanation, and so does part of the temperature. Explanation, and so does part three: this presentation of the channel. So, to do this, I need to maybe introduce some definitions from chalkable geometry. So, the first is the notion of a troughable compactification due to Tevlet. So, the setup here I start with, you know, some closed sub-variety of a torus. Sub-variety of a tor. And then I it's it's somewhat natural to try to compactify this closed closed sub-variety by taking its closure in a toric variety. So I'll say that the closure of Y in some toric variety to X sigma is a tropical compactification. If first of all, I want why bar to me. Well, I want y bar to be proper, so that it's actually a compactification. And two, I want this multiplication map from y bar cross t to x sigma. I want this to be flat and surjective. Okay, so what's the point of this definition? Of this definition of the first point is, you know, this multiplication being flat and surjective. That being flat and surjective, what it means is y-bar intersects all of the torus orbits in x sigma. So, first of all, it has a non-trivial intersection with all the tortoise orbits. So, there's no extra information in this torque variety. And second, it intersects. And second, it intersects them in the expected dimension. And the sort of second great fact about these tropical compactifications is they're all described by fans which are supported on the same set. So they're all So they're all so if maybe y bar prime and x sigma prime is another tropical compactification. Then the support of sigma prime is the same as the support of sigma. And I'll define then this support to be Support to be the tropicalization of Y, which is not the way that people usually define the tropicalization, but it is the same if you take the support to mean the equivalence class of these fans up to common tropical refinement. Now I want to add to this definition. Now I want to add to this definition, so this still gives a somewhat broad class of compactifications. So we'll restrict it to what are called Shin tropical compactifications. So here, it's the same definition, but instead of requiring flat, I'll require that this is actually a smooth morphism. So, what smoothness gives you, or what a shim gives you, is if you look at the strata of a Shun tropical compactification, so this, this, you know, this point. This point of this part one here was that the stratification of x sigma as a torque variety pulls back to a sort of stratification of y bottom. Now to say it's shun says that this is a stratification by smooth varieties. So this So if y bar is a su compactification, then one you get toroidal singularities two. Two. So all the strata here, so the intersections with the torus orbits are smooth. And three. So here, in this tropical setting, I said any two tropical compactions. Any two tropical compactifications are defined by fans with the same support. But there could be fans with that support which don't give tropical compactifications because this first condition could fail. But this doesn't happen for a shin compactification. So any fan supported on the tropicalization So what's the point of all these definitions? The point is these are compactifications that admit sort of a purely combinatorial description. Description. And now the key that I want to focus on is a particular class of tropical compactifications. So this is tropical compactifications of complements of hyperplane arrangements. Well, you could phrase it like this. So what why? Trace it like this. So let y be a, I'll call it a linear variety, which means that it's a sub-variety of the torus, which is defined by linear equations. Then it turns out that y is shin, which means any of the Which means any of its tropical compactifications is shun. And if y-bar is one of these tropical compactifications, then, in fact, the showering of y bar is the same as the chowering of. Of y bar is the same as the chowdering of this torque variant. And more than that, these are also the same as the cohomology groups. So linear here means in C to the N. Like sort of linear in the, but it contains the torus? Yeah, so I guess you could view it as the intersection of a linear variety in C to the N with the torus. So I should say Kulus' theorem is. I should say who this theorem is due to. And I'm not really sure who to say because in this sort of field, this is sort of common knowledge. Just to clarify, the linear variety mean if you mean alpha, right? So what I mean is y is a closed sub-variety of a torus submit. I'll give an example. So, y is defined by some linear forms and Some Taurus. We need constants on Taurus. No constants on the right. Yeah, let's see. Constants are fine. So what you should think of here is why is the complement of a hyperplane arrangement? A hyperplane arrangement in Pn. So if you'll write this, Phi is the intersection of some pipelines. It's the complement. So the way that it works, so if you all Yeah, so let's let's say that I've got well. Four lines like this. So this is H1, H2, H3, and H4. They all get very explicit with this. So let's say H1 is where X is 0, H2 is where Y is 0. H3 says that Z is 0. And H4 by 0. And H4, let's say that this is x plus y plus z is zero. Something like this. So what's the embedding of the complement of this in a torus? So this Y embeds into a three-dimensional torus. So it's So it's, you know, I wrote this in a somewhat confusing way, perhaps. So the first three coordinates are these x, y, and z, which are with which are homogeneous coordinates. And then there's maybe this fourth coordinate, w, and y, y is just. is just defined by saying that w is x plus y plus z. And because w is non-vanishing, this just says that this fourth hyperplane is removed in y. This clear? I'll do more examples later. Later. So the point here is: think of y as a complement of a hyperplane arrangement. And then this sort of isomorphism between the showering of a tropical compactification of Y and the chowering of this ambient torque variety. So, this is a very powerful result. Maybe this was first written down explicitly by Andreas Gross, but really it can be traced back to the work of Katz and Payne and Katz and really this this observation This observation here that the cohomology of this toric variety is the same as the cohomology of Y-bar was the sort of initial observation which led to Jun-Ho's development of combinatorial Hodge theory, for which he recently won the Fields Medal. So this is an important result, but his work. But his work is sort of going from the left side to the right side. I'm interested in going from the right side to the left side. So trying to describe the chowrings of these compactifications using the chowrings of these toric varieties, which are very easy to describe. Okay, now I've left some space here before I wrote the word. I wrote the word linear, because I've generalized this to not just these sorts of linear varieties, but what I've called quasi-linear varieties, which are varieties which have all these same properties, so in this sense behave very close to linear varieties. So, I want to try to explain what a quasi-linear variety is. Before I do that, maybe I'll describe how this notion allows us to prove these facts that I stated for in bar already. First, how do I get one to three for this n bar zero n? So the observation here, and now maybe this is a more useful example of a linear variety, is that M0n is a linear variety. 0n is a linear variety. The way that it works, you know, you fix the first three points at 1, 0, 0, 1, and 1, 1. And then at the remaining points, you write as 1x1 and 1n minus 3. And the condition that no two points coincide says all the 2 by 2 minors of this matrix are non-valid. So this, this. So this, this, and it says that the m0n is the complement of a to the n minus 3 of xi is 0, xi is 1, and xi is x2. So then this gives this embedding of the M0 lin as As it's defined by equations, Zi is Xi minus 1, and Zij is Xi minus Xj in this big torus, which, if you count, has dimension n choose 2 minus n. Okay. So this is a linear variety, which tells us that tropical Which tells us that tropical compactifications are shin and have this description for their challenge for their shower group. And then we need to know that M0N bar is a tropical compacification of M0N. So this idea really gets back to Kapranov. Which is, you know, there's some torque variety, which I'll call x sigma 2n, such that m bar 0n is the closure of m0n in this torque variety. And in fact, this is a tropical compactification. So I guess this second part was not known to Capral. This part, I guess, is due to tetano effect. So because. So yeah, so maybe I'll yes, shun, shun, shin tropical compactification. So now shun is immediate because this is Is immediate because this is a linear variety, and the description of the Chao ring is immediate because it's a linear variety. So this implies both properties 2 and 3. So the presentation of the chowering of M0 and bar is just the same as the chowring of this torque variety, which is very easy to describe. And shun plus some more facts. More facts about this fan tell you that this M0 and bar is in fact logging on the quantification. Those parts two, two, and three are entirely described by this fact here that this is a tropical compactification. And maybe I'll say that one is described by this as well. So the way that it works, this toric variety, this fast. This toric variety, this fan here, is really like the moduli space of tropical rational curves. So it has a sort of tropical universal family. And you get a flat morphism of toric varieties, but the dimensions are way too big, but you pull that back, and you get the universal family for M0 and M1. Just say pull back a flat family like this. You get M0 N bar. And the universal family is M0 N plus 1 bar. And these are both sort of tropical compactifications in these toric directions. So that's one to three for M0 and all. If I remember correctly, at the beginning the N had to be, I mean, a very small set of numbers. So that was when R is 3. So that's for line arrangements. Maybe I wrote it somewhat confusingly. So I wrote when R is 2. When R is 2, or when R is 3 and N is 6, 7 points. So this is really two separate parts. So then, you know, maybe you could guess how 1 to 3 work for M bar R R N for these cases 6 and 7, which is. Which is instead of saying that this is a linear variety, it's a quasi-linear variety now. So maybe first of all, since I'm running low on time, I won't write how one works for n-bar RN, but it's the exact same construction. Now it's due to hacking queue and template. Left. You get this torque variety, take the closure of M bar RORN in this toric variety, or take the closure of MR. I'll just write it. So you get this torque variety, and it has a sort of tropical modular interpretation. And you take the closure of M. You take the closure of MRN in this torque variety and pull back the family here to get the universal family. Fancy this looks like the point here is just this same construction here works to get the main component of m bar R O R. M-bar R O R R A. That's where everyone? Yes. But what I should point out is this is not a tropical compactification unless R is two or R is three and N is six, seven, or eight. So what happens is just besides these cases, Just besides these cases, the closure here intersects torus orbits here in too high a dimension. So now the theorem is if r is two or r is three and n is six or seven, then Then MRN is a quasi-linear root variety. So then in these cases, this main component is a tropical compactification of a quasi-linear variety. So by this result here, it's shun, which Which with some details about the fan here implies that this is the law of canonical compactification. And we get this presentation of the showering of M bar Rn in these cases. So this implies parts two. So just to sort of illustrate this a bit, I'll maybe I should describe what the embedding of MRN in this force is. So to do the same trick that you did here, now maybe I'll stick to M3N because that's the only case that this actually covers. Case that this actually covers, and it's simpler to write. So I'll fix the first four lines like this. So the columns here are the coefficients of the equations of these lines. So I get coordinates like this. This realizes N3N as the complement of A to the two. To the 2 times the n minus 4 of a bunch of hypersurfaces, which are the 3 by 3 minors of this matrix, which describe when these lines are not in general position. So now you see, for instance, for 3, 6, Then, what we get, so we get the complement of x1 is 0, x2 is 0, y1 is 0, and y2 is 0, and then 1, and then we get x1 is X1 is X2, Y1 is Y2, X1 is Y1, X2 is Y2, and then X1Y2 is X2, Y1, and X1 minus 1 times Y2 minus 1 is X2 minus 1 times Y1 minus 1. I don't know if it was necessary for me to write all that out. But the point is: you know, observe, these first, however many equations are all linear. And there's these two guys which are not linear, but they sort of behave somewhat close to linear varieties. To linear varieties, once you remove these first type of surfaces here. So the idea behind quasi-linearity is a sort of inductive procedure which allows you to remove one hyper surface at a time, and if you're careful, you can sort of control what happens on the boundary when you remove another hyper surface. Then you remove another hyperspace. Maybe the second to last thing that I'll say is the reason that this doesn't work for n is equal to 8. I'll write a simpler example here. So in the two-dimensional torus, you look at these two kinds of total. These two guys, x equals y and xy is 1. The complement of these two things is not a quasi-linear variety. And the reason is what these are are two curves that meet at two points, and there's no way to distinguish these two points. So you get a stratum of your tropical. A stratum of your tropical compactification which captures both points at once, which sort of breaks the techniques of quasi-linearity unless you go to a generalization of tropical compactifications to replace this torque variety by a sort of torque-free variety where it's allowed to be non-separated so that you can double these sorts of cones there. comes there. So this is the same sort of problem that occurs for n is equal to 8. So it's work in progress to sort of fix that. And I guess now the final last thing that I'll mention is I told some people that I was going to discuss moduli of Mark Del Pezzo surfaces as well, which I also wrote in my abstract. And as you can see, I did not have time to do that. As you can see, I did not have time to do that. The point is, the exact same techniques work to get these exact same kinds of results for tropical compact applications of moduli of Mark Del Petsens. So if you're interested in that, ask me after the talk. But I have 35 seconds left, so I'll stop. Going back to MGRA, we know that there are many elementary GIT questions you want to use our market model asset with respect to arbitrary renewalization, if there is any. And from this collection we're working into, we can recover radical properties of MVRM. And the same picture works for hyperpolling arrangements. For hypercooling array once everyone. Is there any results that you can expect from the reduction of you? So are you asking for a connection between this and that perspective? Yeah, I don't know any connection. So I think most of those other compactifications are not tropical compactifications. Are not tropical impact locations. So these results don't exactly apply. There might be some connections, but I haven't thought about it. Yeah. Take the case of Mark Del Petzo in the Kubic case. Does this then answer the question before about the showering? Yeah, so you get a presentation of the showering of marked cubic surfaces, or the 27. Of the 27 lines. Yeah, of the Naruki space. Of Naruki, also with the one line. Okay, so I guess that answers. So then, if you take the file invariant sorry, that should answer the question. Or composal services. Just in general, or cubics? Yeah, so I'll say a couple of words about this. I was really hoping to. I was really hoping to just talk about those instead, but it got very complicated. Yeah, so you look at, I'll call it Y En. So this is the moduli of marked Del Pezzos. Of degree nine minus n. Now, I guess a result of Hacking Cube and Templar and also Daardo, Kir and Schaffler. And Schaffler is you you get some interesting compactifications of this space as tropical compactifications. So when n is less than or equal to 6, which really just means n is 5 and 6 because you don't have moduli the way that. Then you get the log canonical compact. Impactification and this this is the KSBA compactification for the minimal weight. And then you get the KSPA compactification for weight one as a certain blow-up of this space. space and these are both are both tropical compactifications and maybe this this this this first part also works for in seven so they're all tropical compactifications and I've proved that they're quasi-linear so you you you get these same these same results here YEN is quasi-linear It's quasilinear for n less than or equal to 7. So you get a presentation of the showering for both of these compactifications and any other tropical compactification. I was trying to do the case where n is equal to 8. I computed what the fan should look like. And then I tried to prove that it's quasi-linear and it's insanely complicated. And it's insanely complicated. You get like over 100,000 boundary devices, and it's. I can't figure out how to reasonably describe this travel. But maybe I'll figure it out. In principle, these same techniques should work up there. It's very messy. Other questions?
