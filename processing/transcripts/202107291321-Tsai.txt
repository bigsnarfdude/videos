The afternoon session with the talk from Pepin Chai. Pepin is a professor at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, and he has made a number of very important contributions to Navier-Stokes equations and also some very interesting works on the dynamics of non-linear shading equations, which I particularly like. Okay, so today Pepon will give us a talk on Taipan will give us a talk on the local regularity conditions on initial data for local energy solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much for the introduction. And also, I thank the organizers for the invitation. So my talk is about the local energy, local in space and time, regular conditions, unusual data, and then it's for local energy. And then it's for local energy sources. So, first, let me introduce my collaborators, Chongken Kang at Yongsei University, and Hideo Hideyuki Mura at Tokyo Tech. So this photo was taken several years ago. I wish you could update this in a few, maybe next year. And then my talk has two parts. The first part is on regular safe. The first part is on regular set. And the second part is on local smoothing. And this is the I've tried like you can find in the first website. Actually, the main thing is this local regularity condition. And that would be the like we discussed in part two. And part one is on a regular set, which is an application. And it's an extension of the series C and D of cabaret, Kong, and the Newmark. Number so, first part: regular set. So, so here we recall the Lafayette snow equations. So, this was already talked about by many speakers, especially Gregory Leisaur. And so, we do this in whole space and positive time. And then, these are some known results. So, first, for LO2 data, we have global entire. In our two data, we have global in-climb the red hot weak solution, and which satisfies global energy in quality. And we can make them to satisfy the local energy in quality. And then for U0, which higher regularity, there's a local in time strong solution. And this guy is locally bounded up to some time. And then the weak solution must agree with it before this strong solution. Before this translation ceased to exist, so this is the weak strong uniqueness mentioned by Gregory. And what are unknown is that the first is the uniqueness of the real hope weak solutions. So this is important because we talk about this later. We are talking about all possible solutions, not just one solution. And then the second unknown is the global in-time regularity or strong solutions. So yes. Yes. And then, so now I want to review the paper of Cavare Kong Newber, which was published in CPEN in 1982. So the main results are local regulatory criteria, propositions one and two. Proposition one is in terms of, I'm not sure, I think it's termed C and D of Gregory's talk. And proposition two is in terms of E. And then E and then a main consequence is on the partial regularity regarding the size of the hypothetical singular set. So we know this hypothetical singular set as S. And then the first result, serial A was done by Schweffer. He said that the five-third house of dimension household major of the singular set is finite. And then one-dimensional household major of the singular set at any given time is finite. And then on the spinite. And then serum P is a main main most famous result of CKN. It says that one-dimensional probability major of a singular set is zero. And then there are also series C and D, which are not as famous. So here is a series C. So this part is So this part is, I just took a screenshot from the original paper. CNC, it says that if U0 is L2, divergence free, and suppose 1.6 holes, 1.6 is this weighted integral being finite. And then there exists a weak solution in this set. And this set is this shortier region. So you can see. Straight region. So you can see what I have this straight region. And then the constant here depends on two norms and this weighted integral. And let's look at this weighted integral. We have x here. So this means that we have more decay at spatial infinity. So this finiteness gives us some control at the infinity. And therefore we can say, so at the infinity, we have a regularity. Will have a regularity for times later positive. And so, this is the original sentence in CKN: that this condition stipulates that you should decay sufficiently rapidly at impunity. And CL in D is the opposite. So, instead of times x, we now define U0 squared by X. X. So it says that there is a absolute constant L0, which should be small. And if this integral is small, it's smaller than L0. And then the solution should be regular inside this region. So you can see it's this region. And what this condition says is that because of this weight, so this solution is not too singular at the origin. At the origin. And the control at the infinity is weak. It's weaker than being in LO2. So this condition here gives us a control near the origin. So this ups it to 0 in C. So under this assumption, then we have a regularity in this middle region here. And then if you take L to 0, so this is a small upper bound. You take L to 0. more upper bound it equal to zero then this constant is at the at the at the most error zero so this this this this region cannot expand it has a finite limit that's error equal to zero and this this was improved by ankona and luca uh five years ago they say that if if an L goes to zero the regular set should inflate the entire space-time Inflate the entire space-time. So, this region actually can be the entire space-time. So, this is the improvement. This is the original CRM D. So, I want to consider this as a part of the discussion of regular set. So, the study of regular set is to identify space-time regions, like any solution of a given data. Of a given theta must be regular. So this is not the complement of the singular set. This is unfortunate terminology. But this says that it's where the solution must be regular. So this set, the idea is that this set should depend on U0 and the certain class. So we'll talk about a very hobby solution. So, we'll talk about the real home week solutions and local energy solutions. And sometimes we do consider something in between. But then, we don't want this set to depend on the choice of particular solution because we don't know uniqueness. So, any solution in this class should be regular in this set. So, the first such result was done in the Rue in his 1934 paper. We call this eventual We call this eventual irregularity. So there is a time and t depending on integral data, such that any direct hope weak solution with this data must be regular after this time. So for time module love, it is on it everywhere. And then we have the CKN, CRM, C and D. And this intention by I got phone call. I got phone calls, let's forget it. Ancona and the Luka. And then there's something called far-field lubricity. So which is that for X-dartial nerve, for any suitable weak weak solution, for X-dartial nerve, solution should be regular. So these discussions are all part of the discussion of regular set. So we also So we also want to consider a regular set of local energy solutions, which I will describe in the next slide. So for local energy solutions, the data is 9LO2, but it is in LO2 uniform local. So this LO2 uniform local norm is taken to be the soup over all possible center and then LO2 O1 center IX. So this discussion is useful for this discussion is useful because this was actually the first so this was useful in a study of forward cell simul solutions so for forward cell sim solutions u0 decays like this forward or u t is a three week and then the solution i if each every given time has the same bound so this does not fit into a lo2 framework so we we do this in so this was done in low for energy solution class. In local energy solution class. And this class, this study of a regular set is also useful for type 1 singularities. So that's the motivation. And then this slide, I briefly review what is local energy solution. So this was a pioneer trial by he used it. And then there were some further refinement by many mathematicians. And then here is the base idea. And then here is the basic idea. A pair UP is a local energy solution with theta in LO2 mean from local. Sigma means that value is free. If that this essential soup of the local energy over any radius R, center at X0, and then text soup over the center, this thing should be finite for any radius R and for any time T and then the the pair should solve Nafisto equations. The pair should solve Narkin's equations in distribution, and then it has a weak local LO2 continuity in time and strong local LO2 continuity at time zero. And then it has to satisfy the local energy inequality, so that is suitable. And then the P should satisfy pressure decomposition, which I discussed in the next slide. Pressure decomposition is always formed. Is always formed. So this is some integral in finite region along x0. This the region outside of this form, if we don't have this turn here and this turn is zero, then this is this is this formula we even usually get by solving the equation of the macro pressure in the whole space by this transform. space by this transform and this this thing this this additional this turn here independent of x uh formally corresponds to this uh constant in x function here but if they are not really equal when our data has slow decay and this time is 80 here so now we can estimate the pressure that u has very slow decay so so this is uh so this theory has But this is uh so this theory has been uh uh uh developed very uh actively actively in recent years. So uh so this is our extension of serial C and serine D for local energy solutions. So we now consider a local energy solution with data in LO2 uniform local and then what is actual Whole. And then, what is this actual assumption? This wage you know should be finite, and this alpha here is a real number. Alpha cannot be zero, otherwise this becomes a or two. This gives us no nothing new. So, alpha is not zero. And then we say that we prove that if alpha is positive, if alpha is positive, this gives us some control at the spatial infinity, then the solution should be regular in this strategy. should be regular in this straight-end region. So this is original, this is similar to original picture of serine D. Oh, I'm sorry. Where is it? It's similar to this picture, serine C. We have also the middle part. The middle part here corresponds to the Lewis essential Essential singularity, eventual singularity, eventual regularity. So, for alpha positive, we have this regular set. And then for alpha between mass one and zero, so now for alpha between mass one and zero, then we have better control near the origin. So, the solution will be regular near the So, the solution is irregular near the origin. And then, here we have this shredded region here, and this shading region here. So, here, alpha is negative, but not so big. And here, alpha is closer to mass one. And so you can see. I should mention that this border that this boundary curve here is x2 mass to alpha is the same in the previous picture. It's just that here, alpha is positive. is positive. Here alpha is negative. And finally, for alpha less than or equal to mass one, then u is regular in this region. Again, x2 mass to alpha is the quantum curve. And then when alpha equals to mass one, that corresponds to the original serine D of Cavari-Cohn number. And our region here. Our region here does not go all the way to the infinity because our data is only in L2. Uniform local, our data is not in L2. So we don't have much control at the spatial infinity. So we have to stop somewhere. And then this theorem is based on local delay criteria to be discussed in part two. So do any questions up to us here? Here. Okay, and now there's a related subject on eventual regularity. So we will not discuss this here, but I just mention. So we say that we have that the low energy solution is eventually regular. If this norm for intra data is small, so we take this scale of the norm. So this corresponds to LOS3, but we have 1 over R. And O3, but we have one over R over four R and O two norm. But then we have to take a soup over the center, but that will only require this to be true for large radius. So only large radius part is important. The small radius part corresponds to initial regularity. The large radius part corresponds to eventual regularity. And then another result is by gracial. Is by very short for Kafika myself. If this norm in the limit at large radius is zero, and then here we just take center to be the origin. But it's again one of our two norms over. So these are related discussions on regular set. So part two is on. So, part two is on the local smoothing. So, the problem on the local smoothing is the following. So, if U is a local energy solution, then we say it's defined R3 times 0, 1. And U0 info 2 is nice. It's visually nice. So, it looks really better than the rest of the space. So, we can clue that U is actually regular in 4, 1. Is actually regular in 4,1, so 41 is slightly smaller than 4,2 up to some finite time possible. But we usually expect that the UT, you know, infinity node of Ut in bow one should be bounded by time t to some negative power. This negative power could be one half and then it could be something else, depending on the initial regularity. So, this statement here is local in space and time. So, we do this only in 4.1, and our assumption is also only on 4.2. And then, our results also finite time. And then this T1 here, upper bound here, decreases if the L2 evolocal node of U0 becomes larger and larger. So, this is not the So this is not an older one. It could be very, very small. And we can also discuss this problem for suitable weak solutions in 4,210. In that case, we need to assume usual energy bounds on U at the pressure. So the previous result, the first one was done by Howe and Vatimir in 1904, and they did this for U0 in 1980. And they did this for U0 in log Q42 for Q greater than 3. So they did this to study the existence of forward self-service solutions. And then this result was extended in 20 by our group for UTO in O342, but small, and also by Barker and Pranjib for UTO in week LOS3 and small. In weak and also and small. So, this here is our new result. So, we now consider this squared integral here. This u0 squared, we integrate this in 4r and then we divide this pi by r by r to some power alpha. And then we text 2 over R, but our R is only up to 1. So this is local quantity. Our center here is 0. We only consider the origin. So it's not everywhere in space. All this is local quantity. So and this alpha here should be positive, should be greater than or equal to one. This alpha is actually a change sign from part one. I change the sign from part one. In part one, my alpha is not in a numerator. So here, in part two, it's more convenient to put that in a denominator. But this alpha sign is different. So we denote this quantity by n alpha. So when alpha equals to one, this quantity will be controlled by O3 norm in O1 by Hurdling. By hurting party. But it's also controlled by L3 with normal. So this is the extension. And then when alpha to 1, we need to assume smallness. So this corresponds to this smallness and this smallness here. When alpha to 1. So who assume this is finite? And then who can show that we have set? In Taiwan, In pi one, u is regular and has this control t to minus one height. This is usual decay rate for minus solutions. And then, but this time the borderline, the border surface of this pi y is 2 alpha, x to 2 alpha. So, this is the same as what we did in part one. There we have the active sign, but it's the same thing. And then if And then, if alpha between 1 is bigger than 1 or 4, and less than 4, then we have this alternative rate here. But then our region is paragraph. So, let me show you a picture first, and I'll come back to here. So, pi 1 is this part, pi 2 is this part. Hi2 is this part. So this figure here, we assume that T2 is bigger than T1. So, but actually, we don't know whether or not this is correct. So, it could be the other way. And then, the border line of pi 1 is x to 2 alpha. And border of pi 2 is x squared. But then the upper bound are different. Let's compare it to the statement here. So, see, alpha here may. So see, alpha here measures how good the solution should be near the origin. So the speaker alpha will have a stronger control. So when we talk about alpha bigger than y, we are assuming something bigger, more control for alpha. So that's why we have something different. And you can see here, see here that the alpha here, T to power alpha minus 3 over 4, this actually Based three over four, this actually becomes a positive base point if alpha is three or higher. So it's actually bounding. But of course, we are assuming about at the origin. So I think, I hope this is reasonable. So we assume more, we get beta stuff. But then our alpha, this is only up to four. I think for alpha too large, this thing does not really. This thing does not really give us much. Okay, so we need to maybe subtract some average to get something meaningful. So, this is a statement of the theorem. And again, this quantity here would do integrals only with center at the origin. We don't have any other control outside the origin. However, if this is finite, then it should be finite for center, not so far away from the origin. Not so far away from the origin. So this can be extended to the neighborhood slightly. So here are a few comments. So first, alpha equal to one corresponds to LO3 and LO3 week. It's implied. So this extends the previous result. And second, UTR in LO3 in the final. UTL in LO3 in a finite ball, this thing is useful for spatial local study of type 1 singularity. This was used by Barker and Prunch in a recent paper. It's a quantitative study of solutions which are infinity, L3 in space. And so extending the work of Kerry Tau. So Kerry Tau did something which is global in space, and then Parker and Brune was able to localize this in space. So this, I think, is very good use of this. And the third is that UCL in scale L2 known, this was essential. Was essential for our study of regular set, which I presented in part one. Because you only have results for L3 or LO3 week, then those assumptions of Cavari communicate, those are weighted and too long, will not be able to be applied. So we really need to use a new revised project to do to study regular set. And then also, my assumption here, I've stated here. My assumption here, I've studied here for low energy solutions, is actually true for suitable weak solutions if alpha is equal to one. But when alpha is greater than one, we don't know yet. So here's a comment I said, a similar serial holds for alpha equal to one. We are still working on alpha greater than one case. We don't know whether or not this is essential. We have some difficulty, but we are trying to. But we are trying to remove it. So, here are a few comments about being a local energy solution. So, first, this is natural because we have existence theorem. And second, this gives us a point bounce on velocity and pressure. And third, it is more flexible than suitable weak solutions. Because for suitable weak solutions, we usually only assume that the pressure is. only assume that the pressure is also high and but for local energy solutions we have a range of bonds of this form coming from the energy bond of the product which we can be we can assume so this is some this somehow uh more flexible okay another uh idea of proof is actually very short Proof is actually very short. So, the idea proof is based on a prior estimate for this scaled local energy. So, in this scale of local energy, we are computing energy in four of radius R, center at origin. The same here. So, this is local energy up to some time p and then but then we evaluating by one over r to Up to power alpha. I don't want to estimate this guy locally in time, up to some time P T T1. And then what we do is that we take the soup. This is script E R. This is the soup of this thing here. For low between R up to one. And then we do energy estimate. And then we do energy estimate. And we do energy estimate. And what we want is that for a short time, the information from Introductor is preserved. So we want this guy, here by its initial value. And then for this thing here, most of our control outside. Our control outside is very weak. So, our time is very short. Our time is decided by the available approach. So, it's not very much. So, this is the time is not all the one. It's small. It constrains to zero if we globally, the solution is going to infinity. The small, it's not enough if the global body is going to infinity. But we are able to estimate the. We are able to estimate this script E for some short time. Once of this, as I said earlier, this thing can be perturbed slightly. So we are able to prove that for center x0, less than 1,5, and for radius r, depending on the center, this scaled norm. So now this is scaling according to parabolic syndrome. according to parabolic single one over r squared r squared center at x0 missing here u cube and the pressure mass some constant in space so you have no is smaller than epsilon a small number of capari polynomial once we have this we get regularity at the point x0 r square so so the the whole purpose is that one So the the whole purpose is that want to on this guy uh want to bound this guy for sh short time. And then once you've left, we prove this. Okay, uh uh some comments of all of you? Some comments about the proof. I think this proof is pretty direct. So, first, we don't need to decompose a solution. In the previous proof, usually we can decompose a solution. The first guy is the local part. Local part is maybe small, and then we cut off the outside, and then we do this small mouse solution. And then for outside, we do some weak solution for localized for. For localized perturbed equation, and then we say the sum is controlled. So, in this proof, we don't need both solutions. And second, we don't need to do induction estimate that's in Kabari Khon number. And third, we don't need to do contradictory argument that's in confiding. This argument was used in our first project in this problem. But then this estimate here is pretty direct. This estimate here is pretty direct. We just want to control this, but because we take this soup, so I think the induction argument is hidden in this soup here. So we are doing this. So that's my intuition. Of course, I cannot make this concrete. But I think induction is hidden in this soup here. So we already mentioned one application on regular set. So I want to mention two more applications. So the set application is on the energy concentration at the singularity. So so assume we have local energy solution. Let's assume that it has a first singularity. That it has a first singularity at the origin at time capital p and then we assume that this solution is type 1 in this sense. So it will take this boundary type 1 over r u squared integrated over 4 r and then take sup in origin take suit of radius small radius and take suit of time t The text shape of time t smaller than capital T and if this thing is finite, we call this type one is different from Rigor's definition. This definition here is global. This definition here is global in space-time. His definition is local at the nice thing local. So, what should be finite? Then we have some constant, such as I. Constant such that the integral over all syntax at zero and radius here is shrinking, is constant times square root of t minus t. And then outside is one over this radius. And this norm here should be bigger than some small constant. And this is true for all time t slightly less than capital T. So, this is this earlier result of the Otawa and Wong, and the latter result of Parker and Prunch. So, I think this results there, the center is not fixed, it's a function of time. That's why I measure. But this is there are many such results, actually. Many such results, actually. For example, the most recent result of Falcon Planch, they have some log T minus T here, but then they had to improve this, they had to make this radius slightly larger. And then they can get the log T minus T to some power here. But that does not imply this because our radius here is constant times. This radius here is fixed. So this is a one application of our. One application of our result. And the third application is about short-time regularity. So this is this extension of the original paper of G.S. Burke and Barker and Prunch. So I think the original paper here shows some bound like this, but it's not quantified. And Barker and Pranch quantified their estimate for Q equal to 6. For q equal to 6. So here is for all q. So let's look at the statement. If u is a local energy solution using your data, LO2, u form local, then u0 is in OQ. Then choose any number bigger than 3. And then some time t such that the alloy field norm of u is bounded by t to minus 3 over 2q. So this is the same as the original paper. This is the same as the original paper, I suppose. But then what is new here is this explicit formula or the concept here. So this explicit formula or concept will be important. I want to do some quantitative estimate. Okay, and that's it. Thank you for your attention. Okay. Okay, thank you for the very interesting talk. Sorry, let me stop the recording first.
