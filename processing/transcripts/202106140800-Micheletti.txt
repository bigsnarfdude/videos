Okay, yes. So, first of all, of course, it's a great pleasure to be virtually all together for this birth workshop. And I would really like to thank the organizers, Carmel, Marielle, and Eleni. I'm sure this must have been a huge effort on top of what normally would have been. So, I'm very grateful for this opportunity to get in touch again with the community. Very grateful. Thank you. So, what I will present today is some work that has been going on in our group and also with collaboration. In our group and also with collaborators for a number of years, where we started to look at how confinement, spatial confinement in particular, affects entanglement properties of molecules. And we have been looking at it both from the point of view of intramolecular entanglement, that is NOTS, and more lately for intermolecular entanglement, that is links. I will first try to provide a physical background for the problem. All of you, of course, are familiar with polymer physics. Maybe some of you are not familiar. Of you are not too familiar with the declination of polymer physics for spatial confinement. So, I will try to recall what are the seminal fundamental results regarding the metric properties of polymers in confinement. And then I'll move on from there and see to what else confinement can do beyond the metrics, and in particular, how it can affect the entanglement properties of chains. So, a good way to introduce the problem. Way to introduce the problem is by recalling the seminar results of Dejain that he obtained at the end of the 70s, beginning of the 80s, where he introduced a very powerful concept that is still used nowadays, that is the blob picture concepts to rationalize how polymers, linear or circular, respond when they are subject to confinement. He and later work were mostly concerned with one-dimensional and two-dimensional confinement. Dimensional and two-dimensional confinement, that is, channel and slit confinement, for various reasons. They are amenable to analytical calculation to some extent, as I will discuss in a second, to numerical ones, and especially they are also amenable to experiments, because with nanofluidic devices, it is relatively nowadays doable or straightforward to confine polymers in one-dimensional or two-dimensional space. The concept introduced by the Concept introduced by Deschain is that a powerful way to look and characterize the metric properties is by assuming that when you confine your polymer in a slit or in a channel, what happens is that the problem organizes in blobs. Within each blob, the chain, the metric properties of the chains are the same as in bulk. So essentially what confinement does is to just fix the scale of these blobs and inside the behavior is the same one that you have in bulk. In particular, you have the same. That you have in batch, in particular, you have the same metric exponent, and so from there, you can work out what happens if you just scale up the size of the chain and you can describe what happens to the extension of the chain. Because if you scale up the chain, you are not affecting the size of the blobs that is dictated by your confinement, but you're just affecting the number of blobs that you have. And according to whether the blobs only have a chance to develop in one dimension, one after the other in a channel, or occupy a two-dimensional space. Occupy a two-dimensional space, you can come up with a prediction of what is the, let's say, longitudinal imprint of the chain in the space that is available. So in particular, just to give you a quantitative result, if you apply this theory for channels, and that is valid, of course, in a range of channel widths. So let's say that the channel width should be smaller than the gyration radius of the chain, otherwise, the chain does not feel the effect. Chain does not feel the effect of confinement. At the same time, it should also be larger than the persistent strength of the chain, so that the chain has the chance to do a little bit of movement around and decorations in your slit. So if that is the case, then the extension should scale like the power of your width of your channel D to the power two-thirds, inverse power of that. So that tells you how it increases. So this has been very So, this has been verified. Of course, the phenomenology can be even more complicated if you factor in other properties, the competition with the persistence length, the thickness of the chain. But a fundamental question remains, if you just describe the metric properties, what are the implications of confinement for nothing of chains? You can discuss knotting in various contexts. Many of you are familiar, of course, with the proper noting that you have. Nothing that you have to deal with when you have circular chains, and you just sample what is called the topologically unrestricted ensemble. You do that with Monte Carlo moves, so your end and final configurations of your Monte Carlo move have to respect self-avoidance, but the Monte Carlo move in between double double pivot crunchup moves cannot respect uh can cross the chain and therefore can sample unre topology in an unrestricted way. Topology in unrestricted ways. You can also sample knot and configuration in linear chains. In this case, you don't have proper topological knots, but you can speak of physical knots. And many of you are actively working in how to extend the concept to those systems too. Regardless of what you consider, circular chains or linear chains, you have that in bulk, you have a certain finite probability of your chains to be noted. And we know that this probability approaches one as you make the chains longer and longer. At the same time, Longer and longer. At the same time, whether you are considering very extreme two-dimensional or one-dimensional confinement, you are leaving no room for crossings, and therefore, for extreme one-dimensional or two-dimensional confinements, you are bound to have no knots. So the question is, how do you go from one limit to the other? How do you go from bulk where you have notes to the case of extreme tight slit or channels where you have no knots? And so we looked at the problem. First of all, we Other problem. First of all, we started with the slit confinement and we just characterized the metric properties of the chains. So, in the example that you see here, you see as a function of the width of your slit, D, you see what happens to the metric properties of the chains. The metric properties you can subdivide into the longitudinal span, the red curve, that is the average radius of gyration, two dimensions. Radius of gyration, two-dimensional, projected in the plane that is unrestricted, and the component, the perpendicular one, so in the restricted component. You see that when the channel width is very large, essentially the chain does not feel confinement very much and retains about the bulk size. Here, the difference you see from longitudinal to perpendicular is due to the fact that you have two unrestricted directions and only one restricted one. Restricted one. But as you make the slit width narrower, eventually the chain is going to feel confinement and the perpendicular size decreases linearly, of course, because it just has to follow the decreasing width of the slit. And so you have this competition between the decreasing size of perpendicular confinement and the increasing spread out in the longitudinal space. So how does that reverberate on the noting properties? This is the result that took us by surprise when we That took us by surprise when we first saw it. You go from the bulk level of nothing to the zero notting probability, not in a monotonic way, as was our naive expectation, but instead you go non-monotonically. You can see that there is an optimal value of your slit width that maximally boosts or enhances the knotting probability of your rings, which can be several times larger than the one that you have in bulk. You see that a different In bulk, you see that at different total contour lengths of the chain, you typically have an increase of a factor of two or three, which is really sizable. So, exactly what happens at this special width is still not clear. And so, I don't have a quantitative explanation or let's say prediction to identify the magic width that gives you the maximum of not improbability. But I can give you a qualitative, hand-waving argument for why this is happening and at least. For why this is happening, and at least it gives you a value of D that is more or less in the correct ballpark. And maybe there is room for some of you to improve that. You can figure out what is going on by looking more closely at this metric plot that I've discussed here. So as I mentioned, there is one direction, the perpendicular one, where the size is decreasing and the other two where it is increasing. So if you take the combination. So, if you take the combination of the two, the sum of the two, to compute the overall radius of gyration of the chain, due to these two competing regimes, you can discern that there is a dip in the radius of gyration, which is the black curve. And so the radius of gyration has a minimum at a finite value of d, which is about here. This is more evident if you consider the radius of gyration and you rescale it by the bulk value, so you can see what is going on on a relative scale, and you can. On a relative scale, and you can see that when the width of the channel of the slit is about comparable to the radius of gyration in bulk, you have a minimum, and which means that at that particular width of the slit, you have a maximum density of the polymer. And of course, being more dense in a loose way brings about more self-entanglement. This is, I think, satisfactory just as a way to remember what happens. What is a little bit unsatisfactory? What is a little bit unsatisfactory is that there is a mismatch and not a small one between the width at which you have the maximum compression, let's say the minimum radius of geration, and the maximum enhancement of the not improbability, as you can see. So the vertical lines mark the location of the two extremal points and they do not coincide. So here there is room for some of you that have an intuition into how to get a better insight. There is room of Get a better insight, there is room, of course, for work to be done. The next question that you may be interested to ask is: apart from the overall knotting probability, what is happening to the spectrum of notes that you generate? And here is for one particular choice of chain length. This is the knot spectrum. For the chain lengths that we can address numerically, we could address at the time numerically, the dominant node is the simplest one. This is the trephoid. But you can see that as confinement increases, you That as confinement increases, you start to populate more and more certain classes of notes, in particular twist nodes, are more abundantly populated. And interestingly, you see that also composing notes, trefold plus trefold, which is this gray band here, start to be sizably occupied while they are practically negligibly present in bulk. And I will tell you more about that when we move to channel confinement, where the effect is even more. Confinement where the effect is even more pronounced. For channel confinement, for the sake of time, I just keep this scaling here. You can repeat the analysis. And here, from the metric point of view, you have again the same competition between what happens in the restricted direction and the unrestricted ones, except that now dimensionality comes into play in a different way. You have two directions where space is restricted. That's where space is restricted, and only one longitudinal where the chain can expand. And so, as a result of this, you can see that the dip in the black curve, which is the radius of gyration, is now more pronounced compared to the slit case, which is the dashed black line for comparison. So, you expect in this case, since the confinement is more pronounced in this case, you expect to see a bigger effect in enhancement of notting probability. Of knotting probability. And so, and so it is. You can see that compared to the bulk level, now you can really increase by an order of magnitude the abundance of knots compared to what you have in bulk. So, confinement gives you a very powerful, and when we were first looking into the problem, unexpected way, to maximize the noting probability, because you don't bridge monotonically between the bulk and the fully confined regime. Here, Here, I just presented results for the linear chains, but the same results, of course, apply except from slightly different amplitude coefficient from for circular chains. So, for the few of you that may not be familiar, the way that we detect the knots in linear chains is by using what we call the minimal invasive or minimally interfering closure scheme. And so, in brief, what we do is we consider an open chain and then we take the Chain, and then we take the convex hull of the chain, and then we consider two possible closures. You prolong the termini at the nearest points on the hull, and otherwise you bridge the termini directly. And which of the two situations gives you the shortest total segment that you need to add in order to close the chain? You pick to define the proper topological state of the chain. So, this is how we detect the knots, but not only that, this is a way. Only that, this is a way that allows you to search for the knotted region in open or closed chains too, because once that you have the chance to assign a topology to an open curve, you can use that to check where exactly, even in a closed ring, the NOT resides by taking all possible combinatorics and looking for the shorter segments that, once closed, gives you the same topology of the full ring. And here, in channel confinement, perhaps you see even more dramatically. In channel confinement, perhaps you see even more dramatically than what you saw in slits, the fact that as you increase confinement, you can really boost the incidence of composite knots. Here, you just see the presence of trephole nodes. It's the second black curve. The one dominating at the top is the trephole node, but the one coming from below and surpassing all the others, almost all the others, is the trephole-trefel node. And if you look Trifle node. And if you look at the configurations that these composite trifle nodes have, they appear like you see in the screen here. They are not merged together, but the prime component tend to be separated or segregated. And so this gave us the idea to make an answer to say that maybe you can understand the occurrence probability of two trifles or three trifles and so on as a sort of. As a sort of Poissonian statistical event where you have a certain small probability per unit chain length to observe a trephoil. And so, in a given chain length, if you make this assumption, you can compute what is the expected probability to see only one tre-foil, two tre-foils, three tre-foils, no trifolds, for example. And then all these probabilities should not be independent of each other, but knowing one should allow you to pin all the others. And you can see that this. And you can see that this works particularly well. I think it works only for channel confinement because I don't expect these to work in bulk, where the two components can actually merge. But in confinement, they need to spread, they sort of entropically repel each other, they need to spread out. And so here, what you see is a plot where we plot the occurrence probability of one trephole or two co-trefold, one after the other, or three, as a function of a master. Function of a master index that is the probability of observing no trade fault whatsoever, and the continuous curves are the theoretical predictions. And all the other dots are dots that come from our simulations, all the different types of confinement that we had. And you see that the points really fall very nicely on this curve. So that tells you that this sort of Poissonian factorization of prime components work well. And maybe, so this could be up for discussion. Maybe. Be up for discussion. Maybe this is a useful way also to understand how complexity of other knots can come about, because maybe this factorization can extend, let's say, to essential crossings, not only one particular topology, but also to the individual topological constraints that contribute and add towards that. By using molecular dynamics, we then looked at what is the evolution of the dynamical evolution. Of the dynamical evolution of the system. We didn't do that with Monte Carlo because Monte Carlo can introduce some unphysical moves that have no intuitive correspondence to an actual dynamics. Therefore, we used molecular dynamics. And here, I just want to give an overall flavor of what is going on. You see, as a function of time in the upper plot, you can see what happens to the size of the chain that is confined in the channel. You see the size of the chain characterized in two different ways. Size of the chain characterized in two different ways: the end-to-end distance that is shown in red, so that tells you the two termini of these open chains, how they can be far apart, or they can approach each other. And the red curve instead is the gyration radius. So, you see that during time, if you sample enough, you see that there is a very strong temporal modulation of the size. And the gray bands that you see superimposed, they correspond to time intervals where the chain is knotted. The chain is knotted, and when you don't see a gray band, it means that the chain is unknotted. So, you can see that there is a lot of knotting and unknotting dynamics that is going on due to physical moves. So, these are not Monte Carlo moves. This is the chain backfolding on itself, forming a loop, threading the loop, forming a knot, and then the knot can travel stochastically along the chain. You can introduce further entanglement in the chain. It can dissipate, it can go out, and this is shown in the second. Is shown in the second row where, for the most significant events, so the longest gray bands that you see in the upper plot, you can actually see where exactly in the chain the knot is and what type of knot is that is color-coded. And so you typically see that the knot appears from one end of the chain, it can travel to the other end or it can die out from the same end, possibly after the introduction of additional entanglement. You see that the color can change, you know, so these are all. Color can change, and also these are all knotting and unknotting events where additional entanglement is introduced through the chain ends. And maybe the thing that I can add is that, of course, notting in bulk is interesting and probably it's the most fundamental thing. And of course, you can look, and we have been looking at spontaneous knotting in bulk, but the simplicity of understanding what goes on in channels is unsurpassed, just because you can only have events that are nucleated. Events that are nucleated essentially at the end and therefore are much easier to track. And even with this, the complexity of the possible changes of topology and frequency that you can have is quite complicated, as you see in the diagram of the possible knots that can dynamics can take you through. I would like to conclude the overview of the channel dynamics before moving very briefly. I think I have just Very briefly, I think I have just two or three more slides on the case of links by mentioning one possible application. So, the use of channel confinement, not just as a way to profile what happens to entanglement, but maybe one practical way of using it for practical purposes, and in particular for what we call the topological sorting of polymers. So, this idea was inspired by some very nice work, experimental work carried out by Bob Austin. Work carried out by Bob Austin and co-workers, where they used nano-channels to separate DNA molecules according to topology. And in that case, in their case, the topology were linear versus circular. They were putting the molecules in a mixture at the end of the channels. And at the other end, when they were collecting it, they were time separated. The linear were coming before the circular, or vice versa. So we were wondering, can you accomplish? We were wondering, can you accomplish the same with knots? Can you separate different node types if you wish, similarly to what you do with gel electrophoresis? But here we don't want to use electric fields. And so we thought that maybe what one could harness is, let's say, is a modulated channel that, having constrictions, could introduce some entropic hurdles. You have some small sections that might be easier to pass through for. Might be easier to pass through for knots with certain topology, more difficult for others. And therefore, we consider these hourglass-shaped periodic modulations of channels. We put one knotted chain inside. The size of the chamber is about the radius of gyration of the chain. So you see the stochastic motion is that the polymers stay in the chamber a little bit and then they hop to a nearby chamber and they do this stochastically. So on the long scale, you have a stochastic one-dimensional walk. And so if you And so, if you put different topologies in the chamber, you see that indeed different node types are able to translocate and pass through the pore with different hindrances, and they end up with having different overall one-dimensional mobilities. So, at least in principle, this possibly can be a way that allows you maybe to separate at least knots from unknots, possibly with polymers that do not have charge. Charge and therefore, on which you could not be able to use electrophoresis. I'm running out of time, so I very briefly, in one slide, I will try to give you a flavor for what we have been doing on links, which is the next, of course, and most interesting avenue looking at intermolecular entanglement. So, we have been looking at what happens to off-links, the simplest type of links. So, two polymers in a off-link topology confined in a channel. Confined in a channel. And we have been looking at the equivalent of the knotted region, but we call it the physically linked region. What happens to the size of the physically linked region as you squeeze the channel? What we saw is that as you decrease the channel width, the length of the width of the linked region decreases with a power of the channel width, and the power is very close to 0.5. So the length of the width is the width of the 0.5. So the length of the linked region decreases with the square root of the size of the channel. And without getting into details, because if somebody is interested, we could do it during the work groups. But there is an heuristic scaling argument. It's not exact, it's heuristic that allows us to rationalize why this is happening, harnessing the concepts of blobs that I mentioned at the beginning. And now, as an extension of that, we are looking at the kinetics, and on these, I can briefly. Kinetics, and on these I can briefly do more informally during the working groups. So, this was my last slides. So, in the interest of leaving some time for discussions, I will not read the summary because you probably will be quicker just reading it by eye. And here are the acknowledgments to the people that have been involved in the work so far. And especially a big thanks to Enso Landini, many of you know him, with whom this work has been going on all these years. And thank you very much for your attention. And thank you very much for your attention. Well, thank you very much for this wonderful talk. It's very hard to clap, but so let's pass to questions, please. You can ask questions, for example, through the chat, or you just go ahead. So I have a question. Have you? Question. Have you examined whether just changing the temperature that can cause any changes in entanglement in tightening of knots or links? No, no, we haven't. So in our models, we typically have excluded volume interactions and bending rigidities only. So whether you consider, so the way that we consider bending rigidity is by assuming. Bending rigidities by assuming by fixing the persistence length of the chains. And so steric interactions are essentially hardcore interactions, so temperature will not be able to affect that. And if you put in a persistence length, temperature will not allow you to modify that, essentially. But in more realistic models, I think this could be relevant because somehow you would imagine that you can introduce a weak self- That you can introduce a weak self-attraction of the chain, and that brings in an energy scale, and therefore the temperature will be able to couple to that. And we have not looked at that. Thank you. Andrew, please. You had a question, right? Yes, please go ahead. Hi, Christian. This is very, very nice work. I'm just wondering how you define linked region in your work. Okay, yeah, yes. I've not explained it. I've not explained it at all. So let me let me share. Okay. Do you see the slide again? Yes, yes. Yeah, okay. So we define it using the concepts of that we call physical links. So imagine to have open curves that are physically linked, but they are open. This is what you will use to Are open. This is what you will use to search for the linked region in closed rings, for example. So you need to have a scheme like when searching for physical knots that allows you to close your chains and establish their topological entanglement. So our way of doing it, I know that there are other efforts and also Eleni has been working on that, our way of doing it is by prolonging each chain, the termini of each chain, away from the center of mass of the partner chain and then closing at infinity. Partner chain and then closing at infinity, and that gives you a simple, systematic way of doing the closure. And as you can see in this example, if you do the closure, you would be able to tell apart the first case where there is physical entanglement from the second one where the two rings are not entangled. And then, when we looked for the leaked region, what we do is we explore all the possible combinatorics of pieces, cuts, excerpts from the Cuts, excerpts from the two rings. And by closing each of the possible choices, we identify the shorter segments, one from one ring, one from the other, that once closed gives you the of topology in this case. This is one way, of course. I know that it's an active subject of research. More questions, please. Can I ask a question? This is Rajif. Hi. Hi. Nice talk. So my question is about the length scale of this linked region. So in the bulk, radius of gyration is one length scale, right? But when you create a half-link, then of course the size of that link is supposed to somehow depend on the tension which you put in, right? The tightness of. Which you put in, right? The tightness of the whole two segments of what you're linking. So, is there any relation you can point out to? How do you, for example, can modulate the length of like basically I'm asking where do you get that exponent of 0.36 and about? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, yes, sure. So, again, I'm sharing again. So, let me show it here. Let me show it here. Your question, in fact, is what was the question in the back of our minds when we looked at the problem. Many of you, you surely are familiar with the very nice work of SAC-June on the segregation of chains in confinement in channels. It is known that if you put two polymers, let's say linear chains unlinked or rings that are unlinked, and you put That are unlinked, and you put them together. So, he was considering that, let's say, for bacterial cells with the replicated DNAs, then the two chains do not want to mix and they separate from each other spontaneously. It's an entropic force. And the longer the chains, the stronger the force. So, what we were expecting is that by confining in channels chains in the off-link topology that are longer and longer, we were expecting to see this entropic pulling on the link. This entropic pulling on the linked region and the linked region to become tighter and tighter and tighter. We didn't see that happening. As you can see in the plot here, for the chain length that we could address, they are all on the same curve apart from finite size effects. And so this connects with the exponent. How do you explain this behavior? How do you explain this exponent? So we explained it in the following way. It's an answer. We explained, look, maybe we can rationalize of this if we assume. Of this, if we assume that the linked region is sequestered in the two blobs that are adjacent, one from each ring. So there are two compenetrating blocks, blobs at the interface. And so when I increase the size of the chains, I'm just making the blobs more numerous, but I'm not affecting the properties of the blobs, including those that are the interface, that are interpenetrating each other. And so now each blob behaves like a chain. Each blob behaves like a chain in bulk, as I mentioned at the beginning. So, if you take into account how the knotted linked portion scales in bulk, which we knew from previous work, and take into account how the blob scales with D, then you can come up with a prediction that is 0.48. So it's very close to the square root that we see numerically. So, this is how we tie everything together. Thank you very much. Thank you. Let's pass to the next talk. Let's pass to the next talk. Thank you. That's been next. Thank you. I hope to ask you more questions later, but now let's move on.
