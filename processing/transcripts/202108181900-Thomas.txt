Anne Thomas from the University of Sydney, and she will talk about fixed points for group actions on two-dimensional buildings. Please go ahead, Anne. Thank you for the introduction, Stefan, and thank you for everyone who's attending, especially those who are not in Australia or New Zealand. And thank you very much to the organisers for the invitation to speak. It's been a very interesting week so far. So, right. Right, so this is joint work with Joran Shilvart, who is also in the audience, and Coen Stroiver. And as many of you know, my background is in geometric group theory, and their background is more in finite geometry, spherical buildings, this kind of thing. So, the talk is going to be a mixture of techniques from these two different areas. A very broad overview is that we'll start out talking about group. Is that we'll start out talking about group actions on trees. Many people have talked about group actions on trees this week. I'll then move to the setting of affine buildings and I will include most of a definition of affine buildings for people who aren't familiar with them. And then at the end, say something about the proof. So starting point is a result of Sayers from his book on trees. And we have a finitely generated group acting on a tree without inversions. On a tree without inversion. So, this just means that no edge gets flipped onto itself. You can remove that assumption by just subdividing edges. And the statement is: if every element of the group, G, fixes a point of the tree, then there's a point in the tree which is fixed by the entire group. So this condition that every element of the group fixes a point is the same thing as saying that every element of the group is elliptic. An elliptic isometry is an isometry that has at least one fixed point. Point and so another way of saying this hypothesis is that the group action is locally elliptic, and then the conclusion is that it has a global fixed point. So, this is a local to global theorem. You have some local condition that individual elements fix points in the tree, and the conclusion is that the entire group must fix a point as well. I'll show you the proof of this. So this is Sarah's proof from his book on trees. So, the key result is the following glimmer. Result is the following glamour. So, suppose a group element fixes a point in the tree. And so, what this means is I'm just going to draw it as a blob. So, this is the fixed set of the group element G. Now, this fixed set is actually going to be a sub-tree. That's not difficult to show. And I have some point P which is not fixed. So, P is outside the fixed set. So, G of P is somewhere else. And the claim is that the group element little g fixes the midpoint of the G. G fixes the midpoint of the GDZIC going from P to GP. Well, let's do some constructions. Now, this fixed set TG is a subtree, so there's a unique shortest path from P to this subtree. Okay, let's call this point where it hits Q. And there's also going to be a unique shortest path from GP to the fixed set. And I've drawn this also going to Q because Also going to Q because if there was a point, sorry, what I should say is this geodesic, the shortest path from P to Q, intersects the geodesic from GP to Q only at Q. If they intersected at some earlier point, then this point Q would not be the closest point in the fixed set to P. So what we have is the shortest path from P to the fixed set, shortest path from GP to the fixed set. Now, Q is Set. Now Q is halfway along, okay, because Q is fixed by G, Q equals G Q. So what this isometry is doing is taking P to G P, it takes this geodesic to this geodesic, and it fixes this point Q, which is halfway along. And there can't be any shorter path from P to G P. This is actually a geodesic from P to G P because we're in a tree. Okay, if there was some other shorter path. Other, if there was some other shorter path, you would get a cycle and it would not be a tree anymore. So, this is proving this lemma here. And then I leave as an exercise then. So, using this lemma, it's enough to prove this theorem to consider a group which is generated by two subsets, each of them finitely generated. So, you induct on how many generators you have. And you assume that the fixed set of the subgroup A and the fixed set of the subgroup B. And the fixed set of the subgroup B, and the fixed set of the group elements AIBJ are all non-empty. And then you prove that the entire group has a non-empty fixed set. So this theorem here, I'm just same theorem again. So this tree here is a simplicial tree. So the vertices are a discrete set in the tree. Subsequently, Morgan and Shalin extended this result to R trees. This result to R trees. So, an R tree is a tree where the vertices can be a non-discrete set. So, a simple example is if you take a horizontal line and then you put every vertical line on it. Okay, so that's a very rough sketch, but that's an example of an R tree. And so the Morgan and Shalom result says if I have a finitely generated group acting on an R tree, then every and every element of the group fixes a point in the R tree. Of the group fixes a point in the R tree, then the group has a global fixed point. And their proof is essentially the same as SAS proof once you prove the properties of trees upon which that proof relied. So things like fixed sets, sub-trees, and you have unique geodesics and things like this. Okay, so that's going from the discrete setting or simplicial setting to the R-tree setting. Now, you might be wondering about this hypothesis of finite generation, and it turns out this is absolutely essential. So, the example I'm going to show you now is really the counterexample in this area, in this region of local to global results with fixed points. You can soup it up in various ways, but let me show you the first version. So, you have some increasing sequence of strictly increasing sequence of finite groups. Finite groups. And from this, you can form what's called a tree of closets. So the vertices of this tree, so I'll start drawing. So you have G0, G1, G2, GI, and so on. And then you put in edges where you have cosets going up to just the next level. So there are going to be cosets of G0 and G1, maybe call this middle G1, G0. There'll be cosets. Little G1, G0, there'll be cosets of G1 in G2, G2, G1. And then there are cosets of G0 in this coset of G1. So this will be G2, G0, G2, G1, G0, etc. Okay, so we get this infinite tree. Right, so that's the tree of cosets, very natural construction. Of cosets, very natural construction, and then you take the group, which is the union of all of these finite groups. This group is not finitely generated. Now, it acts on the tree just by acting on the left on cosets. This action is without inversions, but it doesn't fix any point in the tree. So every element of G fixes, so every element of G lives inside one of these finite groups, Gi, so it's going to fix the vertex. Going to fix you know the vertex GI and stuff after that, but no element of the group, the big group G, fixes the entire tree. The big group G fixes this end, but it doesn't fix anything inside the tree. Okay, so that's a cautionary example to bear in mind. You really do need finite generation, and there are some subtleties in this area. Okay, now let's move up a dimension and where Upper dimension, and we're going to talk about two-dimensional affine buildings. Now, these are built out of apartments. Here's an apartment of type A2 tilde. So this is tessellation of the Euclidean plane by equilateral triangles. That's one possible apartment. Here's the apartment of type C2 tilde or B2 tilde if you prefer. And here's an apartment of type G2 tilde. So these are what these the So these are what these the building is going to be made up of many of these tessellations glued together. Okay, but here's the actual definition I'm working with and this definition is we very much relied on a beautiful paper by Anne Perrault on Euclidean buildings. It's in French, so immerse affin. And this is the way she sets up the definition there. There are other possibilities too. But we're going to have a two-dimensional real vector space A. So the letter A is A. So the letter A is for apartment here. And we have a group of affine isometries which has a particular splitting. So it splits as, so you have a finite group W0. This is a finite linear reflection group. So it's a reflection group fixing the origin. Okay, that's what it is, the stabilizer. So pick your favorite two-dimensional group. And then And then that normalizes the subgroup of translations. And so the group splits as translations seven direct W0. So there are a few different possibilities. First, it's not too hard to show that this group of translations is either discrete, so it's a lattice of translations, or it's dense. So it could be all of our two translations, or you could have all the translations by rational coordinates, say. And in the first case, if this group of translations is First case, if this group of translations is discrete, then the only possibility is the ones I've already shown you. So the entire group of affine isometries is the one corresponding to one of these tessellations. So the A2 tilde, C2 tilde, or G2 tilde. Okay, so I wasn't skipping any examples there. Now, what's the definition of a building? Okay, so we've got our vector space that's going to be our model apartment, and we have a group, W. So the So, the building is a set equipped with a family of injections of the apartment into X. So, each image is actually called an apartment. And it satisfies some list of axioms. I'm not showing you all of them, but I'm showing you enough to give you some idea of what's going on. Okay, so this family of injections is invariant under precomposed by elements of W. Okay, so this should remind you of Okay, so this should remind you of the definition of a manifold where you have an atlas and charts, and then it's a differentiable manifold if it's invariant under precomposition by differentiable maps. And it's a C infinity manifold if the compositions are C infinity and so on. Okay, so we have, you know, it doesn't matter if you precompose by an element of W, and then this transition map. Transition map is always going to be something in this affine isometry group. Okay, so this is where the W is coming in in these first two conditions. So this space is, and then this important third condition is that any two points are contained in some apartment. So this space is covered by images of this vector space. And if you pull back one image and then push it forward using a different Then push it forward using a different injection, then you're applying some element of the cox of this brick W. So, another definition of building you might have seen is that any two points are contained in some apartment. And if you pick any two apartments, there's an isomorphism which takes one apartment to the other and fixes the intersection. This turns out to be equivalent, okay, if you add in those dot dot dot axioms that I've skipped here. Okay, so this is the way we're going to be thinking about. So, this is the way we're going to be thinking about buildings. And the reason for doing this is when we get to our results, we're going to be considering both T being discrete and T being dense. Okay, so we're actually going to be considering buildings which are simplicial buildings, that's the discrete case, and also buildings which are non-discrete, where the translation subgroup is dense. So, similarly to how in an R-tree, you can have vertices everywhere, you can, not just at some discrete set, in a non-discrete. In a non-discrete building, you can have branching everywhere, not just on these discrete set of places. So here's our main result. So we have a finitely generated group acting on a two-dimensional affine building of type A2 tilde or C2 tilde. So those are the first two pictures I showed you. We are working on type G2 tilde. We haven't got there yet and I will We haven't got there yet, and I will say something at the end about what's different in type G2 because I know there are people in the audience who know what a G2 tilde building is. I think it's fair to say that trying to extend the proof to G2 tilde has given us a much better understanding of what we had earlier done in these other types. But there are some subtleties that come up. Okay, so we have funny generated group and we have our local to global result. If every element of the group fixes a Global result. If every element of the group fixes a point, then the group has a global fixed point. Now, let me say some corollaries of this, and these actually give some motivation for why people look at these kinds of results. So, first corollary. So if you remember from that tree of cosets example, this non-finitely generated group didn't fix anything inside the tree, but it did fix an end of the tree. And we get a similar result here. And we get a similar result here. So we now have a group not necessarily finitely generated, and it's acting on a complete, so metrically complete two-dimensional affine building of these two types. So a discrete building is always complete, it's always metrically complete, but a non-discrete building may not be. And every element of G-Fix is a point, then the conclusion is that G-Fix is a point either in the building itself or in its boundary. Or in its boundary. And this is its cat-zero boundary here, so its visual boundary. Okay. And to prove this, we apply a theorem of caprice and leapshack, which requires completeness to apply their result. And essentially, what it says is if you have the local to global result for every finitely generated subgroup, then you get the local to global result on this closure for the entire group. And that's sort of about as good as you could expect to get because of this tree of cosets example. You can't necessarily expect to get a fixed point inside the building if your group is not finally generated. So a second corollary. Okay, so what we actually do in our proof is we construct, so we're going to do a proof by contradiction. Contradiction, and we show that if the group does not have a global fixed point, then in fact it must contain a hyperbolic element. Okay, so what we get is that if you act without a global fixed point, then you get a hyperbolic element. So, what this means is an element which acts on the building with a geodesic line as its axis of translation, so an infinite order element. An infinite order element, and so in particular, we get a Z subgroup of G. So it tells you a little bit about the structure of a group which acts on these buildings without a global fixed point. A long-term, or at least more difficult, aim is to try to prove some kind of TEATS alternative for this class of group actions on spaces. So a TEATS alternative would be saying something like, if a group acts on these buildings, then either it has a And either it has a very particular structure, maybe it's virtually solvable or even virtually abelian, or it has a rank two free subgroup. Now, here's a rank one free subgroup. We don't yet have any concrete ideas really of how to get from a rank one free subgroup to a rank two free subgroup, but this is part of the motivation for this work, some sort of tips alternative. And as a third corollary, so suppose I have So, suppose I have now a finitely generated infinite torsion group. So, this means a group where every element has finite order. Now, the Brouhart-Titz fixed point theorem says that if I have a group, a finite group acting on an affine building, it must have a fixed point. So if I have an infinite torsion group acting, then every element of the group fixes a point. And so, therefore, by our theorem, the group has a global fixed point. So, what this is giving is a very strong restriction. Giving is a very strong restriction on how infinite torsion groups can act on these affine buildings. So, part of the motivation here is: you know, which kinds of spaces can these, you know, burnside groups act on, you know, without having a global fixed point. Okay, now you may have noticed I did a fast forward from Say's result and the Morgan and Shalem work from the 70s and 80s up to our result. Now, let me go back and fill in what other people have been doing. So, there's quite a lot. So, there's quite a lot of work in this direction. So, this is chronologically. Right. So, as you may well know, many or most in some sense affine buildings are Brukartik's buildings. So, these mean buildings which are associated to some, say, reductive group G over a field F. So, if we suppose we have what's called a boundedly generated subgroup, this includes finite generation, but it's a bit stronger. But it's a bit stronger, so a bit weaker. So, if you have a boundedly generated subgroup of this algebraic group and you consider its Bruhart-Titz building, and then take it what's called its Cauchy completion. So if the building is already discrete, this is just the same thing. Otherwise, this Cauchy completion might not actually be a building. But if every element of gamma fixes a point in this Cauchy completion, then gamma has some global fixed point. Has some global fixed point. So the fixed point z of gamma is not empty. That's what that notation means. So Perot's proof is very algebraic. So we have, this is a field with valuation and she's using the valuation theory there to prove this result. Part of our motivation, or at least my motivation, was to find a more geometric proof of Perot's result. So her result, I should say, as for Bruhartiet's buildings in arbitrary dimension, we're just doing two-dimensional. We're just doing two-dimensional, but that was certainly part of my motivation. More recently, Bruya and Fujiwara. So, for discrete Bruha Tits buildings, they have a quantitative version of Perot's results. So, this is sort of saying how far out do you need to go to find a global fixed point. Even more recently, Niels Lader and Olga Volgazi published a short paper which gives this local to global result for This local to global result for finitely generated groups acting on finite-dimensional cat-zero cube complexes. So these are spaces which are built out of cubes of up to some fixed finite dimension, and they satisfy a non-positive curvature condition in geometric group theory, which is called the cat zero condition. There's been a lot of theory of cat zero cube complexes in geometric group theory and roughly the last Theory in roughly the last 15 years. They use arguments which are implicit in much earlier work of Segeev. They're very implicit. I've looked at that paper and haven't seen those arguments there. And it's an argument which is very specific to CAT CRAQ complexes. Let me say that. And then something that came out while we had just started working on our paper, which has a large overlap with our results. Which has a large overlap with our results is this work of Sergey Noran, Damiana Saider, and Piotr Prozickski. So, their setting is: we have a finitely generated room, and it's acting on a cat-zero triangle complex. So, this is a complex built out of triangles satisfying some non-positive curvature condition. And then, under several hypotheses, you get the local to global result. So, either every element of G fixing a point has finite order, so these elliptic elements are all finite order elements. Are all finite order elements? So finite order implies elliptic, but the converse is not in general true. All the complex is locally finite, so you around each point you only see finitely many triangles in a neighbourhood. All the complex has rational angles, which means that the triangles all have angles which are integer sum multiples of pi. So this rational angles condition applies to discrete affine buildings in dimension two. So those triangles we saw, the equilateral triangles or the Collateral triangles, or the triangles for C2 tilde or for G2 tilde. Those are all rational angles. So their result includes discrete affine buildings of dimension two, which are arguably one of the most important classes of Cassiero triangle complexes. Our result includes non-discrete buildings, and I should also say that our arguments are very different to theirs. So they use a Helley theorem for cat zero spaces, which is Spaces, which is not something we use. And then they also use some theorems coming from the theory of billiards, rational billiards. So to find a hyperbolic element, they're looking for what's called a current geodesic. And so they use a theorem called Maises theorem from billiards there. And they also use some work, a theorem of Bauman and Brin about finding geodesics in two-dimensional complexes. Okay. Okay, so all this work leads to a question: you know, is there a local to global result for finitely generated groups acting on non-positively curved spaces? Okay, so we've seen various kinds of spaces, trees, various buildings, finite dimensional cat-zero cube complexes. So lots of results in this direction. And this notion of non-positive curvature, so I should. So I should say there's also a direction here where people are looking at graphs, groups acting on graphs which have non-positive curvature type conditions. So there's a condition called a Helley condition for graphs and there are results, local to global results for groups acting on Helly graphs too. So this is certainly suggestive that maybe this is some general phenomenon for groups acting on non-positively curved spaces. On the other hand, you do On the other hand, you do need caution. So, Asada a few years ago constructed an action of a finitely generated infinite torsion group, so the Burnside group, on an infinite-dimensional Catsiro cube complex. So every element of the group fixes a point, but the group has no global fixed point. So, you know, maybe this is some general phenomenon in finite dimensions. We're not sure. So I've talked with Damien. So, I've talked with Damian, and neither of us have seen anyone write down a question or a conjecture about this previously. But as you see, there is some, there's a fair amount of literature looking at these kinds of results. And it's a very nice question. And I find it encouraging that we have their result and our result with a lot of overlap using really completely different techniques. And this is, I think, a pointer that there's something deep going on. If you can, you know, you bring in theorems from quite... You know, you bring in theorems from quite different areas to prove the same thing. Okay, so now let me say something about the proof. So, as a very top-level overview, we first do some reductions and then we do a proof by contradiction. So, we're going to construct a hyperbolic element. So, construct an element with no global fixed point. Sorry, construct an element which does not fix a point in the building. So, on the So, on the reductions, okay. So, we're starting with our affine building of type AT tilde or CT tilde. And the first reduction is that we can assume that even if we start with something discrete, we can assume that it's an R building and each point is what's called a special vertex. So, this is a vertex with each kind of hyperplane passing through it. So, you can think of it as each, this is equivalent to thinking of each apartment. This is equivalent to thinking of each apartment having the set of translations being R2. So you're allowed to translate by anything. Okay, this is a completely standard reduction. You just change your point of view and now you're thinking of every point as being a special vertex. And our reason for doing this is so that we don't have to consider cases like, what if this point is a vertex? What if this point is in the middle of an edge? What if this point is in the middle of a chamber? Okay, so every point is a special vertex. It means the link of every point, so the neighborhood and the building of each point, building of each point if we if i'm in an a2 tilde building the neighborhood of each point is now an a2 building full stop okay then a second reduction which uses some theorems is we can assume that the building is metrically complete the reason we want to do this is we want to apply some properties of complete catsyro spaces so we need completeness here a discrete building is always complete but a non-discrete one may not be and One may not be. And so we use some black magic here to do with ultra powers. So we take the ultra power of x and we apply a theorem of Kleiner and Lieb, which says that if you take the ultra power of an affine building, the result is an affine building of the same type. So we haven't left affine buildings, we haven't left types, the type. And then we apply a result of coins from a few years ago, which says that if you have a finitely generated group at Generated group acting on this ultra power, then it must fix a point back in the original building. Okay, so we get a fixed point in the ultra power and we can pull that back to a fixed point in the original building using finite generation. And then a completely easy reduction is we can assume that the group price, that the group acting is type preserving because the type preserving subgroup will be finite index inside the full group. So that's not a big reduction. Okay, so now we're working in the land. So now we're working in the land of metrically complete R buildings, and we have a tight-preserving action. Okay, so this next proposition is really key to our proof, and this is the thing where we're going to spend our time proving. So we suppose we have two proper finally generated subgroups, and their fixed point sets are non-empty and disjoint. So here's my fixed point set for one of them. Fixed point set for one of them. Here's my fixed point set for the other. And what we're going to do is we're going to show that in this situation there is a hyperbolic element in the group. So once you believe this proposition, the theorem is easy to prove. You just induct on the number of generators. So how do we get from having our two blobs, which are fixed point sets, Which are fixed point sets to constructing a hyperbole. So, the general overview: like what are the ingredients, and I'll give more detail as I go along. So, we use some general results for complete capsule spaces. So, these are not theorems with someone's name on them. These are, you know, lemmas and propositions in the standard reference work on capsule spaces, which is Brightson and Hefriger's book. And then we also use a lot of building theory. And we also use a lot of building theoretic arguments, both arguments for affine buildings and also arguments for spherical buildings, because the lengths of the vertices in the affine building are spherical buildings. So it's really a mixture of local and more global arguments. Okay, now. So what we do is we construct an element G, and I'll say more about that in a moment, a sequence of points in the space. A sequence of points in the space, so that the ones with even index are part of a G orbit. So A0 goes to A2, goes to A4, and so on. And then a point in, this is the cat-zero boundary, so a point psi, so that this g orbit, those points are going further and further away from the boundary point. Okay, so I'm abusing notation here. What is actually happening here is we're talking about Boozman functions. About Boozmann functions. So, a Boozman function is a function on a cat-zero space which, in some sense, records distance from a boundary point. So, we're saying we're going to construct this g orbit of points A0, A2, A4, so that A0 is, so A2 is further than A0, A4 is further than A2, and so on. And what this means is that this orbit is unbounded. Okay, one way to show an orbit is unbounded is to show that it goes further and further away. To show that it goes further and further away from something on the boundary. It's increasing by a discrete amount each time. Now, if you have an elliptic element, well, it has a fixed point, and then if you think about that, that means that all of its orbits are bounded. If it has a fixed point, say X, and it moves Y, then the orbit of Y has to stay the same distance from X. But here we've constructed an element with an unbounded orbit, and that means And that means it has to be hyperbolic. Perot proved this dichotomy for isometries of affine buildings: that if it's not elliptic, it has to be hyperbolic. Those are the only two things that can happen. So now let me get into construction a little bit more. So, our starting assumption is that we have these non-empty disjoint fixed sets. So here's B0 and use B1. And what we do is we have points, say, A0 and A1, which are going to be the closest points in between. So the distance between B0 and B1 is realized by this geodesic from A0 to A1. Okay, and now what we do is And now, what we do is we apply a group element which fixes A1 and takes A0 to, so this will be A2 is G1, A0. So G1 is doing this. And now we have a fixed set over here. And let me use a different colour. And then we apply an element G2 here. We get A3 is going to be, by definition, G2 applied to A1. So we've got another fixed set here. Okay, and you keep on going in this way, and low and behold, A0, A2. Holds A0, A2. So we define G to be G2, G1 and GI to be G, G I, G inverse, or I at least three. So this will be G three, G4, G five, and so on. And we get A2, A4, A2, A4 will be G applied to, and then we define AI to be G applied to AI minus 2. So A4 is GA2, A6 is GA4, and so on. Okay, so lo and behold, here is our A0, A2, A4, 6. And what about this boundary point? Well, it's going to be over here and A0, A2. And A0, A2, A4, and so on are going to go away from. Okay, so you should be completely unconvinced by this. I've drawn a picture of what I want to happen, and now let me show you, explain to you why this actually happens. Okay, so okay, so starting out, we have non-empty disjoint fixed point sets. So fixed point sets in cat0 spaces are closed and convex. So that's a So that's a general property of complete cat zero spaces. And we need to show that there actually are points A0 and A1, which realize the distance between B0 and B1. So this is something we needed to prove for non-discrete buildings. Now, this point A1 is the closest point projection from A0 is the closest point to B1 in the space because it's the closest point. Space because it's the closest point, it realizes the distance. And in Katzero spaces, if you have a closed convex subset, you have something called the closest point projection. Okay, and there's a unique closest point to anything outside the set. Okay, so something that's true about closest point projections is that the angle here, okay, let me draw it slightly differently. Okay, that's not what I meant to do. Let me just draw this. So, this angle here is greater than or equal to pi over 2. So, what I mean by that is the angle between the shortest path, so the path from A0 to its projection, and the path from A1 to anything else in B1, that angle. anything else in B1, that angle has to be at least pi over 2. That's a property of closest point projections in Katziero spaces. So it sort of has to face away from the closest point projection. Another ingredient is what we call local lemmas for spherical buildings. So these are used to show that we have these elements G1 and G2, which take things away from a given boundary point. Okay, I will show you a local lemma on the next slide. Lemma on the next slide, and then come back to this picture to explain what's going on. Okay, but what rough, very roughly speaking, what we want to do is have elements that take this line to something which has a large angle away from psi. So if I draw g dzig out here, this angle is large. Okay, that's what g1 is going to do. And similarly with g2. Something else we use, so these are results for. Something else we use. So these are results for affine buildings. So there are various results about in a certain situation there exists an apartment in the affine building. And the one that we make strong use of is that if you have opposite sectors based at a common point, then there exists an apartment containing both of those opposite sectors. Again, I'll come back to that. Now, once we have apartments, when we're inside an apartment, we use very basic Euclidean geometry. This is things like, you know, parallel lines. Geometry. This is things like, you know, parallel lines, and what's the angle of some line going between them, you know, opposite angles and parallel lines and things like that. We make use of retractions of the iPhone building. So these are maps from the entire building onto a single apartment. Retractions are distance non-increasing and various other properties like this get used. And finally, we use some basic properties of booteman functions. Okay, now let me go to what a local Let me go to what a local lemma actually looks like because this will explain some of these steps better. Okay, so this is the local lemma in type C2. Let me draw an apartment of type C2 to explain. Okay, so when I say building here, what I'm really meaning is the geometric realization where this is what an apartment looks like. Okay, so each apartment is going to be a unit circle, and here are the panels. Here are the panels. Unit circle is going to be subdivided into eight chambers, and each chamber has panels of two distinct types. Okay, so I'm using a unit circle. So this distance, each chamber is pi over four distance. And then opposite points are at distance pi. Okay, four times pi over four. Pi, okay, four times pi over four. So what's this result saying? So we choose a point in our building, say X, okay, so not necessarily a panel, just a point. And if I have a panel, say P, at minimum distance, so that would be this red panel here, then at least one of the following must hold. Either there's some element of the group which takes P to an opposite panel. So this will be An opposite panel. So this will be over here. That's an opposite panel. Or there's some panel which is fixed by the entire group, which is a distance strictly less than pi over 2. So that means p prime could be this one or this one. Okay, now this is a dichotomy which, you know, if you know what a C2 tilde building is, you could sit down and write. A C2 tilde building is you could sit down and write this proof. Not claiming the proof here is difficult. Let me show you how this gets applied. So, this is going to be applied to show that we have an element G1. Okay, so now here's my point X. So now thinking of X as being in the link of A1, so in that spherical building, I choose a closest panel P, and that closest panel P is here. Now, Now, if the entire group fixed something which is within distance pi over 2 of x, that would contradict A1 being the closest point projection. So therefore, I must have an element g1 which takes p far away. So it's saying this dichotomy says that either I fix some the entire group fixes something close to x or there exists a group element which takes it far away. Okay, and we have to be in the second. Okay, and we have to be in the second possibility because of the properties of closest point projections. Now, that's type C2. Let me show you A2. So here we've got the unit circle is going to be subdivided into six chambers. And now opposite panels have distinct types. So, what the statement is going to look like is if I have X and a closest panel P, then X gets taken either here or here. Sorry, I did that wrong. Either here or here. So it gets taken to a chamber which contains a panel opposite P. So in the type C2, we're getting opposition coming from P and GP. Opposition coming from P and G P. Okay, we have opposite here. In type A2, we have opposites here. And this local phenomenon of having opposites then allows us to find apartments in the affine building because we have opposite sectors. Now, what about type G2? What's different? So here's, so that was A2. And then G2. So now we've got A2. Now we've got unit circle subdivided into 12 chambers And we would like to get something opposite but if you consider the rotation of this by 2 pi over 3 call that 2 pi over 3, I call that group element g. So this takes, this is p, so this will be gp, this is g squared p. Okay, so here we have a group acting on this thin building, for example, where x never gets taken to a chamber containing a panel opposite P. Okay, it just gets taken, you know, we can guarantee it being either here or here. Either here or here, but we can't guarantee it being in something which is opposite. And that lack of opposition is where we're stuck at the moment with type G2. Okay, so there really is some difference there. I think we will get there, but we haven't got there yet. Okay, and that was my last slide. It was meant to say thank you, and I clearly forgot to do that. So thank you very much for your attention. All right, thank you very much, Anne. So, do we have any questions or comments for Anne? I think since we're only twenty people, you can either speak up or put them into the chat if you like. Hi, Anne, it's George Willis here. You explained why you can't do G tilde yet, but can you give us an idea what goes wrong in higher dimensions or why you haven't done that? Yeah, good question. Good question. Um, we're using a lot of two-dimensional stuff, so okay. So, first off, our local lemmas, we don't know if they hold in higher dimension. Um, so you know, it's not too difficult to prove these statements in dimension two, where you can think of these links as being incidence geometries with just points and lines. And then in higher dimensions, you've got more flags, you know, more complicated flags to think about. Um, secondly, we're using quite We're using quite heavy use of the apartments being Euclidean planes. So, what that means is that the walls, so the fixed sets of reflections, are just lines. And so, if you have a point and you've got some boundary point, the line, the geodesic ray going from that point to the boundary is actually half of a wall. And that determines a unique wall. And that's not something that's true in higher dimensions. So, yeah, so that being. Yeah, so that being able to sort of say which wall you're talking about just from a geodesic ray is not something that's going to be necessarily possible in higher dimensions. That's it. We haven't yet seriously thought about higher dimensions. I should also say, so in higher dimensions, because of Tietz's theorem about affine buildings, so all of the discrete buildings in dimension three and up are actually Burkard Tietz buildings, so would be covered by. Brooke-Artiques buildings so would be covered by Anne-Perot's resort. Whereas in dimension two, there are even in the discrete case, there are two-dimensional affine buildings which are not Ripartites buildings. Right, okay. Thanks. All right. Any other questions or comments? Let me make also to Jordan's. Yeah, so this other team that's working on similar things, so the Norona Saida Przitsky, so their arguments are also very special to Dimension 2. So the billiards arguments that they're using and existence of geodesics arguments are very special, you know, very particular for dimension two. Right, okay. Yeah, thanks. Well, perhaps I can ask you a follow-up question. You mentioned Anne for O'Heas results. You mentioned Anne Perot's results, and they do reply in all dimensions. So you said that she uses algebraic techniques. Can you say anything about the difference? You know, what's, I guess, what's missing from her techniques that allows you to do the dimension too? That is not covered by her results? Well, I mean, we don't have a field. I mean, we don't have a field. That's the big right. Yeah. I mean, I should say I can follow her proof line by line, but I don't really have a sense of what the big picture. Yeah. I mean, maybe Yorain can say more. Her result relies on the fact that these buildings come from fields with valuation, and then she can, from the finite generation, she can derive bounds on the valuation. She can derive bounds on the valuation of any word in the group, but we don't have any underlying algebraic structures, so we can't do anything like that. Yeah, I think this is why the rank two is different from higher rank. In higher rank, the building has to be Bruhatit's building. Yeah. Her argument is very short. It's only five pages. It's clever basic properties of fields with valuations. Fields with valuations. Right, okay, thank you. All right, very good. If there are no further questions, then I will ask David to stop the recording.
