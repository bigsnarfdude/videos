So I'll talk about an exceptional theta correspondence and some Arthur packets on F4. This is joint work with Gordon 7. I also want to thank WeTech, Nadja, and Gordon. Just not so long ago, I didn't really know much about any of these things. So thanks to them. All right, so what do I want to do? So the goal of this talk. The goal of this talk is to describe a theta correspondence arising with the following groups. We're going to look at the automorphism group of a composition algebra. I think in this talk, this C is just really going to be a quaternion algebra. And we're going to have a group of type F4, and this is going to be living inside the exceptional group E7. E7, okay, and this form of E7 will depend on our quaternion algebra. So we're going to look at this dual pair inside of E6. We want to describe the associated theta correspondence. And then we'd like to show that this data correspondence should be, should allow us to construct some family of Arthur packets on F4. Packets on F4. Okay, so which Arthur, which type of Arthur packets will we be looking at? So this is the Vay-Deline group, and here's The Vay-Deline group, and here's the Arthur SL2. We're going to be looking at Arthur parameters into F4C, and the ones that are going to arise from the theta correspondence that we're going to consider will factor through a particular subgroup. This is going to be SL2C times SP6C. So, when we come back to Arthur packets later, they will factor through this product of groups inside of. Through this product of groups inside of F4. You can actually see this product just from the Dinkin diagram of F4. So over here, we have the SP6, and the highest root gives us that SL2. Okay. All right, so I want to begin just by talking about the local theta correspondence. All right, so what's the setup? I'll describe this in general and then I'll specialize to the groups that we're interested in. Okay, so the first thing that we need is we need two groups, G1 and G2, and these are going to be sitting inside some other group G. We want this map to be almost. We want this map to be almost an inclusion. And we would like G1 and G2, or rather the images of G1 and G2, to be mutual centralizers. All right, the second piece of information that we need is some representation of G. And this representation should be small in some sense. And later on, when we specialize to the groups that we're interested in, we'll take it to be a minimal representation of at least seven. All right, okay. So once we have that set up, what are we trying to investigate? We want to investigate our surface. So let's take two irreducible representations, one for geometry. Representations, one for G1 and one for G2. And we'd like to investigate the following space. We want to look at the homomorphisms from this small representation of the big group G that map to tau one tensor tau two as G1, G2 homo principles. All right, now there's a better way to reformulate. There's a better way to reformulate this problem. This is sort of a set. And since we're dealing with representations, representation theory, it'd be better if we described a representation instead. So we're going to slightly modify this problem, and it will lead to a better reformulation, something that's a little bit more convenient to analyze. Okay, so now we'll take our tau1, just an irreducible representation of g, and we'll start by looking at the maximal tau is. The maximal tau isotypic quotients. Right, and there are a couple important facts about this. So the first is that this maximal tau isotypic quotient, it's going to admit an action of G2. So G2 acts on this. Okay, and then it will admit a factorization. So this will be of the form tau, tensor, some other representation of G2. And we're going to refer to this as the big theta lift of tau. All right. This representation, this could be zero, it could be reducible, and so it's also convenient to introduce the maximal semi-simple quotient. And this is sometimes called the small theta lift. Okay, all right, and so now what we'll do is to describe the theta lift, that really means we're going to try and describe big theta and small theta as explicitly as possible. As possible. All right, I have to say a few things about exceptional groups. All right, and throughout the rest of this talk, we're going to be working over a non-Archimedean field. So F will be, it's specifically a chaotic field. Okay. And we're going to need this algebra C. This is a composition algebra. There's actually only a few families for these composition algebras. The dimension is either one, two, four, or eight. When it's of dimension one, you just have your field. Dimension two, you can have the field plus itself or a quadratic extension. For dimension four, this is the one that's For dimension four, this is the one that's mostly going to come up today. We can have the matrix group, two by two matrices. Okay, and then I'll use D for the quaternion division algebra. And then in eight dimensions over a piadic field, there's only the split Octonians. All right. All right. Okay, in addition to composition algebras, there's also something called a cubic Jordan algebra. This is going to be a group of three by three matrices. Where along the diagonal, we're just taking elements from the base field. And then on the off-diagonal, we have elements coming from the composition algebra. And the structure of these composition algebras, they come with some sort of conjugation, like complex conjugation for complex numbers. Okay. But now the multiplication for this Jordan. But now the multiplication for this Jordan algebra is sort of the skew commutator. So x times y, just regular matrix multiplication, plus y times x. Now with this product, this is non-associative, but commutative. And then lastly, there's a norm. So, if we take some element of our cubic Jordan algebra, there is a cubic norm form, which is essentially coming from something that looks like the determinant, but we don't really need to or want to write down the formula for that. Okay. All right, so what's the significance of these algebras? Well, let me make one quick, let me just state some facts really quickly. So   Okay, but what about for our purposes today? So there are these constructions where you can take as an input a composition algebra and a Jordan algebra and produce from that exceptionally algebras. So this is due. So, this is due. Get the names correct. How do I spell these? There we go. So, Freudenthal, Coker, and Tits have these constructions of exceptional Lie algebras that take as input a composition algebra and a Jordan algebra. All right, we'll look at a construction of or so for our purposes today, if we take J. If we take J to be the cubic Jordan algebra that I talked about over there, we get the following family of Lie algebras. And so let's say that G sub C will be coming from C and J C. All right. So, by taking as input just the base field and this cubic Jordan algebra, we can get an F4 Li algebra. If you do this for a quadratic composition algebra, you get something of type E6, for a quaternion algebra, E7, and for an octonian algebra, something of type E8. The groups that we'll consider will come from the quaternion algebra. Consider will come from the quaternion algebras. So, for today, C will be a quaternion algebra. And so, in particular, our large group will be this E7. And in fact, there is the following. And in fact, there is the following, a dual reductive pair. Get the automorphism group of our composition algebra cross F4 sitting inside E7. So I haven't really explained where any of this comes from, but this is what we're working from. And it's coming from the choice of a composition algebra and a Jordan algebra using these constructions of Bretenthaler. Of Brighteller coconut and tits. All right. Okay, so now I've introduced enough notation to state the theta correspondence. So let me state those results. All right, so we have the dual pair. This was the first part we needed for a theta correspondence. The second thing was a representation on the larger group. And in this case, we're going to take the minimal representation. Case we're going to take the minimal representation for E7. Okay, so we'll take an irreducible representation for the automorphism group of a composition algebra, sorry, a quaternion. Composition algebra, sorry, a quaternion algebra. And the first result is that if we look at the big theta lift, the big theta lift of tau, this is always non-zero. So this is a non-zero representation of F4. And furthermore, it's of finite length. Okay. Next, if we further assume that Next, if we further assume that tau is a supercuspital representation, then in fact the big theta lift is irreducible. Yeah, so if we started with a supercuspital representation, then the big theta lift is irreducible, and so in particular will just be equal to the small theta lift. All right, so these first two results are general. We can take either the split or the non-split quaternion algebra. But now we'll specialize to the case of the split quaternion algebra. In other words, C is just the two by two matrices. And so then in particular, the automorphism group is just PGL2. Okay, so for PGL2, generically, if we lift a principal series representation, and let me just call PGL2, let me call this G. Okay, so generically, if we take a principal series representation of PGL2 and we look at the big theta lift, we get a degenerate principal series for F4. Let me just describe the notation here. All right, so we're going to be inducing from a maximal parabolic subgroup. This Q sub 4 is just the B3 parabolic in the F4 thing. In the F4 thinking diagram. And the fours are because I'm labeling that one as the fourth root. So Q4 is coming from the maximal part, maximal parabolic associated to eliminating alpha four. And then omega four, this is just the weight which is associated with alpha four. Okay. All right, so this is what happens generically, but in fact, we can precisely describe big and small theta for all constituents of principal series. But generically, this is the result. Sorry, Say again. So the calculation of the colours of the colour The calculation of the big and small theta for principal series uses techniques that Gordon developed many, many years ago. It basically involves studying. Okay, so when you're dealing with exceptional groups, you don't have a nice model of the minimal representation like you do in the case of the classical theta correspondence. But you do have nice filtrations for the minimal representation. Filtrations for the minimal representation with respect to different maximal parabolic subgroups. And so you start with a Siegel, for this result over here, you want to start with this filtration associated to the Siegel parabolic subgroup. And then you can compute various co-invariants or twisted coinvariants. And I'd be happy to talk more about that later to pin down exactly what comes out of this. Other questions? In the sense that In the sense that there are the best way to say this, in the sense that for almost all characters, this thing will be irreducible. And when I look at its big theta lift, I'm going to get this thing, and this thing will also be irreducible. But there are certain choices of characters where either the input or the Where either the input or the output will be reducible, and then you have to be a little bit more careful about exactly how things pair up. Does that answer your question? Okay. Other questions? Oh, right. Okay. All right. So part C and the results that I didn't mention basically say that for all of the constituents of principal series, we have a complete answer for both the big and the small theta lift. For the supercuspital representations, there's still a little left to be done. However, we can say Little left to be done. However, we can say that if we have a supercuspital representation of PGL2, the big theta lift, which is irreducible by 1B over here, this big theta lift is a quotient of some explicit representation on F4. All right, but there's still a little bit of ambiguity because it's not clear if that quotient is unique, for example. Saying over here That's correct, yeah. So Correct. Yeah. So the big theta lift, it is irreducible, but we don't have an explicit description of it. What we do know is that it is the quotient of something that we can write down explicitly. It's some induced representation, but it's not clear if there's a unique quotient, for example. And so there could be still some ambiguity in exactly what big theta is. Does that answer your question? Great, great. Sorry, could you speak up? You're asking about the levee. This one is it is, I always flip it around, I believe. I can tell you later, but this is parabolically induced from either removing alpha 2 or alpha 3. I forget which one it is right now. But you're not, but you're inducing from a cuspital representation just of a GL2 quotient of the levy. So there's some, but we can talk more about that later if you'd like. Okay. One interesting thing that happens in this exceptional theta correspondence is that it's not injective. So there's one, or rather, two F4 representations. Let's call this sigma one and sigma two that have the same That have the same that have the same theta lift into PGL2. So the classical statement of how duality fails in this case, not sure if I'm not aware of any other examples like this, but it is a peculiar feature that comes up in this F4, in this F4 case. F4 in this F4 case. So this is not one-to-one from F4 to PGL2. All right. Okay, all right, so these are the results that describe what happens with the theta correspondence. As you can see, there's still a little bit left to be done. We have, we always know, for example, that the supercuspital representation lifts to something which is irreducible, but in both the split and the non-split case, there's still some work to be done in terms of pinning down exactly what that lift is. Okay. All right. So now. All right, so now, in addition to just describing this theta correspondence, we have some applications to periods. And so, I'm going to talk a little bit about the application to spin 9 periods. Okay, so previously I remarked that the group F4 is the automorphism group of this cubic Jordan. Of this cubic Jordan algebra over the octonians. And there's a particular, particularly simple element in there. We can look at the matrix, the diagonal matrix 1, 0, 0. Okay. We can look at the stabilizer inside of F4. I'll call this H. This is actually isomorphic to spin 9, split spin 9. Okay. And using our results on the theta corresponding. And using our results on the theta correspondence, we have the following. We can characterize the F4 representations with a spin 9 period. So let me break this up into two pieces. So we'll take an irreducible representation of F4, and I guess I'll call this two. Okay, so the first is that the dimension of the space of H-invariant linear functionals, this is at most one. And second, if this is equal to one, so if there is an H-invariant linear functional, this happens precisely when. Precisely when sigma is isomorphic to the theta lift of some irreducible generic representation of PGL2. Okay, all right, so this is a summary of our results on the theta correspondence for this automorphism of the composition algebra cross F4 inside of an E7. Now I want to describe the relationship to Arthur parameters or Arthur packets. Yeah. Second. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, I'll repeat it. That's better. Yes. So this question was: was the last statement predicted by some conjectures of Secular Lorettis and Bankatesh? And Bankitesh. Let's see. So I do know that the spherical variety of F4 mod spin9, I know that this does appear in their paper. They were certainly aware of this spherical variety. Not 100% sure exactly. It should be able to be fitted into their framework, yeah. But I haven't checked that or thought about that very carefully yet. Okay, all right, so I want to come back and talk about a parameters again. So just as a quick recap, so we're considering a parameters of the following form. A parameters of the following form. So here this will be the Vey-Deleene group cross SL2C. We're going to be looking for maps into the dual group of F4, which will be F4C. But we're going to focus on parameters which factor through a particular subgroup coming from SL2C cross sp6c. And we want these parameters to take the following form. So let me. I should have. Okay. I should have put this up top. Let's take tau to be an irreducible representation of PGL2. And let's say that it is tempered. Okay. Okay. So, this parameter that we're going to look at will be indexed by tau. It's going to factor through this subgroup and it's going to take on the following form. The Vay-Deleen group is going to map into SL2C according to the L parameter associated to this irreducible representation tau. And then the Arthur SL2 is going to map into sp6 under an embedding. An embedding associated to the regular nilpotent orbit. All right. So let me make a few remarks about the component groups that we'll see here. Unfortunately, Lei, there will only be abelian groups. Abelian groups, but there is an F4 does have an S4 component group, but we don't see that in this particular construction. All right. So the first thing is that if we look at the centralizer, just of the image of the regular, if we start by just looking at the image of SL2C under the regular embedding of the regular embedding into SP6, which is then. Regular embedding into sp6, which is then pushed into F4. This centralizer is just this SL2C. And maybe just as a reminder, this SL2C is really just coming from minus the highest. C is really just coming from minus the highest root. So I'll call that alpha zero, and I'll just use a subscript to indicate that. Okay. All right. So the centralizer of this, the image of the Arthur SL2, this gives us just an SL2 coming from this minus the highest root. And so then if we take the full parameter, there's two possibilities, and everything is complete. There's two possibilities, and everything is completely determined by the L parameter for the representation of PGL2. If tau is a discrete series, then we're going to get plus minus one. And if tau is not discrete series here, okay, so let me just say it's going to be connected. Okay, and so then in particular. Okay, and so then in particular, our component group is either μ2 or trivial. μ2 occurs precisely when tau is a discrete series. Okay. All right, so now we want to take a look at how we can try and construct something that's plausibly an Arthur packet associated to these types of Arthur parameters.  All right, so we'll take a parameter like we have over there. And I guess I'll do this in two cases. So first, we'll, oh, sorry, no, no, I want to say something else first. Okay, so what's the connection? I told you all about the theta correspondence before, and now I'm saying we're going to look at these eight parameters, but what's the connection between? At these eight parameters, but what's the connection between the theta correspondence and these eight parameters? And so this is going to come by investigating, taking a look at what happens to the Satake parameters under the theta correspondence. Okay, okay. So, one of the results that I wrote down earlier described what happens when we take the theta lift of a principal series for PGL2 and lift it to F4. And it looked like a big theta of this principal series. Series at least generically, this is a degenerate principal series on F4. And then we can view this inside of a Borel principal series. Maybe I'll just call this B4 just to keep the indexing the same. Okay, and I'm using normalized induction, and now we have to just track what happens to the modular characters, and we will get, I think it will look something like this. All right, so the ratio of these two and the ratio of these two modular characters, this is essentially. characters. This is essentially this is essentially the sum of the roots for FP6. That's the levy when you dualize everything. So this was a B3 parabolic in F4, but when we pass to the dual side, then this becomes the C3 parabolic, which is why we're seeing the sp6 here and in the Here and in the our picture for these A parameters. Okay. All right. So why these A parameters in particular? So now let me just say that tau is unramified. We take something which is unramified and we apply this. Sorry, Sagan. Yeah, B4, that's just going to be the Borel inside of, or A Borel inside of Q4. It was just using the same subscript, just a Borel subgroup for F4. V is not the type there. Yeah. Yeah. Say again? Yes, yes, yes. I was running out of. Yeah, it's not the best, I agree. Yeah, but it's just the Borel inside of Q4. Yep, no trouble. Okay, so if you take a spherical representation and you look at these Arthur And you look at these Arthur parameters or the associated Arthur parameter, this is going to map exactly to the Satake parameter of the theta lift. Okay. All right, and so this is sort of the first piece of evidence that, at least for this theta correspondence, we want to look at Arthur parameters that are of this form. Okay. Okay, component groups. All right. Okay, so now let me just describe sort of a candidate construction for these Arthur packets. Okay, so let's first assume that tau is not a discrete series. All right, when tau is not a discrete series, Not a discrete series. Our component group has size one. So we just need to come up with one representation. And we're starting with tau. Tau is a representation of PGL2. Let's just take its theta lift to F4. So this will be the proposed Arthur packet associated to this parameter. And I wrote too big. Okay, and if tau is a discrete series, we come back, we take a look at the component group. Now this is μ2, so we need to come up with two representations. And in this case, because tau is a discrete series for PGL2, we can look at its Jacques Languin's lift to PD cross. To PD cross. And so for our packet, we can try to take the theta lift of tau. So that's a lifting from PGL2 to F4. And then we can look at the theta lift of the Jacques Langlands lift of tau, followed by the theta lift to F4. So this will give us a packet of size two. All right. All right, okay. All right, and so this seems like a reasonable well that's to be to be determined in the future, but here's how we can use the theta lift to at least construct packets of the correct size. Now, there are many other things that need to be checked. And so, in particular, let me just write down a list of a few things to do. Okay, so one, we've only studied the theta lift for a piadic representation, and so we'll want to do this for over the real and complex field as well. So we need to do the theta for the Archimedean case. We'll need some sort of dichotomy theorem because it's actually not completely obvious that these are distinct representations. And so we'll want these to be distinct, otherwise, we won't have a packet of size two. All right, so this is in the discrete series case. And eventually, we would like to try to use this to verify the Arthur's multiplicity formula. All right. All right, so that's all I want to say about Arthur parameters and packets. Just a quick recap. So we studied this beta correspondence for automorphisms of a composition algebra cross F4. And in the structure of the theta correspondence, we see some suggestions that this could be used to construct Arthur packets. There's a natural way to construct packets of presumably the correct size based on component group calculations. And it behaves very well with respect to the Satake correspondence. Okay. All right. So I think for the final part. For the final part, I'm at 5:15. Is that right? Okay, all right. So, I want to say a few things about the proofs, one proof of one part of the beta correspondence. In particular, I want to highlight the role played by the Jacobi, the Fourier-Jacobi functor. So, this is specifically in relation to the following theorem that I described earlier.  Okay. Okay, so I want to say a few things about how the Fourier Jacobi functor factors into the proof that a super cuspital representation lifts to something which is irreducible. Okay, so the Fourier Jacobi functor, you can start to look at something called the Fourier Jacobi functor if you have a Heisenberg parabolic. And these exceptional groups, in particular, I'm going to be looking at this for E7 and F4. So there's a very nice way to look at this. Okay. So here I've just written the Dinkin diagram for each. I've just written the Dinkin diagram for E7, the extended affine Dinkin diagram. And if I look at this, these two nodes over here, this gives me a copy of SL3. Okay. And if you look at the maximal torus, the Cartanen SL3, and look at the associated relative root system, you'll get a relative root system of type G2. And I think I'll need more space. And this is the most difficult part of the talk. Okay. All right. So if we look at the carton of SL3, we get a relative root system. The long roots in this relative root system are all one-dimensional, and this just gives us that copy of SL3. This is just coming from the SL3. The short roots, these actually all have the structure of one of these exceptional Jordan algebras. Specifically, J sub C, where C is the quaternion algebra that we're looking at. Okay. All right. And then you can specify exactly what happens at the origin as well, but I'm going to skip that just to be brief. Okay. All right. Finally, there's a grading on this. You can look at zero, which will correspond to this horizontal line, one, which will correspond to this horizontal line, two, which will correspond to this top. Horizontal line two, which will correspond to this top, and also along the negatives. Okay, and in fact, if you take all of the positive numbers here, the positive part of the grid, you'll get a Heisenberg parabolic. I'll call this P and I'll take a Levy D. I'll call this P and I'll take a Levy decomposition m times m. Okay, all right, so I just did this for E7, but in fact, we can do the same thing for F4. We'll also get a G2 relative root system over here. And the only thing that's going to change is that instead of JC, we'll have JF. Okay. All right. And so these two Heisenberg parabolics, the one for E7 and the one for F4, are going to be compatible in the sense that, well, let me just say the Heisenberg parabolic for Let me not say that right now. Okay. All right. Okay, so what is the Fourier Jacobi functor? We're just going to do this with respect to the minimal representation from earlier. The 40-hour. The Fourier Jacobi functor is the Hom space from the Heisenberg representation to the minimal representation, except we have to take some co-invariance. This Z is going to be the center of our Heisenberg subgroup. Subgroup psi will be an additive character non-trivial additive all right and so I can also I've done this for E7 maybe I'll just use sevens to indicate e7 but I can also To indicate E7, but I can also do this for F4. Okay. And so what I, let's see. Not going to happen at times. Okay. So let me just try and write down a short calculation. What I want to do is I'm going to show that the Fourier Jacobi functor of this minimal representation for E7, this is basically going to give us a Vay representation for a classical dual pair. And that's going to give us a lot. Pair. And that's going to give us a lot of leverage in terms of understanding the exceptional theta lift. So the goal is to, well, okay, I'm not going to have time to write this down. So let me just summarize quickly. The Fourier Jacobi functor basically reduces the exceptional theta correspondence. The exceptional theta correspondence to a classical theta correspondence. And the essential calculation boils down to we're going to take the Fourier Jacobi functor with respect to the F4 Heisenberg parabolic. And this is exactly going to be isomorphic to the Vay representation. So, first off, this is as automorphisms of C SP6 representations. Okay. And this omega psi, this is the V representation for S P V T. All right. Okay, so let me just stop there. Oh, yeah, Shinbo. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. This is first off. This is first off, it's over the Heisenberg subgroup, and it is from the Heisenberg representation to the minimal representation. What ends up happening is by Stone von Neumann, when you take this co-invariant space, this is just going to be the Heisenberg representation times the multiplicity space. This is just the multiplicity space. All right, let me stop there.
