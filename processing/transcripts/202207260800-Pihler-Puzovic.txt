See that there is a change in the shape of wrinkles that you see, and before the final pattern emerges. And the final thing, the most obvious thing, is obviously depending on some control parameters, we have a very different pattern emerging in the two microchannels that we've studied here. Yes? So this is top view of the micro channel. So I will explain this in more detail. At this stage, I'm not explaining anything at all. I'm just showing. Explaining anything at all, I'm just showing you some pretty pictures, and I'll explain how we do experiments a bit later. Okay, so why would we want to study this? So here is my motivation, more generally. So swelling is used a lot for modeling biological growth. And although these patterns have not been obtained by swelling, others have. I just picked up those because I highlight them. For us, it started with this paper. This paper. So, here is a microchannel made out of hydrogel. And you start, so it's a microchannel, so it has initially a rectangular cross-section. It's empty, and then a top wall is also a thin membrane. And then you swell it by putting in some water through the microchannel. As a result of that, you see this geometry developing, and we call these telephone cordritols. And so you see these patterns emerging. See these patterns emerging. Now, I would claim that the patterns that we see are different to what they see, but you can think of our problem as a means of manufacturing or fabricating 3D structures on microscale. More generally, I already mentioned that we are more and more interested in soft micropholetics. And okay, so soft micropholytics is popular because you put soft parts in the micropholetics channel and you have means of passing. Channel, and you have means of passively controlling geometry in such systems, and you can think of swelling as means of alternating geometry in the system. But what I'm really attempting with this talk is to make links to some more sort of classical problems of wrinkling and buckling that involve thin sheets. And so, I will also be showing you some wrinkling patterns, but also hopefully convince you that I have some. Hopefully, I convince you that I have some folding in my system, and I see period doubling and tripling as well when the pattern changes. Okay, so that's my motivation. So, here is the actual experiment. And here I want you to understand the details of how we do the experiment. So, first of all, we fabricate our channels for PDMS, and we use Silgert 184 in the sort of standard mixing ratio. So, this is quite kind of common in the literature. In the literature. And we make a microchannel, which is, for the purpose of this talk, fixed. So the cross-section is fixed. It's a rectangular cross-section to begin with. And it's 50 millimeters long, 5 millimeters wide, and it has depth of 100 microns. So this depth is not so important for the problem that we are doing. What matters is that we have a ratio of 10 to 1 in the horizontal direction. And then we bond, so we make this. And then we bond, so we make this phase, and then we bond it on top to the thin membrane. And we make the thin membrane by spin coating the same PDMS. And again, for the purpose of this talk, I'm not going to vary the thickness of the membrane. So it's 27 microns throughout. And then once we've kind of bonded the two together, then we start the experiment by inflating the membrane using a pressure controller. And so that ensures. Pressure controller. And so that ensures that throughout our experiment we have a constant pressure inside the microchannel. Once that's done, then we spread a small amount of silicon oil. So we use 20 centis of silicon oil over the membrane. We do so relatively quickly in two seconds and we watch it swell. And the way we watch it swell, we basically put the camera from the top and see what happens in the system. We also have a means of assessing. A means of assessing the information in the memory, we use prophylometry for that. So, we have a prophylometry device basically. And but the one thing I should point out is that for the most of the experiment, our membranes are actually covered. So, this is a transverse cross-section or a system. Yeah, go on. Wanted to be close to me. So, sorry, just to clarify the picture. So, the yellow is the PDMS. So, yes, so yellow is unfortunately covered PDMS, yes. And then this is the thin membrane. And what is the purple? And so, this is just a kind of a boundary for the means of so that our siliconol that we put in does not okay. So, what we should really In does not okay. So, what we should really pay attention to is the yellow, which is the yellow lie on the top, which is the membrane, and the membrane is supposed to be also PDMS. It's the same PDMS as the base. So, it's all silget 184. And between what you fill it with silicon oil. So, you in between, you eject just air so that we inflate it, and then we cover it with the silicon oil. And so, there is for the most of the experiment, you have a layer of a silicon oil at the top. Layer of a silicon oil at the top. Which is floating on the air? Yeah, it's floating. It's basically on top of the membrane, yes. And but we ensure that this pressure stays constant inside because we have a pressure controller, so we can adjust. Sorry, again, where is the I'm maybe it's clear, but this is the silicon oil is supposed to be not floating on air. No, no, no, no, no, it's floating on the membrane, it's a membrane. Okay, there is a layer of silicon oil on the top. Layer of silicon all on the top that swells the membrane. Okay. Okay. But the air inside has a constant pressure because we have a pressure controller, so we can control that, right? Okay, so hopefully that's clear. How should I match in the swelling? So is this a tiny bit of swelling or is this really a large scale change? Get all coming. Oh, oh, okay. All the details of that are coming. Yeah, I. Yeah, is there like a do you have some basic idea of like why did you decide to run this experiment? Like so it's a total accident. So we were looking at we were looking at a biomimetic problem of trying to model two phase displacement in a elasto-rigid network of channels. And my student put in silicone oil instead of glycerol, right? And he started sweating. And I was like, this is. Started swelling, and I was like, We decided it looked pretty. And then we started digging and realized there's loads of people actually looking into this problem. But we decided that was too complicated to do, right? The inside. And there was already paper that dealt with it. So we thought, okay, let's do it in a more controlled way. We've covered it with silicone oil and observe different patterns. Okay. And that's the whole story. Okay. So where was I? So, okay. So basically, we have. Okay, so basically we have this layer. The point I'm trying to make with the layer is: okay, we can watch the pattern transition from the top, but we can't do prophylometry measurements with the layer of oil at the top. So what we do is we get rid of the oil once the pattern has set, it does not evolve anymore. We get rid of the oil and then we can measure the deflection. And we can obviously measure before we deposit any oil as well what the deflection is. Okay. So, I also brought some microchannels. Unfortunately, all the silicon that was on top of them has evaporated, so you don't see the patterns, but you can see the microchannels themselves. Okay, so what's happening before the swelling? So before the swelling, we've inflated the microchannel. And so to begin with, we start with a membrane that looks a little bit like this. It's a side view. And so there is already a non-trivial deformation of the membrane. Is already a non-trivial deformation of the membrane to begin with, and so how we need to characterize that and understand what's happening. So, in order to so, this is the cartoon representation of how the membrane is deformed. This is transverse cross-section and longitudinal cross-section. It turns out that essentially our membrane is mostly tensioned, and there is a very thin boundary layer near the edges where we pin our membrane. To the good approximation of the To the good approximation, this membrane is in a state of plane stress, right? So obviously there are boundaries, but as long as you're away from the boundaries, it's equivalent, the deformation is equivalent to having an infinitely long membrane in that direction that's being inflated. And so in order to characterize it, you might want to use so-called bulge tests, which I've learned about from engineering literature. So that's something that engineers have been using for a while to characterize. Using for a while to characterize properties of the membranes. And what they do is they inflate the membrane and then they monitor the deflection of the membrane, in particular the maximum deflection of the membrane as a function of pressure, for example, or vice versa. And so it turns out that if you assume that you don't have any boundaries, that you're not pinned at these ends, then you can solve for the deformation of the membrane. And it just goes, it's basically a parabola with the pre-factor being. Parabola with the pre-factor being this maximum displacement in the middle, and then you can take that relationship. And here is that relationship, the dashed line is the relationship fitted to our experimental data that we obtained from prophylometry. And you can see that it works quite well. One thing to point out here is that, well, prophylometry is not very reliable when we have deep angles in the deformation, so that's where we're struggling to actually measure things. Uh, things, uh, but you know, usually towards the center, we can measure things, and there we see what's happening. And obviously, the formations are, yeah, you get up to one, yeah, they're quite large, yes. But I will, I'll come back to that because they're relatively large. Um, you know, obviously, this whole business assumes that we have um constitutively linear relationship between stresses and strains, it fails eventually. Strains, it fails eventually, but I will show that in a second. What I want to make a point here is that we have a very good procedure of making these channels. So, here we've obtained all of this data is measured over, you know, with different channels made on different days and in different cross sections away from that edge. And you can see they'll have a reproducible kind of data. So, going back to this relationship and Relationship that engineers use, basically, you can solve that problem. You can solve that problem exactly, assuming that you have an infinite channel that way. And you can solve it exactly with the finite channel using numerics and show that actually when you have large outspect ratios, as we do, 10 to 1, as long as you're away from these points here, that the solution does work, right? And so you can obtain the relationship between the pressure and the maximum deflection in both. The maximum deflection involves what this cubic relationship, and that's the kind of relationship that engineers typically use. Yeah, go on. I think that maybe to elaborate on our shades, so this is the non-linear relation that you use. Yes, but in my understanding is that this captures the this will work well if you have geometric nonlinearity on, but in this case, the last. Right. But in this case, the last deflection, in my understanding, indicates a non-Hookian response. In a second, I'll show you when that relationship fails. But for now, I want to advocate it. It does pretty well early on. And the point is, you can rescale your data. So you can see from here, if you divide your pressure by W0 and correct. Yeah. You have essentially you can fit for. Slope, you can obtain a slope, and you can obtain where it crosses the zero, and therefore you have your Young's modulus and you have your pre-stress in the system. And yes, it failed. You can see how it fails. So that's because you have constituents of nonlinearities in the system. Right. Does anybody solve the problem for the Neo-Hutton-solved? They have solved the problem for the Neo-Hokian solved. Yes, they have. But you have to do it numerically. And yeah, so okay, so this is before any swelling, and the numbers that are extracted, we have means of independently verifying this. We can just make cylinders of the same PDMS and check by compression. Basically, we get the same numbers out within the error bars. Okay, so then this is just that bit. We also verified what we obtained here by actually doing some numerics, and we did numerics. Some numerics, and we did numerics with the Foprom-Karman equations, assuming that we have pinned our membrane at the edges, and we supplied these parameters that we fitted for into the model. And so, here, I'm just going to remind you that this is just the vertical displacement. These are in-plane stresses. We have the initial stress, yes? I love that there are lots of questions. I love that there are lots of questions, by the way. Thank you. So, your analytical solutions from the previous slide, what equations were they solving to get those solutions? Are they solving the Gaussian? Yeah, so they're just saying there is tension. Basically, they're solving for Puman without bending terms. Yeah, so they dropped the nonlinear terms, right? No, they keep that, but they get rid of that. Oh, they drop that. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, um sorry, I was here, yeah. So we've solved that, and basically, that's this uh solid line, and again, it deviates from our measurements where we would expect it to deviate because of constitutional loneliness. Okay, so let me now move on to swelling and answer the questions that were asked before. And so, what can we say about swelling? So, the first thing we set to do is to actually measure To do is to actually measure the fusion coefficients in this problem and estimate the time scales in our system. And so we've done the following experiments. So we've made beads out of the same PTMS and put it in the same silicon oil. And then we looked at how the bead changes, how its diameter changes by swelling. And then we can basically fit the exponential to that measure to extract the equilibrium state once it's fully swollen. And from there, with a And from there, with the appropriate rescaling, extract the characteristic time scale for the swelling. So that allows us to estimate diffusion coefficient. And so we can see here, so these different data points are actually obtained in experiments done with beads, which were left to kind of age for different amounts of time. So what we see here is that, so this is, this is, we make a bead and do experiment immediately. And this is after 30 days. So there is an aging going on in these people. On in these PDMS materials. And so, depending on kind of which experiment you do, you get a factor of two in the diffusion coefficient. But ultimately, what we expect in terms of time scales in our experiment is we expect the swelling to happen around one minute from the point when we kind of cover the sheet with the silicon oil. We also did the following experiment. We wanted to The following experiment, we wanted to estimate what the swelling does to our membrane. And so, to a good approximation, we have a uniform expansion after swelling of the material. And so, the way we've confirmed this is by doing two complementary experiments. So, first, we've made squares of the same thickness as the membranes in our channels, and then we've covered them with the silicon oil and looked at how the area changes as it swells. Changes as it swells, and then allows us to estimate that unit of length elongates by basically around 17 percent. But using this method, we couldn't really measure the thickness changes very well. So we've confirmed that there is indeed uniform expansion by making cylinders as well out of the same material and again, swelling them in silicone oil and looking how much they change by. And in there, depending, you know, independent of whether or not you look at the height or the area changes in a silicon. The area changes in a cylinder, you get sort of the unit length elongation, but about 15%. So, anywhere between 15 and 17% is how much the unit length changes. We've also taken these cylinders and we've put them into instrument machines. And again, to order one approximation, we get that our Young's modulus decreases a little bit as a result of swelling. And so overall, And so, overall, the sheets expand, but they also become softer. So, when we combine the two, we think that this is quite constant, E being the Einstein T being the thickness of the sheet. Okay, so once we've done that, what is the consequence of this? Okay, so our sheets become a bit softer, but they become bigger, right? They expand. And so the result of that, in the current geometry, you must have some sort of compressive stress in the system. Compressive stress in the system, right? You simply cannot accommodate within the given sort of area of the channel. You can't accommodate the excess length. And so just to confirm that's indeed the case, we also done bulge tests with the channels that have been swollen already. And we can again do the same, you know, plot the same relationships as before. And we indeed get that at if we were to completely deflate our Our membrane, we would get compressive stress in there simply because we've exceeded the size of the original rectangle. Okay, but because of the channel geometry, again, we don't have, and this is confirmed by numerics, we don't have compressive stresses in the transverse direction. Our compressive stresses are in the longitudinal direction. And because of the longitudinal direction, compressive stresses, that means that we would expect Would expect wrinkling to occur sort of in this direction. So that just comes from the, yes? So why you don't have compressive stresses in the transverse direction? Why aren't there any compressive stresses in this direction? Our sheet is inflated. It's under tension. Well, but you can, if you swell it enough, it can overcome. Of course, but not in the regimes. Overcoming. Of course, but not in the regimes in which we are operating. So that's all I'm saying. Well, okay. Thank you. You must have thought about this, but the swelling is happening to a membrane that's already under anisotropic state of stress, right? Yes. So that swelling. Right. Yes. So that swelling is happening sort of microscopically by the polymers rearranging. And that rearrangement, the actual swelling, should then be probably anisotropic. Right? It's a, yes. I have a very, so we thought long and hard about this, and I have a very kind of simplistic view of things at the moment. So I don't think that matters massively, but I'll hopefully. But I'll hopefully convince you of that towards the end of the talk. That's all I can say at this stage. I think everything under the same tension, so everything should swell isotropically. It swells isotropically, but you might get, you know, throughout the swelling, it might not ultimately be isotropic. That's what I'm hoping. But you might dynamically, you know, throughout the process, you might not swell equally. You know, if you watch the minute of swelling. If you watch the minute of swelling, it might not be equal everywhere. The swelling that comes from the blood could be anisotropically biased by the stress. I don't think it is. Yes, we'll see if we can discuss a bit more. Okay, so this is this is the, I'm just going to speed up a little bit because I'm being a bit slow. But basically, this is the pattern transition that we see. Is the pattern transition that we see, and this is at two different pressures inside the channel. And you can see that what I want you to notice is that indeed the time scales that we've predicted are sort of of the right order of magnitude. And for both of these patterns, whether or not you end up with the alternating folding or connected folds in the end, and I use the word folds here loosely, all I mean is larger amplitude deformations basically. Deformations basically, you undergo sort of this initial stage where basically you have a small amplitude deformations, undulations, right, first. And then you end up with these patterns at the end. And so we wanted to see first whether or not we can say something about those small amplitudes. And the one thing that we could measure reliably is the wavelength of this initial wrinkling. So we could look at the wavelength as a function of Length as a function of initial pressure inside the channel. Sorry, go ahead. My apologies. In the last slide, can you just explain the color code of the what is black and what is white? White is plain and black is steep slopes. How should I think about that? So it's a very good point. And this is hard to interpret, right? Because, of course, our membranes are bulged out. And then on top of that, you see some wrinkling pattern, right? So the dark regions are regions of the highest. Dark regions are regions of the highest slope, essentially. So, this is like shadow graph imaging. You have light coming through bright fields. That's right, and then regions which are darker are steeper, so they deflect light out. Yeah, correct. But you can't do on linear mapping or anything like that. We are still not there yet, but there are things that we can do. Like, if you put like a fluorescent dye in the fluids. In the fluid itself will go in there and then you can dissolve in soda only will also be in PPMS so they will just go edit the fluid even they will not say in liquid which is saying diffuse as well in the pure PDMS form so they know so what we're trying to do we're trying to do two things so we're trying to do prophylometry measurements still and Prophylometry measurements still. And the other thing we're trying to do is we're trying to do, we're trying to put for the wavelength extraction, we're trying to play with putting lines below at the bottom of the channel and seeing the deformation of those lines. So those are the two things we're trying basically. But we're fairly certain about the measurements that I'm showing you today. Error bars are big though, and you will notice that basically. So we have the, so this is. So, we have the so this is going back to initial winkling, we have the wavelength as a function of the pressure. You can see that it decreases. And so, okay, how can we interpret that? So, when I first saw this problem, I thought, oh, this reminds me a little bit of, you know, the problem I call my sleeve problem. So, fortunately, I don't have long sleeves right now. But basically, when you have a sleeve around your cylindrical hand and then you start pushing it towards your elbow, then eventually. Your elbow, then eventually you will wrinkle it, right? And you can ask a question of what is the stability, how does this wave number depend in the problem, on the properties of the problem. Another problem that is currently being studied in our lab, which is, I think, also relevant to this system, is the one with cylinders. So in this case, pressurized cylinders, in this case, thin box with doing a This case, uh, Finn Box who is doing experiments is using cans of coke that are filled with liquid and they're being compressed top to bottom. And you can see that there is also this very regular wrinkling pattern appearing. And so why do I think that's relevant? Where this is something that's very well known in the literature, people have looked for a very long time for or solved over 50 years ago problems of. Ago, problems of stability of infinitely long cylinders that are either pressurized or not under compressive stresses, under torsion, etc. You can ask, how did this cylinder lose stability? And so the way you can do that is by basically writing down minimization energy problem. You add up bending and stretching, plus if there are some external forces, you add up those, and you solve a minimum energy problem. And you solve a minimum energy problem. And then, if you do so, then you end up with the wavelength. So, this is just the linear stability problem for the infinitely long cylinder. And the wavelength goes like a square root of radius times the thickness of the cylinder. So, what I'm claiming here is that as long as I'm away from these boundaries, and if I just look at the strip at the top of that membrane that I'm dealing with versus the cylinder, then I have. Versus the cylinder, then I have the same problem, right? So, what I'm claiming is that my pressure is basically there to provide some curvature to my membrane, and then the stability problems are the same. So, is this the case? Well, this is the scaling argument that I built, which might be totally wrong, so please argue. But basically, we expect the wavelength to go like a square root of the radius, and we can estimate the radius by looking at the curvature of. By looking at the curvature of our deformation around that point, there, right? And so the radius of the corresponding cylinder goes like one over the maximum displacement of the sheet. From our membrane equations, the ones that I've solved initially and the bulge test that I've shown you, we have that the pressure goes like the maximum displacement cubed. And that, you know, we can again debate that because there are constitutive non-linearities, etc. But the first approximation that's But the first approximation that's true. And so, if I combine all of this, then I should expect the wavelength to go like the pressure to the power minus one six. And so, I've asked my student to send me the data and it works. Okay, so what I think is happening here is that at least this initial wrinkling is just the linear instability of a cylinder-like shape that's being compressed. And it's being compressed because of the swelling. Right, so that's. Right, so that's something that I'm kind of okay with, but then the question is because pressure goes as omega naught to the q versus it was this, yes. Initially, it's a cylinder which is expanding. Should I no, this is this I'm extracting from the bulge test that I did for my membrane. Oh, okay, right. Did for my membrane. Oh, okay. Right. So, this is just that relationship I showed you a few slides ago. So, first of all, I believe that, so you, what's the ratio between the so W naught is the height, right? Yes. The deflection. This one, the maximum. And what is the what is the? What is the width? The width is 2a. And w naught is larger or smaller than 2a? W naught is much smaller than that. Then the radius of curvature is not 1 over w naught, it's w naught over a square or 2a square. Okay. Let's talk about that. Yeah. Okay. So let me move on. Whether or not my scaling works with initial wrinkling, I can tell you something about nonlinear patterns. And again, I've showed you this already. So we go from alternating folds to connected folds as we change the internal pressure. And we also have for the pressures in between, we do have states in which we end up with the sort of mixed state folding. So parts of our channel follow the The alternating pattern, and then parts of them follow the connected folds pattern. Okay, so what can we say about that? And why did I initially claim that my wrinkles had nothing to do with telephone cord? The reason why I said that is because if you look very carefully here, the wavelength of the pattern that you measure will depend on very strongly on where you measure it, right? And so what we've done is What we've done is we've basically went along these lines and measured the wavelengths of our pattern, and we ended up with a hierarchical pattern. So the wavelength of our pattern changed. And of course, when I saw first, we saw this first for the first time, immediately reminded us of these works. And I've included Benny's work and Josette because work here for that reason. And again, they have very nice, beautiful. And again, they have very nice, beautiful arguments of energy minimization to show that the wavelength should vary with the distance away from the boundary. And depending on specifics of the problem, they predict self-similar variation. But the point is that this power here is always less than one. So now, what about our data? So, this is our data. Data. So, this is our data. And again, I should say that. So, this is the wavelength as a function of y, which is the coordinates away from the edge. We can't deal with this just yet because of all the issues that I've mentioned before. But in this region, you can try and attempt to fit a Paulo relationship. And, regardless of what the final n is, it's definitely more than one. At least that's what our measurements say so far. Measurements say so far. Another thing that's quite striking is that eventually, we, as we kind of go away from the boundary, so about one millimeter into the channel, and remember they're five millimeters wide, we essentially saturate the wavelength. So we get the same measurement for the wavelength. Right, so what else can we say? So, this is the thing that we've now focused on, and we've basically decided to measure that throughout. And if you look at our patterns, you see that that. If you look at our patterns, you see that that wavelength that we saturated to decreases with the pressure initially. And then we reach the state of mixed pattern. And then that's when the wavelength starts increasing again. And so, okay, we've looked at this and this, you know, does something. Okay. Can we make a sense of it? And so then we've basically decided. So, then we've basically decided to divide that wavelength with the wavelength of initial wrinkling that we had. And what we obtained is the following: so, all our alternating patterns ended up basically showing a period doubling type transition in patterns. So, you can see that the wavelength measured in the middle is twice the wavelength of the initial wrinkles that we had. And then, when it comes to connected folds, It comes to connected folds, yes. The initial one is the one that the linear stability. Sorry? I just repeated the question. Yes. What do you mean by initial? Right. The initial ones are the cylinder argument that we can still discuss afterwards. So the ones that you first, the first undulations you see linear stability of the lambda two is the saturated one is the is this one. Yeah, those are in the middle. So basically, from one millimeter onwards until one millimeter from the other side, basically. So it's not in time, but basically, what is not in time. So I'm not doing anything. So in time, I guess in time is initial versus the final pattern at the very end. So you claim basically that lambda one, the wavelengths near the edge, remains the same at threshold and above threshold. And the only thing that changes is. And the only thing that changes is lambda 2 as you keep increasing the pressure. Yes, but not quite because lambda 1 also decreases. Here, you do see, you know, if you measure there, you see something that's basically lambda 1 over 2. Right? Okay. So it's not remaining the same. But what I'm saying is that this wave number here in the middle is just twice the lambda one. At least that what our measurement says. What our measurements say so far, and I guess for me personally, this was also nice for confirmation. So, this is now the mixed pattern where we see both alternating as well as connected folds. And if we just look at the wave number of the patches, which are in alternating folds, then we get the two. And if we go to the connected folds, we get the three. So, there is, I think, strong evidence that there is some period doubling of some sort and tripling. Okay. Some sorts and triple A. Okay. So this is a question that I kind of, the way I'm thinking about it now, but you know, I'm happy to be corrected. I wonder if this is the confirmation that we have that what we're looking at is some form of instability of a non-linear state that was resulting from this initial wrinkling. So the fact that our wrinkling does not happen instantaneously, you have first this initial wrinkling that we see. Wrinkling that we see. Is it possible that what we see at the end is just yet another stability of this intermediate non-trivial state? Can I interrupt and ask a question from the online audience? Yes, of course. For me, actually. Can you clarify during the swelling process, what is the boundary condition at the top and the bottom? Top and bottom. I think you said pinned, pinned boundaries. So at the edges, it's pinned, yes. So around the edges of the channel. of the of the of the channel yes just in there and it remains pinned it remains pinned throughout this one pin throughout yeah thanks clamp well not pinned right clamped zero zero derivative uh of the of the slope zero derivative of the slope and zero displacement there clamped but in the meantime the film has expanded and so it's clamped from the film's viewpoint in a compressed state that's right okay thanks That's right, okay. Thanks. This is yeah, yeah, okay. So, this is I'm getting to the end. I'm sorry, and I'm really glad you asked me all these questions because they're making me think about this problem. But here is here is the question. How do we understand this transition? And I have no answer yet. And this is what we intend to do. So, what we really want to do is just basically try and see this transition in our numerics, right? One way of thinking about it. One way of thinking about it. And so we want to solve this problem by basically varying p and modeling the swelling using the appropriate pre-stress, so treating this as the parameter. This is quite hard to do because you can imagine that it's not just as simple as plugging in these two values and computing. There's loads of solutions there, and it's very hard to track those solutions. Track those solutions. But this is the experiment that reassures me that such things would possibly work. And this is what we've done in the experiments. And we basically swollen our system to begin with at the given pressure. And we ended up with the alternating fault as one would expect. And then we've increased the internal pressure inside our channel. And what we can see is that we go from these alternating modes to Alternating modes to faults to eventually connected faults. So that's going back to your question earlier: whether or not the details of the spelling matter. I don't think so. I think ultimately the fact that we can reproduce these two states just by alternating the way we do the experiments reassuring. However, that's of course not the whole story. So if we now try to deflate and see whether or not we can go back to And see whether or not we can go back to alternating folds. And it's not as simple. And we see all sorts of frustration in the system. And then very final slide I wanted to show. This is because I've seen loads of similar images. Let me keep that. Lots of similar images yesterday when we were doing our introductions. This is kind of a fun thing we've tried as well is we've swollen the membrane and got The membrane and we've got alternating mode, and then we deflated it. And we've got a packing of this membrane within the bottom of our chow. I've seen a few people show very similar images yesterday. So I thought that's kind of similar to other people's work. But what's nice about this is that you basically preserve the same wavelengths that you've measured there in the channel. Okay, so that's me. Thank you very much for all of your questions. Questions. Okay. Thank you. You can continue being grilled while we set up the next speaker, I think. There's a question from the online audience. Dick James has a question. Maybe you can go first. I can't see it in the chat. Is it there somewhere? No, he just raised his hand. Oh, go ahead. Yeah, thank you very much. Very interesting talk. So it reminds me a little bit. It reminds me a little bit of old work, very old work, maybe 1950s or 60s, of Alan Gent. And he put rubber strips in compression, usually by bending them and looking at the inside of the bend. And they were transparent so you could really see. And there was an instability, sort of like yours. And it was, but it was noticed. But it was noticed, and either he noticed it or some later people, that it was not given by linear stability analysis. And the kind of tangent to the beam was sharply changing. It was a very sharp instability. And so the onset of that was, and it's been of great interest in the mathematical community because. Mathematical community because the known methods of doing metastability and the calculus of variations don't handle this case. It's a big, huge open problem. So I thought that yours had a little bit this flavor, although you did show that linear stability analysis did seem to agree with the initials. I mean, Betty thinks otherwise, but yeah. Of course, another possibility is it's just post-bifurcation. Just post-bifurcation, you're far away from the bifurcation, of course, something anything can happen, you know. So, sure. Thank you. I will look up the reference because I'm not aware of it. Thank you. It's Alan Gent, G-E-N-T. Okay. Thank you. Really? Okay. Thank you. We're eating into coffee break now. Sorry. I'll be quick because we do have another talk coming. I think you're early in your talk, you pointed to the work by Van de Par. And there's, in fact, there's other work too on coarsening of folds in a blister that's compressed at the edges or in hanging drapes. And I agree that the analogy seems very strong. That the analogy seems very strong, but your membrane is curved. Yes, of course. And all that work is on flat, exactly. So you have very different curvature will completely change the answer. Benny's work on the substrate effect that comes from the curvature is along those lines. So I agree with the analogy, but the quantitative comparison. Absolutely. And I think that's the reason. Exactly. That's why we have n greater than one. It's as simple as that. I totally agree. As simple as that, I totally agree. So, but I don't know, I still don't know what it is. Yeah, it's yet to be established. Yeah, thank you.
