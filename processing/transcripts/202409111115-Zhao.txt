And today I'm going to talk about machine learning orbital-free density functional theory for top-ink nuclei. And this gives the outline of my talk. I don't think I need to introduce you what is a density functional theory, but in the first part, I will mainly focus on how we implement this idea to nuclear systems. Systems and things became a little bit different from this electron systems. And then I was focusing on the machine learning orbital free density function theory for nuclei. Actually, it's just a straightforward implementation of all these ideas in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry to nuclear systems. Of course, we have to treat, we have some special issue to be. Special issue to be considered in nuclear systems. And finally, I will talk about nuclear deformation from the orbital free density function theory because in atomic physics or electron systems, you don't really need to consider this deformation because the shape is fully determined by this actinal field. But for nuclear system, it's a self-bound system. So we have to look at its deformation. Look at this deformation. Okay, so the major goal of the nuclear manybody problem is to understand the nuclear properties from a unified theoretical wheel rooted in the forces among nucleons. The nuclear-nuclean force is essentially from the strong interaction, so it's much more complicated than the coolant force, even in the vacuum. For us, even in the vacuum. So, in principle, we should start from the QCD, but as you may know, this QCD is highly non-perturbative in the low energy region. So essentially, you can very easily write down this Laglaunging of the QCD with the degrees of freedom of clocks. However, it is very difficult to solve that Lag Launging. So, usually we have So, usually, we have to start from some so-called effective field theory, which respect the symptom satisfied by QCD. For example, the Chiral symmetry or the Lorentz symptom, something like that. And in this effective field theory, we use the degrees of freedom of nucleans, but not quarks. So, the nucleons are interactive with each other by exchanging pion mesons. And in this case, And in this case, we can guess a nuclear nuclear intaction. And based on this kind of nuclear nuclear intaction, we can do somehow the so-called abinatial calculation. But this is just the terminology. In principle, you should do up initial from the QCD. But in nuclear physics, in the field of nuclear physics, we call this kind of calculations up initial calculation. That means we start from the nuclear nuclear force in the vacuum. Falls in the vacuum. Okay, and however, this kind of calculation is still not quite easy because the nuclear-nuclear force has a very strong repulsive core. Because they are very nuclear, two nucleons, even in the vacuum, the repulsion is very strong at a short distance. And then, if you use this kind of interaction to directly do the manipulated calculation. Directly do the mandible calculation, then you need a very, very large space. So, this is a kind of another kind of non-perturbative nature of the nuclear mandibility problem. So, apart from this ab initial calculation, we have also this shell model calculation, which uses a kind of effective interaction defined in a given configuration space. Given configuration space, this is something equivalent to the condensed matter physics configuration intection calculations. And finally, of course, we have this density functional theory. It starts from the effective nuclear-nuclear interaction in the nuclear medium. That means we do not use the two nucleons, two nuclear interactions in the vacuum. So, in this sense, this strong repulsive core. Positive core can be removed. And actually, from this direction, you see that at the QCD level, we can very easily write down the Laglan gene, but it is hard to solve. But for a density functional theory, it's relatively easy to solve as compared to the QCD, of course. But in this sense, we have no good definition of the nuclear-nuclear interaction because everything is in the nuclear medium. In the nuclear medium. So, this is the philosophy. So, I'm not going to touch the details of the density functional theory because you are all these experts in the field. And I just want to remind you that originally, this density functional theory is developed for electron systems. So, when you prove this Hohenberg-Kon theorem, it proves the existence of this energy density functional. It is a universal for quantum many body. Is a universal for quantum many body problem. There's an external field. For example, here I show you the external field of harmonic oscillator potential trapped several electrons. And in the scheme of construction density functional theory, which is also the traditional calculation in nuclear physics, then you write this kinetic energy by introducing these constant orbiters. This construction orbiters. And of course, this construction orbiters is connected to density, and you need to calculate it from the solving conch equation. And the system must be solved self-consistently. And the practical usefulness of this conch theory depends totally on whether an accurate energy density functional can be found or not. This is, of course, for the electron systems. So when we apply Apply this kind of framework to nuclear system, then we have several differences. First, as I mentioned, the nuclear force is much more complicated. We should not only consider the central force, but also the tensor force, for example, which means that you have to include more degrees of freedom from this interaction. Of freedom for this from this interaction, we have to consider spin-orbit interaction and spin-spin interaction, and also tensor interaction. And also, we have two kinds of nucleons, proton and neutron. So, we have to take into account the isospin degrees of freedom. And the ground state of most nuclei is a superfluid state. So, we have to consider the pairing correlations between nucleons. Not only the neutron-neutron, proton-proton coupre pairs, but also the Cooper pairs, but also the neutron proton cooper pairs. So I will give an example below. And another important point is that nuclei are self-bound systems. So there's no external field. So the density functional theory for nuclear system is essentially defined in the intrinsic frame. So the density is intrinsic density. So this is why the nucleus can be deformed in the intrinsic frame. Can be deformed in the intrinsic frame. And at present, all this, because this nuclear force is very complicated. So, at present, all the successful energy density functions for nuclear system are phenomenological. That means it has no direct connection to the two nuclear or three nuclear interactions in a vacuum. And this kind of phenomenological functionals has to be adjusted to the properties of nuclear matter. Properties of nuclear matter, which is essentially an ideal system to simulate the neutron star properties. You can get some observations or constraints from the neutron star observations to these properties of nuclear matter and also finite nuclear, several finite nuclear. And in the future, we are actually now doing very hard to connect this kind of phenomenological functionality to our The phenomenological functional to our initial calculations. So, here I give you an example how this energy density functional performs for nuclear systems. This is a covariate density functional. That means for this functional, we respect the Lorentz symmetry. And it's called PCTQ1. And this PK is just a PK university, by the way. By the way, and here I show you the mass difference between the density functional calculations and the experimental data for all the even-even nuclei with mass measured at the moment. So the color shows the difference and you see for most nuclei, the mass difference is less than one MeV. One MeV, that means one million EV. E way in standard of the standard of condensed matter physics, this is nothing, but for nuclear physics, this is a very high accuracy, actually. So if you calculate the root mean square deviation, it's around 1 MeV. And that means in average, we can get an accuracy of 1 MeV for each nucleus by the energy. What does this mean? What does this mean? If you take a light nuclei, for example, oxygen-16, you have 16 nucleons in this system. The total binding energy of this system is about 127 MeV. So that means for a light system, this accuracy is less than 1%. If you look at a high-wave nucleus, for example, LED28, it has 208 nucleons in the system. The body energy, the total body energy, The body energy, the total body energy is around 1600 MeV. So, one MeV means essentially for high-wave nucleus, this x-rays is less than 0.1%. So, this is what we can achieve at the moment for nuclear mass from the nuclear density function theory. And actually, if you compare this functional with many other functionals in the market, this is to my knowledge among. To my knowledge, among the best density functional description for nuclear masses. And not only for the mass has been measured, but such accuracy could already explain some, help to explain some very novel effects observed in the experiment. Here, I just give you an example. This is For example, this is some mass measured from the Lanzhou facility. They measured this mass of the unequal Z nuclei. That means the proton and neutral numbers are equal in this nucleus. Then, depends on the proton number is even or odd, you can You can classify this kind of nuclear as two groups. One is the even-even nucleus, the other one is the odd-odd nucleus. Here, I don't give you the mass, but the double binding energy difference. That is the kind of the double differential of the mass with respect to the neutron partal number. So, it is a very fine structure of this mass surface. Then, experimentally, Then experimentally, they found that actually for this even-even and even odd-odd nucleus, the tendency is quite different. And if you compare to all these theoretical predictions, no theory can explain this bifurcation. However, if we do the calculation with the so-called PCTQ1 density functional calculation, Density functional calculation, in particular, when we consider this neutron-proton pairing correlations, then you immediately get this tendency. So the solid line shows the results with the neutron-proton pairing, and the dashed lines shows the results without the neutron-prong pairing. So you see, we can very nicely reproduce these experimental observations. So, this is just an example to show you how the density functional theory performs for nuclear system. Okay, then I move to all these calculations are based on constant density function theory. And now I move to the orbital free density function theory. Even for the electron systems, this orbital free density function, if you look at the test book, read the test book, the most difficult part is for this. Difficult part is for this kinetic energy because for the Kaunchian case, we can introduce the Kaunjan orbitals. But if you do an orbital free density function, the difficulty is to write down this kinetic energy density function. The Thomas Fermi, of course, from the textbook, Thomas Fermi is naturally a density functional orbital-free density functional theory. And if you look at this performance of the Thomas-Fermi function of atoms, Functional for atom physics, then there's no shell effects. This is commonly known. For example, here for this atom, this Hartree-Fold calculation has very strong oscillations. But if you look at Thomas-Fermi results, there's no oscillations. So it's not accurate enough because there's no shell effects. This is for atom physics. And also for nuclear physics. For nuclear systems. Actually, in the end of 1990s, there has been a lot of efforts to develop orbital-free density function of nuclear systems. Here is the based on the Thomas Fermi. They do a lot of extensions, expansions to improve Thomas-Fermi functional. So here I give you an example for this LED 208. This is the prototype density distribution. A portal density distribution as a function of the radial coordinate. So you see, if you look at the cartridge for calculation, there's still some oscillations in the central part of the density distribution. But if you do a Thomas-Fermi, whenever you improve it to any order, this central density is almost a constant. So there's no oscillation. Constant. So there's no oscillations. So again, there's no shell effects for nuclear systems. So of course, this accuracy is not enough. But numerically, this orbital freedom function is quite efficient in computation. So here is a people has tried a lot of work to develop a high accuracy object. Work to develop a high-accuracy orbital free density functional, but after 20 years, the conclusion is that maybe this simply doesn't work for nuclear systems. And then we noticed that in condensed matter physics or quantum chemistry, actually by using this machine learning approach, they can really develop a very high accurate orbital free density function theory. So we just Function theory. So we just follow all these works. I don't think I list all of them, but there are many. And we just take these ideas and try to develop orbital freedom functional to solve the nuclear system. And this is our work two years ago published, and it is the first machine learning nuclear energy density functional, actually. Energy density functional actually, and of course, this is just a calculation of principle proof of a principle case. So, we take just three spherical nuclei in this paper. So, here I just want to emphasize that what is the advantage or what is special when you work for orbital free machine learning orbital free density function for nuclear systems? Okay, we start from the Okay, we start from the Hohenberg concern, and we know that there must be an exact energy density functional, but we do not know the expression. And the Thomas-Fermi functional is not accurate. However, if you do machine learning for nuclear systems, actually we have a very big advantage in my opinion. Here, I show you all the density distribution for thousands of nuclei. So, this is essentially what we do. So, this is essentially what we just want to investigate for material sense, because you can really do experiment to control or design all kinds of materials, but you cannot design a nuclear because this strong interaction, we have no tool to control them. So, you just produce this nucleus, then you observe. So, this is what we can do. So, there are thousands of nucleus. Thousands of nucleus, and if you calculate, look at all this, the density distribution of all these nuclei, it just looks like this. So, this they have the very general factor. In the central density, you see this is essentially a constant. It's just close to 0.16, 0.15 density. So, this reflects the saturation property of the nuclear force. Property of the nuclear force. It's a short-range force. It's not just not, it doesn't like a cooling force, it's a long-range force. And then at the surface, it's gradually dropped to zero. So this is all the, essentially, this is all the density distribution we need to consider in our machine learning database. So it is quite easy to build a data set for nuclear system. And we can actually base. And we can actually, based on this machine learning, to do a regression in a functional space. And this space we can is a very limited space actually. And essentially, we do interpolation because there's no nuclear very novel. All the nuclear just look like this because this is guaranteed by the nuclear force, the saturation properties of the nuclear force. And of course, because of Hotenberg's theorem, there must be a By conservation, there must be an energy functional. So then we prepare our data set. So here I show you, we just write the total energy density functional into two parts. First part is the kinetic part. And this will be obtained from the machine learning approach. And the second part is the interaction part. And because there's no external field, so this interaction. External field. So, this interaction part means all the energy from the nuclear nuclear interaction. And now we take this because we have no accurate knowledge about this nuclear nuclear force, so we just take an effective force, for example, this SKP. It is a well-determined nuclear nuclear force. Yes. And then to do machine learning, we have to prepare the database. Database. The database means we need to generate many, many nuclear density distribution and the corresponding kinetic energy of this density profile. And we have exact knowledge about the kinetic energy of non-interacting systems, assuming that we have several nucleons. And there's no interaction between them. Then we can calculate exactly the kinetic energy and the density profile. So we can trap, imagine that we can trap this nucleus in an external field. Then you can change the external field into whatever shape you like. Then you can produce a lot of density profile, nucleon density profile. And then you just solve a one-body Schrodinger equation, you got this kinetic energy. So this can. Kinetic energy. So, this calculation is very easy, and you can repeat them many, many, many times. And finally, we can generate, for example, this 30,000 samples of the density profile and also the corresponding kinetic energy. Of course, you do not always get a reasonable density profile because, as I said, this nuclear densities profile must be like this in this. Profile must be like this in this form. So when you get a central density, it is much higher than this value. You just exclude it from the data set because it's not a nucleus. So based on this data set, we can do a machine learning. In principle, we can use a machine learning model. For example, this neural network and all kinds of sophisticated neural networks to do this. But at the very beginning, we just take. But at the very beginning, we take this very simple network, it's called kernel radio regression. The energy density functional is just a weighted sum of this kernel function. And this kernel function, we take it as a Gaussian shape. And then by minimizing this loss function, we got this. We just need to solve this linear equation. And And here the input is just from the data set. You've got the energy, you've got the density profile and the corresponding energy. Then you can solve this equation to get the omega. This is the weight. With this weight, you can predict the energy of any given density profile. So this is the idea. And here in this network, we have two hyper parameter, lambda and sigma. Uh, parameter lambda and sigma, and they are determined by this validation set to compare the accuracy of the validation set and the test set. This is all standard techniques in machine learning. Okay, then we have checked the generalization power of this system. We train on a small representative dataset, and the model should. set and the model should generalize to unseen data and in particular for nuclear physics the model should have has to be valid for arbitrary system sizes for example here this is the mass number that means how many nucleons are there in the system and this is the kinetic energy per nucleon so for the for the circles black circles is just the system that we trained That we trained. This is an example. We train for this data set, this system says, for example, the nuclear mass number 16 and so on. And then we predict the kinetic energy per nuclear with the machine learning results for all the system. So here I give you in red. And by in comparison with this, By in comparison with this result, I show you also this conchum calculations. Here, you can regard this conchum calculation as a kind of very accurate calculation, exact calculation. So, you see this orbital-free results can reproduce the conchum results very nicely. In particular, there are some oscillations. This reflects the quantum shear effects. So, here we can really get this shear effects by learning from only this small. A small set of the training set. And also, if you look at this Thomas Fermi and the extended Thomas Fermi results, it's not that accurate in compared with the consumpt results because there's a missing of these shell effects. Once we have an accurate kinetic energy density functional, then we should do a self-consistent iteration to solve. iteration to solve the to do an iteration to to get the ground state to do a vibration of this energy density functional so here i show you the vibration process so we take the three spherical nuclei as example helium 4 oxygen 16 and calcium 40 and we start from a trial density this green line and then we just do a gradient Uh, gradient, uh, very simple gradient iteration evaluation, and then finally, based on this machine learning orbital free density functional, we got this right line. And this constant results is a blue line. So you see that we can get very accurate dense ground state density profile from our machine learning density function. The green region shows you the data set we are using to. Data set we are using to train the network. So you see here the trail density is always in the training set. But this is just to speed up the iteration. You don't really need to do that. For example, here for helium 4, if we start from such a trail density, which is far away from the data set. Data set, still, you can get finally very accurate ground state density profile. So, this iteration self-consistent solution is very robust, no matter where you start from. And finally, I just compare this, I just show you the accuracy of this energy density functional. So, again, for these three spherical nucleus, this is a total. Nucleus, this is the total energy. So, this is the Khan-Shan results, and this is the machine learning results, and this is the experimental data. So, you see, we can really compare to the Khan-Shan and the experimental data based on the orbital-free density functional. If you compare these results with the previous, for example, the Thomas-Fermi results, we have a very significant improvement, not only for the body energy, but also. Not only for the binding energy, but also for the radius. And if you look at this density profile, so here from this, this is a Thomas Fermi, so there's no share effects, but when you do machine learning, you have this share effects. So everything so far, so good. Then people always ask, you should have deformation, because one of the significant evidence of the quantum shear effects is the nuclear deformation. Is the nuclear deformation. Nuclear deformation is related to very fine structure of these quantum shear effects. So, this is really a challenge. How to define a nuclear deformation? You can define a nuclear shape. You can define the nuclear surface and do expansion of this nuclear surface by the spherical harmonics. And it depends on what order you are truncated this expansion, you got the nuclear shape. You got a nuclear shape. For example, here, if lambda equals two, you get, if lambda equals zero, you got a spherical shape. If the lambda equals two, you got all this quadruple shape, oblate, prolate, triaxial shape. If lambda equals three, you got this octopus shape, this reflection asymmetric shape, and so on. This kind of nuclear shape is very important to nuclear physics. For example, most of the actually, apart from Actually, apart from the closed shell nuclei, most nuclei are deformed in the nuclear shape chart. Here, I just show you an example of how this nuclear deformation is important to explain the data. This is a recent result. Experimentally, for this nobelium-254, this is a super heavy nuclear. They can measure the rotational band of this nucleus. Band of this nucleus. So here is the rotational moment of inertia as a function of the rotational frequency, how fast you rotate this nucleus. This is the experimental data. If you take into account all kinds of deformation, you got the right line. So you can really reproduce this data. However, if you switch off the beta six, that means you expand it. It's a very high order deformation. I don't have an English word on that. So, you immediately deviate it from the data. So, this deformation is very important and very sensitive to the experimental data. So, normally, we can only get a deformation by doing the conchum calculation. By doing orbital-free calculation, you can only get the ground state, you can only get the spherical shape. This is a kind of textbook challenge. If you look at read the textbook of nuclear physics for any. Textbook of nuclear physics for any orbital free density functional calculation, you can only get a spherical shape. You cannot describe the deformation. So now we apply our framework to this oxygen-16 and Nio-20. This is a closed shell nucleus, so it must be spherical. And here I show you the total energy as a function of the deformation. So that means if you look at the ground state here, this is the Look at the ground state here. This is the minimum total energy at this point. It corresponds to beta equals zero. That means this oxygen 16 take its minimum energy at a spherical shape. So this is because it's closed shell. However, if you look at Neo20, the blue is a conjunct calculation. So you get the minimum state here and it corresponds to a non-zero. It corresponds to a non-zero beta. That means this nucleus is correlated evolved. And if you do Thomas-Fermi calculation and also the extended Thomas-Fermi calculation, you can never get, you always get a beta equal zero ground state. You can never get a deformation. However, if you look at this right, we do our machine learning calculation for neotenti in particular, we got this deformed state. We got this deformed state. And here I show you just this density profile. You see, it's just a parallelate shape, it's not a spiral shape. So we can really get this deformation from the nuclear system. That means we can treat these quantum shear effects very accurately. Okay, this comes to my summary. We have applied the machine learning approach to build the orbital-free density functional theory for atomic nuclei. Atomic nuclei. And the background is that the existing orbital free density function are essentially based on Thomas-Fermi approach. It's not accurate enough because it has no quantum share effects. That leads to the challenge that we cannot describe the nuclear deformation. However, once we do a machine learning orbital freedom functional theory, we can get a robust and accurate result for nuclear ground state. Accurate results for nuclear ground state, and it works both for spherical and deformed nuclei, and it's computationally efficient. In the next, we are going to expand this calculation to a global calculation for the whole nuclear chart. At the moment, we just take several nuclear as an example. And we are going to do time-dependent case because, in nuclear physics, the nuclear reaction is a very important. Very important aspect to explore the properties of the nucleus. So, by doing the time-dependent case, we can really investigate the nuclear dynamics related to the nuclear reaction. And we are going to extend this framework to relativistic case because, in nuclear physics, the relativity is very important because we have very significant spin-orbit splitting. Not in the electron system. In the electron systems, this spin-orbit splitting this spin-orbit interaction is weak. So you can perturbatively consider this except for heavy ions. But normally you can do it in a perturbative way. But in nuclear physics, this spin-off interaction is very strong. So you cannot do it perturbatively. Okay, thank you very much for your attention.
