The project that Falco presented is a work with him and also with Antonio, Fabrizio and Francesca. But we change the causal inference setting. But last I speak about, I don't know, always motivation application. So again, Palpa already explained how important it is to understand the heterogeneity of in the effects. Of in the effect of the PM2.5 on human health. So, what is obvious to things like, okay, what can we do to reduce the PM2.5? So, in this way, we can have an effect on the human health. So, what we want to understand now is how does our pollution regulation affect the human health? But if we do air pollution regulations, like Air pollution regulation is like changing the level of the air pollution, in particular the PM 2.5. And if we change the level of PM 2.5, I mean, if the air pollution regulation can change the PM 2.5, the air pollution can affect the human health. So we have like these three variables that are connect to each other. Connect to each other, and we want to understand the causal effect. So, practically, we have to frame these settings, this situation, this real question in a causal inference framework. And in particular, we have to introduce the principle of certification. So, now I will start the presentation, speak about that. And then, I mean, causal inference have a lot of problems, especially. Causal inference have a lot of problems, especially because we have missing data, and then we will see some other problem that we have. So, what we had to think is like a model that tried to resolve some of that problem. So, this is why we introduced a vision on parametric model that we call a confounder-aware share-atomix model. And then I will end the presentation looking at the result of our application. So, a bit of notation. So, what is pre-specification framework? So, we have a set of units. For each unit, again, we have some confounder characteristic and again, a treatment that is a binary, is a binary indicator. So, 0, 1, control or treated group. And then we have outcome. So, we have potential outcome. So, this means like add outcome for each treatment. Add the outcome for each treatment level, but different from the previous presentation, I mean, what Alco presents, we have another variable that is the post-treatment variable. Also, this variable have like two potential outcome. So, P0, P1, that again depend on the treatment. And to understand better, like in our application, the treatment now. Treatment now, different from the previous work, is the air quality regulations. So, if like a particular area, let's say in the US, apply or doesn't apply some particular regulation. The post-treatment variable is the PM2.5 exposure. So it's a continuous variable. And the outcome, again, is the mortality rate, but it can be like any different disease in the population. In the population. And for the characteristic of the population, we have some socio-economic characteristic, but also we have information about the weather, because the weather can have an impact of the PM2.5. Okay, so that are the variables. What are our causal effects? So what is our goal? What we want to calculate estimates. So we are in the principal strategy. The principle stratification. So we want to partition our unit by the value of the post-treatment variable, but in particular, how the two potential post-treatment variables, so like PM two point five, the level of PM two point five, if we apply or non-apply our quality regulation, change or not. Change or not. So, what is the relation between the two potential outcomes? But in particular, in principle verification, we care about three particular stratum. The dissociative stratum, that is when P1 is equal to P0. So, this means like I apply air pollution regulation, nothing changes if I didn't. The associative positive stratum, so when P1 is. So when P1 is bigger than P0 and the opposite. So when P1 is smaller than P0, so like say like I applied the regulation, the level of PM2.5 is smaller than if I didn't. So these are like the three strata that we care about. And we care about them because we want to estimate the principal causal effect. So the effect on the outcome. The effect on the outcome, so why in our case mortality rate? So, how change of mortality rate condition on the fact that the PM245 in that is an doesn't change with different treatment level, or again, the causal effect when we are in the social deposit stratum, and again, the same things for the social negative stratum. Okay, so yeah, yeah, oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. So just to represent that, we have some area counties around the US. I want again cluster them in three, in the three strata. So while for the previous project, I mean the one that Falco present, we can have like how many clusters we found. Here we really care about these three. So we want to just split in these three strategies. These three strata, not more, I mean, they can be less, but this is what we care. And condition then in the estimate the causal effect. Let's just, okay, we want to estimate, calculate this value, yeah. The problem, the first problem is that we have a lot of missing data because we are in potential outcome frameworks. So this means that half of our potential post-retimet virus. Post-potential post-treatment variable are observed, and the other half is missing. So I observed the one where corresponding to the treatment level that we observe, and it's missed the other one, and also for the outcome. So this is the first problem. Second problem is identify that strata. So something that is quite easy, we can say, is when we have a binary post-fitment variable. Binary post-fitment variable, because if it's binary, it's like say, okay, P1 can just take the value 1 or 0, P1, P0, P1, again, 1 and 0. So if we combine all the possibilities, just for combination. And yes, like indeed, we have a lot of work about that. But of course, we don't have always binary post-treatment variables. Have always binary post-treatment variables. So, and like in our situation, we have a continuous post-treatment variable. So, this starts to be a problem because we have to understand how we can consider the dissociative strata, like, because we cannot have like an integer value for P0 and P1, so we cannot see easily is the same value or not. And in this, In this, so with the continuous post-treatment variable, in the literature, we can find like some options. The first one is like just decotomize the post-treatment variable, so it's like come back in the binary case, or estimate a parametric or no parametric model. But to identify the strata, we have to take some assumption or subjective choice. Subjective choice, so some threshold that can say, okay, we can consider like the P0, P1, so the post-rhythmic variable almost the same or different. And so we really don't like these things, so we propose a new model that tries to take in account the fact that we have a continuous post-treatment variable. So we care about the nature of our variable. Of our variable. And in the same time, we want to impute correctly the missing potential, sorry, the missing post-return variable and outcome, but also discover the principal strata. So we want to let our model tell us what are the strata without taking more assumptions because I mean, in causal inference, we have so many assumptions, and add the new assumptions is not what we want to do. What we want to do. So let's go to see how those models build. First of all, I know we have all that variable, so we have to factorize the probability. And in particular, the first element is we can just simplify for the standard causal assumption. And the second probability, we just model. We just model like a linear regression model, but we can anyway like use a more flexible model. It's not really like the focus of this topic. But the interesting point is the model for the post-treatment variable. So how do we define the model for post-treatment variables? In this way. So we have two models, like one when I'm under the treatment zero, one. Under the treatment zero, one under treatment one. And so the post-treatment variable condition, the treatment coverage can be defined this way. So we are assuming a kernel that is a Gaussian and the prior is a dependent ratio process. In particular, this dependent Richie process is defined this way. Way. So we have that our random probability measure is defined like an infinite mixer where the weights are depend on the treatment and the coverage. So if we think like we are using a dependent probiotic breaking process, so if you think about like our stick that we have to break, we change how we break according with the treatment. We break according to the treatment and the coverage. And then we have that the atoms are shared between the true treatment level. This allows us to identify the principal strata. So I try to like represent here how does it work. So about why we put the coverage on the weight for things. And this helps us for the importation of the missing data. Of the missing data. This is because, so if we have like a unit with some particular characteristic, I will have like a sequence of weights that are associated to like atoms. If I have a unit with some other characteristic, I will have like another different sequence of the weight and go on. So when it's time to impute the missing data, I can use this. The missing data, I can use this information. So, this means that if I have to impute the value for a unit that is similar to the first one, I will go to some place, something more similar to that unit. And again, if I have another one similar to the third one, I will sample from that. So using the weight on sorry, the covert on the weight help us for the imputation. So resolve the first problem that I did before. That I did before. Then the second problem that we had was like to identify the strata. So this was more difficult to represent, so don't take too formally, but just take the idea. So for each unit, if you remember, we have like the two post-treatment variable under control and treatment. I have like, so this, we have two different distribution. So how can I understand what is the probability of this unity to be in one of the different Need to be in one of the different strata. And here the shared atom helps because I can see if the probability to be allocated like in the same atoms. So that helps us to understand if it's like in this associative stratum. So give information about the probability to be in that stratum. Or like I will be that unit will be in the associative positive stratum. Soto-positive stratum, if like if the probability to be like in two different atoms where the component of the mixture for the P1 is bigger than the P0, or again, like for the Sochetti negative stratum, it's the opposite. Anyway, like to formalize a bit this part, so we know that like DDP have a discrete DDP have a discrete nature, so we can introduce with a Latin categorical variable S that we have for each unit two categorical variables, one for the treatment one, one for the control zero, that were the pro that indicates the probability to be allocated in one of the clusters. And to estimate the probability to be in the probability to be in the dissociative stratum, it can be like anyway, like computing this way. So let's see how what result we obtain for our application. So again, these are our variables. In particular, here is how we, I mean, the data have been collected. So there is like So there is like the national ambient air quality standard that say, okay, if you are above or below a particular value, it's fine. I mean, if you are above perfect, if you're below, no, sorry, the opposite. Above, you have to take some air pollution regulation. If you are below, it's fine. So there was like a baseline period where they collect the data. They collect the data and see if different countries in the east of the US were above or below the threshold. That counties that were above the threshold had like some years where they could use something to reduce the APN 2.5 and then they check if how the PN 2.5 changes in the follow-up period. So here So, here are the results. So, first of all, the straight. How we can see here is like, so how the treatment, so the air pollution regulation affecting a different way the PM2.5. So, indeed, we can see like the yellow is like the disotative stratum. So, when the air pollution doesn't really change the value of PM2.5, and then the other two asotative stratum. Associative stratum. But what we really are interested is like how change the mortality rate according with the three groups strata. And what we can see is like the green one box plot show that if the air pollution regulation can reduce the PM to 0.5, then we can see that we can really reduce the mortality rate in the population of that. In the population of that county. While, if the air pollution regulation can't change the PM 2.5 level, or I know air pollution also increases during that years, then the mortality rate is like or around zero or also increase a bit. And again, as before, we are interested in understanding like different Understanding like different types of population or like condition. And in particular, we can see like in the first spider plot that the counties that usually are like in the cities, in this like this, the urban value, usually is where we can really, the air pollution regulation can really reduce the PM to 0.5 and improve. Five and improve the quality of life of the people there. And another thing that we noticed, like, anyway, like, the weather have a significant, they can explain that there are differences between the different strata. Indeed, like in the second and third strata, we have that, I know, we have like high temperature and some other characteristics of. Temperature and some other characteristics of the weather that maybe can explain why the PN2.5 didn't reduce if they apply the air pollution regulation. Another thing is that for each counties we can know the probability to be allocated in a different strata and you can see like in this one we know like each county We know, like, each county which strata is allocated in the postimation of the partition. So, just to conclude, so we have, we introduced this model that try to that model the principle stratification, keeping in consideration the fact that we have a continuous post-treatment variable and that can impute the missing potential outcome and post-treatment. Outcome and post-treatment outcome, but also discover the strata in the same time without assuming more assumptions. And indeed, the principal strata are driven by the data and not from our a priori choice. And we saw how it works in our application. So thank you for your attention. Thank you so much, Daphne. Let's open up the floor for questions for Daphne. Okay, so I have a clarification kind of question, and please forgive me if this is stupid. So if you go back to the triangle plot with very nice little cartoons representing the different elements, so I'm not an expert, but somehow it looks like. For somehow, it looks like a mediation analysis instead of like a principal stratification thing, or if you position on the principal stratification variables, the treatment no longer really directly affects the outcome. So, like, what exactly is the difference? So, yeah, they're really similar. But what changes like your causal estimate that you want to estimate? So, why like mediation, I think, is more interesting. mediation I think is more interesting like direct and indirect effect in principal certification you care about just like three strata and effect on principal strata but yeah how you formalize the variable and the relation among them is the same this just changes the causal effect that you are you assuming that like in like aside from the M2.5 level changes interest uh air pollution regulation does really directly impact air data people is that the assumption we're making here um it's more that we can like so we have a heterogeneity of the effect of the our pollution regulation pm 2.5 and i know we can choose like how to characterize the heterogeneity and in principle certification we care like about that risk We care like about that three strata. Mediation, I think they just if I they care about like quantify like this arrow or the arrow that goes through the PM 2.5 so they didn't that divide in that way, right? It's more um okay so. So yeah, it's more like yeah, there doesn't there could be the possibility that our pollution regulation doesn't affect i mean there are some but not all right this concludes our sessions of the day and i i think i was asked to announce that we have a van leaving the this hotel at 630. exactly I think Merifer told me that. Yeah, so basically, we have a van with a driver, a chauffeur that can take us to a downtown area departing at 6.30 p.m. So yeah, we can like if we want, we can do city center.
