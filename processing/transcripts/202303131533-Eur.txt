So here's one sentence summary, if you like. So as the title says, we want to think of main choice as vector bundles. And turns out one can really milk a lot out of this. So my collaborators, Andy Burgett and Hunter Spink, turns out three of us were in the same place for the first time ever. So we finished this whole project without ever being in one place. And Dennis Sung and some other works that I Some and some other works that I also have done with Matt Larson, June, and Alex since then. If I have time to get to those, I'll say a few words. But for the main talk, I'll tell you about the work I've done with Andrew-Faget and share an events. So let me just begin with some notations. So E will be a finite set. It will be the ground set of our matrix with N elements. With n elements, r will always denote the rank of the matrix. The range is from 0 to n. And let me denote by t the standard coordinate torus. So, from our talk this morning and Oliver's talk, so I have fields. We'll stick with fields. I'm sorry. Alright. Fields will be interesting enough. So I'm looking at just the units of the field to the E. Very often we'll take the projective torus, which is you take the original torus and module the diagonal copy by coordinates and E, and just up to global scaling. So that will be the projective torus. So those are the notations, and a little more. And a little more. So matrix M has ground set E, and bases will be this curly V for my matrix. In some of the statements, it will be implicit that I'm really thinking about loopless matrix. I might be a little bit not careful exactly when I mean loopless and not. Feel free to ask, but often loopless might be there. And just to be And just to be confusing, I'll use t also for the top polynomial of the matrix. T sub n, the top polynomial variables. Let me not define it. I'm sure many of you at least have seen it. You may not remember the exact definition, but that's okay. You can look it up if you like afterwards. We just need to remember that it's a very We just need to remember that it's a very important invariant of matroids that has been studied time and again. And by realization of a matroid, today I mean a linear subspace in the coordinate space coordinatized by the finite set E. So L should be R-dimensional. It's very thinking about rank R matroids. In other words, the set of bases given a linear subspace are exactly subsets of my ground set such that the composition of my inclusion map of the linear subspace to the coordinate space project to the Project to the coordinates in the subset B. This is an isomat. So we have all such subsets, and those give me the bases of the matroid. And by realization of the matroid, I'll just mean a linear subspace with exactly the set of B's, making this isomorphism being the basis of my matrix. Any questions on the notation? Any questions on the notations? Okay. So Federico has a wonderful survey and he often does not advertise this in his talk for some reason, but I will. So I think it's called Geometry of Geometries. Same title for both one and AMS notices. For both one in AMS notices and also in the ICM proceedings. Wonderful survey. And in there, you will see at least three different kinds of geometric models that we have or many people have used to study, say, the top polynomial or the characteristic polynomial and the like. But something that I noticed when I came into this field is that some of these geometric models are somewhat disjoint in the sense that In the sense that one model has a really nice set of tools, but then if I want to carry that tool to another setting of a different model, it's rather difficult. So these kind of models had their own benefits, but it was kind of hard to use those benefits in one go. So one of the motivations behind our work in thinking made choices vector bundle was to bridge that gap. So let me give you a brief review of some of highlights. Highlights studying make choice in its more geometric sense. So let's see if I can fit it into this board. I think I can. We'll give it a try. So let X sub E be the permutahedral variety. From the morning talk from Federico, this is the Tori Karadi. This is the toric paradigm. OSI shaded to the permitahedral fan on n elements. We have seen already some or many different kind of results that one can do on, say, the chowing of the usual variety. On the other hand, for instance, coming from, say, more emphasized than Tong's talk or Oliver's talk is looking at it. Oliver's talk is looking at it through the lens of Rasmanians. So let me do that side first. So let's look at Rasmanian of R-planes, a coordinate space labeled by E. A realization of a matroid, let's say a linear subspace L, is a point in the Grossmannian. The standard torus T acts on the Grassmannian in the way one expects. The way one expects. You scale the first coordinate by T1, second coordinate by T2, and so forth. So, given a realization, in other words, a point in the Grassmannian, I can consider the orbit closure under the torus action. Combinatorially, this is exactly the same as looking at what many of us know as the base polytope of the nitrogen. Base polytope of the nectar. In case we had some polytope, and one property of this polytope is that its normal band coarsens the primitahedral band. Geometrically phrased, this is saying that whatever this orbit closure is, there is a canonical map from the permutahedral. From the permutahedral variety to that variety when considered as a torque variety. I will map like so. And what can I do with this picture? Well, for instance, I can take the ample line bundle that gives us the fluker embedding of the graph platinum and pull it all the way back. So upshot here is that I can define a line bundle. Well, strictly right now, this should only be defined for a realizable matrix. But let me just write L sub M anyway. This is the pullback of the antique line on the one on the cross bagni to the primitahedral. Or if you're just polytopal inclined, this is just another way of saying I'm looking at the base polytope of the matrix. So that's kind of one side of the story. I'll say a little more as we go. Another side of the story, we've seen some glimpse of it already. Let me phrase it in a more geometric way. So, first, once again, I start with a linear subspace that Start with a linear subspace that realizes my matroid, let's say L. Well, it's a subspace in K to the E. Let's projectivize everything. I'm looking at just projective linear space L inside the projective space. And there's a distinguished map from permutahedral variety to a projective space, where you can think of this map as a series of blowdowns. A series of blowdowns. So, what does algebraic geometry provide us? It provides us with the following diagram where I can consider the strict transform of the linear subspace L inside the linear space. Some nice variety. And this has a name, wonderful compactification. To take continuum project. In any case, we can forget how this wonderful compactification was created and really just only remember the cohomology class. For whatever this whole blow-up process is, at the end of the day, I'm just saying that given a realization of a matroid, I have some nice. Of a matroid, I have some nice compact sub-manifold of the primitive dahedral variety. So I have a homology class inside the permutahedral variety. Let me be a little bit not too careful about homology versus cohomology. In other words, I have some element inside the cohomology ring, or in the algebraic sense, the chow ring of the primitive. Of the primitive equipment. Now, in the morning talk, we heard about this term Bergman fan, considered as a balanced fan. And part of, I'm not exactly sure where exactly to pinpoint in terms of the literature, but like Carly and Federico and Bernd's literature, part of the content of the theorem is that this coin. The content of the theorem is that this cohomology class is exactly the balanced fan given on the Bergman fan of the nature. So, this is geometric way of saying where the Bergman fan comes from. One way of saying it is, well, look at the 100 location. So, in any case, now I have two different looking things given a matrix for its realization. One of them is an element in the cohomology ring. Ring. Another one is a line bundle on the perimeter-eto variety. In other words, I can consider the line bundle as sitting inside the growth and decay ring of vector bundles on the correctahedral variety. And both of these rings, the chow ring and the k ring, have a distinguish map to the integers. Distinguish map to the integers. Okay, this is the sheaf Euler characteristic map. For instance, I have a line bundle. One can try to measure the sheaf Euler characteristic. On the other hand, I have a degree map that coincides with the degree map, as Federico mentioned this morning. Mentioned this morning, defined on the child. And in this somewhat small space, let me fit in two of my favorite results that are not mine, but in the matrix literature. And the choice of these two is simply because I think I can fit it in this small space. So it's kind of short to write, but there are many, many more amazing results that I won't be able to mention in full. In full. Here's one result in think 22, which is the following. I'm going to take the sheaf Euler characteristic of something that involves a slime bundle. But to complete this sentence, I need one more object. I need one more object in this picture, which is that the permutahedral variety has another distinguished map for projective space, where it can be considered as the variety that resolves the indeterminacy of the rational map called the cremona map. So the map that inverts all the coordinates, of course. That inverts all the coordinates, of course, is not defined everywhere. And one way to resolve a rational map that's not defined everywhere is to do some series of blow-ups. And in this case, the permutahesual write does the job. In particular, this picture gives me two distinguished maps to Pn or Pn minus 1. And I can consider the following two classes, alpha and beta. Classes, alpha and beta. And alpha is, as denoted in this morning. So alpha is the pullback along the first pi 1 of the hyperplane class, out known as little h, and beta is the other. So each of these projected spaces have hyperplane classes. Just pull them back. Just pull them back according to different flowdown rates. So now I can finish writing down what this result is. Let's take some multiple of the alpha, some multiple, let's say y of beta, and try to compute the Euler characteristic of this. Now I realize I can't possibly fit two results in this little space, but I think. In this little space, but I think I'll figure it out. Polytopically, this is also just saying I want to know the number of lattice points of the matroid base polytope. We includes a dilate of the standard simplex, the convex whole of all the standard basis vectors. Basis vectors, giving Kolsky sum dilate of the opposite simplex. So take the minus of the center simplex. And try to count the number of lattice points as x and y varies. And the statement is that this is more or less equal to the top plane. So the true statement is that one needs to do some sort of a variable transformation and do some binomial. And do some binomial to polynomial kind of transformation. But up to those kinds of operations, the content is that you count the number of points in this way, exactly gets you the top point. So, this was one result, or one incarnation of top polynomials. Coming from thinking of matroys on more of this kind of right side, so-called k-theoretic. Chris, sorry, I just please, but what y is multiplied by what? So the last term. Oh, this upside-down triangle. This is the negative standard simplex, in other words, convex pool. In other words, convex pool of negatives of the standard basis vectors. And just a quick question. So there is a large overlap to Bernardi, Kalman, and Let me mention now a result that, in fact, Federico mentioned already in the morning that resides more on this kind of quotation mark, child theoretical site. So here's a statement due to June and Eric, both here, which is that if I apply this degree map to the bird map, To the Bergmann band class times alpha to some power, beta to some power. This equals exactly the ith coefficient of the top polynomial evaluated at q plus 1 comma 0 over q plus 1. Or some may call this the reduced characteristic polynomial, at least when one ignores the signs. And this is one of the key ingredients, or combined with the following amazing tool that all three authors are here, actually. And for the second one as well, Delaware, and then And unfortunately, I can only say due to time restraints, they develop a notion of tropical Hawk theory, which in very loose terms tells me that if I have some invariance of matroids that arise by doing this. That arise by doing this kind of degree computation involving either, for instance, the Bergman fan or classes like alpha and beta. It gives you a log concave sequence. And Federico said a little in more detail about how that actually works. But let me also just leave it at that. So it's an amazing tool on this more child theoretic side, the kind of left side of this board. That combining these together led to the resolution of, for instance, Rhoda's conjecture about log cavity of the sequence of coefficients of this point. Now, one looks at this. Okay, in this statement, something matrix, alpha. Something matrix, alpha, beta. Something matroid, alpha, beta. Specialization of tut, tut. Are they related? Or how can they possibly not be related? But of course, it could be a red herring. But it kind of does beg the question: is there some Beg the question: Is there some common framework where we can get, for instance, both of these results in one go and also try to use this tropical hot theory and combine it with whatever kind of results one can get from thinking of or studying matroys using Bayes polytopes. And for the experts, you might say, oh, isn't there a canonical tool called the Hertzenberg-Neyman rocket? Tool called the Hertzenberg-Neumann-Rock theorem that bridges between this child side and the state theory side. But to use Hertz-Bung Greenman-Rock, one needs a fairly good understanding of taught classes. And at least I have trouble dealing with taught classes. They seem quite hard to manage. At least for a lot of these very hands-on common. Lot of these very hands-on combinatorial results. To me, Todd classes seem quite gnarly to work with. I'll tell you one replacement of Herzog-Greemann rock in the case of perimetahedral varieties that are very special and provides one of the bridges that I'm saying we desire. Any questions up to this part? Okay. So let's finally get to new stuff. Well, our paper is trying to get a little bit... I don't know. Does whatever Federic remarked about apply to papers too? It causes being new to being old. Yeah, newer than what's on this board. The key idea, as I remarked in the beginning, is to think of matroids or realizations of matroids as defining a nice vector bundle on the permutahedral plane. On the perimeter. So let me give you that. So here are some notations. So let C to E underline be the trivial vector bundle on the primitive Ho variety. On the primitive hegel variety, just trivial vector bundle modeled on. Oh, I changed my field to C. Let me keep kidding. Just to be consistent. But this is not T equivarially trivial. So I want some action of my torus T on this vector privilege. Vector portal. So t acts on this by inverse gender action. So what do I mean? T1 data dot Tn acts on, let's say, V1 dot dot Vn by T1 inverse V1 dot dot Tn inverse V1. Why do I need to take the inverse instead of standard? A bit more on the technical side, so I won't say too much more, but this convention makes things a little neater to work on. So I have a trivial vector bundle. It is not trivial as a T-equibarian vector bundle. It has a non-trivial action. And I'm going to build two vector bundles. I'm going to build two vector bundles, given a realization of a matrix, let's say a linear subspace L. Define two vector bundles that we call SL and QL T equivariant vector bundles on the primitive right. The primitive variety by the following. Ah, before that, I need one more notation. Bear with me. So the permutahedral variety, if you're not too familiar with it, really the key property, one of the key properties is that it contains the projective torus as the dense open torus inside it. And given an element And given an element little t inside my original coordinate torus t, let me write t bar for the image of that as considered inside the projective tools. Just notation. Bar, we're going from T to the projectivization. I think on one of the talks, maybe Matt, I kept writing the bar too close. I kept writing the bar too close, and Matt thought I was writing E over and over again. I'll try to have a little more separation this time. And hopefully with this remark, we won't see it as E. So what are these vector bundles? So S of L, this is the unique T equilibrium vector bundle, or T equilibrium sub-bundle. Of this trivial bundle such that the fiber over a point, let me just tell you what the fiber is over the point in the torus. Not the whole perpendicular friday, but just over a dense open subset for now. The fiber over this point. The fiber over this point T bar is, well, you just act on the linear space by the torus. And in some sense, this is like kind of the very first thing one should try. If I want to build an interesting vector bundle out of data of a linear space in a coordinate type space, well, if I just make everything just trivial, then it's not very interesting. But. But acting by an element of the torus to the linear subspace keeps the same matroid. I mean, if I scale each of the coordinates, however, by non-zero element, I have the same matroid. So matrially, giving me the same matroid, but the fibers of this vector bundles are now a little more interesting. You may, of course, ask, oh, you only specify. Oh, you only specify the fiber of this vector bundle over a dense open part. Does it actually extend to the whole thing? And it does. And there are several ways to check this. I won't say too much more. Q is essentially the same thing. So you need the equivariant quotient bundle instead of sub-bundle. Of the trivial point of k to the E, such that the fiber at the point T bar is now proportional. Those are the two vector bundles. And I haven't totally justified why they even exist, but you can trust me. Can trust me. One way to see why this exists is that if I have a realization, we had this map before from the permutahedral to the orbit closure sitting inside the Grassmannian. The Grassmannian has the universal sub-bundle and the quotient bundle. Then you pull back. In some sense, that's where the notation comes from. That's where the notation comes from. The universal sub S, the Gaussian bundle Q, pull back along this map, defined by picking a point L inside of Rasmagnier, and they give me these vector motions. So so far, everything requires that I have a realization, the linear subspace L. But the first observation that we make is that For any matroid, there are, let me not say unique yet, there exists, in fact, T equivariant K classes in the perimeter priority that we denote. That we've denoted as Sm and Qm such that, well, if I have a realization, hopefully they agree. So for instance, if I had a realization L, the K class of that vector bundle equals whatever this K class that's valid for arbitrary matrix is, and the same for And the same for Q with L plus. And at this point, you might be saying, wait, you can probably do that in a million different ways. Like, what if I just say for non-realizables, just set them to zero? And for realizables, set them to equal like this. And the And one way to kind of nail down exactly these k classes in a unique way is to say that I want this assignment, for instance, m goes to this k class, to be valued in the sense that as Federico mentioned, it respects some inclusion-exclusion principle whenever I have a subdivision of my nature. So as soon as I impose So, as soon as I impose, for instance, that sort of natural condition, there's only one way to define k-classes such that this property still holds. And those are exactly what we call the tautological classes for any matrix M. And we want to study these as vector buttons. Is the uniqueness here the same fact we heard earlier that the linear That the linear, the representable matroids generate. Yes, that's mative. That's right. So the linear matroids, their base polytope in the valuative group generate. The result of Dirksen and Fink. The trick that Federico mentioned, that he learned from me, that I learned from him. So one thing we really studied about these Studied about these k-classes is their churn classes. So, given a vector bundle, one of major invariants that one can study about vector bundles are their churn classes. So E can be either S or Q, and we want to understand a little bit about their turn classes. A little bit about their churn classes. And this essentially gets me to the statements of our main theorems. Any questions about the construction slash the proposition? Okay, so here are the main theorems, myself, the spin, and so on. It's always very tempting to just abbreviate to the acronyms. I won't do it this time. In any case, here's the first statement. Statement, which is that the first term class, so let's take the Q1, this is equal to the divisor of this line bundle that I mentioned coming from the Grossman. So there was some kind of picture coming from the Grossmannian side where I look at the whole one and gave me some line bundle that corresponding to the base polytope of the matroid. Top of the matroid, and statement is the first term class exactly that you have. And this statement is essentially just unraveling definitions of how a group I didn't actually tell you how to actually define these. It comes through, we do it through localization techniques in Tierquid geometry. In any case, the first statement is just unravel the definition and the second statement is a little less The second statement is a little less observational, which is that if I look at the top turn class of the cube, this exactly gives me the Bergman-Band class. So by looking at the first and the top, you can sort of go in between the two. At least thematically, it feels like it. And I'll make it a little more precise, what kind of bridge we can build soon. Bridge, we can build soon. Chris, is that first M just L? Is that my bug a lean submerged? Ah, so as I've explained it today, it feels like there has to be a linear subspace in the Grassmannia in order to write down the Lyme bundle. But if I just think of polytopes as Neff bundles on toric varieties, the Lyme bundles exist for arbitrarily. The line modules exist for arbitrary L. So as I said it today, it feels like I should say L does exist. And one other result is that if I take the following products of the turn classes, so take the top turn class and any turn class of the S, this gives me What's called the ICSM class of the matroid as defined and studied in Lución Lopez de Matrano, Philip Rucol, and Sh. So it's kind of pleasing that we can understand. That we can understand some of these previous constructions or matroids by looking at some distinguished chunk classes. What about the degree numbers? So let's try to compute every kind of degree number possible in the following sense. So it's going to be a gigantic sum over indices ijkl. Alpha to some power, beta to some power, sum to Some turn class of S, some turn class of Q, and keep track of all these numbers in a four-variable polygon. So, X, Y, Z, W, just formal variables, and I want to keep track of all of these numbers as i, j, k, and l varies. And the result. And the result, no surprise, is that it's more or less the top polynomial in the following way. Specify numbers, c to the rank, x plus w times rank. So there's a part that only depends on the rank and then the top point only. X plus y. X plus 2. So that's our second result. The third result says that the above polynomial is, if I were to use the technical term, denormalized Lorentzian. By Lorentzian, I mean in the sense that June and Thatcher Brendan has developed. But technical kind of terminology aside, you can think of this as Eric who briefly mentioned, as some sort of a multivariate kind of mountain log concavity. So the whole polynomial has some sort of a log concaval property, and from this And from this statement, for instance, one can recover that the characteristic polynomial has law-concave coefficients, the independent subsets have law-concave, are law-concave, and so forth. So, does this mean the normalization has moved in? Yes, yeah, that's right. Denormalize points. And let me finally write down the fourth result. Fourth result, which is the promised Hertz-Ba-Greemann-Rock replacement. So here's the statement: there is a unique ring isomorphism from the K ring of the perimeter variety to the tau ring of the perimeter of ID. We named it Zeta for no good. No good reason whatsoever, other than we ran out of other names. Any case, there is a ring isomorphism characterized by the property that if I have a realization, let's say L, then I can look at the structure sheet of the wonderful compactification. So that defines a K class. What does the What does the map zeta send the k-class to? Exactly the homology class. In other words, the Bergman class of the matroid that linear subspace L represents. And this satisfies our following property. If I want to compute the Euler characteristic, The Euler characteristic, or yeah, the Euler characteristic of some element in the K-ring, I can instead compute it by applying the degree map to zeta, the map zeta applied to that element, E times sum of powers of alpha class, alpha as defined before. Now, if I wrote here what's called a turn character map for the experts, and instead of the sums of powers of alphas, wrote Todd class here, that will be exactly the old classical Herzog-Greemann-Rock theorem. But this is not, the zeta map is not the classical turn-character map. In fact, the turn-character map is not defined over integral. Vector map is not defined over integral coefficients. In our case, we're claiming that this isomorphism is over integral coefficients. And this thing I can understand. Taught class, I generally can't. Sums of powers of alphas, there's poor hope. That I cannot. So that's the replacement for the Herzog-Greemann-Rock that we often call the exceptional Herzog-Greemann-Rock property. And it's quite special for the permutah. Quite special for the permutahedral variety. Not all Toric varieties, for instance, will have such kind of ring isomorphism. So let me write a few corollaries. The first one is that the k is the k wind of uh complete tori priority. Project project projective toy priority is not as a model. Yes, for instance, I don't know of integral isomorphism between the K ring of arbitrary projective toic variety to the chow ring that is a ring map. Can I just break you repeat? So it's a Z versus Q issue? Not only that, but I mean it's a completely different ring map than the Troika in the first place. But if you change the Troik variety, the issue is. Now, if I want some isomorphism, and if I'm willing to work with rational coefficients, then the turn character map is always an isomorphism for smooth project. But if I were to remove either the rational coefficients and yeah, I don't think I don't know. Okay, let me tell you a few corollaries. So by combining 4, 2, and 1 in some appropriate way, one can recover many formulas, geometric formulas, for the top polynomial, for the characteristic polynomial, many of them Federico mentioned. Theory convention. Two I mentioned today: the one due to Hoyt Cap, another due to Cameron Fink. One I didn't have time to write it out explicitly that I also really like is due to Fix Fire. That also one can recover by combining 1, 2, and 4 in an appropriate way. There is also a formula for the characteristic polynomial or a shift thereof. Or a shift thereof, a theory dimension. That also, you combine like the third part of one with number two, and it more or less falls out. So all these previous formulas are kind of stored in these three statements, one, two, and three. And second corollary is that this extends. This extends some of the log concavity properties. So, this is really just a statement from number three. So, one can recover log concavity of a characteristic polynomial or independent set counting sequence and a little bit more. But I do want to state very clearly that for this step, number three, Three, we're not reproving tropical hodge theory. We really take that as a fundamental tool. The technology that allows us to give this kind of new formulas and recover a bunch of previous things and extend the locking cavity and so forth, really is that on the K side, there's a wonderful set of tools that often goes by the name of TI. That often goes by the name of T-equibrarian localization. On the Chow side, there is the tropical Hutch theory. And with this framework of tautological classes, I can use both. And that's one of the kind of main technical advantages that to me really allowed us to prove many of those statements. Any questions? Any questions before I have some concluding and open questions? So this description totally defines our isomorphism with respect to the bases given by very compounds. But other bases, is it is this the only one that someone has to describe? It's also very strange if you think about It's also very strange if you think about Todd characters that it's not mixed in the grading of the chow. I mean, even before, like, why would this even define a ring map? Yeah, absolutely. And since our work, let me point out one work as partial answer. So there is a wonderful work. I think she will talk about it this week with Matt Larson, Sam, and Nick. And Nick. And in fact, proof number four for arbitrary matrix. So they developed some notion of K-ring of matroids, so K of M here, chow ring of matroids we had before. So I think the name of the talk is K-theory of matroids, something like that. So here we'll say a little more, and they give More and they give a little more geometric proof of how this isomorphism comes about. Our proof originally was through T-Aqueon localization just purely algebraic. But they have, at least to me, a much more satisfying geometric way of looking at it. But it's still a little mysterious. Like, why is that shit? Some other works that I should mention. Should mention. One by myself and Julian and Matt. There's an augmented version for everything that I talked about with new results that one can't actually quite get just by staying in the periphahedral case, but what's called the stellahedral case. So there are different kinds of pleasing statements there, but one of the key technologies once But one of the key technologies, once again, thinking of MateChoice as far as the list kind of goes on. For instance, myself and Sphinx, Matt, and Hunter. And Matt, I think we'll talk about this this week as well. There's a type B story to everything I talked about today as well, where if you think of choreographed, Where, if you think of chromium dehedral, all story in the chromium is type A story. There's a type B story. It's related to orthogonal delta matroids, or orthogonal matroids. We work in a slightly more general setting of delta matroids. But again, there's similar strain type B, but let me not make it sound like it's just take the same idea. Make it sound like it's just take the same idea and apply. Like, it's genuinely difficult. Even if we all had these previous ideas and try to apply it, genuinely a lot of new work needs to go in getting type. For instance, we don't know how to do it in other types other than A and B. Calciotypes goes on. There's D. I rarely think about E, but in any case, we don't know how to extend beyond type. And let me finish. And let me finish with some progress that I maybe wish there was more progress, but has not really seen as much progress, which is the question about the cohomologies of, say, some operation done on these vector buttons. So the other characteristic we So, the Euler characteristic we seem to understand, at least in some cases, relatively well. What about the actual homologies? I mean, for instance, in the flavor of Tarot's conjecture, does this only depend on the matroid that L defines. And I'll finish with what's I'll finish with what's known at this point, at least to me. This, I think, will be at least mentioned in sometime this week also, where Andrew and Alex show that if I take any short functor applied to, say, Q1. This is 0 for all positive i over characteristic 0. So characteristic 0 is right now critical to their proof. I have some results that I can replace this by, for instance, symmetric powers or exterior powers, very special instances of shock functors. I can get rid of the characteristic hypothesis. Hypothesis and get the same result, but not arbitrary short functions. I have some results in that regard. And if this smells and feels like Terrell's conjecture, there is actually a logical implication that I won't say exactly how. But understanding some of these cohomologies very well, I think, will be intimately connected to some of these questions that concern Taros. That concerns Taros Fenis conjecture. And also, David Speyer has a conjecture from his 2009 paper. He was like, this could give us a clue. But unfortunately, not as much progress in this direction. But I think some of you might be interested and maybe able to give us some new ideas. So to summarize, let me just say the key takeaway, as I said in the beginning, well, what are main choices? They're linear subspaces. Main choice, they're linear subspaces. What's one good way to study main choice? Well, let's think of them as vector properties. And I should say this idea is actually not totally new, just like many things in mathematics. A few days ago, I was giving a talk in Amherst, and I said, Oh, by the way, this statement was essentially proved in a paper by Hacking, Keel, and Tevala, and Paul Hacking. Tepela and Paul Hopkins was in the audience and he was like, I did what? And then, like, at the end of the talk, he's like, oh, yeah, I guess I did that. Yeah. So I guess you just have to run through his memory. So a lot of the statements here are not, as with many things in mathematics, not totally out of the blue. I think David and maybe Alex and Chris had some proto statement that looks vaguely like four. Like four. So it was kind of there, and one could kind of smell it out. Thankfully, we were able to at least sit down and write it down explicitly in full so that others can appreciate it. And I hope you can take this tool and apply it to whatever other kinds of main choic questions you need in the future. And hopefully, you will find that fruitful. Okay, I'll end there. Questions? You mentioned tarot conjecture. What is it?
