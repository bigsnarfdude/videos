Talk about the dynamics of concentrated vorticities in 2D and 3D polio equations. Thank you for the introduction. Well, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation. I'm very happy to be here. I'm not coming too bad. I've not come for a few years. Okay, so what I will speak about today concerns. Today concerns another subject within the course of Euler equations. So let me go to the point. So here is the standard Euler equations for an incompressible fluid. So I will take, unless otherwise stated, again as the entire space as the ambient space, where dimension n can be towards 3. Of course, 3 is more interesting. Of course, three is more interesting, but still as many things are normal. So U represents the velocity field for the fluid, for the underlying fluid, and the quantity, this vector value quantity, the curl of U, is of course measures the tendency to rotate around an axis defined by this direction. By this direction. Okay, so when dimension is 2, we can write a simpler version of this problem, which is actually just a scanner equation. So let me tell you how. So if I consider a solution in two dimensions, so it has two components and two variables. And two variables. Then, well, the vorticity can then be identified with scalar factor of a vector pointing in the normal to the x1, x2 plane. And this scalar makes the problem make an equivalent formulation for the equation possible. For the equation possible. In fact, the curve is precisely this quantity and it satisfies this equation. So if I have a solution of the full problem, I will have a solution of the equation in vorticity 4. And the velocity can actually be recovered from the vorticity in the following way. Well, since the fluid is incompressible, Since the fluid is incompressible, that implies that we can find a potential called the string function such that not the gradient but the gradient per actually of that scalar function corresponds to u. Here, or per my notation, perpendicular, will always mean this thing here. So psi is called the string function of u. Of u. And this is the main thing. Actually, the string function satisfies this equation right away, just after the definition of vorticity. And then, well, I can select the solution, my favorite solution to this, if omega has sufficient decay, then so a good solution defined the entire space is Newtonian potential, which is the convolution with the fundamental solution. Solution. Okay, so this is the what is called the vorticity string formulation. And then the velocity field I write in terms of the string function. The string function, remember it's inverse Laplace and formula. By inverse Laplace and a formula, I will always mean the Newtonian potential. Just this is standard notation. And the velocity field. And uh the velocity field. The velocity field can be recovered by simply taking the of the of uh of this guy and uh and then then you arrive at this formula based on the um the on the vorticity. Okay um okay this is what is called the bio-sevar law okay so concerning Verposen's global global global existence in 2D Global existence. In 2D, this is an issue relatively well understood. At least it is known that if we start with initial conditions in a variety of spaces, in particular, bounded initial conditions, perhaps it's indicated, of the initial value problem, then this problem is well posed in the sense that it has a unique solution. A unique solution, a unique solution which is bounded. Besides, solutions are defined at all times, they do not develop singularities in finite time. This is well known, and this is a different feature in principle. With respect to the three-dimensional case, this is not known. And let me make an observation. For instance, if you have a solution to a semi idea, If you have a solution to a semi-linear elliptic equation of this point, this is a local equation, so what I mean is by f of psi of x, then automatically a function like this defines through this formula a solution to a stationary solution of the Euler equation, for this model. That's automatic, that that that comes from this computation of the gradient of formula gradient given by this. Given by this. As an example, one solution of that type, identity symmetric, with a name, where there are many of them, I will fix what follows this one, which is a solution of the Louvre equation. The Louvre equation is this classical PD in the plane, for which all its solutions, all its entire solutions with finite mass and many loaders actually, are known. Actually, are known and they correspond simply to scalings, say, translations and suitable scalings of this kind. Well, this is called sometimes the Kaufmann Scully vortex, and the mass is 8Ï€. Okay, so what's the problem that I would like to talk about in this talk? It's the problem of constructing solutions whose vorticities Whose vorticities are highly concentrated around lower-dimensional sets. So, points in the plane, and later on I will go into the three-dimensional case. So, what I would like to construct are solutions that somehow depend on the small parameter, so that if that parameter goes to zero, they will look like this. Simply like a linear combination of direct deltas supported at a finite number of points. The fact that the equation research mass, so this is easy to see on each component actually, makes it reasonable for if you want to consider a formal or single resolution of this form, measured value, then to take this guy's constant. In fact, this makes sense. And the corresponding string function is, of course, the inverse Laplace of this, which is just a linear combination of. Which is just a linear combination of fundamental solutions. So, okay. Okay, so what I would like to find are solutions, the smooth solutions, regular solutions that asymptotically look like these configurations. Okay, so these solutions or this analysis of solutions with highly concentrated vorticities is a very old subject. In fact, it comes from the very origins of the Origins of the study of fluid dynamics through this type of PVs. The study of this type of concentrated vorticity solutions goes back to Herkhol Sakirkov and many other people over the years. And well, so in our current language, then what is the question? The question is to analyze this n-vortex singular solution. This n-vortex singular solutions, so this mesh of value solutions based on direct deltas, and then be actual smooth solutions to the problem. Okay, so let me consider an expression of this point. So this expression is defined through these centers CJ of T and a reasonable question is well, how do these points psij move? Okay, so this Okay, so these xij are assumed to be radio smooth functions. Omega should be L to 1. And then since psi s is the inverse Laplace of omega s, then psi s is this guy. Omega s, the s is stands for sigma. Formally, we compute, we plug in those expressions inside the equation, inside the operator, and then I arrive to the And then I arrive to these things. Of course, they are quite agree. They are in principle format, they make sense distributionally, except for one term. These terms, when I was to J in principle, well, it is a little bit more delicate to make them have two significant True signification in distribution assess because this is singular, right? So this is singular xij, so if i is equal to j, then this is something singular multiplied by distribution. It's not so clear the meaning of that, but luckily we have an observation. That is the reasonable observation. The direct delta is radially symmetric of the symbol rotations, and gamma. The rotations and gamma, right, is also radially symmetric. So if you make this product the gradient of a radial function times the gradient of another radar function, that's always zero, it aware functions. But, well, we can make sense of these quantities for i equal to j, assuming that those terms for i equal to j are not present. So if they are not present, then the summation becomes a summation with becomes a summation with i different from j and at last what we find is this expression this expression with these coefficients and these distributions that are supported only at the point psi j okay well but this is going to be zero right i mean this is going to be zero if when i since the support of this distribution so this ij when these expressions are j, when these expressions are zero, when x equals to say j. And just a quick computation of the gradient of this log, okay, then we arrive at the fact that half a C final leaf, this system of all these is satisfied. This is called the Kirchhoff-Roth the system. I mean it's simple. It's a an it is an expression uh or it is an embody problem in R two, okay. An embody problem in R2, where these coefficients in principle are arbitrary here. Okay. So this is the system of all these that I call K that determines the motion of the vortices. So the motion of the vortices for these distributional singular solutions is given precisely. So the natural question that I So, the natural question that I would like to say something about is whether or not there are true solutions, true regular solutions, that have this behavior, in what sense? The solutions that are highly concentrated, in some sense, right? Around a finite number of points, and those points evolving approximately by this law. So, that's the question of desingularization of vortices, of vortices, how it is called. Yeah. Okay. So in order to give a reasonable answer to that question, let me make the following answers or the following yes for the regularization. So this is rather relatively naive, but it works. So if I consider the singular expressions given by this, then I desingularize them using I designularize them using these two expressions down here. So I make the direct delta, I replace the direct delta by simply the Kaufmann-Scully vortex scale in this way so that mass is preserved and centered at the same point sin j. So this is the expression I care about now. If I do that, this is nice, where the log gets the singularized as well, and this gets the singularized in a very simple form. The pole is replaced by the pole plus epsilon squared. Okay, so let me consider this expression as regularizations of these things. So our result is the following. Our result is that you can actually find a true solution of the equation behaving like this at main order. Let me be more precise. It goes like this. Uh it goes like this. Well, of course, this guy's convert distribution of the S epsilon go to zero to the corresponding configuration of the R deltas. Also, the kinetic energy has an expression. That is the kinetic energy. That's it. It approximates a combination of the Rag deltas when normalized by the log. Okay, our result is the following. If we single out a solution of the embody problem in a fixed interval of time, In a fixed interval of time, let me emphasize that. Then there exists a solution of the Euler equation, a regular solution, that differs little from the regularization that I already presented, centered at those particular points. Okay, so this is a result we proved a couple of years ago, which was published a couple of years ago. With this is joint work with Juan Davila, Oni Gamuso and Jun Cheng Wei. And Junqen Wei. And what we found was the following. So that we can find a true solution given a collisionless solution, a collisionless solution of K. Of course, we want the solutions not to collide, the points not to collide, otherwise the regime may be different. So the question is: given, so the result is, given a solution defined in this physical interval of time, 0t, there exists a solution of There exists a solution of the full oiler system that has this particular form. So the regularization plus the smaller terms. How smaller? This is very, very small in comparison. This psi is of psi epsilon squared. Look, this is log of 1 over epsilon, so it goes to infinity at the ball. And this psi is epsilon squared. The phi is a little bit more modest, still substantially smaller than the remainder. Substantially smaller than the remain term. We can make better than this asymptotics anyway. Sigma can be taken bigger locally. In fact, phi had made already the C in capital O1. But I will not elaborate on that now. I am just happy with this expression. So this is our result. Um okay, we are not the first ones in uh considering this this question. Considering this question. This was considered actually in a series of works by Marcolo Pulviretti, and I singled out the result of 1993 in which they found a designularization of this type, but in which the only conclusion that they actually have, the only strong conclusions they have, is the weak distributional convergence assets normal to zero. And some control. And some control on the supports. Their solutions are compactly supported. So, is there weak information around the vortices and globally for the exterior situation? The dynamics they capture is the one we capture. The method is entirely different, of course. And the big difference is that we are able to capture what's happening precisely near the point because of the method of construction. Construction. Okay, so our method, I don't have much time to elaborate on that, but let me mention main ingredients. A main ingredient is an improvement of the approximation in powers of epsilon. Say, you have an error of approximation that depends on the parameter epsilon, is more with epsilon after you scale conveniently the equation. And we use elliptic equations. We use elliptic equations, suitable elliptic equations, to improve locally, and transport equations to improve also far away. These elliptic improvements only work near the concentration points, but not far away. Sorry, you are familiar with the Arru here Okay, so uh sorry, I went Okay, so this is our result. So we found we find these improvements, then we set up the problem as a system that actually covers the inner regimes near the singularities and near the vortices and the outer regime. In order to solve that system, we have to adjust conveniently the parameters sort of homalternative or modulation in order. Another alternative language, and then we use LP estimates to solve the full problem using a shadow degree argument. Anyway, so let me mention some extensions of that. I would say non-trivial extensions. There is this equation that is very interesting and whose look is very similar to the Euler to be, which is called generalized surface quasi-geost. called generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation in which the inverse Laplacian is replaced by inverse fractional Laplacian, okay, which by definition is this quantity, convolution with fundamental solutions, fractional Laplacian. And then you can ask the same question. Can we find this desingularization of vortices? The answer is yes, but not for all S. Putting. At least with the logic that we are following, we are able to reach up to an S which can be a very good thing. Up to an S which can be quantified but still leaves a long range open. We can arrive so far up to 0.937. And the reason is technical, has to do with the coupling between the outer and inverse problems. Anyway, the problem of X say in the case of special solutions traveling in wavelength, if you want to construct, for instance, If you want to construct, for instance, vortex pairs with constant speed with opposite signs, we did this with direct works like that. We have a result of that type without way, with one, one we can do cheng. And for the time-dependent problem, there were some previous partial results. One important difference between the actionable problem Actional problem and Euler is that you don't have so far a good well-positions theory. There is nothing like Judovich theory and that creates some type of problems in the construction. But it can be done at least in that range. Okay, now let me make some comments about the three-dimensional case, which is well, which is probably more interesting. Then uh so here are uh solutions, vortex wings, yeah, vortex wings by a volcano, by a dolphin and a tornado. These are situations in which you have a solution of the Euler equations in 3D, Euler and Aviostokes perhaps, with high vorticity around a curve. So this is the um concerning the asymptotic law of those curves, um this is not at all trivial. Um Not at all trivial. Okay, here is the Euler equation in C D in vorticity form, so the curve of velocity satisfies this equation. You have an analog of the string function, vector value now. And then the question is this. Now imagine that you have a solution or you want to analyze a solution that is concentrated with with a around a tube, say, okay, um tiny tube around a curve. Magnitude around a curve in space. Well, many years ago, actually in the early 20th century, Darrius, who was a student of Levi Chivita, proved that if you have such an object, such solution that concentrates more or less in this form, then what he realized is that if you scale the time in this funny way, with this log epsilon, epsilon is the width of the tube. Epsilon is the width of the tube. Then you end up in the limit for the equation of the curve, measured in this way, with that length, you arrive to this equation, which is a specific equation, by the way, called the diagonal flow of curves. Okay, so after this, well, what's the question? Are there such things? So, given a solution of the binormal flow, can you Given a solution of the binormal flow, can you find a solution of the full Euler 3D with this form, with this shape? And so far the answer is no. There are partial answers, but the full question is widely open and it is called the vortex filament conjecture. So here is the here is the the correct I mean here is the statement of what we understand by this. Statement of what we understand by this Philadelphia conjecture. Here you have the scaling, and you want to find given a solution, a true given solution of the dynamic flow, you want to find this thing, the solution behaving like this as epsilon goes to zero. So it is natural to look for a solution given what I showed you before, where the direct delta is replaced by this regularization with Kaufmann's pulley vortices, right? So that's reasonable. And, well, and these are Well, and these are Fermic organisations associated to the norm, these are normal and binormal vectors. But it turns out that this is still far from being understood and this particular statement is only known for special curves associated to Terrible Wave solutions. Essentially, two. The thin vortex ring, that I will tell you in a moment what that is, which was first found by Fracl in early 1970. By Fracken in the early 1970s, and recently, this is something we did with the helicoidal filament. Let me be more precise, you have two classical solutions, non-trivial solutions, of the biodormal flow of curves. One is an S1, traveling with constant speed on its axis, and Helix rotating as, you know, also with constant speed. Okay, so So, let me consider the situation of axisymmetric Mosswir that already appeared in the talk of Stevens, in the first talk. The axisymmetric Euler equation with Mosswir in vorticity form, let me go fast here, takes this form. The vorticity vector takes the form scalar times this guy. Yeah, this is the same notation. And after rescaling, And after rescaling time, you arrive to this equation down here, which it has a look like Euler 2D, but it's more delicate. And Frankl was able to find rigorously solutions like this with thin tubes, in fact sort of vortex patches, compactly supporting. And how? Well, the traveling wave actually solves an elliptic equation, which is this way. Solves an elliptic equation, which is this one, and eventually this one. So, these elliptic problems can be formulated and can be solved in different ways. This has been the subject, a topic for many people. Something we recently found was the corresponding statement of the helix. The helix you have, the observation is that you have the symmetry. What I mean is that you can find special solutions with this form, okay, not axis, axis symmetric, but the not swear condition is But the no-sphere condition is replaced by this particular form. If you use this form, you again arrive at an elliptic equation, which is this. And if you decide you look for rotating helicoid solutions to this problem, then you arrive at an elliptic equation. The elliptic equation is this one. And if you choose conveniently f, essentially Lu will, is what we do. And uh with Lu will we find this uh this statement. This statement. So, this statement is valid. So, for this particular problem, you can find a solution concentrating as the dirac delta in the plane Rz. And this corresponds precisely, the parameters make the concentration curve precisely the solution of the binomial flower curves as it is explained. Okay, so let me conclude by telling you about. By telling you about some related results which is not elliptic. So the previous things were very nice, okay? The helix and the vortex ring, but they are elliptic problems. So we are not really facing all the difficulty of Euler. Here, we go one step beyond. Still the axisymmetric formulation given by this. Now I care about the solu the introduction of multiple vortex rings. Multiple vortex rings, like in this picture. In fact, it was Hercules already who observed that I don't know exactly the mathematical analysis he did, but what he found was that there should exist thin tubes, thin worketh strings that alternate in the form expressed in this picture. If you make the radius smaller, then it goes faster. If the radius is bigger, it goes slower. And then that produces some type of And then that produces some type of motion with alternation, like in this picture, between the red and the green. This is called deep flogging of vortex rings. This is what is explained here. And our aim is to rigorously justify the leaf flogging dynamics for the 3D asymmetric Euler flow without swear. Let me mention that Bogjela, with the SMETS, they found such a justification in the Eros-Putayevsky equation. In the Eros-Putayevsk equation based on the inspiration dau vortices, but that's a much easier problem than full logic. Anyway, what we found was the result, I will conclude with this, given by, if you have a solution to the reduced dynamics, which is now this system, okay, then we can actually find a solution with this look that corresponds to a configuration like this, where the distances between this dist is of order one over square root of. This is of order one over square root of logier C. This is our result. In the case of just two, rather than capital N, we actually have a very simple dynamics. It is the system is like this, B1 equals minus, V2 equals P. And it is a Hamiltonian system. And its orbits, in fact, turn out to be all periodic. This is the Hamiltonian. And this is the shape of the phase plane. So any of these periodic. So, any of these periodic orbits corresponds to a configuration like this, like the frogen configuration. So, anyway, so I stop here. Thank you very much. Okay, it's something about used very specific vertices as solutions of lube. Vortices as solutions of Liu-Will's equation for approximation. Is it allowed to use any other solutions like Q integrals and yes? There is a technical reason that made us life simpler in using the Kaufman-Scully vortex, which is the following. I can speak about that. But in finding a real estimate, it was very important. A linear estimate, which is an L2 weighted estimate, and for us it was very convenient to find that estimates by estimating to find that estimates by estimating a quadratic form, that was much easier to express it in this theory. And that has to do with conformal factors. This is why the SQG case. We were able to do that. However, you can do this type of estimate without going to the sphere of the session. And the spatial decay is not important. The spatial decay is not important. It should be faster than falsey, perhaps. Perhaps somewhere. But you could even use even compactly supported things. The configuration. So the conference could like a transformation of Delta. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Alternative functions in dimension 3. Sorry? Alternative functions in dimension 4. In the in the SQG case? In the SQG case, what we consider is in is uh in 2D. We consider the critical exponent. So the cosmos could be vortex is the talenti solutor. It's exciting. So another question. So do you have an exponential extra? Do you have an existence uniform pipe? Ah, that's a very good question. No, no. Say, our result is strictly like this. You fix the time. Time capital T, then you can find epsilon sufficiently small so that the solution looks like that. The solution later on continues, but the configuration could be destroyed easily. In fact, these guys are likely to be quite unstable. We know this curve, and this is something we are working currently, is that for some special solutions of the dynamics, of the reduced dynamics, you can construct solutions. You can construct solutions going along with them, but things like finding solutions with a periodic behavior or things like that could be very, very difficult. Configurations that we believe this can work are, for instance, a special solution which is similar for the reduced dynamics, which is like a spiral, okay? There are already there is already work on the line. If you can take the idea now, sorry. And uh and um and there is another case which is nice, which is that you could you will consider two vortex pairs traveling in opposite directions and uh to glue the both of them that also has the flavor of glued solids, right? So multi-solitome dynamics that we have since noted. Uh we we are advancing in that direction, but it's not it's not easy. That's what you say. It's not this for the question. That's a question. So the error estimate that you have was point twice, right? Sorry? It's pointwise. What is the LP norm or HS norm? Okay, if you work harder, you can actually... What we use is the infinity weighted estimates, but in between we have to prove every things. So definitely, it's not that the infinity gaps right away. It's just the simplest. Right away, it's just the simpler, the simpler. Yeah, but we aim at finding just estimates in an infinity or C1 sensor. The C1 sense is already quite difficult. This is why I didn't emphasize that. One reason why we use this theory and not balance this point theorem is that it seems to be particularly complicated to prove that what you have there is niches. And the reason is that if you use Gromba in the wrong way, you immediately get something that picks up exponential between epsilon. Oh, so it's this identity. Well, which is also placing this pole. Well, your last result was two uh rings. Yes, okay. At different velocities, not. And they trust one to the other? And they traverse one to the other because that generates vorticity, extra vorticity, and destroy the. Exactly. What happens is that initially the two rings, if you wish, have a constant speed. So they have a constant speed. So this motion is actually small order perturbations of that main speed. The speed at main order is constant, but then you have this sort of periodic motion superposed to... Motion superposed to that constant velocity. So if you model out this guy, which is responsible for the... This is essentially the speed of a fixed vortex ring. This R0 to minus 1. R0 is the initial radius. And then what we do is modifications of this radius. So in R and C coordinates. And then this is where you see. This is where you see here. And then this is what you see, this is why you see the alternation. But we can only do a finite interval of time, in long time. In fact, all the numerical experiments that you can find, you can find many in YouTube. And they get very quickly destroyed. Just after two crossings. Regeneration of roticity when they cross. Exactly.
