What I can do is that there is some physics which is not well defined, especially quantum field theory, which is not mathematically defined, but there's a black holes. If you threw the black holes, you can make a mathematical statement. Rigorous statement which I cannot prove so that the uh since I'm not trained uh as a mathematician so that the but the audience uh they're a brilliant uh they're a brilliant mathematician in the audience I am was I'm hoping including collaborator uh Neeting here and also Guaytan or many people uh here uh so that So, they can just make some rigorous mathematics out of this statement. So, there's a black box here. So, and my task is to make the meaningful mathematical statement so that the here in the audience can understand the statement and then try to make some rigorous mathematics out of it. Mathematics out of it. So the title is most likely this already exotic to the mathematicians. I just titra say something called a four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory. And even for physicists, we do not know how to formulate this theory so well. But there is something called, so it's called So nowadays called classes classes, which is the construction given by Guyoto 209. So it's as follows. So given the hitching system, hitching system System one can just uh cook up so-called uh for the uh uh any good so-called any good two supersymmetric uh quantum filter supersymmetric quantum filter and the right hand side uh most of people uh do not uh know uh what's going on but the left hand side most of people already familiar with okay uh so the the selling So, the setting we are considering is some Riemann surface with genus G with puncture, with puncture. And then you just consider the cortangent bundle of CGN and consider a spectral curve inside here. So, this is a setting, a heat chain system. And out of it, so one can create so-called body n equal to two pseudosystem quantum field theory, or more precisely. Field three, or more precisely, conform field three. And then, so you have some CGN is the like a Riemann surface. And then here you have some puncture and the puncture around the puncture, you need to, so in the hitching system, you have to consider a so-called Higgs field, which is a homoflex function of the Of the endomorphism of some homophobic bundle cancel with canonical bundle, canonical bundle of C with some appropriate ramification data. And the Higgs field will take the following ramification data around the state. This is the sum m minus m like this, or maybe more precisely, I could. maybe more precisely i call it so some a uh dc over c so this is the uh the carton matrix of the um endomorphism e okay and then um the cutter matrix and this is called regular singularity regular singularity singular so z is a local current around tuncture and we just Current around puncture, and we just impose some following ramification that a Higgs field. So, this is the and then this A, in fact, it can be understood as some diagonal matrix in the case of rank A type gauge field. And the multiplicity of eigenvalue is encoded by some partition of n. So, it's just partition of n will encode the Code the multiplicity eigenvalue. So that's the huge system we consider. Then, so there's an interesting story that in the case of the SUN, so the rank of the rank is the backdrop on the rank, rank of E is equal to two. Okay, so the homophobic backdown of two, which corresponds to. Which corresponds to in the case of the CU2 gauge, it's called SU2 gauge group group. So there's something called the physicists can compute something called instantal partition function function by this is defined by Necrosoft. Defined by Necrosoft or some many people, even the mathematician, Nekrosov Okunkov, Nakajima, and so on. And the statement of a so-called AGT is so-called, this is something coming from a four-dimensional quantum field three, but this is something related to the so-called two-dimensional conformal block block. Block and I will say Birasoro. So the reason why restrict yourself the homophobic bundle is equal to rank of homophobic bundle is two, is in fact, this construction usually do not admit so-called in physics language Lagrangian description. So we don't know even how to compute left-hand side if you go higher than the rank two case. Than the rank two case. But in rank two case, one can compute the instant opposition function in a world manner. And then so this is the R die guy opto touch cover. So AGT coming from these people nades. And nowadays, this statement is rigorously proven in some cases by. Proven in some cases by many people, mathematicians, starting from Schiffman Baserhot and then Mariko Kunkov and Nakajima Finkel Finkel Nakajima Abraham. And also recently, the Gaitan and the Niti and the collaborator, the collaborator written here, also proved this statement by using so-called topological recursion or like. A topological equation, or like so-called area structure. Okay. And then so I from now on, so that this the topic of this conference is non-computer geometry. And then I would like, I would say this two-dimensional component field theory, so two-dimensional is coming from. I mean, so I'm not going to give a definition of component block, but I will give some definition. But I would give some definition of the representation of algebra from now on. I would say this the two-dimensional conhole, two-dimensional conhole CFT can be understood as a quantization, the quantization of a hitching system. Hitching system written here. So, if you contrast this hitching system in some using so-called Bier-Sorrow algebra, one can just obtain a two-dimensional conform field theory and then put the so I mean some particular representation theoretical object reproduce so-called something something called instant of partition function. Okay, um yes, the for instance, if you start with the the uh start with the the uh like for instance example uh the c04 so which is your favorite four function sphere is like this way if you wrap this uh anyway if you start with this one and consider uh this heat chain system of the su2 gauge group so this one somehow corresponding to uh the so-called conhole block four point uh conhole block where the uh b alpha The B alpha of C is given by E to the alpha phi of C one B alpha two C2 B alpha three G3 and B alpha four C4 and this object phi is called the some free field in the CFD and then here it's called primary field vertex operator primary field. Operator, primary field, Higgs approximate primary field. So, therefore, somehow the punctured data of the Higgs field is replaced in somehow the primary field into the mission field. And then here, it's a regular puncture. So, here we consider regular puncture, but the field corresponds to the so-called primary field. So, that philosophy. That the philosophy is that the regular functions correspond to primary shape. However, so in mathematics, the hitching system is much more broad. So one can consider the following thing. So if you consider instead of the like, so you just consider a sphere with the two so-called irregular punctures. Irregular means that Higgs field takes the following form. Take the following form. Let's see. So, for instance, some matrix DC over Z, 3 over 2. So, now the pole at this point, so Z is a local local coordinate, local coordinate around here, is greater than 1. So, this is in this case, so it's called irregular singularity, Higgs field, Higgs is four. Is there any question? Is there any question? Feel free to ask me a question. Irregular singularity. And then, so again, so this is a sphere. So you can take the local coordinate w, which is one over z, and then even at the infinity, you can have a Higgs field will take the following dz over z over 3. C over C over 3, like this. At here, A is this somebody of our card on subalgebra of the locally can be written like this. So this hitching system is the legular puncture, something called 4D N equal to 2. You don't need to know about the detail, pure mouse. MLs. Super MLs, or like a pure MLs. It's much simpler than this guy, actually. This guy. Even though the hitching system involves something more complicated, in regular singularity, the system becomes simpler. And then if you try to write down the spectral curve of this one, so one can just write down the spectral curve of this one. Down that the spectral curve of this one is the X DZ1 minus the Higgs field. I call it the phi capital phi, capital phi, capital phi, phi of z is equal to zero. So this is the spectral curve sigma written over there. And then if you just plug this the plug this the body of the the Higgs build into here so you can immediately see that the so if you so mainly I consider SU2 gauge group or homoic bundle run two vector bundle then as you can easily see if you take a determinant of this one so here you get some value and then and you have to multiply the uh you have to square so the so therefore the the most singular part is the one over Most singular part is one over z to the three and some constant. And then it should be symmetric. It should be symmetric between the z goes to zero and z goes to infinity because I mean that's a system. But alpha, it should be something like this one. Okay. And then in the middle, you have some some z square is equal to z. That's the form of a spectral curve. Of a spectrocurl. Okay, so and then here usually I call it a small phi of two of C. That's why I just emphasize this with capital pi for Higgs. And then in this case, the statement is that the what how to interpret or how to quantize this heating system by system by using the Birasor algebra is that you associate each irregular puncture to these some states so-called so this is states in the or yes some states in the Bomo module Bomo Boma module or BSR Algebra. And you just assorted some representation of a Virus algebra. And then since you have a two-puncture, so you just have the same type, lambda, delta, lambda. And this, if you take an inner product, so you can define some inner product in a UDCFD, and that will give you something called the negro partition, instant of partition. Partition instant of partition function. In this case, you can I can easily write down the what is character of C star E1 E2 cross C star A of the modular space of instanton, which is n equal to 2k, capital n equal to 2k. So this is the instanton modular space. It's called and then maybe you can just put the lambda to the 2k. 2D2K. Okay. So in some modular space, it's some Nakajima Kuiba variety which is written like this way in the Nakajima language, which receives something called U, like C-star action. So there is a C star cross C star cross C star action. So there are three C star acts on it. And you can consider a character of it. And you can consider a character of it. And if you consider generating function of this one, and the claim is that this inner product, I will define what this representation is from now on, is equal to this one. So this was proven by first by Shifman Basrott. Shifm Basrot, I don't remember, around 2010, and Maliko Kunkov, and if Brava Mon Finkev and Nagajima, and then Shima, and then brought bushard and then kneading and then crude it and who else? I forgot. But maybe. Anyway, so bunch of proof already given this statement. And I will explain how to define this double lambda. And you eventually understand what. You eventually understand why this is called quantization of huge system eventually. So, this delta is the some state in the module, which means that you start with the delta. So, this defined is this is the characterized following equation. So, I hope. So I hope everybody is familiar with the Birouster algebra. Birouth algebra is the L M, L N is the M minus N, L M plus N, and plus C over 12, how to say M cube minus M delta M plus N C. So these are your third algebra. C is called central charge. Is called central charge, and then Lm, and this is the integer. Okay, so these are the infinite-dimensional algebra. And then L0 acts on these states as the follows as a constant, delta and lambda. And then here, usually this primary, so the primary states given here. So once this takes the limit d e goes to zero. Z equals to zero, uh, B alpha of C acting on so-called vacuum, you get a so-called delta alpha. So, this is called primary field. So, this primary field is characterized by primary acts on the altar alpha equal to zero when n is greater than zero. So, this is the characterization primary field. Characterization primary field. However, in this case, L1 acts non-trivially. So if the primary field, if it is a primary field, L1 annihilates the state, but here it acts as a constant, the lambda. But for higher one, it annihilates. It is equal to zero for n greater than one. So that's the how you how you What's how you define a state? And since it's a biomodule, it's a linear combination of the primary and descendant. So this delta lambda is if you write down the state in the Bermud module, it's a so Bermo module. I hope just if you are not familiar with the Bermuda module, is you start with data. Delta is a primer. Instead, you just act the same. A primary state, you just act the descendants, uh, lower states like this way: minus one square. Those are the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space you get, and so on. So, this is called primary state, and the if you act the negative mode, you get the descendant, and so it can't write down like this way plus uh lambda over two dot L minus one. L minus one acts on delta, and so on. So some number times L minus one squared plus some number L minus two acts on delta and plus dot dot dot dot dot. And this coefficient, there's a method to define this coefficient by using a so-called cuts sharpobalof matrix. Metrics, but I'm not going to go into detail. Anyway, so there is a way to define the way to define this coefficient. Then you can just contain infinite many sum of the descendants to define these states. And if you take the inner product, for instance, this inner product, I mean, just I can write down the first few terms very simple. First few terms, very simply, one plus lambda square to delta plus lambda to the fourth. I mean, just it's a very simple calculation. You can just do first few terms, one plus two delta, c 10, 16, lambda squared, and so on. And if you do the change of suitable change of variable, A change of suitable change of variable for delta relate delta C and epsilon one, epsilon two a, then one can just obtain the character cis test action, character of cis action on the instant of modulus. That's a statement of AGT conjecture, and but now it's proven we're gonna look at how Look at how this can be understood as a quantization heating system. So, as a quantization heating system, so we just consider the, so in the 2D CFT, we can consider the following quantity, delta of the lambda. And you just consider x square identity operator minus t of z acts on delta lambda. The outer lambda, okay. The outer lambda, you can consider the following thing, and you just normalize the same thing. The outer lambda. So now, so the let's, so T of Z is a so-called source energy tensor, which can be written L L Z L plus 2 L runs. So it's called source energy tensor in 2D conform field 3, which is some kind of generating function of Birasor algebra. So Birasor generator. And then we consider such an inner product between the, you just sandwich this stress energy tensor by this the state defined over there. So tell me, did you see those couple of questions? Oh, is there a question? Oh, sorry. Can you? Uh can you take B n is equal to a n oh okay so Gaitan mentioned they just show that no emotional conversion or AGT plight one can compute negative partition by topological regression okay so maybe misstatement but anyway anyway so so what guide Anyway, so what Guyton did is that he proved that this can be computed by topological equation, right-hand side by computer, can be computed. Okay. Okay, so misstatement. What else? Do I need to mention something? Can you take BN trivial permutation? That I don't understand the meaning. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Oh, okay, okay, okay. One of them. One of them. Okay, so then just plug this one into here. So then, so the first term is very simple because I mean, you can just take the identity. So you just cancel. And then delta lambda. Sorry, sum of L and C L L C L plus two L. L plus 2 L lambda. Like this. And now also we just take a look at how the VR throw mode will act on them. And then since L1 acts on the constant as a lambda, so once you take equal to one, so you just have the lambda over z cube. Okay, so that's what you get. Okay, so that's what you get because L1 acts on the constant. And if you take the L0, 0 also acts a constant, so then you have a delta, z square. That's what you get. And then L minus 1 can act from this one as using some Hermitian conjugate, we can act as like this way. So that's how you obtain the. So, and if you look at this one. So, and if you look at this one and then compare with this guy, compare with spectral curve. It's the same form. And if you use the relation between U and like a delta or C, in fact, so this, if you take so-called, yeah, I think I should mention there is some central charge bilateral C is equal to one minus six. is equal to 1 minus 6 epsilon 1 over epsilon 2 minus epsilon 2 over epsilon 1 and square. I think this is the correct statement. Epsilon 1 epsilon 2 is the cistern equivalent parameter cis action appear here. And then once you take epsilon 1 2 goes to zero limit and you get the spectral curve sigma which is x minus lambda the q. Lambda C cubed plus u z plus lambda z. So therefore, so if you consider this quantity, you can get the class spectral curve. So therefore, using the epsilon one, epsilon two, so one can quantize. So this quantity can be understandable quantization huge system. Or more precise statement is a deformation of the. Statement is a deformation of the spectral curve by epsilon one, epsilon two. So more generally, more generally, so you if you have and then uh here I call it this one is phi two, right? Phi two, this one, this quantity phi two, sub two. So therefore, So therefore, if you take the T of Z dz square and the limit, so this bracket is just how to say, take the sandwich by this state, irregular state, it's wrong two goes to zero, and you get the phi two of three. So, and this statement can be generalized to the rank type A case, you can generalize. Type A case, you can generalize to the W algebra, W n algebra, but I'm not going to go into detail. So, in fact, this mirror transformation is to really look like mirror transformation can be understood a quantization of this one. But I'm not going to go into detail, but it's just straightforward generational hierarchy. Now, so Archer stars. Is the diagram theory is a physicist name of this following physicist name of following a hitching system. So no need to worry about that name. It's just some particular hitching system. So here it's irregular in the sense that the phi will take some matrix of which is counter-metrics. which is countermetrics dz and then uh z k over n plus one uh i think i should put the n equal to two because i only focus on virusural algebra at this in this talk and this is called uh a is the sum matrix cata matrix like and this is p1 uh p1 with one irregular puncture and then k is in fact we assumed here is equal to assumed here is equal to greater than two. Greater than two. And then here it's it's somehow some something called some particular call A1 I don't know. I mean no need to worry about the name. A1K minus three Aja starga three. A D is acronym. K is the the the k is the the anyway so it's labeled by this the number k here so k is an integer and the integer body uh integer body uh or positive integer value greater than two integer value the body so so particularly this irregular heating system we call it uh uh we can uh cook up some quantum field and we call it a just dark up and then uh spectral curve And then spectral curve of this theory, just take the again determinant of the x dz one minus phi of z, again capital phi of z equal to zero. And then what you get is as follows. So x squared is equal to lambda k c k plus two plus dot dot dot dot plus total to plus lambda okay minus two uh this is floor it's called floor because i mean it can't it can't be half integral uh that's why you have to take the some integer part sorry k plus two and then subsequent term uh the reason why i call it lambda is the some some constant but so Some constant, but so for the other constant, I call it u1. K2, I will call it y and z cube is the highest due to some power. I don't remember. So if you take the compute this quantity, you get this one. So this is the most singular term, and then you can have a subsequent singularity. So this is the more singular term, and you can have. Singular term, and you can have subsequent singular terms, for instance, dz, zk over 2, and some power b matrix B, and so on. If you consider such a system, the spectral curve become like this. And then the reason why it composes like this way is that the physicists give you some grading to the some grading. To the some grading or sorry, sorry, degree, degree to the x variable, which is k minus 2 over k. And then 1 over z, z inverse degree, we give 2 over k like this. And then we compare left-hand side and right-hand side. And then left-hand side plus 8 should be equal to right. 8 should be equal to right-hand side degree of right-hand side. So that should be the case. So plus 8 is really coming from actually, if you write down the cyber width, sorry, spectral curve in terms of one of a w variable instead of z variable. We don't need eight, this eight. This eight come from like just changing. From, like, just changing variable from Z to W. So, no need to worry about so much about plus eight shift. If you write down everything in W variable, so it becomes lambda k w k minus two, this part becomes w k minus two, and this one it becomes minus two, uh, w this floor, like this way. Anyway, then everything, uh, no need this plus eight shift. Plus eight shift, but no need to worry about this one. Then you can see that the this variable degree of this variable is in fact less than one less than or equal to one. For instance, you can easily compute left-hand side plus eight is equal to what? So left-hand side, 2 times k minus 2 over k plus 8 is equal to 2k plus 4 divided by k, right? And then if you compare with, if you plug this one into here, so degree of the lambda sub k is equal to zero. Okay, so this is zero. And next become lambda k minus one is. K minus one is in fact a degree one, and this not degree one, sorry, one over k or something like this. Sorry, k over two, two over k. And so. And since we assume the k is this variable, so therefore, so this degree is less than one. If degree is less than one, it's called so-called relevant coupling in physics. So-called relevant coupling in physicist language. Coupling. And this u are the, in fact, degree is greater than one. So this variable, it's called current branch. Branch parameter. It's also a name, actually. These are just the complex structure of the curve. Complex structure curve, spectral curve, but somehow. Spectral curve, but somehow we assign degree to each complex structure. And then, physicists, if they're less than or equal to one, we call it Laraban coupling. And then otherwise, we call it the R-Kuro-branch parameter. Okay, so then Okay, so then we assign again the try to quantize by using hitching system by 2D CFD. Quantize or deformation. Okay, maybe deformation is better worse. Deformation. Deform the hitching system, this hitching system by 2D CFT or Bira-Soro algebra. And again, we assorted. And again, we associate some so this irregular puncture, we assorted so-called ik over uh to some states. So they we assign the irregular puncture to some state. A state in vermo module, I will. Invermal module, we call I k over 2. Somehow we pick only this the high-order pole of the fixed field and the k over 2 part. So that's somehow physicist notation. But it's just a name. We just pick the order of pole of a Higgs field. And we try to construct these states by using Bira-Soron algebra. Algebra. And then the philosophy is the same. Philosophy is the same. So we just start with the sphere with irregular puncture. One irregular puncture. Previously, you have a two irregular puncture, but order is a three over two. It's very close to one. But here it's definitely the order has to be greater than a pole of the order greater than two. So that's the difference. Okay, so that's the difference. But now we assign that so this so here there's nothing. So the reason why we pick the inner product here, inner product here, and also we sandwich this operator into the CFT by two state since the hitching system has a two puncture, two puncture, two irregular puncture. However, here you have only one irregular puncture. have only one irregular function we assign this one is i of k over two and then uh we just consider the uh the same quantity as before okay but since there is nothing here we assign we just sandwich a back in okay so that's corresponding to the the quantity considered here okay quantity consider here and then we just normalize uh zero and i zero and i k over two. We want this quantity as a quantization or deformation of the spectral curve. So to do that, we do the same exercise. So this x squared minus zero and then sum over L L L over z l plus two and r. Um and I k over two and then little I k over two. That's the uh you know product we consider. And then so we want this quantity to be a deformation of this guy. When did I start? So when did I finish? Fifteen minutes okay, twenty minutes okay okay so then so to define uh this quantity so we uh we just let this action of the browser mode to the following. So the L act a virusomo acts on this k over 2. Okay, and then so we just act at the lambda of L. I hope this is the k. Yeah, and i, k over 2, this irregular, so I call it this one, it's the irregular state, so that's like a net label i. label I where the L is the this relevant coupling so as I mentioned the reason why I put this the degree is to distinguish greater than or less than sorry greater than one and less than or equal to one okay so I want to distinguish so these are called relevant coupling in physicist language these are called chrom Physicist language. These are called chromatic parameters, but we want the relevant coupling. So the part is just coming from the Biroul-Sero X as a constant. On the other hand, we need to satisfy L. L has to satisfy Birasoro algebra. So therefore, the lower model is automatically somehow, I wouldn't say automatical, but determined by a function of lambda. that um plus sum over i rounds for k over two and then ah greater than one and then i minus l and lambda i plus l and derivative of lambda i sorry i plus l hopefully it's readable from i plus l and then that acts on and then that acts on that acts on uh lambda sorry i okay over two like this okay so that's the how we define the action of to the this irregular states let's look at the example so uh in particular uh so l is uh less than uh sorry so k over two Over two, sorry, less than two and zero. And of course, the L L acts on this state, k over two, is equal to zero when the L is greater than K. So those are the action we consider. So negative model is not so important, so I will consider at this moment. So this is a state. Let's look at the example. Let's look at the example. The simplest example is the L2 acts on this K is. Let's look at the K is equal to 2. Then you have 1, the axon lambda 2, I 1. And then lambda 1 acts on I1 is equal to lambda 1. And then lambda 0 acts as a differential operator to lambda 2 lambda 1. Lambda one sorry lambda two plus uh lambda one del del lambda one this state okay so these are the action of the and it has to so you can easily check that this obey the BRCOL algebra for instance you can check L2 L0 is equal to 2L 0 so you can easily check first you act on L L L2, and then after that, the L0 acts on this one. You get this derivative acts on lambda two, but you restore lambda two, but instead you have a quotient two. So therefore, you restore two here. And also, you can check the L1, L0. These are non-trivial part of Birasora algebra in this representation. You can check this. You can check this so that so this action is consistent consistent where two lambda two the lambda two this one is the yeah two L zero you mean minus two you mean Ah, you're right. Thank you so much. That's what you mean. Sorry. Thank you very much. Any other questions? And so on. Okay, so then, so if you look at this one, so if you just look at it using this one, this can be understood as follows. One, this can be understood as follows. So, here the higher mod is equal to zero. So, this x square minus lambda k. So, this part is automatic, k plus two. And then plus dot dot dot dot plus lambda k over two floor z k over two. Okay, over two plus two. These are automatic by using this action. And the latter one is indeed much more complicated. It's the plus some whatever. F of L of lambda acts on some I minus L and this one, I plus L acts on like this way. Like this way, and you just need to sandwich I, A, and then zero, and take norm, like this way. And then if you correctly evaluate this differential operator and take a limit, you should reproduce the current branch environment. That's how the quantization of a hitching system should be defined from this language. From physics language. So, those are the preparation of the how to construct this irregular state corresponding to this irregular punctual hitching system. Then in the case of the in the case of the, for instance, if you okay, so let's use the example. Example, so for instance, example, so. For instance, example, so zero of I, let's see, x squared minus t of t of the i1 case is given by x squared minus the minus the lambda square z to the four lambda one z to the cube and here what you get is the What you get is the log of 0i1. And then here you need to insert the differential operator 2 lambda 2 del del lambda 2 plus lambda 1 and del del lambda 1. So you just plug into here. And then so once you once you can determine this inner product and the axon derivative. And the axon derivative and axon derivative and x epsilon one goes to zero, you get the so-called current branch method u. That's how you define the current branch moment. And now ten minutes five minutes Okay, so then when k is equal to even case, k is the even case you can just define. You can just define as the following. So the so-called free field representation: LL is equal to J0 plus I and Q Jn plus sum of I is not equal to 0 and L J i J L minus I and L is not zero. J i is the side Heidermoga algebra. Heisenberg algebra, you're familiar with i delta i plus j equal to zero. This is Heisenberg. Okay. And our zero is something like j0 square plus q square over four plus two sum over a minus k ah sorry, j minus k and j k is greater than zero. And then so this. And then, so this state is the i k over 2 at this moment. Now we can call it, since k is even, we can call m. And then here, the action of this, the Heisenberg acts as following, minus C L I of M. If you define like this way, so one can just write down this action. So, one can just write down this action of the Rossor mode as follows. If you use this, then what you get is that the L L I of M acts on the constant I is equal to L minus M C I C L minus I acts on I M and then And then the lower mode acts as the more complicated manner, as you might expect. And then this one is equal to minus sum over C I, C L minus I, I is equal to 0 to L minus 1, and plus some differential operator. Some differential operator, sum over i is equal to 1. equal to one um m minus l and then c i plus l del del c i acts on i n okay so that's the case uh in fact i'm missing some term uh important c l times q minus c zero and so on q minus c zero is missing but anyway so the important thing is that if you compare between uh this one this part This one, this part, and that part. So, this capital lambda corresponding to now the constant mode of the action of the Heisenberg. And this differential operator part is just corresponding to this guy. Okay, so therefore, in the language of some people familiar with the ARI structure or topological recursion, this lambda. Logical recursion, this lambda or c are called so-called shift. Witteka shift of the in the case of the VRE structure. And then the resolute harm is determined by just the try to satisfy this computation relation Birasoro algebra. But this is also the same. So if you just do the compare, the check the Biron Sero algebra differential operator here is. Differential operator here is automatically determined. Or you just replace this CI as the CI, and the negative model is corresponding like this way, like derivative. So this work is done by the by Gauton Teschner Gauton Tescher. Gaut on Tessian. So, this representation is given by Gaiot on Teshana. And then Tessian. So, this is 2012 around here. And then let's look at the simplex example. And then here, what we have is the L2 again is 1 is equal to minus C1 square and I1. And I1. Unfortunately, I'm running out of time. I1 is equal to minus 2C1 to alpha minus QI1, like this way. And then I0 acts as a differential brain. And alpha, Q minus alpha, and plus C1, the other. The other C1, like this one, and acts on the state like this. Okay. And then we can just consider the I can be constructed as an explicit manner, as a linear combination of the descendant. Unfortunately, time is up, almost up. But didn't you mention it's five minutes later minus alpha? minus alpha q minus alpha plus beta q minus beta and then delta beta plus uh c1 minus uh two alpha minus q over uh delta beta actually this is called delta beta and this is delta alpha alpha and l minus one acts on uh this delta minus one acts on this delta beta and so on some number acts on L minus one square plus some number acts on L minus two acts on the primary field and then here you have one of C1 square and so on so here is a primary state and then the low negative mode acts on descendants also descendant mode acts on a descendant, those are descendants with some coefficient. And even though here the states parameterize C1 and alpha are the parameters which define the state. But since we have the differential operator here, differential operator here, you have to introduce so-called initial condition. Initial condition is extra parameter beta here, beta here. But if you just plug Here. But if you just plug this one into here and recursively look at how the C1 derivative acts on and the L0 acts on it, in fact, this state satisfy this differential equation or representation BRASOR algebra. But even though this is characterized as C1 alpha, you need to specify so-called initial condition better, and that corresponds to the following operation. So this to get the I1. So, this to get I1, you start with primary field B alpha of C B of beta, and then you have to bring B alpha of C1 and bring this one and collide. So, the primary field needs to collide to another primary field to get the I1 state. So, therefore, when you collide them together, the order of four. The order of power of the Higgs field will be increased by one, one plus one, and you get the two, and it corresponds to this state. And then what's happening is that the so when you collide them together, so the information of this, how to say the concord dimension is being encoded. So that so therefore, when you this the I1 should This, the I1 should encode the information alpha and the beta. That is exactly the alpha here and the initial condition of beta here. And then here. So those are the information about the, I think time is up, unfortunately. I have to finish by just mentioning some progress on open problem. So these are the case opt case. K is equal to K is the odd case odd case odd case we cannot use free field representation because I mean L so for instance L5 contain like an L2 L3 and then L3 L2 and then L6 contain a hard sorry J J J J and J J three J three plus J three j three plus j three j three plus total total plus total total and once you define that the j acts as a constant to the irregular states j3 acts as a constant so what we want is l5 acts on something like 502 to be some constant but l6 acts as the analysis the the state state but if you set the But if you set the J3 acts a constant, automatically L6 also acts a constant, non-zero constant. So we cannot use this free field representation. But we now, the ongoing work with my undergrad student, we also have the representation of Birasarajo for K-Ott case, and we try to generalize to the higher run case. And also, we already determined explicit expression FL. Expression F L for any k so that the so that this representation satisfies becomes the representation of your third. So those are some progress and the important thing is to construct so i k of two or high ranked version by uh topological recursion logical recursion recursion or the CRE structure structure is the I think the open problem I can just skip to the to the to the audience here and then I should stop here
