Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much for the introduction and for the invitation to speak. And thank you, DePierre and all the organizers for bringing us together here on Zoom and Gather to listen to stimulating talks and catch up. So the project I'm presenting today is joint work with Nkalo Malawo, who was an undergraduate student at Who was an undergraduate student at Purdue, but has now graduated and he'll be applying for graduate schools in the fall. And I hope you'll look out for his application because I think he's really exceptional. He's also a really good speaker, as those of you who have seen versions of his talk at Purdue and Berkeley can attest. So I can recommend him to you on those grounds as well. But today, you'll all get my version of the talk, and I hope you'll enjoy listening to something relatively elevated. Uh, relatively elementary at the end of the day, uh, actually, shortly before bedtime in my case. And um, so the plan is to keep everything relatively light and fun, omit all the more complicated calculations and estimates, and um, but hopefully still keep enough substance to keep it interesting. So, so we'll see how I do. Okay, um, so our story begins in uh 1993 when uh Cromie Lutzen. When Cromie, Lutz, and Eigler used what was at the time recent technology to arrange 48 iron atoms. So these little dots arranged in a circle here are iron atoms. And they manipulated these individual iron atoms into a circle to create what is still one of the smallest stable structures that people are able to create, manipulating individual atoms. And they were able to trap. Able to trap a little electron in there. So, apparently, on a copper surface like this, electrons sort of skitter across like bugs, and they were able to catch one in this little ring and then see what it does. And for an electron at this type of length scale and energy scale, we use non-relativistic quantum mechanics to describe the behavior, and that's what they did. And so, what they did was they actually approximated the atoms using a hard barrier approximation, which means that they imagined an impenetrable wall as being arranged here on this circle. This is the particle in a box approximation that you might know from undergraduate quantum mechanics. And if you solve that problem, what you're doing is solving this eigenvalue problem. So, maybe I should say first over here is. All right, so maybe I should say first over here is the Schrödinger equation with all the constants set to one. And to look for energies, we separate variables and replace this derivative with respect to t by an energy e. So that's over here on the right. And we're finding the eigenvalues of the disk. So this is a famous calculation. You might recognize it from the beginning of Scheice's talk on Monday. And if you've done it before, you know that these are Bessel. Done it before, you know that these are Bessel functions. And if not, it's very analogous to the same thing in one dimension. You can solve the same problem with just an interval. That's the 1D particle in a box, or the vibrating string is really the same problem. And then you get these sine functions that look basically like this also. And so we have these different energy states. And those energies correspond to frequencies of oscillation. So over here in the middle, I have psi as a function of x and t, and I multiply the The eigenfunction by this oscillatory phase, and that's my solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. So that's what Cromi-Lutz and Eigler did and compared it to the actual energies that they were able to measure for their experimental setup. So over here, I have a plot taken from their paper of the energies that they found, and you can see how well it matches. So the different columns in my picture on the right for the picture on the right for the eigenstates of the laplacian the different columns correspond to different angular momentum modes and then the different rows rows are different energies within those angular momentum modes and and the same scheme appears on the left here so in the left column you can see the the radial modes and you can see that especially at low energies the match is really good so these uh dashed lines with very short dashes Lines with very short dashes. Those are, you know, at the top, you can see it says peaks at circle center. So that corresponds to the radial modes. And you can see they match pretty well, especially at low energies. Although at higher energies, you start to see more and more of a discrepancy. And then you can also see some results for the excited angular momentum modes. But the main thing I want to emphasize at this point is just that the energies are predicted quite well by this hard barrier approximation. Quite well by this hard barrier approximation, and especially at low energies, it's good. At higher energies, it's not so good. So, we'll come back to those phenomena. Are there any questions so far? Okay. So now we'll jump ahead to 2010. So there have been many papers on this subject. I don't want to try to survey the whole history of the problem. But in 2010, Barza Littel and Heller did a very interesting Did a very interesting study of the time decay of this problem. So, in the previous slide, we were looking at the hard barrier approximation. So, the particle is trapped in there forever. Now, we want to understand how can the particle actually leak out. We know it doesn't stay in there forever. It leaves at a certain rate. And so, that's what Barzel and Heller looked at. And so, for that, instead of eigenvalues, they wanted to compute resonances. Now, we don't have perfect reflection at the boundary anymore. We have imperfect reflection, and the so-called energy is complex. And the so-called energy is complex. So we have a similar form for the solution with the oscillatory factor, but now E is going to be complex, will be decay as well as oscillations. The real part is going to be frequency of oscillation as before, and the imaginary part will be rate of decay. And we want to understand how the decay rate depends on the chorale. And you can see here in their paper that they found some resonances here computed numerically. I hope you can read this small print here. I hope you can read this small print here. The real energy is the axis over here on the right, and the imaginary part is the axis on the left. The vertical thing is linear density of states. I don't want to worry about that unless somebody's really fascinated by it. And the main thing to notice is just that they are seeing decay rates here, different imaginary parts, which are growing with energy. And so that's something that we'll also come back to in the talk. Okay, good. And then And then in the mathematics community, this was picked up by Galkowski and Smith and Galkowski in a series of papers. And here's the math problem that they set up to correspond to this. So here's a picture again from Barza, Littel, and Heller of their choral, this time in a stadium shape and the electron trapped inside. And so what Galkowski-Smith and Galkowski did was just call that a domain omega and solve this Schrödinger equation. This is the same one I wrote before. Equation. This is the same one I wrote before, except now I've introduced a semi-classical parameter h, and I've introduced a potential. So they look at this potential vh, which is supported on the boundary. So it's a singular potential supported on the boundary. And they look at different examples, but the one I want to focus on in this talk is just the multiple of the delta function supported on here. And the multiple that I want to look at, vh, is a multiple which depends on h. So that corresponds to having an So that corresponds to having an electron which interacts with the barrier in a way that depends on energy. And that's apparently a realistic assumption. Also applies to other problems. I'm focusing on the electron here because it's just a fun and vivid example, but it also apparently applies to concert halls, other types of waves. At any rate, for our problem, we have this parameter alpha greater than zero, which measures the strength of the barrier. So it's multiplying this delta function. So it's multiplying this delta function, and the bigger alpha is, the stronger the barrier is. As you can see, h is a small parameter. And so now our question that we're interested in is: how are the decay rates related to the strength of the barrier? That's what I'm going to want to focus on in this talk. Okay. And actually, the problem that I want to talk about is an even simpler version of this problem, which is the half-line problem. So this is the simplest possible setting where the thin barrier is now reduced to just a single point. So the picture. So, the picture I want to look at is replacing this shape here by a problem on the half-line. I put a hard barrier at zero and then a thin barrier at one, and then the electron will be trapped in this interval. And what's nice about this problem is that because it's the simplest possible problem, all the thin complicated thin barrier stuff is happening at a single point. We can solve things quite explicitly and get a really complete picture of what all the resonances are doing and see some of the same features. Doing and see some of the same features that happen in the more complicated higher-dimensional problem, and there are also some differences, and I'll point those out as we go along. So, we'll get a very complete understanding of this problem. And the first thing we're going to do is get a very complete understanding of what a resonance is, which is very simple in this case. So, we can define a resonance using this equation. Here's the stationary Schrödinger equation with the energy z squared and the delta potential. So, I've color-coded it here. The green term is the thin barrier and the hard barrier. The thin barrier, and the hard barrier is the boundary condition at zero. And then in between, I've put what's called the outgoing condition. And this is easiest to understand if you look at first the case of an eigenvalue. So if you want to solve an eigenvalue problem like this, then you take this differential equation, which initially has, you know, two terms. In the general solution, you have two terms here, two exponential terms with the different possible signs. But if I want to have an eigenvalue, then I need my solution to be an L2. So one of these terms is ruled out. And I set up my convention. Terms is ruled out. And I set up my convention so that when the imaginary part of Z is positive, I'm looking for eigenvalues when the imaginary part of Z is positive. So that means that this is just a square root convention to take this one to be the decaying one and this one to be the one that's not decaying. So for an eigenvalue, I have only the decaying one and not the non-decaying one. And then a resonance happens when we solve the same equation, but it's not an eigenvalue, i.e., the parameter. The parameter Z is in the closed lower half plane. So it's not an integrable state. It's on L2 state, sorry. And then that's called a resonance state, and that's a resonance. And for this particular problem, actually, it's easy to see that there are no eigenvalues. If you just multiply this equation by u bar, you can pretty much do this in your head and integrate both sides. You can see that if it's going to be an eigenvalue, imaginary part of Z is positive. So this is negative. So you get positive equals negative. That doesn't work. So there are no eigenvalues. So this probably of only resonance. No eigenvalue, so this probably of only resonances. So, does everybody understand what a resonance is? This is meant to be very easy. If it's not clear, it's because I explained it badly. So, please ask. Okay, well, we'll assume that everybody got that. So, this is what we're looking at, resonances. And here, I've just repeated the same equation, but just to interpret it again in terms of the formulas I showed you before, a resonance is a number z now with imaginary part of z less than or equal to zero, for which we solve this equation. For which we solve this equation, and then we can take the solution u and plug it into the same format we had before, the separated solution psi, and we'll solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation now, and our solution psi will have an exponential decay according to the imaginary part of z. So that's very easy to see. So now we can reformulate our question again, still more precisely. How are the imaginary parts of resonances related to the strength of the barrier? So basically, I want to understand how are the imaginary parts of Z and How are the imaginary parts of Z in this problem related to the strength of the barrier, this H to the minus alpha? Okay. So, as a warm-up to understand what's going to happen before giving you the answer, I want to do another elementary calculation from undergraduate quantum mechanics that maybe you've seen before, but if not, again, it should be very accessible. We just move our delta function just to zero, just for simplicity, and And so, what we're doing here is solving for this special type of solution u, this type of wave, where e to the izx, the first term here, represents the incoming wave, and then we have two other terms, a reflected wave and a transmitted wave. So here they are in the picture, the incoming wave coming in from the left in this case, and then there's a transmitted wave and a reflected wave. And it's very easy to solve this. So, to solve it, we just Um, we just um impose the delta function condition at zero. U needs to be continuous at zero and obey a jump condition. Um and then and then if we plug that in, we get from continuity at zero, that's just one plus r equals t. And then the jump condition is right here. I just take the derivative of the first term and apply this jump, and here's what I get. Jump, and here's what I get. You can solve this very easily, explicitly, and find this formula for the transmission coefficient. So 2iz over 2iz minus h to the 1 minus alpha. And when we write that down, we can see that, well, first of all, the derivative with respect to alpha is negative, as it should be. A stronger barrier means less decay. So remember, alpha being bigger means this barrier is stronger. So we're seeing less transmission when the barrier is. Less transmission when the barrier is stronger. So that should be less to k. And then as h goes to zero, this transmission coefficient goes to one if alpha is less than one and zero if alpha is greater than one. So it's easy to take this limit and you can see that if alpha is less than one, we're getting almost full transmission. In the limit, we get full transmission. And when alpha is greater than one, in the limit, we get full reflection. So we're seeing that transmission is dominating when alpha is less than one, and reflection is dominating when alpha is greater than one. Is dominating when else is greater than one. And then, if we go to solve our problem now, I can give you the main result. So, the main result here, again, just to recap the problem that we're solving, the definition of a resonance. And what we find is, here's the main theorem. All the resonances, we look at resonances in some region, epsilon up to one over epsilon, for this problem. And that's just looking at a compact region. It's just convenient to avoid z equals zero and z. Avoid z equals zero and z equals infinity, but otherwise we can get uniform results in large compact sets and find these asymptotics for the resonances. And you see that the behavior changes at alpha equals one. So I'll illuminate these formulas a little bit more later, but for now I just want to point out that you can tell we're saying the imaginary part of z is close to some formula, and you can see that if alpha is less than one, this is roughly h times a logarithm. Is roughly h times a logarithmic factor, whereas if alpha is greater than one, this is h to some power which is greater than one. So we're seeing polynomially close resonances. So here's the answer in words. We see that there's a slower decay for bigger alpha as we expect, and then also a qualitative change in behavior when alpha equals one from this logarithmic behavior to this polynomial behavior. And I don't want to dwell. And I don't want to dwell too much on these remainders, but you can notice that they're as they should be, you know, smaller. Okay. So any questions about the statement? Okay. And so to understand how this happens, we solve for the resonances explicitly using, again, as before, just solve this boundary value problem like an ODE class. Problem like in ODE class. If we want u of 0 equals 0, we need a sine function between 0 and 1. When it's greater than 1, we have our prescribed exponential function. And then c must be chosen to make this continuous and have the jump condition. So I put those equations here, making it continuous and imposing the jump condition. So here, all you do is you take the derivative, subtract the two derivatives, and plug in the value at zero here. And some simple algebra on this equation. Some simple algebra on this equation, these two equations, you just eliminate c and write everything using a single single exponential function, you can get this formula for a resonance, at least when z is not zero. So z equals zero, as you know, the formula is a little different, but that's not important here. Here's our formula for the resonances when z is not zero. So that just comes from plugging in the continuity condition and the chump condition. Okay. Okay. And then, and so if we write it that way, so here I've just recopied the equation in brown, I guess. And here I've just recopied the problem just for reference. And then we can look at this equation when alpha goes to infinity and see that it simplifies very nicely. So when alpha goes to infinity, these two terms dominate and this one goes away. And we get this simple equation e to the And we get this simple equation e to the 2iz over h equals 1, which we know how to solve. That's just z equals h pi k. Or again, k is an integer different from zero because zero is special. And these values are exactly the problem that we saw way back in slide two, basically, the hard barrier problem. So this is, again, the exact eigenvalues that you find for solving the simpler problem that everybody does in some undergraduate boundary value problems class or Schrodinger class. Schrodinger class. So the sine functions that I mentioned before, i.e., the same problem with the thin barrier replaced by a hard barrier. So the thin barrier here that we're solving with this delta and the limit as alpha goes to infinity, the barrier just becomes infinitely high. So we're trapped in there. And here I've plotted some resonances. So brown is for the resonances and blue is for the fixed problem dots. And we can see here a nice comparison with the hard barrier approximation of Prami-Lutzen. Barrier approximation of Pramey-Lutz and Eigler, and also the fact that the energies are matching more closely when we're at low energy and then at high energy there's more of a discrepancy. Okay, so we're able to recover that easily from this equation. And then, and now I can restate our main result again, or really just, this is the same slide I showed you before, but now with the equation for resonances that we're working with. So it's really a very That we're working with. So it's really a very simple statement that if I am looking at solutions to this equation here, this three-term transcendental equation, then the solutions to it obey these asymptotics. So here we've computed the leading order behavior as h goes to zero of solutions to this equation. Okay, and so what's nice about this equation is it's very simple and you can generate plots for it very easily. Generate pots for it very easily. In fact, so easily that I'm going to take the risk of trying to do it now in real time and maybe provide some amusement here in the late evening or you know, whatever time of day it is for people. So you just go to desmos.com, which is this amazing website that's so easy to use that even I can just do it on the fly, hopefully. You just go to desmos.com and you can just start typing h to the minus a. So we'll do zero equals. Oops. Right. Right, add a slider. You should always add a slider. Okay, add a slider. And then e to the power, so you just have to do the real and imaginary parts of this equation: e to the minus 2y over h cosine of 2x over h. So this is the real part of the equation minus h to the minus a. So here I'm just writing the real part of the equation. Oops, oh no. Oops. Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. Can I undo that? No, sorry. You have to put up with this. Okay, I'll do it again. Right above your cursor, there's an arrow going back. Oh, I see. Yes. Thank you. Oh, good. Thank you, Pierre. You saved the day. Okay. Okay, now we'll do the equation for you just the same thing with sine 2x over h, and then this. Over h. And then this other term is also a little bit different. It's plus 2x over h. So here, if you hold this down, you can pick a color. So here, green. So green is for the imaginary part and blue. Sorry, red is the real part and blue is the imaginary part. And you can see where they're crossing. And then here we'll let h go between 0 and 1. And it's very fun here. You can just play with these parameters. These parameters. And, you know, so we want H to be kind of small, and we want we can look at alpha smaller. Let me let it catch up, I guess. So if alpha is smaller, here are the resonances, and then it gets bigger, and we can see them moving up and approaching the real axis. And you can play around with that. And you can also, so let me zoom in a little bit. Maybe that's appropriate here. And then, so we'll start with alpha small because that's my first result, and then I can do the approximation here. So, here's my ln and sorry, zero equals all that. So, you can see it's doing really well when alpha is small, and then we'll put in the competition. Is small, and then we'll put in the competing approximation when alpha is not so small. So here's the polynomial one: sorry, y plus x squared h to the power 2a minus 1. All right, so on the first two rows, again, just to recap, I've written the real and imaginary parts of this. And then on the next rows, I've written the approximations that we got. And so you can see that when alpha is not. And so you can see that when alpha is not too big, the first approximation is doing really well, the logarithmic one. And then as alpha increases, that one gradually does worse, and the other one sort of takes over. And so you can go back and forth and watch it sort of hand off between the logarithmic and the polynomial one. And you can also play around with different values of h. So if you like this problem, this is a very fun way to analyze it. And actually, you can also look at many other problems with Desmond. And actually, you can also look at many other problems with Desmos very easily. It's much more fun than Mathematica or whatever that you have to muck around with coding. Although, you know, that also has its advantages, of course. Okay, so any more requests before I go back to the slides to see different versions of this? Or I can also leave that to the reader, so to speak. Okay, so we'll go back to the traditional format if I can do this. Phew, okay, I made it through that. Excellent. All right, so now for some context, right? So now for some context, right? I said I would compare with what happens in higher dimensions. So here's higher dimensions. So Galkowski studies a number of problems in higher dimensions, actually, including very general ones. But the one where he gets the most detailed information is the disk. And that's the one I want to compare with. So he's looking at the disk, the same problem on the disk, but and real part of Z is approximately one. And so he finds these formulas for the resonances. And here I've recopied our formulas for the resonances in that case. For the resonances in that case, when real part of z is approximately one. So here I've just recopied the same logarithm and power that we had before. I'll just put real part of z to be one. And here Galkowski has similar things. And in fact, it's just the same for small values of alpha, but you'll notice for larger values of alpha, something different is happening. The transition between logarithmic and polynomial behavior is occurring at a different value of alpha, and that's because a different phenomenon is at work here. A different phenomenon is at work here. The difference in his result is due to glancing or whispering gallery mode. So, here I've drawn a picture of that. These are trajectories moving very close to the boundary of the disk. So, that means waves or eigenstates in this case concentrated very close to these trajectories. So, they're bunched up around the edge here and they're moving in this direction. And those are the ones that contribute at Contribute it starts contributing when alpha is greater than five six to resonance is close to the real axis. And of course, in our case, there is no analog of this. We have this simple one-dimensional problem where there's just a point. So there are no glancing or whispering gallery modes to generate anything. And so the resonance closer to the real axis start happening at a different value of alpha, and it's due to a different reason. The reason is reflection rather than glancing. So we see that. Okay, and now I'm ready to. And now I'm ready to dive into the method of proof. So, for the method of proof, we want to solve this equation, h to the minus alpha. So, here I've written it again. And to solve it, we use the Lambert W function. So this is a special function. We recognize that this equation, which has, it's annoying because it has a z both in the exponent and here in the linear term. And that's annoying because, well, yeah, we can't solve that using elementary functions. Well, yeah, we can't solve that using elementary functions, but we recognize that we've seen equations like this before. This is a famous function going back to 1758 with Lambert. You know, one of these old school types who you probably recognize his name also from things like the Lambert projection in maps. He was also involved in the nebular hypothesis for the origin of the universe and origin. And all or origin of galaxies and stars, and you know, friends with Kant and all this stuff. And anyway, among many things, transcendence or irrationality of pi. I'm a fan anyway, but he also did analyze this equation. And you can read about it in this more recent paper, Coralis, Gunnett, Hard, Jeffrey, and Knuts, that we used for information about this function. They survey the history of this problem back to Lambert and include a lot of. And include a lot of very useful pictures and formulas that we used for our problem. So we're solving this equation. And of course, if we're complex solutions, there's going to be infinitely many of them, a countable set. We're going to index them with k. And we want to rewrite our equation in that format. That's very easy to do. We just multiply through by basically this power of e, the one that's going to be equal. The one that's going to be the linear term. So, if we multiply by that power of e and then just rearrange, we get this format. So, what used to be h to the minus alpha times some power of e, now it's times a different power of e with no z's in it. And all the z's have been brought into this form, x e to the x. So, now here we have an equation of the form x e to the x equals y. We just apply the w function to both sides, and we're all set. We have a closed form formula for our resonances in terms of the. For our resonances in terms of the Lambert W function. So that's wonderful. Okay. And so here's our theorem again. Now I'm ready to start proving it because, remember, we want to find all this information about the resonances, say that the imaginary parts are close to these certain real parts of the resonances. And to do that, we just use this formula we now have in terms of the Lambert W function. And we can see that. Can see that, remember, we're looking at a semi-classical problem. Alph is a positive parameter, h is small, so this is large. So, what we want is asymptotics of the w function when the argument is large. And those are known. And in fact, it's even better than an asymptotic expansion. It's actually a convergent series expansion, which we got out of this paper. And to introduce it, I'll first just remind you how it works for the much simpler exponential problem. So, everybody knows how to solve e to the So, everybody knows how to solve e to the x equals y. You just solve it with the logarithm, and it's the real logarithm that we all know from, you know, whatever elementary school or, and then minus 2 pi ik. And traditionally, you put plus 2 pi ik, but in this problem, it's more convenient to use minus. Of course, that's equivalent since k is an integer. And so we know how to solve that. For w, we notice that w is actually pretty similar to that. e to the x equals y is pretty similar. Similar to that. e to the x equals y is pretty similar to x e to the x equals y. And if y is going to be big, then x is going to be big. And if x is going to be big, the exponential will dominate the linear. So that's why in our expansion, we get this first term here solving for x in the more difficult equation. The first term is the same. So leading order, the behavior is the same. And then you can compute correction terms. And that's what people did. And the first correction term is this minus logarithm of the first term, actually. And then you get a remainder. Term actually, and then you get a remainder which has this expansion, which is just a series. So the remainder is not just going to zero, it's this explicit, fairly explicit, convergent series. I guess the not explicit part is these coefficients, these combinatorial coefficients, but even they have an attractive combinatorial meaning. So the Stirling number PQ is the number of ways to arrange P objects into Q cycles. You know, so you imagine like beads on a necklace. You have P objects and you make Q necklaces with them, and then that's the. Necklaces with them, and then that's the number this number here that appears. And so this is the expansion for the W function. Okay, and then so we plug that in. So we plug the W function formula. So X is Wk of Y. So that's the, sorry, this is just the formula that I had on the previous slide for. Formula that I had on the previous slide for x, and we plug that into the resonance equation. So that gives us: here's the same resonance equation I wrote before, and now we just put that in. So we have this logarithm, this h to the alpha, that's from ln of y, right? Y is now this, h to the minus alpha e times, h to the minus alpha times e h to the minus alpha, that's y. So when we plug it in, ln of y is just the sum of these two terms, minus 2 pi i k. That's just. terms minus 2 pi i k that's just copied over and then here we have this nested log plus a remainder and um and then we can simplify that by just canceling the h to the minus alpha terms and then solving for z so just putting those constants over there and now we've got this formula for z in terms of um now we've got this this formula for z in terms of this series r basically but the leading terms are we've got this h to the h to are we've got this h to the h pi k is what came out of this 2 pi i k. Remember, this part got canceled, this ln got combined in. Here we've got our logarithm with all the logarithmic terms, and here we've got our remainder. And so here's our series formula for Z. Remember, R is given by this series of combinatorial coefficients. Okay. And so And so here it is again. I've copied the formula up there again. And just as a reminder, the remainder r is going to zero. And to sort of get a feel for this formula, again, the easiest thing to do is to let alpha go to infinity, just as we did before. When we let alpha go to infinity, this picture comes back. And we can see that z is going to be approximately h pi k. So why is that? Well, if you just let alpha go to infinity in this fraction, you can see that the middle term is just one. The middle term is just one. This term on the left here is small. And then this term here, as alpha gets bigger, it's just going to get beaten. So basically, this whole thing goes to the logarithm of one. And that's why, and r is also going to zero as a small term. So the dominant term is h pi k. And so once again, we've recovered this fact that we saw before that the resonances for the thin barrier problem converge to the resonances. Thin barrier problem converge to the resonances of the hard barrier problem when the strength of the barrier gets big. So remember, alpha measured the strength of the barrier. As that's going to infinity, the barrier, thin barrier becomes a hard barrier. And so these resonances are converging. And we can also see from this that the reason I chose K the way I did, this way we get the same indexing that we had before for our solutions K. So basically we're numbering the solutions in the same way using K, except now they're not exactly on the Except now they're not exactly on the real axis, they're a little bit off it, as you saw in the plots that I did on Desmos a little bit earlier. And then, and so when h goes to zero, so now for now leave alpha alone, remember, we don't want to take alpha goes to infinity, we want to study the more interesting and challenging limit, h goes to zero. And now k has to go to infinity unless z goes to zero, right? If h is going to zero, and um, so there's a separate thing. So, there's a separate thing looking at resonances close to zero. I don't want to do that here. I don't want my resonances to go to zero. So, the only way that can be avoided is if k is going to infinity. So, k has to do the work here and go to infinity. And then when that happens, now we can approximate the real part of the resonances very simply, because this h pi k is once again the dominant term. As h goes to zero, you can see that, right, this is going to one. Over here, it's small, logarithmic over linear. Logarithmic over linear. And over here, we have a k, but the k inside the logarithm cannot compete with the k outside the logarithm. So all of these terms are dominated by this one. So h pi k is dominant, and the remainder is o of h. Actually, here you can also compute that nicely by if you take the real part of both sides, when you take the real part of this term, that's the imaginary part of the logarithm. As you know, imaginary part of logarithm is arg, and so arg is bounded. So that's, remember, I remember. Remember, I don't remember if I said before it's principal branches all the way, so there's no issues with art blowing up or anything. And so, anyway, so that's bounded, so that's why this real part of Z is basically H pi K. And we can see that in the picture here. The real parts are very closely approximated by H pi K. And now we can plug that into the imaginary part. So the imaginary part, you know, I take the imaginary part now of both sides of this equation. First term goes away. And now I look at this big log. Now it becomes log of an absolute value plus a remainder. Plus a remainder. So the remainder, this R here of just written as this little O remainder. And then this ln is became ln of absolute value because I took the imaginary part of both sides. So it's the real part of the logarithm. That's the logarithm of the absolute value. And then, and I can use this approximation for real part of z. Real part of z is approximately h pi k. So 2 pi i k is approximately 2i h inverse real part of z just from H inverse real part of Z, just from rearranging this equation. So this gives me a formula for the imaginary part of Z approximately equal to this formula involving the real part of Z. And then on the next step, I want to track down the change in behavior from alpha greater than 1 to alpha less than 1 in this formula. So here I just recopied the same formula with the 2 pi ik becoming the real part of Z. Pi ik becoming the real part of z. And then I just look for different values of alpha at what's going on in this fraction. So the dominant term depends on alpha. If alpha is less than one, then you can see that the dominant term is the last one. So remember, oh yeah, over here is easier to look at. So here we've got real part of z, and we're just comparing h inverse with h to the minus alpha. And so if alpha is less than one, then these terms lose out to this one. Then these terms lose out to this one, and we just drop them. And here's the ln. So here I just dropped the first two terms in the fraction and just copied that over. And this is exactly the leading order behavior I claimed in the theorem a little bit earlier. And then when alpha is greater than one, now the dominant term is the middle one. So we drop the first term and keep the second one because, well, if we drop both terms, we'll just get zero. We don't want zero. Zero. We don't want zero. So we drop the smaller term and keep the bigger term, and then we get this. And right, so here all I did was move the denominator upstairs, ln of one, and then it's this. And then ln of absolute value, I just wrote that out using the definition of the modulus of a complex number, right? A squared plus b squared square root. So that's just writing this out without any complex numbers. And then you just use the first term of the approximation of logarithm. So ln of one plus logarithm so ln of one plus t is approximately t so here it is so you plug that in and you recover the that's the term i claimed for um for alpha greater than one okay so that's the derivation of the leading order asymptotic and um and all that remains are the error estimates uh you know all that remains so then what you have to do is go back and everywhere i put this squigly equals you have to you know put minus or plus To put minus or plus a remainder and estimate the remainder. And so that's where my collaborator really put in a lot of hard labor and estimated all those remainders and got the theorems that I showed you about a few slides ago. So, as I said, it's too late in the day for me to do such remainder estimates, especially over Zoom on slides. So, instead, I'll just give you a conclusion. So, what happened? Conclusion. So, what happened here is we computed resonances for this problem on the half-line. So, the Schrödinger operator with this delta potential, with this H-dependent strength of the barrier. And we saw that reflection dominates transmission when alpha is greater than one, but not when alpha is less than one. And when reflection is dominating transmission, we're getting the polynomially long-living resonances. And otherwise, we had these logarithmic ones. So, the polynomial ones were. The polynomial ones were longer, and the logarithmic ones were less. And we saw this change in behavior at alpha equals one. And then we compared that with the result of Galkowski, who found a transition in behavior between five at alpha equals five, six, because a different phenomenon was at work. So he had glancing, and that was producing the polynomially long-living resonances when alpha was greater than five-sixths. And so in our simpler problem, we got precise asymptotics. We got precise asymptotics, including a full convergent series expansion. So I just showed you what I think is the most interesting result, but it's clear that if you work with these formulas, you can, you know, uncover presumably all the secrets that these resonances have to hold and find out anything you could be possibly interested in about them. So with that, I'll stop. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. That was very interesting. Are there questions for Kiral? Simon. Hi, so I noticed that you that's right. It's not just your bedtime, Carol. It's our bedtime too. I noticed that you carefully omitted the case alpha equals to one. Is there a fixed fi there their distance h? Fixed their distance h? I think so, yeah. So we didn't do that case, but you can sort of, you know, kind of anticipate what should happen from this formula I have on the previous slide. Then, you know, so we didn't do all of the error estimates, but it seems likely that you could and basically carry through this reasoning here. You know, this idea of dropping the first term is still applicable, and then, or should be. And then, if you just make all these steps work and plug in alpha equals one, that should be an answer. And Carlos actually work on a sort of more general version of what I just presented, and we'll hopefully be able to cover that. That's okay. I see. So, okay. So, you expect a strip. So, if alpha equals to one, one of your formulas doesn't. Of your formulas doesn't make sense literally, and the other one gives a fixed age distance. Yeah, no, I mean, if you're bold, if you're bold, you can plug in alpha equals one here, and actually that also, but yeah, but I think that constant is wrong, right? So this is the correct, I think this is the correct constant. But actually, this one, as it happens, as I guess as it should, it also converges to the same thing. Okay, thank you. Any other questions for Carol? Chris? Yeah, so you compared it to Gaukowski's result in dimension two. I wondered, I mean, does it scale up in dimension? And does the five-sixths, you know, become something that depends on dimension or is it no? No, it doesn't. No, no, he gets the same thing. So he did this very detailed study for the disk, you know, using Airy functions and, or, you know, starts with Bessel functions, then Airy functions, you know, the drill. You know the drill, and um, but but he also proved some more general theorems for resonance-free regions, uh, basically in bands. You know, in that case, you get a band structure for resonances, and that holds in higher dimensions as well, and for more general shapes. And right, and five-sixths is the magic dumper, yeah. So that's apparently the threshold at which glancing produces resonances close to the real axis. And in dimension griddle, though, I mean, like, there's still reflection. Though I mean, like, there's still reflection, so presumably, there is still some alpha equals one, it's just you don't see it because yeah, I think he just didn't go there. I think, um, so I think he basically didn't go past alpha equals one in that case. But, but yeah, you one would expect, and you know, certainly in the in the symmetric case, you know, like if it's a disk, you separate variables, and really the zero mode is basically the same as what I showed you, you know, and um. And anyway, and so the same thing should be happening with reflection and transmission at alpha equals one. I think he just didn't push the analysis that far because he was more interested in glancing. Okay, yeah, thanks. I'd like to just make a brief piece of shameless self-promotion to say that in a paper I wrote with Luke Hilleray, where we were dealing with a situation where you've got a, say, the exterior of a Say the exterior of a polygon in R2 were in general manifold with cone points. You get a very similar transcendental equation in dealing with the resonances caused by trapping, where you've got diffraction back and forth between the cone points, where the wave keeps getting reflected back and forth between these singular things, and most of it radiates off, but some small fraction of the energy keeps getting reflected by diffractive effects, and it gets trapped by that. And you again get these logarithmic curves of resonances. These logarithmic curves of resonances. And we were able to show that there's at least some logarithmic curve. We had a very similar transcendental equation, but with much more complicated error terms. So we weren't able to get nearly as exact an estimate as you've got. And there is a pretty exact computation in a similar setting by Nikola Burek, I should add, where he deals with two analytic obstacles, both of them convex and one with a corner facing the other. So it's essentially a one-dimensional problem involving traveling back and forth along the line. Involving traveling back and forth along the line, connecting the corner of one obstacle to the boundary of the other, and reflecting. And he's able to show that very precise distribution on logarithmic curves, again, dealing with a very similar transcendental equation. It seems to show up a lot. Cool. Any other questions? Comments? Self-as uh self-promotion? Self-promotion
