How are you going everyone? Now Gabriela is going to talk us about microtype irregular cages, but designs and general polygons and please. Thank you, Mayenne. Well, that was a really difficult to me find some topic. So it's not easy to talk. But I decided to talk about block design more, but block design because we have people expert in that and maybe they are interested in some these problems. And this is a joint work with Robert Alejandra Ramos from Mexico, Tomasnopsi, and Thomas Snowski and me. And that was, I will give the motivation and the first paper of that, but this is a paper that is just accepted. And that was a very nice topic, I think. And I will introduce the BB cages. And the BB cages are bipartite with regular graphs with fixed gear G and we have two sets of degrees, but in Sets of degrees, but in each partit you have one degree. We were working also with Robert and many people in biregular graphs, but that is a different topic. And here the graphs are bipartite and has this condition. Okay? And that was introduced by Robert, Filipovsky, and Alejandro Ramos Rivera in 2019. And when I saw there, I love. So there I love I love of these graphs. And the GERT of the graphs, let me show what is the situation here. Imagine that the girth is equal to 4 and I will call the thin vertices as Earth, the vertices the thin and they are fat vertices, okay? And we have what is the lower bound here and here this is the lower bound because the vertices 1 to 4 and we can solve the And we can solve the problem immediately with the bipartite graphs, with the KRM graphs. Okay, what happened with GERT equal to 6? With GERT equal to 6, we have a family of thin vertices and fat vertices. They are all fat because it's a bipartite. They are all thin and they are all thin and they are all fat. And let me show you what is the problem here. For example, forget eight. For example, for get 8, we maybe can solve the problem because here we have a thing, we have a fat, we have fat things and whatever, and the tree is odd as an odd distance, the distance here is odd, and probably we don't know, but arithmetically we can have this number of edges that goes in this direction and the same number of edges that goes to the other direction, and maybe the problem. And maybe the problem could be solved. But what happened with GERT 6? And with any GERT that was converted with 2, module 2, 4, we have an even tree here, and we can have the same number of edges that go to one side and to the other. And this implies that this graph is not possible to go. Graph is not possible to construct. We need more vertices to construct this kind of graph. And I will show you what is the lower bound now. I take a fat vertex and I have all the neighbors here and I have these neighbors. And obviously, if they get six, we have more vertices here. Yeah? And this is the lower bound, but obviously we need more vertices. And how many vertices? And how many vertices? If you can count these edges, and you have to pack it here in packets of error because we have a bipartite graph, okay? And in this case, we have packets by error at least. And if this number is an integer, this is a good bound. And probably, or maybe that it's not an integer number. Maybe that it's not an integer number, and we can add a little more vertices, and that was the lower bound. We have these lower bounds in general. Here, R is odd, and that was this, the last case, the R is equal to 3. We have Gert 6. And when R is even, we have a bound that was similar, or at least the same, for Gert E1 to A. Girth equal to 8. Okay? For example, 4 girls equal to 8. Maybe we can construct the graph. Okay? They are the lower bounds. 4 are even. Okay? This is the lower bound. This is a new lower bound. This is the lower bound in the new paper. That was a new lower bound. Okay? And let me to show you what are the bounds for getting... Show you what are the bounds for get6 and for get6. If I calculate the bound, we have this number of vertices if this is an integer. And if that is not an integer, we have this lower bound. Okay? And what happened? I used some log designs to solve this problem. As you know, on caches, you use the projective plane to solve the problem. But here, we have That. But here we have a bipartite biregular graph, and we have to use other structure, combinatory structure. And we can solve exactly as the projective plane solves the probe of the cages, the stainer systems solve the problem in bipartite irregular cages. And I will show you what is the point. A stellar system, I know. Probably all people here know what is a stainless system, but I will recall you. It's a collection of blocks, and any pair of points live in a block, okay? And they satisfy these obvious these conditions to be subsets to be a subset of say of say sk. Of says k and any pair of points live in a pair of elements. And this is easy to calculate and this is a little more difficult, but it's not difficult. And the conditions, the existence condition of a stainless system are given by these values. And what happened in particular we work with stainless triple systems. The blocks has size equal to triple. has size equal to 3. And here we have this condition. If k is equal to 3, the statement triple system exists if and only if v is congruent with one or three modules 6. We know that and well a standard triple system is a set of subsets of size 3 and you have this condition. And you have this condition: any two points are in one and only one block with any pair of points live in one block and each point live in exactly this number of blocks. And the first example is fact. This is the is the energy system. And here we have any coin lives in the same number of blocks. Okay? And we have other examples. We have other examples. Well, with funnel plane, as you know, we can construct the incidence graph, the incidence graph of the funnel plane. And as you know, this is a cage, this is a 3,6 cage. And we have here the incidence of the top. And also, I can construct that is not a biregular because. That is not a biregular because it's a regular graph, but it's a bipartite graph. The regular bipartite graphs of R6 are associated with this, and the incidence point block of our stainless system is a BBK with these parameters, okay? In general, not only for K equal to 3. And if gamma is a K in six disorder, we obtain an stainless triple system. Obtain an extinct triple system. We have exactly the same as a projected plane with the caches. And for example, if n is equal to 0 and 1 module 3, we have an stainless triple system. And immediately, we have a VBK that is the incidence graph of this stainless triple system. And this is the order. This is the theorem that we proved in this paper. And if we have the stainless triple system in media. The steamer tip resistant immediately we have the graph. And if we don't have the stainless tip persistent, but in this case we don't have the stainless persistent, we make something in some graph and we obtain a cage because we assign the Law bound. Okay? And what is the situation here? For here, if M is congruent, we have the stainless triple system and we have the graph. And I will show you. This is the stainless triple system. This is System, this is the graph, and this is the cage. And it has the X's, and you can see in the lower bound, they catch vertices. Each vertice catch three edges. And we have that the graph, this number is an integer. The X is an integer. And if n is congruent with 2 module 3, then the order of this case is this. And what is the technique here? What is the technique here? What is it? I have here the lower bound. The lower bound is given by the lower bound that we calculate. And the upper bound is given with this technique. We start with a stainless triple system that there exists, a 3n plus 1. We take this sketch that is associated with a stainless triple system that exists. And we remove a portion of the graph. Portion of the graph. And this is the size of the graph. And we remove this number of vertices and we obtain a graph that attains the lower bar. For example, here, to construct a 356 BB cage, we start with a 366 366 BB cage. This is a 366 BB cage and we delete this. We delete this and we obtain a graph that attains the labor. And we obtain the graph, and that was very funny, and we are so happy. And this is, we solve the problem for by regular bipartite graphs, one size of one set of size three and the other, well, it depends. And as you know, the state. As you know, this stainless triple system is also projected plane and this is a projective plane of order Q but and the regular graphs are more cages when we take the projective plane and with the graphics A we have also a more cage that is a Also, a more cage, that is, the incidence graph is the graph of the general quadrangle, and also here. And the regular cages are the incidence graph of these graphs. And if I take a project display, obviously you know it's fano. Well, you know that we have the cage, they are the other projected play of order four and give us a cage. A cache and we use this also to construct bipartite irregular graphs. And we delete also some things here. We delete this. And we obtain graphs that they are biregular also. Yeah? And but in some cases, and I can delete packet by packet, and I continue constructed by regular graphs using the project plate. But for example, here, it is very interesting. It is very interesting, it is very nice because this is a PB cage. And what is the situation here? That, as you know, the cage of the cage, the 7,6 cage doesn't exist because 6 is not a power of prime and we know that there is not existed 7, 6 cage that are tiny more about. Okay? And for example, if Q is equal to 7, we can obtain a graph deleting of. Can obtain a graph the letting of the projective plane a parallel class. Okay, I believe this, and after I have a graph with this number of purposes, and I believe this, and I also believe this, and I have a biregular graph here. And you have to calculate something that arithmetic calculated, and we find that we prove that also the lower bound is ninety one. The lower bound is 91, and we have a h in this case, and we have some general, and it depends if q is an integer and there exists an affin plane of order q. There is not exists an affin plane of this order, we can construct a cache also. And they are something techniques, and the first upper problem that is we are working on it, but what we have. That was we have what happened with the blocking set with one size is equal to four because we don't know what is we know something for m congruent with zero and one obviously because they are a steady system if m is congruent with three we have some ideas but we don't know what happened with m is congruent with two well maybe could be here for is Be here for is plus one plus two, no, because n should be congruent with two, and we don't have an idea about that. And I think that the question for the people that works in block design is, can you find a substructure of points and blocks in a stainless people system with blocks of size four that as they're deleting this structure, you obtain Structure: You obtain blocks with the same size, but the other part of the graph lost two blocks, reduce the degree of the graph. It is possible to find something with these properties in the blockings in a stainless triple system. It's a structure that you delete, the blocks have the same size, but the points live in two blocks less than before. Than before. That is the question. I don't know if that is a case or not. We have to prove the lower bound also, but it will be a nice construction and we don't know. And in general, final substructor with key points in a block standard triple system that after deleted, the blocks are exactly of the same size, but you reduce the number of Of blocks that leave any point or any L. And we can construct some things. And well, I don't know how is you have eight minutes. Okay. Okay. We are working also with the projective, with the other projective geometry. Projective geometries, and we made some results, but partially. This is, we find we know that we have the incidence graph of some generalized quadrangles or hexagons, but not they are not regular. And we have these hexagons and these generalized hexagons are. Generalized hexagons or quadrangles or whatever, and we make something there, but not much. We are working in that also with Georgie now and Thomas and other people. And this is the results that was of this paper is McTrover and Thomas and Ali. And that was a well, really enjoyed the paper. This is the problem that I am asking, and this is the other problem, and we have some progress there. And let me give you a different problem, but it's related with the question of rubber and it's also related with one nice graph that Imichi will talk about that, and maybe some other people are working on that. Working on that, that it's a girl regular graph. And the idea of this graph is for any edge, you have the same number of girls. Yeah, it's a graph, it's a regular graph, and if you take one edge, you have exactly the same number of girls that inside in this graph. And we were working in that with Dimitri, and this problem is related, but not is the same problem. Let me give you the problem. If you have a KGK that attaches the Moore bound, this graph has this diameter. You know that. I don't know. Maybe the answer is yes, but maybe Robert know the answer. I don't know if the answer, or maybe some of you. If I have a graph with some X's, the graph and the graph at times. And the graph attains the order of this graph, some x's and attain the number of the record graph, or it's a cache, but with some x's. I don't know if the diameter is the current over 2 plus 1. We don't know. That is an interesting question. Well, for record graphs, you have this wonderful. I can say that it's a wonderful survey. Wonderful survey. Well, they will be updated and whatever. And if you want to know what is a record graph, you have this survey. And my question now is, given three fixed parameters, GERT, regularity, diameter, and GERT. That was a problem that I was working a little with Dimitri. We start, we have some progress, but we don't know. Progress, but we don't know too much. And when I was exploring this, it depends on the lambda in the edge-scared regular graph. And imagine that you fix these three parameters. And how is the minimum graph that has this diameter and this girth? What is this kind of cages? Because, for example, the true regular graph that has gird five is Peterson and the diameter is two. What is the minimum graph? What is the minimum graph with this diameter and this girth? Or maybe what is the minimum graph with diameter equal to 5 and girth equal to 5? We don't know. And this is a mixed problem between diameter and girth. And how about the lower bounds? Maybe the lower bounds could be interesting. And it is related with lambda. Lambda is the number of fixed girths that one vertex leaves. Because if you have a Because if you have a big diameter, lambda should be small. And I think that it's a nice problem. I think that it's a really open problem. And thank you so much. And I hope that you enjoyed this and I do.
